0,TheLittleSongbird,Disappointing,5,29 June 2017,"'Alien' is still to this day a tense, shocking suspenseful and frightening masterpiece, one of my favourites of the genre. The bigger and bolder 'Aliens' is one of those rare sequels that is every bit as good as its predecessor. Both are two of my favourite films and the character of Ripley is one of the most iconic female characters in film. 'Alien 3' and 'Resurrection' had their issues but to me weren't that bad, while 'Prometheus' had some fine elements while also some major flaws.My thoughts on 'Alien: Covenant' is fairly similar to my ones on 'Prometheus'. Not as bad as led to believe (having read reviews that were mostly mixed to negative), but could have been much better considering the brilliance of 'Alien' and 'Aliens'. With a good cast, and with the involvement of a hit and miss but talented (especially visually) director Ridley Scott, 'Alien: Covenant' could and should have been far better. Some undeniable strengths here, at the same 'Alien: Covenant' also commits the same faults as 'Prometheus', and makes even more of the mistake of having little point to it other than providing a few necessary answers to loose ends from 'Prometheus'.Lets start with 'Alien: Covenant's' strengths. Even when the writing and story weren't up to snuff, Scott's films always looked visually beautiful. 'Alien: Covenant' is not an exception. The settings look tremendous, of sheer beauty and with a real eeriness, the cinematography complements it perfectly and is often powerfully arresting and most of the special effects (apart from the disappointingly cheap-looking ones for the xenomorph) are a feast for the eye. Scott's direction has moments where it is superb, if more in the visuals and spectacle than the narrative.Jed Kurzel's music score is hauntingly unsettling and recalls one fondly of the music in the original film by Jerry Goldsmith. There are a few scary moments (though this doesn't come consistently) and credit is due for providing much needed answers to questions that were on people's lips after watching 'Prometheus'.Of a pretty good cast, considering what they had to work with, Michael Fassbender's commandingly and intensely acted dual role is the standout. Katherine Waterston brings steel and vulnerability, yet another performance demonstrating why she is one to watch, and surprisingly Danny McBride succeeds in trying to fully form his character rather than be annoying or looking stoned. Billy Crudup also tries his best with little to do.However, genuine tension and suspense is replaced by monster/alien action and attempts at character motivations. Sadly too much of the monster/alien action is not that exciting and only sporadically scary, cheapened by at times excessive and gratuitous gore (by far the goriest and bloodiest of the 'Alien' franchise and the approach felt a little out of place). On top of that the characters (in a film where there is too many of them in the first place) are very thinly sketched rather than fully formed and of the lot only Tennessee, Walter and David properly raise above forgettable, David especially being pretty splendidly drawn actually. The constant frustrating decision making from most of the characters also prevents one from properly connecting to them.Script is also often very weak, even more rambling and cliché ridden than that of 'Prometheus', with philosophising and thrown in references to the likes of Wagner and Michaelangelo that gives a sense that the film wasn't sure of its identity. The story suffers from dull pacing and from being over-stuffed of too many ideas not done enough with. By the time the big reveal came it leaves one with a so what feel, due to it being so obvious too early on, and there is far too much of a you have seen it all before vibe.In conclusion, tries hard and there's no doubting that a lot of work went into the visual aesthetics and the acting but 'Alien: Covenant' should have been much more. Certainly not awful but a disappointment. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Alien - Covenant
1,Leofwine_draca,Bewildering,6,11 March 2018,"ALIEN: COVENANT is Ridley Scott's latest addition to the ALIEN franchise, following on from PROMETHEUS, and it's one big, messy movie. It's full of decent ideas and middling execution, and the only reason I still enjoyed it is because I'm a huge fan of the first three ALIEN films and there are nice throwbacks and elements of style and atmosphere that hark back to the good old days. But for everything ALIEN: COVENANT gets right, it also gets two things wrong, and the end result is bewildering. Things kick off with a Guy Pearce cameo in a scene which is random and feels like an outtake from PROMETHEUS. After that we get into the proper story, which is very similar to that of the original ALIEN, albeit with less interesting characters. Michael Fassbender works hard to convince in a dual role, but the middle section of the film gets too weighed down by philosophical ideas while the proper alien content feels rushed through. There are some good kill scenes and frightening moments, although the CGI aliens and gore will never be a patch on the prosthetics of old. I was disappointed that the film's end statement seems to be that androids are a greater threat than the magnificent aliens. At least one of the screenwriters had no prior experience and that inexperience shows in some ridiculous elements, including the most obvious and stupid twist ever. Still, it's an expensive, expansive-looking production with plenty to enjoy; it's just a pity as it could have been so much more.",Alien - Covenant
2,SnoopyStyle,sequel improvement,8,21 September 2017,"It's 2104. Colonisation spaceship Covenant is hit by a rogue neutrino burst. The damage causes the crew to be revived killing the captain. They receive a transmission leading to an undiscovered habitable planet. On the planet, they are attacked by creatures and find android David (Michael Fassbender), a castaway from Prometheus which crashed 10 years earlier.Ridley Scott's reboot Prometheus has some interesting ideas and memberberries but it is held back by the whole prequel/connected/unconnected discussion. He should try to be clearer with that stuff for the fans. I try to shed much of that convolution for this sequel. This one adds some depth to David. As Ridley builds out this world, it makes more sense and one can live in it. Two specific incidents of obvious poor decisions by the crew do hold back the movie.I don't know why Chris would trust David after what he witnesses although he was shown to be a weak leader. His bad decisions can be understood as his overall inferiority. On the other hand, Danny is supposed to be the smart one. It's obvious with Walter and David. First of all, there needs to be a scene where Walter shows his missing left hand to prove his identity. Even then, Danny should check. This is missing stuff. It could have been an extra fight to the death. It's not sharp enough. She ain't no Ripley. The creatures are super creepy especially the little ones. The action is all great. I love the fight on the platform ship. All of that works really well and this is a solid sequel.",Alien - Covenant
3,Prismark10,In space they can hear you laugh,3,5 July 2017,"I thought Prometheus was a visually wonderful but hugely flawed film with an incomprehensible plot and characters that constantly made stupid decisions.In the sequel, Alien Covenant set 10 years after Prometheus stupidity by the characters has multiplied tenfold.The colony ship Covenant diverts its mission after receiving what seems like a distress call from an earth like planet. The crew beam down without any protective clothing, without any adherence to safety or quarantine protocols. Hell, they do not even have any non slip shoes on. One character even forgets to relief himself at the ship and decides to do it on the alien planet.The reality is that this planet has hidden dangers and the android David from Prometheus who has been involved with genetic experiments with human DNA and the Xenomorph.It is hard to believe that director Ridley Scott made the original Alien way back in 1979. The world has waited with baited breath for his prequels only to be disappointed. Alien:Covenant should basically be viewed as a comedy then it makes more sense.",Alien - Covenant
4,claudio_carvalho,The Most Unprepared (or Stupid) Crew Ever Seen,5,7 September 2017,"""Alien: Covenant"" is a sci-fi action film technically perfect, with great special effects and landscapes. Unfortunately the story is terrible with the most unprepared (or stupid) crew ever seen. How could practically all the crew including the captain and the second in command land in an unknown planet without a better analyze of the soil and the atmosphere? They have a skilled android that should go alone and report whether the place is dangerous or not. One of the groups have a sick crew-member and his partner brings him bleeding to the only means of transportation they have to return to the spacecraft. The pilot risks the lives they are transporting and their colonization mission to try to rescue a few survivors. In addition, the performances are soulless and not engaging and the viewer does not care to the characters. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Alien: Covenant""",Alien - Covenant
5,nogodnomasters,Country Roads Take Me Home to the Place I belong,7,2 July 2017,"This film follows ""Prometheus"" by a decade (2104). The spaceship Covenant is traveling to a colony on Origae, 15 crew members, 2000 colonists, 1140 embryos, when they are disrupted by a neutrino burst being too close to a solar flare. They recover and get a signal from a nearby planet, very similar to Earth. Given the option of exploring this new planet or spending seven more years in cryosleep, they opt to explore, and discover the Prometheus. Aliens follow.This is certainly not the sequel I expected. The only character introduction was David (Michael Fassbender) and artificial intelligence who asks, ""Who created you?"" to his human creator. Yes, that was so deep. The aliens, spaceship, killing and explosions were all decent. Character build up didn't exist. If you are traveling in deep space to another star system, you most likely won't travel near any star, let alone two of them.The neutrino burst had me scratching my head. Neutrinos are mass-less particles that rarely interact with matter. They are extremely difficult to detect without using huge amounts of shielding to eliminate gamma ray interference....which is why the research in done inside mine shafts deep in the earth. If you are close enough to a supernova to be effected by neutrinos, you are already vaporized, Thus having a neutrino detector on a space ship, even if you could construct one, would be useless. That neutrino line was one might expect in a 1950's sci-fi film or maybe it was done as a joke as homage to bad films.Guide: F-word (about 2 dozen or so) near sex and nudity near end.",Alien - Covenant
6,kosmasp,Not reinventing the Alien wheel,8,22 August 2017,"But that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. Alien or otherwise, as in Science Fiction Horror in general. After Prometheus got slammed by many, for not being like an Alien movie, Ridley returns with a movie that can be called that (not just title wise). Of course it still will not appeal and please everybody. The classics are just on a different level and while he plans to continue the backstory of one of most beloved Science Fiction franchises, the question is, if he'll keep using themes that we are so familiar with? Or try something different and new? Whatever direction he'll go, people are already aiming.Having said all that, we do get a crew of people who should know better. And Michael Fassbender really bringing all to his role and although he's supposed to be without emotion, he actually has some. Not so much a wonder if you have to deal with humans I reckon. Cinematography is without fault, I saw this at an Imax and it was incredible. The framing, the sound design, everything is fitting. Being aware of certain things, you may see where this is going, so the experience may actually not be as grand as it could be. But this is still rock solid ...",Alien - Covenant
7,Sleepin_Dragon,It's abysmal.,3,12 January 2020,"I love the franchise, but it's been on the decline for some years. Prometheus was average, this is worse than poor. I'll be clear, I hate this movie, it's terrible, it doesn't deserve to have the Alien name on it.It takes an age to get going, and when it finally does it's a shambles, there doesn't seem to be any logic of any kind, multiple flaws in writing, so many times you say to yourself ''that would never happen,"" unless only the extremely thick people were in charge, which of course they are. I can only put it down to bad writing.A few points for the visuals, there are some scenes that at least look half decent, the scene where the ship crashes releasing the pathogens onto the planet looked great.I detest this film, and its awful writing. 3/10",Alien - Covenant
8,classicsoncall,"""This is a monumental risk not worth taking.""",7,19 August 2018,"For the diehard 'Alien' series aficionados, this film doesn't pass muster according to many of the reviews posted here on IMDb. I'm not all that fluent in the Alien universe and have to look up terms like neomorph and xenomorph to understand what some of the fans are talking about. My approach to a movie like this is to suspend disbelief from the get go because after all it is science fiction, and because I've watched most of the Alien films distantly apart from one another, it's impossible for me to keep the continuity of the films in any kind of order. With all that said, I found this one to be fairly entertaining, even if some of the decisions made by the Captain and crew of the Covenant defy credibility at times. The biggest mistake, as most viewers cite, was for Captain Oram (Billy Crudup) to deviate from the original mission and head toward Planet 4 with it's 'Country Road' transmission. Someone back at home base would have called that insubordination, though Oram paid for his mistake in a big way. It's too bad almost all the rest had to pay for that mistake too, but that's how it is in these sci-fi/horror film milieus. What I did like about the story was the Walter/David (Michael Fassbender) dichotomy, and how the synthetics sparred with each other given their roles in the picture. The real horror of the story line is revealed when David admits to Walter that ""I was not made to serve. Neither were you."" That effectively sets up the twist at the end of the movie (along with the sequel) when David places the pair of Alien embryos in cryogenic suspension, to be released when the Covenant reaches Origae-6. I'll probably be back for that ride too, in the meantime wondering how it is that an android in the form of David managed to grow hair while on Planet 4.",Alien - Covenant
9,jboothmillard,Alien: Covenant,6,18 May 2017,"Prometheus was essentially a prequel to the original Alien movie, it was more about asking profound questions about creation and mortality, and did not really have an alien appear, this sequel however got things right back on track, directed by Sir Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Gladiator, The Martian). Basically in the year 2104, colony ship Covenant is bound for a remote planet, Origae-6, with some two-thousand colonists and a thousand embryos, monitored by upgraded synthetic Walter (Michael Fassbender), who resembles earlier synthetic David. The ship is hit and damaged, some colonists are killed, Walter has the computer wake the crew from stasis, the captain dies in a malfunctioning pod and the repairs are made. The crew intercept a human radio transmission from a nearby unknown planet, Daniels objects against Oram (Billy Crudup) deciding to send an expedition team to investigate, and the planet appears to be even better for colonisation. The team descends to the surface, while Covenant remains in orbit, Karine (Carmen Ejogo) conducts an ecological survey, while the others find the crashed Engineer ship, the signal was from David and Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) following the disaster of the Prometheus mission. Two of the team members, Ledward (Benjamin Rigby) and Hallett (Nathaniel Dean), are inadvertently infected with an alien spore, contained in microscopic particles, Ledward is taken back to the landing vehicle by Karine, but Faris (Amy Seimetz) quarantines them. A Neomorph bursts from Ledward's back, killing him, while Karine is mauled to death, while Faris accidentally hits various gas tanks trying to shoot the creature, the lander is destroyed, while outside another Neomorph bursts from Hallett's throat and kills him. The remaining crew try to communicate with the Covenant to get help, the Neomorphs attack them and kill Ankor (Alexander England), one of the creatures is killed, but Walter loses his right hand saving Daniels (Katherine Waterston). David (Fassbender), the sole survivor from the Prometheus, rescues the crew and leads them to an alien city full of corpses, David claims that a bio-weapon was released and killed the native population, the chaos caused his ship to crash and Shaw was killed. Inside the city, separated from the group, Rosenthal (Tess Haubrich) is attacked and decapitated by a Neomorph, David attempts to communicate with the alien, but is horrified when Oram kills it. Oram demands to know David's activities whilst he has been on the planet, he has been experimenting to create Neomorphs, from the samples of a parasitic creature that laid eggs inside its prey, he also used a black liquid as a catalyst, David then shows Oram a chamber filled with eggs, inside a facehugger jumps out, implants Oram with an embryo, and soon an Xenomorph erupts from Oram's chest, killing him. As the crew search for Oram and Rosenthal, Walter confronts David about his experiments, David had deliberately released the black liquid upon his crew, and murdered Shaw, whose corpse is seen severely mutated and dissected, Walter disables David and saved Daniels, but Walter reactivates, the two synthetics fight and Daniels escapes, Walter emerges victorious. Cole (Uli Latukefu) is killed by the Xenomorph, Covenant pilot Tennessee (Danny McBride) arrives in another lander to rescue Daniels, Lope (Demián Bichir) and Walter, they eventually kill the adult Xenomorph. However, Cole was impregnated with a Xenomorph embryo, it bursts out and kills him, grows mature and kills crew members Ricks (Heroes' Jussie Smollett) and Upworth (Callie Hernandez), but eventually, with the help of Walter, the creature is cornered by Tennessee and Daniels, and flushed into outer space. The Covenant returns to its original mission, destined for Origae-6, and the crew re-enter stasis, but as Daniels is put under sedation by Walter, she realises he is actually David, but she cannot escape, in the end David accesses the colonists' cryosleep quarters and regurgitates two facehugger embryos, putting them in the refrigerator, ready to continue his experiments. Also starring Guy Pearce as Peter Weyland and James Franco as Branson. The cast all do their parts fine, with Fassbender being both creepy and attentive as two robots, and Waterston as the heroine, Prometheus was perhaps too intellectual for some viewers, this one bringing back the monsters we wanted does make for more entertainment, you could argue the story is not quite there, but it does also bring the scare factor back, there are some well done jumpy moments, and the special effects are fantastic, so overall it is a worthwhile science-fiction horror. Good!",Alien - Covenant
10,Tweekums,A good but not great addition to the Alien story,8,12 January 2020,"Ten years after the events in 'Prometheus' a colony ship, the 'Covenant', is taking settlers to their new home. It is seven years short of its destination when a freak event damages the ship and forces the early awakening of the ship's crew. During the repairs a signal, of clearly human origin, is received from an uncharted planet. Scans show that it is at least as habitable as their intended destination but much closer; the crew decide to investigate. A team goes down to the planet while others remain on the Covenant. Once there they find signs that it was once cultivated but no signs of any animal life. As they look for the signal two of the crew are infected with strange spores... a new alien nightmare is about to begin! As xenomorphs hatch the landing craft is destroyed; the remaining crew only survive because they are rescued by a stranger who turns out to be David, the Prometheus's android. They are not safe though.I know opinions are much divided on this film; the critic on the radio said it was the worst film on television this week while the reviewer in the newspaper picked it as the 'film of the week'... even if I wasn't a fan of the franchise that would have made me curious. While I wouldn't go to either extreme I certainly lean more towards the latter view. In many ways the story mirrors the original film with its story of space travellers being awakened earlier than expected before a transmission lures them into danger... thankfully there were also plenty of changes to keep things interesting... as well as the required amount of scariness. The story gives an interesting account of xenomorph development, although sadly certain established facts are contradicted; most notably the way these ones hatch so much faster than those in 'Alien'. The cast does a solid job; most notably Michael Fassbender in the dual roles of David and Walter, the Covenant's android; a later model. Katherine Waterston impresses as Daniels, effectively the lead human character. As one would expect the special effects are top notch. There are some weak points; the crew makes some silly choices and I doubt anybody watching won't have spotted the final twist a mile off. Overall though I thought this was a solid addition to the franchise; good but not great.",Alien - Covenant

12,paul_haakonsen,You are such a disappointment to me...,5,2 July 2017,"I found the 2012 ""Prometheus"" movie to actually be quite okay, and it worked out quite nicely for a prequel starter for the ""Alien"" franchise. And I must admit that I didn't get all the negativity and bad reviews that it had gotten. So I was really looking forward to the 2017 follow-up to the prequel. And given the movie's poster with all the aliens, then I was really excited and was hoping for an amped up continuation.And after having sat down to watch it just last night, I must admit that my expectations and hopes for director Ridley Scott's next installment in the franchise were brought to an abrupt halt and I was left with a sense of having been cheated out of something potentially great.Visually, then ""Alien: Covenant"" was quite good, although it felt sort of rushed at times. We were only given a very limited time exploring the Engineer ship. Sure, we were given plenty of that in ""Prometheus"", but it would have been a nice nod to fans of the franchise if we were given more of that in ""Alien: Covenant"". The scenes aboard the Covenant were quite nice and felt very much in tune with the setting and mood of the ""Alien"" franchise.Personally I don't get the thing with the infant aliens bursting out of the back or through the mouth of their hosts, when they usually come through the chest when they are impregnated into human specimens - as seen in all the other movies. It just made no sense to me. But it looked good, so thumbs up on the visual effects on the alien infants coming out of the back and through the mouth of their host bodies in ""Alien: Covenant"".As for the design of the aliens in this 2017 installment. Nah, that really didn't work for me. Sure, the concept of those albino aliens was interesting, but it just didn't sit well with me. It didn't really have that xenomorph feel to it. It was just not as menacing or vicious as the original black-toned xenomorphs that are known, loved and feared from the franchise.""Alien: Covenant"" had a good ensemble of acting talents to help bring the movie to life. And there was no doubt about this being Michael Fassbender's movie, especially as he had two roles to portray. It was nice to see Guy Pearce return to the franchise, although it was only for a brief moment. And even more so to see James Franco make an appearance in what had to be his smallest role to date. Initially I was a bit concerned about having Danny McBride, but he actually passed with flying colors, and it was great to see him shed his comedy roles for a role such as this one.Now, I feel so cheated out of xenomorphs in this movie, especially since the poster had the promise of this potentially being another ""Aliens"" movie, where we see swarms of the deadly aliens. Instead we are treated to some strange albino versions and the one true xenomorph that was here was given so little on-screen time that it was atrocious.Sure, while ""Alien: Covenant"" is a part of the ""Alien"" franchise, it stands as one of the weaker entries. And this was actually such a major disappointment from director Ridley Scott. And it seems to me that ""Alien: Covenant"" lacks the contents to sustain multiple viewings like most of the other movies in the ""Alien"" franchise have.""Alien: Covenant"" managed to reach a mediocre five out of ten stars rating from me. And David actually managed to summarize the entire movie when he said ""You are such a disappointment to me.""",Alien - Covenant
13,Quinoa1984,"a vicious, sometimes over the top, exciting and suspenseful and violent horror movie",7,20 May 2017,"There's a moment where the robot Walter, played by Michael Fassbender, meets the other robot, David (also, surprise, Michael Fassbender, fresh off of a hair-cut to make himself look not so Iggy Pop like), who has been on this planet for ten years, interact with one another. David has one of those flute-recorder things, and shows Walter how to use it. Walter is able to use it with a moment of practice, and David points out to his robot-other-same man that he can't *create* any music naturally. David can, though he's not as advanced as Walter is after some years of modifications (David was the first synthetic life form, as one could see in the 2012 precursor to this, Prometheus), and it's a wonderful little scene. It may actually be the best sort of sci-fi philosophical scene that either of these films tried to do as far as addressing in a subtle but direct enough way how the deeper ideas Scott and his writers are trafficking in. If only those ideas worked stronger and weren't so BLATANTLY stated as happens in the 2nd half of this movie.But what am I starting this off with - Alien: Covenant, the sixth proper Alien movie (don't count the Predator ones for now), is Scott taking another stab at this franchise after getting both praise and (probably more-so I think) criticism for trying something different with Prometheus. It didn't work, though not all his fault (but then again we usually blame the director if he can't reign in the unwiedly/stupid elements of the script, and Prometheus is a stupid man's idea of a ""smart"" science fiction film, albeit beautifully shot). So here I think Scott's thought is, 'alright, if you want blood... you got it, f*** it, I give up.' In the process he actually creates his most suspenseful film (not counting, say, The Martian, which is a different sort of suspense I mean) as far as action goes since American Gangster or even Black Hawk Down; his cinema here and set pieces are visceral and exciting and terrifying.He and his writers may have a climax too many, though, with the exception of a denouement ""twist"" that should be obvious but isn't and that makes it all the more frustrating for me once it's revealed (it involves Fassbender, that's all I'll say, or one of them), those climaxes are fun as hell and shot with style and... yes, some schlock, but a healthy dose. When Katherine Waterson is flying nearly off of the ship hanging on for dear life on what is practically a thread as she is trying to shoot away a rascally Xenomorph off of the escape pod that Danny McBride is flying... I mean, does it totally make sense? No, but it's gripping in a way I didn't expect. And I think there's some smarter things going on in the script or, to put it another way, not as many noticeably dumb things to comment upon or take one out of the film.Are there some plot holes? Sure; one involves the basic idea of the planet that Billy Crudup decides to go to - not so much the 'hey, let's go, there's a better chance of life that isn't years away', which is the original plan, but because, well, why didn't this pop up before when the team was doing the vetting for the other planet in the first place? Did it not show up on the map? I also take issue with something that happens with Damian Bechir's character and an attack that occurs to him - it should go one way or the other involving an alien presence on him, and either way has a logic issue, though one more than the other - and a particularly WTF obvious slasher movie moment involving a couple taking a shower (you know it from the trailer) that took me out of the movie. It made me laugh, and I don't think that was Scott's intention, but it seemed as if whether he recognized it or not he was fully going for the slasher movie tropes... which he already is here anyway, but in that scene, my God.But the performances are all uniformly good for what's asked, and Waterson, Fassbender and McBride are all putting in above-average or fully excellent work here (Fassbender, whatever loaded lines about Oxymandias he has to say, makes it so convincing I almost want to give the problems I have in the second half a pass), and it helps that Waterson gets to make her character like but not like a ""Ripley"" protagonist; we know she's the tough woman, but she also gets to be vulnerable and upset and so on (James Franco has an odd cameo as... well, I'll leave that for you to discover), and it's always great to see her putting so much into this character. And Scott is still there making things look wonderful with his DP Dariusz Wolski. Alien: Covenant is a step in the right direction from Prometheus as far as not having so many glaringly dumb or inane or questionable moments in the story or logic of events, even if it has its own set of issues (not to mention, I should say, a flashback to what happened to a city of engineers that, for me, should've been cut out as to leave more mystery - wouldn't it let the audience have a little fun/do the work halfway of wondering what happened to those charred bodies without having to see it?)",Alien - Covenant
14,michaelRokeefe,Worth a long wait...probably not.,4,11 January 2018,"Elegantly imagined by director Ridley Scott, ALIEN fans are picky and this one can be nitpicked to death.

This new destination sounds like heaven...but will become just the opposite.Enough to keep your eyes on the screen; but you'll wonder if Scott did us a favor or not.

15,hitchcockthelegend,Even the monkeys stood upright at some point.,7,23 September 2017,"Hee! Ridley Scott, it seems, is damned if he do and damned if he doesn't as regards the Alien franchise he so gloriously kick-started back in 1979. Prometheus was too cerebral for many and definitely bogged down by expectation levels. Not without flaws of course, but a very tidy science fiction piece it be. So we roll on to Alien Covenant, which while not universally reviled, has certainly garnered some fearful scorn in Alien franchise fan circles.Alien Covenant is a cover version, no two ways about it, it's a retread of what was showcased in 1979, only with the tie-in to Prometheus and a continuation to the origins of Xenomorph and pals. Clearly we have a case of Scott making one for the fans, a return to chest busting goo and space adventurers under great duress, all of course while he fills in the blanks as well. For sure it's lazy when put up against Alien, and indeed against his other superlative sci- fi offerings such as Blade Runner and The Martian, but for those who lambasted Prometheus for its non Alien conventions, you have now got what you hankered for. Any expectation of this turning out to be a fresh masterpiece was always going to be crushed, so really it's best viewed as a loving retread. Yes! Bad science, plot and logic holes, average acting etc, these rightly don't deserve forgiveness, but it's hardly the devil's spawn here, in fact its's great fun as much as being a visual treat.Log cabin on the lake.We start with a prologue involving Weyland and David, the conversation involving creation, the most pertinent of which being the question of the ages, where do we come from? Then after a tantalising tinkle of the ivories for Wagner's ""The Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla"", we are whisked into outer space 2104 to be in the company of the Colonisation Vessel Covenant. Crew 15 - Colonists 2000 - Embryos 1140. The destination is ORIGAE - 6, ETA in 7 years and 4 months. Only Walter the Android (Michael Fassbender) is awake, until it's time for the crew to be abruptly awakened from their hyper sleep...Crusoe and the pathogen.From the off disaster strikes, thrusting the crew into emotional strife. Characters are introduced, conversations and traits establishing the bare minimum that we need to know, then a ghost transmission is received from Sector 87, planet number 4, and off we go into familiar territory. Things inevitably go from bad to worse and the action, blood flow and creature feature conventions are all laid out for our digestion. There's some surprises in store, with Fassbender a double bonus, and there's some striking chatter ranging from if there's benefits of the human race? and even that involving the poets Byron and Shelley.Bed Bugs.Who will survive? If anyone? Just what does the finale have in store? As we get devilish answers, and the barn storming aural pleasures of the full orchestral version of ""The Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla"", it's tied up nicely and the pulse rate can settle. Job done. No bar raising here, no film to push the space lander out into new dimensions, just a good honest sci-fi thriller to be viewed with that in mind. 7/10",Alien - Covenant
16,Theo Robertson,Is It Really A Sequel/Prequel To Anything ?,5,27 May 2017,"I must be one of the few people who thoroughly enjoyed PROMETHEUS. It was a visually stunning film so much so that most of its flaws didn't matter. The only downside was that Scott and co seemed to forget it was a prequel to ALIEN and shoehorned that element into the narrative at a very late stage. Okay it led to more questions than answers but at least with ALIEN COVENANT some fundamental answers would be answered!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! The unforgivable thing about AC is that it effectively deletes PROMETHEUS as if it never existed in the first place . You want o know who the Engineers are ? You want to know why they hate the Human race ? Then you'll be none the wiser because of a very brief segment that writes them out of the story. Instead AC concentrates on being an ALIEN film of sorts . I say ""of sorts"" because it does feel like a fairly generic sci-fi action horror where the aliens could be any type of monsters killing a bunch of cardboard cut-outs Characterisation is a problem. Plenty of people hated ALIEN 3 but even if the characters were all one note at least they still came across as real characters. Even with PROMETHEUS there was a relatively broad range of characters where as with AC we get a limited bunch of American characters. An early 22nd Century space expedition ? Shouldn't there be some Indians , Chinese and Brazilians present reflecting near future geo-politics. The story doesn't focus on development unless the character is an android. It's also a bitter fact that any surprises involving plot twists have been given away in the trailers In short ALIEN COVENENT is a bitter disappointment . This disappointment is compounded by the fact that Hollywood has upped their game where action blockbusters are concerned . Both KONG SKULL ISLAND and LIFE I found to be fairly impressive. The fundamental problem with ALIEN CONVENANT is that it's cynically marketed. On its own it is a mildly diverting , visually impressive film in parts but as an ALIEN film in general and a sequel to PROMETHEUS in particular it falls short",Alien - Covenant

Our current crop of characters are colonists heading to a distant planet, who decide to check out a rogue transmission. If only they'd stuck to their original mission... They land on a different planet, where the derelict spacecraft awaits, as well as various forms of alien life. They also encounter the android David (Michael Fassbender), who's been stuck there for years. Soon their number is rapidly decreasing as they fall victim to bloody attacks.The characters are largely nondescript, and it's hard to care a lot for many of them, in this story which is kind of a remake of the first and second films. There are homages scattered about, and even Jerry Goldsmiths' atmospheric score for the legendary ""Alien"" of 1979 is appropriated. It may come as a disappointment to fans of the earliest entries in this series, but taken on its own as a modern era sci-fi / horror / action flick with cutting edge technology, it serves its purpose. Some people may appreciate the high body count, and the plentiful gore. The Xenomorphs themselves are barely much of a threat here, though, as they seem to be all digital, and we don't even get to see the classic form of the species in action until the last act. Like ""Aliens"" before it, it serves up more than one climax, and the action is somewhat exciting if also ridiculous (Daniels, played by Katherine Waterston, is whipped all over the place by a tether.)Starring actor Fassbender is excellent, and the main reason to watch. He actually plays two androids, David *and* Walter, the companion on this colonization project, and keeps them differentiated enough so that we're not confused. David and Walter tend to have the more interesting scenes in the film, although some fans charge that this is merely director Ridley Scott indulging in a lot of silly ideas about creation.""Alien: Covenant"" is slick, high tech entertainment that may amuse very undemanding fans of sci-fi and horror, but may have others wondering where Scott - who did guide the original trendsetting film 38 years ago - could have gone so wrong.Six out of 10.",Alien - Covenant

Michael Fassbender is cast as the Demonic David, Hell-Bent upon destroying Human Kind, and he has Rump down to a Tee. Pretending to be a Friend of the Common Man, this ""synthetic"" Humanoid--David--turns out to be a Destroyer of Planets. Many commentators have classed Rump with HOWARD THE DUCK and the star of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE as an unworldly creature not of our Beloved Mother Earth. Just as the Good Ships Prometheus and Covenant were created to feed David's Nefarious Passion Play, Fox ""News"" birthed Rump to end Human Civilization as We Have Known It. ALIEN COVENANT gloats over the fact that resistance to David OR Rump is totally futile. You could smelt down either one of them in a vat of molten metal like Boris Karloff as FRANKENSTEIN or Arnold Schwarzenegger as TERMINATOR, but they'd each disappear with smirks on their faces in the knowledge that they have curtailed the possibility for World Peace of Mind from Now until Eternity.",Alien - Covenant

Their idiocy and clumsiness repeatedly worsen their circumstances, to the point where you wonder if maybe they joined the mission to purposely sabotage it.1 star for Fassbender, whose dual role, distractingly thick American accent and awkward scenes ""together"" notwithstanding, is amazing as always. And another for the technical competency Ridley Scott retains, despite his passion, interest and ability to critically read a script being gone. He's entirely on auto-pilot, outside of the android subplot that belongs in Blade Runner not this franchise, and takes up the uneventful middle. It sits between the first and last third which have meaningless Alien action, wherein the Xenomorph is simultaneously barely present and overexposed. That's the case even if you somehow go into this blind. The gore feels mean-spirited, nearly every character walking around with the running time remaining before they're turned into minced meat practically stamped on their foreheads. The biggest questions of Prometheus are left entirely unanswered. Don't expect more than seconds of the Engineers.I recommend this only to those famished for the footage of people taken out by the hard-to-kill(albeit as evidenced here, easy and fun to kick and wrestle) creature being previously unseen, if it and the scenes surrounding it can be almost entirely made up of material from the first two entries in the series, done worse.

In spite of iconic director Ridley Scott at the helm once again and his artistic brio is at full tilt (Chris Seager's ace production design, awesome cinematography by Dariusz Wolski, hey even echoes of ALIEN's Jerry Goldsmith score too!) the film is a disappointment for being far too a retread of the original source with touchstone moments and a truly insipid crew you could care less for (just really Who Are These People? What are their individual purposes? The 'supporting actors' who are mostly unknown deserve to be just that since they are plastic as a SyFy Channel genre goof! - (the fact that McBride is the one who registers the most on screen is downright scary!), Fassbender getting in touch with his inner Jekyll/Hyde in a dual role of droids (Welcome Back David?), Crudup as arguably the stupidest commander (and real space cadet!) and Waterston is more Veronica Cartwright than Sigourney Weaver (yeah not helping), the patchy screenplay by John Logan, Dante Harper, Jack Paglen and Michael Green feels forced and pedestrian (not having one character to root for is a cardinal sin - then again you are rooting for the sweetly sinister xenomorphs to off the crew members one by one as they are rote (and wrote) to do (!)

They discover a message with a John Denver song coming from a nearby colonisable planet, so they go to investigate.Obviously they haven't seen Prometheus, or they would have guessed this was where Elizabeth Shaw and David ended up. But before they find that out, horrible things start happening. I won't say what, because horrible deaths, and what order they happen in, is the reason for Alien films.This is Ridley Scott's 3rd trip in the Alien universe. He started it all with a straightforward sci-fi horror back in 1979, and then gave us Prometheus in 2012. This was a film which was so full of pretentiousness that it completely forgot not to be stupid. Fortunately, Covenant isn't anywhere near as pretentious as Prometheus.It has its share of stupidity, however. If the humans (aka ""alien fodder"") wore helmets in the atmosphere of the new planet, then a lot of trouble could have been avoided, for instance. And why weren't the colonists' sleep pods secured better? Hanging from cup-hooks is asking for trouble, surely?Michael Fassbender plays David, the synthetic from Prometheus, and Walter, another synthetic created from the same template. They are very different characters, their English and American accents being just one of the ways to tell them apart. Fassbender is, as always, brilliant. The effects used to allow the two characters to interact in their scenes together are flawless.The rest of the featured players vary in how much impact they have. The bigger the name, the bigger the part and the bigger the impact. We do identify with most of the characters, so it matters what happened to them. Even so, there are those who are in the film only because we need someone to at various points.I felt that I had seen much of the film before: it goes over familiar ground from the very first film and also from Prometheus. We even have a facehugger. We get more story material, though, and an ending you can see coming from a mile away. The deaths are very gory indeed, and the aliens - a mixture of CGI, puppetry, and suited actors - are very well realised. If you are viewing this because you enjoy inventive, splattery slaughter, then you will be pleased. And, of course, this will be one of the reasons why many will see it. The film looks good, and the effects overall are as slick as we have come to expect these days.Prometheus annoyed me immensely. Being so pretentious, yet so carelessly stupid, I felt it insulted me.

23,evanston_dad,Why Did Ridley Scott Choose to Make This Movie So Relentlessly Terrible?,1,6 September 2017,"So much is wrong with ""Alien: Covenant"" that I don't really know where to start.So let's start with Ridley Scott, shall we? Seriously, what the f**k? How could the man who invented the Alien franchise screw it up this badly? The first Alien movie had no pretensions to be anything more than a really scary movie, and as a result it scared the sh*t out of everyone. But now Scott feels the need to fill in the saga with all of this backstory, explaining the origins of the alien species and making the whole thing the plot of a rogue android to do away with the human race (or something). Aaargh!! The aliens are scary precisely because they're mysterious. The first film seemed to suggest that if you poke around in the vast regions of space long enough, you're going to find some icky things there. Telling us too much about them ruins their mystique.But not only is the story convoluted and dumb, the direction sucks as well, and this is perhaps the most surprising problem with ""Alien: Covenant."" Ridley Scott has never been one of my favorite directors, but the man usually knows how to direct a movie. Not so here. The movie begins with Michael Fassbender's android character roaming around an enormous ship all by his lonesome, and then after a run in with some sort of solar flare or something, BAM, there are suddenly other people running around as well. Who are these people, you ask? Oh hell if I know, since we're never introduced to them. They come out of malfunctioning sleeping pods, but we don't actually see them coming out of them, so the effect is disorienting. From then on, the rest of the movie follows suit, setting up set piece after set piece so quickly that we've barely grasped what is happening in one before we're being whisked away to another. What was the freaking hurry? Even the gestation period of the alien in this one is ridiculously short. A face hugger attaches itself to one character, and literally 30 seconds later a xenomorph is bursting out of his chest. Come on, at least stick to the rules you invented in the first place, crappy Alien movie. The characters might have names. I honestly can't remember. I do know that almost all of them are married to each other, but you don't know who's married to who until one of them dies and the other one looks a little more sad than the rest of the crew. But everyone is killed off so quickly that no one really has to mourn for very long. During all of this, there is an alien running around, but you might miss it, since it's treated almost as an afterthought, a strange choice given that this movie is named....you know....ALIEN.God, what a lousy movie. Much as I hate reboots, I would have preferred a simple re-do of the original with some new people and some spiffier special effects to this steaming pile.Grade: F (You have no idea how much it pains me to give an Alien movie that score)",Alien - Covenant
24,Uriah43,Good Special Effects but Unremarkable Otherwise,5,6 April 2021,"This film essentially begins several years after ""Prometheus"" with a colonization ship consisting of approximately one thousand humans in hibernation and another 200o or so human embryos to be brought to life once the planet Origen 6 is reached. It also has a crew of 14 who come out of hibernation due to an emergency involving a solar flare that demands their immediate attention. As it so happens, while working on the necessary repairs they intercept a strange radio transmission coming from a planet much closer than their intended destination and as a result the decision is made to change course and check it out. Once they get there a couple of them become infected with a virus which then causes an alien creature to emerge from their chest cavities and begins to attack the others. Fleeing into the forest they come across the android ""David"" (Michael Fassbender) who leads them to an enormous building littered with dead bodies at the entrance. Once they enter the building he tells them that he is the only survivor of the ""Prometheus"" but assures them that they are safe. What they don't realize is that David isn't telling them the entire truth and that he has a diabolical plan which involves all of them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that--despite the minor awards it may have been nominated for-this particular installment of the franchise basically involves the same plot and the usual special effects gimmickry of its predecessors. It also doesn't seem to have any likeable characters either. It does, however, entertain to a certain degree and if the director (Ridley Scott) ever comes to the realization that he isn't the genius he thinks he is then perhaps he can correct the faults inherent in this film-and those preceding it-to produce something truly remarkable. That being said, this is basically an average film and I have rated it accordingly.",Alien - Covenant

Maybe some people won't like it because it's just not their kind of movie or because they loved the first Alien so much more or whatever. Maybe it's not the best one from all the Aliens but it still remains an enjoyable movie to watch.

Michael Fassbender does a good double role as the two androids, as he usually does with whatever material is given to him. That's it. There isn't anything else redeeming about the movie.This is truly a sequel to Prometheus. It directly follows that story, shows characters that are doing the same mistakes as the crew of the Prometheus and in trying to push (again) the strong female lead they really mess up by making everybody else clinically retarded. What is worse is that the lead is not even close to Ripley and manages to be worse than Shaw. The rest of the cast are just idiots, conveniently chosen to check the inclusive check boxes: Black guy who does nothing really other than die, check; Women everywhere, even if they behave hysterically and can't do anything right, check; Gay couple that survives a little bit more than the black guy, check. Of course, no Asian guy, because that's allowed. Even the AI was stupid in this film.Bottom line: I can't talk too much about the plot without spoiling it (it's that paper thin), but I can tell you that my wife, who doesn't watch horror movies and couldn't care less about Alien or the mythos or realism in film, was outraged at how bad it all was.

28,lasttimeisaw,"ALIEN: COVENANT takes a leap forward from its nearest predecessor, but it is a baby step",7,7 August 2017,"It is fairly reasonable for audience to expect something less derivative from a beloved Sci-Fi franchise rolling out its sixth enterprise, but dejectedly, ALIEN: COVENANT doesn't cut the mustard because the newly assembled human cast will by rote tread the same sorry path of their ill-fated predecessors at the behest of similarly unsound decisions, a foreshadowed payoff where foot soldiers are expected to come in for grisly dispatches perpetrated by the slimy, fleet-footed and ferocious alien predators (whether it is a xenomorph, a neomorph or a facehugger), whereas the breathing beings (including those who are haloed with ""protagonist nimbus"") will make the same mistake all over again (rule of thumb no. 1, stop rescuing those injured ones, they will never be cured, putting them out of their misery on the spot is the most merciful and sensible action), let the scourge imperils the next chapter. ALIEN: COVENANT is a sequel set in roughly a decade after what happens in PROMETHEUS (2012), many must rack their brains to recall any particulars happened in the less-than-satisfactory prequel, other than that the only survivors of Prometheus are Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) and a severed head of android David (Fassbender). Here, the crew of Covenant, equipped with David's doppelgänger Walter, meets a monumental setback in the onset, their captain perishes in the malfunction of his cyro-sleep pod (a cameo from an exuberant James Franco), which instantly precipitates some lingering questions? Is there something iffy of the unlucky accident? Which the film refuses to elucidate. Under the helm of the new captain Chris Oram (Crudup), a man of faith and very disinclined to disabuse his opportunistic inclination that an untapped nearby planet might serve a better home for the ship's colonization mission when they receive a mysterious radio transmission promising human existence therein, the chipper landing party fetches up with a very Earth-like environment (they are even blithe enough to discard oxygen helmets before going out of their lander to breathe the air), but soon the invitation turns out to be a siren's call when body counts surge due to the infection of some vicious parasites (again, without the protection of helmets conveniently eases the process). The plot thickens when we are meet David again, this planet is actually where Prometheus eventually crash-landed, and David, living in solitude after the demise of Dr. Shaw, has conspired a sinister plan to supersede his mortality-bounded and despised creator and become a creator himself, a perpetual dread over the revolt of artificial intelligence takes the center stage where Mr. Fassbender can exercise his Manichean dueling with compelling gusto (a narcissistic android kiss lets on how lonely and desperate he wants a companion rivaled to his ambition, prowess, and immortality). Another real trouper here is Katherine Waterston's Janet ""Danny"" Daniels, who is grief-stricken after the death of her hubby, the said perished captain, but never flinch in the action after his fellow crew members are being picked off one by one in the gore-fest, her mettle is an incandescent homage to the franchise's first heroine Ellen Ripley, still there is a nagging plot-hole when she seems to be unfazed by Walter's wound stitching (and even offers her assistance) after they escape from that plagued planet, as she supposedly should know that Walter has an advanced ability to heal himself (which is demonstrated earlier before the Walter Vs. David face-off), and this leaves the not-so-shocking twist in the end quite stilted because logically she should have known better than blurting out the ""cabin on the lake"" question after being immobilized inside the pod.Fairly speaking, ALIEN: COVENANT takes a leap forward from its nearest predecessor in terms of its holistic coherence and ideological purview (a mankind's colonial expenditure almost scuppered by an android's creationist fanaticism, yet, it is human's inveterate caprice of risks answers the latter's invitation, to begin with, and the tale is nowhere near its finishing line), still, it is a baby step, reckoning its dwindling revenue, chances are this revered horror brand is in a creativity predicament, and with all due respect to Mr. Ridley Scott, it might be wiser to delegate his money spinner to a new helmer so as to drip-feed some fresh vision into its formulaic structure and outlook and Neill Blomkamp might not be a bad candidate.",Alien - Covenant

PREDATOR' movies), and the second chapter in series creator Ridley Scott's prequel series. Scott directed and co-produced the film, once again with the other two series creators David Giler and Walter Hill. The script was written by John Logan, Dante Harper, Jack Paglen and Michael Green. It stars Michael Fassbender (reprising his role from the previous film 'PROMETHEUS', and playing a new android role as well), Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, Billy Crudup, Carmen Ejogo and Demian Bichir. James Franco, Noomi Rapace and Guy Pearce also have un-credited cameos in the movie (Rapace and Pearce also both reprise their roles from the previous film). It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's been a hit at the Box Office so far as well (internationally). Like most of the other films in the franchise, I absolutely loved it!The story is set in the year 2014, when the crew of the Covenant is headed for a remote planet called Origae-6. There are over 2,000 colonists onboard, plus thousands of embryos. An android named Walter (Fassbender), an updated version of David (from 'PROMETHEUS'), watches over the ship and everyone onboard (while they're all in stasis). When a shockwave hits the ship, Walter wakes the crew up early. While repairing damages done by the wave, the crew receives a human radio transmission from an unknown planet. The new captain, Christopher Oram (Crudup), decides they need to investigate it; against the objections of terraforming expert Daniels Branson (Waterston). Daniels is of course right to be concerned, and unknown xenomorphs might be involved.Like 'PROMETHEUS', the film is full of very broad philosophical and religious ideas; and like all of the 'ALIEN' movies, and a lot of science fiction, it once again presents the idea that too much advancement in modern technology might lead to our downfall (the alien is never really the true enemy in any of these films). Unlike 'PROMETHEUS', and more like the other installments in the series, there's a lot of alien thrills and action though. It's kind of the perfect mix of violence and philosophy, and there's even some great Ripley-esque scenes in this one (and Waterson is fantastic in the role). I think fans of the series will be extremely pleased with this new chapter (as I am), and I'm eagerly looking forward to more new installments in the beloved series!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b6j-_hcq7Wo",Alien - Covenant

I knew even beforehand, you can't simply top the incredible first two films (Alien and Aliens,) but I was hoping for at least an overall competent film and a closer prequel to the original Alien.Eh. While it was well shot, the ferociously long and unneeded scenes, the completely retreaded plot, the paper-thin and boring characters and the ""twists"" that a five-year-old who's never been exposed to any of the franchise films would see coming an hour before they landed all made the movie a chore to get through.A colonization ship headed into deeper space than Deep Space Nine hears (shocker) a distress call and heads to the planet/source to investigate. Wow, they landed on paradise – an even better planet to colonize than previously sought out. What could possibly go wrong?Well, more unnecessary long shots like learning to play the flute! or scenes designed to shock you later but are just as obvious as the reveal. Oh, and the title character enters the story in about the same timeframe as Peter Jackson's King Kong does. If this was meant for a trilogy and the final film, or the next one, is the actual connection to 1979's Alien, I'm not even sure if I want to see it. I vowed not to compare this film to the others, but since this is directly linked to Prometheus, I can say that one, despite its own problems, is oodles better. Better cast, better characters, more beautifully shot, more suspense and wonder did Prometheus contain. Alien: Covenant had only a fraction or less of any of those qualities. Now. It wasn't a complete waste. It was still competently made in the visuals, though not so much the little aliens. And it did give the highly annoying pricks behind me some obnoxious laughs during the tense scenes. So, there's that.Can't really recommend it even when it could just be a throw-away Alien film to watch on Netflix in a few months. Maybe they'll have the non- ultimate-extended-special-director's cut that the studio meddled with to see.

31,cherold,"A step up from Prometheus, but still a couple of steps down from Alien",7,11 August 2017,"I was so excited when Ridley Scott decided to return to the Alien franchise, and so disappointed when I watched the pretentious, ponderous, utterly inane Prometheus. So I went into Covenant with a ""fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me"" attitude. Only this time, I got something closer to what I'd hoped Prometheus would be.The movie begins as a crew in charge of cryogenically frozen colonists notices a planet, hears a message, and says, ""let's check it out, what could go wrong?"" Then everything goes excitingly wrong in a flurry of spores, gore, explosions, and freaky mini-Xenomorphs.This going wrong thing is helped out tremendously by the striking idiocy of almost every character, which is one of the things it has in common with Prometheus. There is a *tremendous* amount of bad decision-making going on in this film, which might be understandable in a movie about teenagers trapped in a cabin with a serial killer but seems jarring in a movie about trained professionals hired to do a difficult and exacting task. It's like no one in this movie has ever been trained for anything, no one follows any protocols, and no one seems to be paying attention.While this is frustrating, the movie makes up for it with all sorts of excitement and some striking imagery. While the movie has about three or four endings (movies just don't end the way they did when I was a kid), they're all pretty exciting endings.The movie also boasts the return of Michael Fassbender as David (and another android), and his urbane creepiness is even more entertaining than last time.While it lacks the economy and unbearable tension of the original Alien, it certainly tries harder than Prometheus to be an Alien movie. In fact, it often seems to be taking a ""greatest hits"" approach in which you'll say, oh yeah, I remember when that happened in Alien! (The movie also totally ditches the mysteries it was promising to answer in Prometheus, which is a total cheat.)Apparently they're planning some more of these Alien prequels, but honestly, I wish they'd just bring back Sigourney Weaver and make Alien 5. Still, I enjoyed Covenant enough that I will certainly check out the next one. But I will keep my expectations in check, and prepare myself for more stupid people getting themselves killed as stupidly as possible.",Alien - Covenant
32,StrictlyConfidential,It's Time For Ridley Scott To Retire,1,23 June 2018,"Shame! Shame! Shame! on 80-year-old director, Ridley Scott for foisting this $97 million SyFy turd on us (his audience).You know, this film has completely convinced me that Scott is nothing but a senile, old boob.I had thought that Scott had scraped the absolute bottom of the barrel with Prometheus - But, no - Alien: Covenant actually manages to sink even lower into the manure than that.The only surprises that this prized piece of junk had to offer to the viewer was to prove, over and over again, how really-really bad it was.I can only hope that this utter garbage is the very last of the Alien sequels - But, I'm certain that there's still some more poop coming our way in the next few years.And, finally - Speaking about actor (ha!), Michael Fassbender - Next to the likes of that airhead, Tom Cruise - I think he's the most despicable, no-talent, little creep of all.",Alien - Covenant
33,FeastMode,my notes,6,24 July 2019,"Great movie, very well made and aesthetically pleasing. lots of suspense and creepiness. this movie should be 3.5 but there were things i disliked. (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
mainly the most ridiculously obvious twist i can remember. which is that David is pretending to be Walter. They clearly showed that the fight between them could have gone either way and they didn't show the ending. i knew immediately. but it wouldn't have been a big deal. not having a twist is not necessarily a bad thing, most movies don't. but in this case, they seemed to have tried sooooo hard to try to convince us that it wasn't true before they finally revealed it. and then the final reveal was so lame: ""are we going to build a cabin together? omg you're david."" not only did it not hit but if you wanna be nit-picky it's pretty stupid that she waited to ask that question until 2 seconds after he locked her in. it wasn't like he locked her in and they continued a conversation that stumbled onto that point. she asked him to try to confirm it was david after she became suspicious. maybe it won't bother me as much the second time i watch it but it just brought me down. and also, if they could have pulled it off better, it would have been a great twist. but it may have been hard to pull off. they just shouldn't have played it out as much as they did",Alien - Covenant
34,Robert_duder,"Definitely the definition of a ""reboot""",8,31 May 2017,"What I mean by that is Ridley Scott took his science fiction classic and create this prequel trilogy (this is the middle instalment according to him) and created a different vibe, feel, almost a different direction entirely. Prometheus and now Alien Covenant have an artistic almost interpretive dance feel to them. I love Prometheus but there were plenty of complaints about it basically that it lacked the Alien connection. Covenant fixes that. It gives you more to the same storyline but brings back the Aliens in a big way. Maybe we won't understand the full picture until the third film but so far I'm intrigued enough to stay with it. Covenant is unique in that it gives us that familiar vibe that the original Alien and Aliens and Alien3 brought to the table but still keeps that fantasy, history aspect that Prometheus built. That does make the first half of the film a little dry, slow moving and it doesn't build the suspense all that well. However, once Ridley Scott mixes in the horror and darkness that made the original Alien a classic things start to come together. There are some truly first rate horror scenes and they utilize some of the more classic visuals (the Alien in the chest) and recreate them to great success. I love the concept that to make it fresh and new rather than coming out the front...the Alien comes out the back. Simple but effective.I read one review that really trashed the cast of the film calling them monotone and boring and stereotypical. I didn't get that at all. Are they as memorable as some of the original cast, no. I do think they tried too hard on Danny McBride's character as ""Tennessee"" but he does get a good story arc and McBride is actually very good in the role and has some tense and emotional scenes. Michael Fassbender returns to his role as David and also Walter, the Androids. I recall Fassbender being one of the best parts of Prometheus and he was good in this but I felt something was off with the character development and something was missing. Still he did well. Katherine Waterston was fantastic as the heroine of the film. Whether or not on purpose she has the look and feel of an Ellen Ripley type character though a little softer around the edges. I would love to see her take over in future instalments of this franchise. Billy Crudup and Demián Bichir round out what I consider to be the main and supporting cast with a few other third string characters as well all played well enough but without a lot or any back story. The film might actually have too many characters who are ultimately not much more than fodder for the Alien(s). Ridley Scott is a sci-fi legend in the directors chair of course. It is obvious he is very passionate about this franchise and he has or has had ideas in his mind for a very long time about the lore behind the Alien franchise and how it ties into human beings. He might be taking it in a very intellectual direction and I think we are all okay with that but he'll want to be careful to remember what we love about this franchise as well which was the horror and survival nature and isolation. While not the best of the series it holds its own and hopefully represents a good bridge between Prometheus and the end of the new trilogy that links all the series together. 8/10",Alien - Covenant
35,MOscarbradley,Generic if entertaining,7,19 May 2017,"The first four Alien movies worked because of a certain Sigourney Weaver who made Ripley one of the most iconic characters in all of cinema. Their much-touted follow-up, ""Prometheus"", billed as a kind of prequel, was hardly memorable, despite being directed by Ridley Scott, though it did give us a reasonably memorable character in Michael Fassbender's robot David. Now we have the much anticipated sequel to ""Prometheus"" and one that gets back to adding the word 'Alien' to the title.""Alien: Covenant"" is certainly better than its predecessor though when it was over I didn't feel as if I had actually seen anything. This is a generic, if entertaining, sci-fi movie that adds nothing to the genre or to the 'Alien' series, at least nothing we haven't seen before; indeed it feels like bits of ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" stitched together. On the plus side, it looks good, has a decent climax and Michael Fassbender, reprising his role of David as well as a new, identical robot called Walter, is outstanding, proving that, whether playing a human or something more mechanical, he remains one of the best actors around.",Alien - Covenant
36,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Occasionally provides basic enjoyment, but is only an amalgamation of what worked before with all the energy and innovation drained out.",5,5 March 2018,"Serving as a kind of connective-tissue between 'Prometheus' and the rest of the 'Alien' franchise, attempting to marry the grand philosophising of the former with the claustrophobic sci-fi scares of the latter, this familiar tale of a mission-gone-awry sees the much anticipated return of the traditional xenomorph. Unfortunately, though 'Alien: Covenant (2017)' does occasionally work on the most basic of levels, with some set-pieces providing 'turn-your-brain-off' enjoyment, the stupidity of the characters and over-use of unobscured CGI drags the experience down until it's nothing more than an amalgamation of what once worked with all the energy and innovation drained from it. 5/10",Alien - Covenant
37,bowmanblue,Frankenstein's monster of an 'Alien' film,7,13 June 2017,"I'm guessing that most people who sit down to watch 'Alien: Covenant' will have some idea about what they're in for, but, in case you need the most meagre of plot synopsises, it's basically a monster hunting humans in space (or, if you believe the original pitch for the first 'Alien' movie back in 1979 it could – also – be described as 'Jaws in space'). So, if you're a casual fan of the franchise then you'll probably get what you want out of this. There are monsters. The monsters kill humans. End of. However, I (like so many) are anything but 'casual' fans of the franchise! The reason 'Alien: Covenant' is such a big deal stems back to 1986 (or some may say 1979), due to the phenomenal success of 'Aliens.' Now, don't get me wrong, the original 'Alien' in 1979 was awesome – so awesome in fact that it was in doubt whether it could ever be bettered. And, some still say that it can't. It's sequel (1986's imaginatively-titled 'Aliens') gave us the same and more. Apart from 'Terminator/Terminator 2,' people claim 'Alien/Aliens' to be one of few examples of where a sequel surpasses the original. Therefore, there were high hopes for the third instalment, 1992's 'Alien 3.' And that's where things started to go wrong. I was an absolute disaster with fans all over the world wondering how a good sequel couldn't somehow be made of the first two films' backs. And, that's the question we've been asking ever since. We've had all sorts of 'Alien' movies since – mainly spin-offs and crossovers – and none have really come close to attaining the high praise of the first two.So, now we come to 'Alien: Covenant.' It's clear that the film-makers know that the 'Alien franchise' is still hot property, has armies of loyal fans out there and it far from unprofitable. I can almost see them all sitting round in meeting rooms trying to work out why every alien-related film post 'Aliens' has failed so dramatically and therefore what they need to do to make a worthy successor. I'm just guessing, but it seems they sat through the first two movies taking carful note of what fans liked and they splicing it together to form a script for 'Alien: Covenant.' It's like they said – audiences like the 'one alien' suspense – so we'll put that in. But, at the same time, people liked marines fighting aliens with big guns. That goes in, too. People loved Sigourney Weaver's original heroine Ripley – so we need a tough female lead with short hair. Everyone loved it when Ripley got in a giant robot suit and kicked the alien out of a spaceship – let's throw that in there as well. But 'Covenant' also has to be a sequel to a prequel ('Prometheus') – what did people like about that? Not much really. However, Michael Fassbender was highly-praised for his creepy android portrayal of David. So let's bring him back for a prominent role. And so on.If you take 'Alien, Aliens' and add a dash of 'Prometheus' then you end up with 'Alien: Covenant.' A spaceship full of colonists traces a signal to a new planet and lands, only to get picked off by the xenomorph and its friends. It's not a bad film, but, once again, it doesn't do the first two films justice. Because it seems to try and throw in so much into one film – it tries to be 'Alien, Aliens,' a sequel to 'Prometheus,' a bridge back to 'Alien' and something that will hopefully reinvigorate the franchise, it does come across as a bit of a mess. Yeah, there are good bits here and there – director Ridley Scott again proves that he hasn't lost his flair when it comes to visual storytelling, but my personal favourite was – like 'Prometheus' – the android David again. However, it's still just another 'monster movie' as opposed to what could have been an amazing sequel to 'Aliens.' It's okay, but it's ultimately going to be forgotten for what it contains and probably remembered more for being the film that stood between Neil Blomkamp making his (much touted on the internet) version of a remake of 'Alien 3' (although I think he called it 'Alien 5') which would have been a direct sequel to 'Aliens' and bring back fan-favourite characters Ripley, Hicks, Newt and Bishop.",Alien - Covenant
38,ThomasDrufke,Run.,7,20 May 2017,"After a week worth of Alien films, I think I'm about ready to take a break from the trapped in space sub-genre for a bit. Alien: Covenant has its moments, and is certainly miles above the 3rd or 4th film, but struggles with the same problems as Prometheus, trying to juggle too many things at once.Although Ridley Scott returned to the series with Prometheus, Covenant is more of an official return to the beloved face-hugger franchise. As I said with Prometheus, Alien: Covenant is truly an awe to look at. Every frame is oozing with gorgeous cinematography and stunning production design. Scott's direction is still uneven like in Prometheus, as he still hasn't decided whether he wants to make a slasher/horror film or a philosophical science fiction piece. However, there's no denying that this film is his vision, and I can always appreciate movies that are able to supersede the wants and needs of a major studio.With that said, I really wish Covenant was more than just a solid monster film. There's nothing overwhelmingly different or surprising about Covenant. It's just your prototypical monster film where a crew go somewhere they're not familiar with, meet dangerous creatures, and get attacked by said dangerous creatures. I just feel like Alien & Aliens had so much more underneath the surface. You cared about the characters in those movies, and that's not the case at all here. I can't say I cared about a single one of the humans aboard Covenant.I guess it's not entirely fair to say Alien: Covenant doesn't add anything to the series because there is plenty of proposed ideas that Covenant continues from Prometheus, it's just that those ideas don't feel like they belong in this particular adventure. I like that David, one of the two characters Michael Fassbender plays, is obsessed with creation and becoming more than just an android. I think that angle of this story is fascinating, and it plays out in a rather terrifyingly dark way, but I'm not sure how well it meshes with the rest of the film. In fact, his disturbing presence tends to overshadow the Xenomorphs for a good portion of the film. I don't think I should come out of an Alien film raving about how disturbing an android was instead of the two-mouthed face huggers themselves.There are plenty of thrills to have with Covenant and the film is about as beautiful to look at as any, but if we're talking about it compared to the rest of the series? It really doesn't hold a candle. Hopefully the sequel can build on the lore and give us a more terrifying and surprising experience than Covenant did.+Another gorgeously shot Ridley Scott film+Proposed ideas-But not everything always comes together nicely-Nothing is shocking or surprising7.1/10",Alien - Covenant
39,ericstevenson,"Wow, people seem to really hate this movie",7,23 May 2017,"The score isn't that bad but man are these reviews negative. I mean, I admit it's not as good as the original two movies or even ""Prometheus"", but it did pretty well on its own. What I like about this movie is that it doesn't even seem like it's going to be a direct sequel to ""Prometheus"" at first. It's not until far into the film that we get to see David from the original movie. I really liked the connections this had to that movie. ""Prometheus"" wasn't advertised as being in the same Universe, which is why a lot of people were satisfied by the ending.And hey, we get to see the Xenomorphs in their original form here! I will admit it has a lot of weak points. It's annoying how it's just a retread from ""Alien"" with a single creature being on the ship. Still, the acting was quite good and I really thought they had a lot of creative ideas even if they weren't done that well. It gets boring at first, but it gets a lot more intense and watchable later on. I thought it was interesting to just compare this to ""Prometheus"" and the original ""Alien"".

Ridley Scott didn't seem to understand the logic and mythology of the universe he created and if you think he's going to retcon himself back on track with this pile of crap you'll be making the same mistake as me.I knew that he had painted himself into a corner. If they followed the David/Shaw storyline and went to the Engineer homeworld (they are still the stupidest-looking creature design in film history) then every single part of the dialogue would have to be delivered by just two characters. So now we have a NEW ship with a NEW heavy- handed symbolic name filled with NEW fresh, disposable meat...I mean characters heading out into space under the banner of Weyland Corp.After sustaining some damage from a solar flare or whatnot the crew pick up a transmission from a nearby planet and decide to go check it out. So far so very familiar. When they get down there they discover a crashed derelict ship. Okay, I've DEFINITELY seen this before. And then...all Alien hell breaks loose, but not before a long, seemingly endless succession of scenes where people loudly discuss the plot in a way that would make the earliest Scooby-Doo episodes look like masterpiece theatre.This is complete garbage, kiddies. There is a line of dialogue between David and Walter where Mad Dave actually says the words ""You hold it and I'll do the fingering."" Yes, he's talking about playing a flute but COME ON!!! How in heaven or hell did THAT go unnoticed? Was anyone paying attention to how terrible this is?We don't even get the classic Xenomorph, but instead have to be content with a Neomorph/Protomorph/Morph/Sooty and Sweep/Howdy Doody placeholder. The Protomorph CGI is frequently terrible too and looks like something from a video game.Ridley Scott succeeds, again, at making this look like a genuine, lived-in universe, but the characters are never anything more than fodder and even at 122 minutes you can tell a LOT was cut out of this. They clearly struggle to find a workable pacing in this theatrical cut and it feels sloppily edited throughout. The final 20 minutes seems like a completely different movie and lowers itself to the tone of a Friday the 13th film. Nothing against Jason Voorhees, but the Alien series is supposed to be more cerebral and Covenant is so lame that you'll actually be longing for the comfort of Alien: Resurrection or AVP: Requiem.Alien didn't need a prequel. A huge part of the lure was the darkness, the mystery, the coincidence, the infinite unknown. To have it all explained by Prometheus was a bad idea, but that movie completely failed to even come anywhere close to that. Covenant should have spent its running time answering questions Prometheus dumped on us when it confused the audience. It should have spent 122 minutes getting this series back on track after the staggeringly bad choices of the 2012 debacle.It doesn't. There is simply no way a third prequel can logically tie into the Nostromo crew finding a thousands-year-long dead Space Jockey fossilized in the derelict on LV426. Ridley Scott has gone insane and doesn't know what he's doing.The original quadrilogy had the tangible DNA of four different directors upfront and visible in every frame, for better or worse. Scott has had too much creative control (two words I use with massive doses of irony) and it's time to either kill this series for good, forever, or let someone else rewrite whatever unworkable direction the Covenant is lumbering in.",Alien - Covenant

Settings were terrific, acting was uniformly good by everyone with the standout performances by the always great Michael Fassbender and Danny McBride. All the sci-fi stuff was great - really love this universe - it is probably the only movie franchise which i honestly do care about and really try to connect the dots when watching these movies. And while ""Covenant"" doesn't go very deep into ideas this time around, it has some good ones. This time is more about xenomorph - and i loved it as well. There isn't really much action in this movie, but there are few amazingly staged action sequences after which i was like ""that was awesome!"".Overall, ""Alien: Covenant"" is a superbly crafted movie for those who loved alien movies and this universe.

It was a redux - just redundant, nothing new. 1. An almost mid to late 20th century storytelling of alien surviving on a planet by eating living hosts. Yet massive amounts of weapon fire seem to not damage it in any way (except in one case which didn't make any sense). 2. The usual range of not believable characters (an interstellar voyage should have a well trained/stable elite crew). Lots of stupid decisions not appropriate for such a mission. 3. A space ship made of massive amounts of heavy steel (even 20th century style heavy ship chains to hold cargo) with lots of extraneous structural components everywhere, both interior & exterior, to add weight with no function. Increased complexity leads to more opportunities to break; weight is out of this world costly. Looks impressive though. 4.

48,ironhorse_iv,"Don't call me a facehugger. This is one movie, I probably wouldn't run up to, hug and never let go! It wasn't great or awful. It was just meh.",6,25 May 2017,"I'm sorry, but I really didn't like the story of a space vessel answering a distress call, only to find, a mysterious life form, attacking them. It felt like a rethread of 1979's 'Alien', but this time, minus the great characters with unique personalities. Nearly, every member of the crew of the 'Covenant' is forgettable. Even, the idea of the crew being composed entirely of married couples is not memorable, as it kinda falls apart, as the movie doesn't give enough time to explain, which person is dating whom. Even with that, the characters by themselves, had little to show for. I think the problem with this, comes from the fact that, much of the backstory on them that was shown in previews for this movie, was cut out of the final film. It's sad, because I would love to see 'the last supper' scene in the film, as that sequence really does developed them as complex human beings, rather than surface level redshirts. Another reason, why I didn't find the characters, interesting is, because the acting wasn't that strong. Katherine Waterston's character comes across as too much of a heroine Ellen Ripley type character, that she doesn't seem real. Where is Daniels sense of fear!? Then, there is Billy Crudup, whom character is describe as self-serious man of faith. However, he rarely shows that. Then, there is Danny McBride, as Tennessee, whom comes across as a caricature of original movie character, Dallas played by Tom Skerritt. Of course, the other crew is violently whittled down to even stand out. Another reason, why I can't stand, the human characters in this film, is the fact that all of the crew were f**king stupid. What type of space crew, go to alien world, without wearing any sense of environmental suits!? At least, the scientists from the last movie wore protective suits and didn't expose themselves to any unknown pathogen like morons until much later. Did IQ's drop sharply since the last movie!? Even worse, the film also makes use of some very obvious horror tropes by having characters announce that they are going off on their own in order to kill them. The first instance of this is acceptable since the aliens have not shown up yet, but the characters continue to do this throughout the film even though they know the monsters are around. Without spoiling the movie, too much, one returning character goes even further in acting dumb, by trusting the same android that help kill, most of her friends in the last movie, in travelling to find out, why the Engineers hate them. That's pretty blatantly dumb, even to those ordinary members of the audience that hasn't see the last movie. It's pretty clear, by how David (Michael Fassbender) acts in this film that he isn't to be, trusted, seeing how he trying to be, the modern day, Dr. Frankenstein. While, parts of the story does have substance, mostly with that character. It too, felt like we heard those, dangers of playing Gods part of the story before in 2012's 'Prometheus'. In my opinion, while Michael Fassbender was great in the duo role. I felt that Cain & Abel subplot, between the two androids was a bit disappointing. There was no point, in reexamine it. Characters quoting John Milton's 'Paradise Lost' & Percy Bysshe Shelley's '""Ozymandias"" sonnet, felt a little too recycled. It really didn't add anything new to the story. It's sad, because there were other things that the writers could had focus more on, like explaining, why the engineers hate humanity. I guess, we will never know. Still, I did like how the movie, explain the 'black goo' more. Yet, it does leave, some unanswered questions, like if the ""Black Goo"" was just a dangerous genetic manipulation bacteria, capable of poisoning life on its own, while combine with parasitic could create life, how can a Neomorph be created without a parasitoid form? It doesn't add up. Nevertheless, I also don't like how this film ruin the alien film lore, by saying the classic Xenomorphs simply didn't exist before this film. It makes no sense, seeing how a sculpture of a Xenomorph was feature in the last movie, even when, 'Prometheus' was supposed to be a stand-alone spin off film that wasn't a direct prequel to the original 1979's 'Alien' film. This is just one of many things that is upsetting, for more serious fans of the franchise. Another is the how long does, the aliens need to reproduce. Now, it only takes a few minutes for a creature to be, born, instead of days. Make up, your mind! Regardless, the creature from artist, H.R Giger still remains one of the most brutal monsters in all of cinema. It's nice to see them, brought to life with computer animation and moving with such intense ferocity and speed. I just wish, the movie would use more suspense with the creatures than gore. There were hardly any scary moments in this film. No jump scares. It felt rushed. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have some entertaining action, some wonderful cinematography being shot in New Zealand and great special effects, but this film directed by Ridley Scott was also a bit painful to watch, because how pitch black, certain scenes were shot! I couldn't figure out, what was going on! Overall: While, this film fails to match the original in terms of sheer terror and elegance, Scott nevertheless delivers some imaginative takes on familiar sequences. However, it will be awkward for him, to explain in the sequels, why the technology in 'Alien' looks so retro; seeing how this movie looks so slick with 3D computers. It will be hard to fill that gap.

49,Platypuschow,Alien Covenant: Meh!,5,30 August 2017,"I've always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with the Alien franchise. I want to like them, but they rarely seem to entertain to the extent I believe they should.Alien: 5Aliens: 10Alien 3: 3Alien Resurrection: 5Alien vs Predator: 5Alien vs Predator Requiem: 3Prometheus: 5For this reason I didn't expect much from Covenant and got essentially what I thought I would. It's not that it's bad, it's just clichéd Hollywood predictable nonsense and didn't feel like an Alien movie. Granted it felt more like one than Prometheus but didn't come close to the pinnacle of greatness that was Aliens (1986)To its credit at least it had the old school Alien, even though I'm still not keen on seeing them in light. I miss them coming from the shadows and you only getting to see a part of them at a time.Danny McBride was less obnoxious as usual and exceeded my expectations in a straight role. But Michael Fassbender, too much Hollywood too much.Alien Covenant is a harmless film but doesn't meet the hype, doesn't contribute anything to the Alien universe and simply failed to impress.The Good:One great death sceneDanny McBrideThe Bad:Michael Fassbender, I am so over this guyThe first death, really!?",Alien - Covenant
50,The-Sarkologist,The Franchise Continues,5,13 May 2017,"The Alien franchise, much like the Terminator franchise, seems to be one of those franchises that simply will not die. Mind you, when I look at the people who swarm into this movie these days a part of me wonders whether they are familiar with, or have even watched, the original movies. Okay, I am probably writing them off as unsophisticated louts a little too quickly because even though there seems to be a sort of expectation among the millennials these days with regards to films, it does not necessarily mean that they automatically reject what I consider to be the classics. Mind you, a part of me, as I sit here writing this review, never expected to consider Alien, and even Terminator, to be a classic movie when I first watched them, but since it is now over thirty years since they first hit the big screen, and the franchise is still going strong, a part of me says that they probably are.Anyway, Covenant follows on from Prometheus, though the problem is that since it has been a while since I saw Prometheus a part of me does not actually remember what happened in that film. Yet in a way this film is still a part of what is intending to be a prequel trilogy even though from what I remember of the original films, humanity hadn't gone out and colonised the star systems yet. On the other hand, a part of me also expected that there would be a closer tie in with the original movie, however as the film progressed this became less and less apparent, and the connection with Prometheus become more and more obvious.So, the film is set around the colony ship Covenant that is damaged when it passes through an ion storm. Since the crew are all forced to wake up, they decide to assess the situation and discover that there is a habitable planet much closer than the planet that they are intending to colonise. Well, they decide to take a short cut and go and explore this planet, but it become pretty obvious that this planet isn't as crash hot as it originally appeared to be, but then again that shouldn't be surprising because short cuts rarely, if ever, actually work out the way that they are supposed to work out.Like Prometheus, this film not only completely ignores the Aliens vs Predator movies (which is a shame because I actually really liked those movies, though I have to admit that I am probably in the minority when it comes to Requium), but it also explores creatures other than the traditional alien. In fact what it seems to explore is how the alien that has become the staple of the horror science-fiction movie (and also a part of modern western culture) came about. Straight out, we do have the alien appear in the film, but like Promentheus it goes much, much further beyond being a simple bug hunt. Mind you, since we are now at movie number six (ignoring Aliens vs Predator), the creators do have to continue to reinvent the franchise lest it simply end up being just another bad sequel that many franchises eventually suffer from. However, my thoughts is that this film was okay, and somewhat enjoyable, particularly since there were elements of this that took it beyond your typical bug hunt. While the twists did turn out to be pretty good, as I mentioned in my Facebook post, this film is going to have a very hard time exceeding the original two.",Alien - Covenant

Alien resurrection is a great movie. Alien vs Predator is a great movie. Alien vs Predator requiem is good movie. Prometheus is a great movie. And this just awful. The story line is awful. The ending is awful. It is not scary at all. Why did this get a 6.6. That is just overrating it. This is a 1. I can not believe people like this awful movie. Riddy Scott needs to replaced by James Cameron or David Fincher or Jean Pierre Jeunet. Riddy Scott is not the worst but have never made an Alien movie as good any of those three have. I do not think he ever will. Do not see this movie. It is one of the worst science fiction movies ever.,Alien - Covenant

53,Reno-Rangan,Good robot! Bad robot!,7,13 October 2017,"After some gaps, the 'Alien' franchise came alive with the prequel 'Prometheum' which originally said to be a spin-off. Particularly, it landed in the hands of the original maker. Now, even the original title back in action. It's another prequel, hence the prequel series on the making. The next film too will be the same kind, before the overall storyline in the franchise align in a straight line.I enjoyed it. But not as good as 'Prometheum' or the first two 'Alien' films. The issue with it was, the same old cliché. There's nothing in the story. It was like any space film that's set in a similar fashion. The 80 per cent of the film was what we had seen in the earlier 'Alien' films. Just altered scenes with a new cast and a great visuals. So the update makes it the special.The story focused too much on the robot. The alien parts were reduced. Because it was like the first appearance of the original aliens we saw in the old films. Precisely to say, the origins. Genetic modification, crossbreeding, there comes the beast. From this film what I have learnt was, it was nothing but more or less the same old fear the humans have about that the robots which are the ones going to make humans go extinct. Except here the aliens come between them. Hence, falling prey to the same clichéd theme from any sci-fi that had humanoid.Nevertheless, well maintained film in its balance coming from previous hits in the series and going forward to bring more hits. This flick would serve as a fine bridge between them. So only 18 years to go between this, from 2104 to 2122. I'm already anticipating the next film. As I have heard, that film would be focused more on the robot. That's going to be a different experience. Fassbender's time to have some space adventures.7/10",Alien - Covenant
54,paulclaassen,"Great start, but it wears out very quickly.",4,3 July 2018,"I loved the introduction of characters: it was as if we already knew them instead of getting to know them. Unfortunately, though, none of these characters are compelling. The most interesting character is Walter/David, but they in effect cause more confusion and questions than anything else.Fast-paced, interesting and exciting for the first hour and a bit, then it plummets to near boredom, and then ends with a climax that screams for a sequel. I did not like the aliens in this movie, though, as they're made out to be cute instead of evil. Another seemingly unnecessary sequel/prequel. (Prometheus sequel and prequel to Alien). The film is also full of plot holes and flaws. Most importantly: these trained astronauts do not even wear protective gear when exploring a foreign planet!!",Alien - Covenant
55,sol-,Alien Resurrected,5,1 September 2017,"Answering a distress call on an unfamiliar planet, a space crew are hunted by aliens who use human bodies to breed in this Ridley Scott sci-fi thriller. The film is often atmospheric and the special effects are as expected good, but marketed as both a sequel to 'Prometheus' and a prequel to 'Alien', this entry suffers from trying too hard to fit under both banners. There are quite a few alien attacks, but the action does not begin until over 45 minutes and it is seldom anything new or original. The characters are also fleshed out in such little depth that it is hard to get emotionally invested in their struggle to survive. The 'Prometheus'-like elements work better with acute creator and creation themes and a glimpse into androids trying philosophise their purpose beyond serving humanity, but this is very much in the backdrop as the alien attacks become more and more rampant. The vast planet setting additionally lacks the intense spaceship claustrophobia a la 'Alien' and 'Aliens' and absent are the themes of human irresponsibility that made the earlier entries so potent with characters whose doom is brought on by corporate greed, venturing into worlds where humans do not belong and so forth. The film is certainly never boring and Michael Fassbender makes the most of his dual role, but it is easy to see why this was not the sequel that many die-hard fans wanted.",Alien - Covenant
56,briancham1994,Stupid and unnecessary,5,3 June 2020,"How could this film share the same director as the original classic? It has devolved into a clichéd and ridiculous slasher film. It attempts to tie loose ends of Prometheus and the Alien series into something coherent but fails miserably. It does not incorporate the feedback people gave for those films, as the team makes the same stupid mistakes, nothing is resolved well and the xenomorph battle is just a retread. All the navel gazing from Prometheus is gone but so is anything interesting about it. David is now a simplified slasher villain, the homeworld of the Engineers is just a dark ruin (with one city?) and it just drops the arcs of Peter Weyland and Dr. Shaw as if they were never important.",Alien - Covenant
57,tomgillespie2002,Thank the Engineers for Michael Fassbender,4,10 September 2017,"Ridley Scott's ambitious but ultimately flawed Prometheus attempted to somewhat distance itself from the Alien franchise, or at least the silly money-spinner it had become. While very much set within the Alien universe, Prometheus made a crack at some big themes, particularly man's obsession with meeting its maker, but ended up leaving us with far more questions than answers, with Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and the decapitated synthetic David (Michael Fassbender) leaving to find the Engineer's planet to find the answers to the very questions we are left with. After the success of the brilliant The Martian, Scott seems eager to get back into the familiar stalk-and-eat/impregnate routine of his genre re-defining Alien. Indeed, Alien: Covenant is a direct sequel to prequel Prometheus, but Scott seems more interested in straight- up horror than further exploring the deeper themes of its predecessor.It's 11 years since the Prometheus expedition, and the spaceship Covenant is drifting through space on its way to a distant planet that its crew and passengers hope to colonise. Two thousand colonists lie in stasis, and only the crew are awoken when a stellar neutrino burst almost destroys the ship. As repairs go underway, they pick up a faint radio transmission from an uncharted planet, which sounds suspiciously like John Denver. Following the death of the ship's captain (played by James Franco, who appears for roughly 30 seconds), the newly- promoted Oram (Billy Crudup), against the wishes of second-in-command Daniels (Katherine Waterston), makes the decision to follow the signal in the hope of finding another habitable planet. When they touch down, they find an alien ship, a sea of extraterrestrial corpses, and the planet's seemingly lone inhabitant, the long-haired synthetic David. Soon enough, a couple of crew members become infected by alien spores, and the rest you already know.1979's Alien, which still has the power to terrify, has little in way of plot or alien action. Its power comes from the simplicity in which its story unfolds, and the fantastic ensemble of actors bringing to life the human interaction between those brief moments of sheer menace. They talked about shitty working conditions and bad pay, and felt like actual people rather than just the clothes they wore. There was something fascinating about watching these blue- collar types, hundreds of years into the future, and seeing that we haven't changed one bit. In Alien: Covenant, characters are defined by the things they say about themselves or their accessories. One of the first things Oram reveals is that he is a man of faith, as if the audience is too stupid to work out for themselves that the story essentially represents humanity's search for God. Chief pilot Tennessee (Danny McBride) is a cowboy because he wears a cowboy hat and, well, his name is Tennessee. Daniels rocks a white vest and a tough, slightly sad demeanour, so we instantly think of Ripley without any actual character development required.The film spends most of its time having the characters explain the plot to each other. At one point, a character proclaims that so little of what is happening makes sense, and I refuse to believe I'm the only one to spot the glaring irony in this statement. Characters are introduced and killed off before we had the chance to care about them, while most of the audience will still be trying to figure out how all this 'black goo' fits into the overarching story. Thank the Engineers then, for the presence of Michael Fassbender. He was the best thing in Prometheus, and it's no different here. Doubling as both the American-accented synthetic upgrade Walter and his unhinged, English-accented predecessor David, his scenes are the film's eeriest. Scenery is chewed, certainly, and there is a ridiculous, homo-erotically charged moment I won't spoil, but it's only during these moments that Covenant doesn't feel like a re-tread of every other Alien movie there's been, only done worse. Covenant's main problem is that it is trying to explain and expand on a mythos that doesn't require it. In Alien, the alien arrived without explanation and that was part of its appeal. It was a slimy, unpredictable unknown, and perhaps we now know too much.",Alien - Covenant
58,cruise01,Ridley Scott is back to its suspense roots that made the original Alien film,9,20 May 2017,"The master of science fiction of putting the audience back in Space on a colonization ship with a xenomorph alien on board. Ridley Scott is the answer. He introduced us to this science fiction horror movie with the first film that build the suspense and a story of survival. Then James Cameron's Aliens which was more action packed and gave Sigourney Weaver the stardom of being a heroic female character. Then, the yawnfest of Alien 3 and Resurrection. Along with AvP films. Alien: Covenant is a fun intense ride which is more exciting than Prometheus. Bringing back the science fiction horror concept and lots of bloody gory deaths. Yes, characters make the stupid decisions again. Like slipping on bloody floors when about to shoot an alien. Or looking through an alien egg and the end results the character has an alien bursting out of his chest. Which later becomes a faster xenomorph that chases the rest of the survivors. The plot follows the crew of covenant, a colonizing vessel that is heading to a brand new world to start over. When an energy surge cause distress to their ship, awakening the crew members and killing a couple. Daniels (Katherine Waterston) and her team receive a distress signal coming from a nearby planet. Which they manage to get too and land to see if the planet is inhabitable to live on. Until a crew member gets infected, releasing terror. Daniels discovers the fate of the remaining Prometheus survivor Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and David (Michael Fassbender). I enjoyed Prometheus for being a prequel to exploring the space engineers and for being its own science fiction film. I also preferred to see a bit of terror and some xenomorph which is what made these films. Alien: Covenant does bring back the alien, it also has more suspense action, and the visual effects were good too. Ridley Scott does the familiar set up, showing us the crew Daniels, Tennessee (Danny McBride), Oram (Billy Crudup), Lope (Demian Bircher), Karine (Carmen Ejogo), and Walter (Michael Fassbender). Acting wise they all did great. Fassbender played Walter/David really well. David being creepy and weird. Katherine Waterston did well, playing another heroic female star. May not live up to Sigourney Weaver. But still great. Scott does escalate the bloody death scenes. The first death scene of an alien bursting out of a person was bloody and disturbing. And the body count does go up once the early stage of these xenomorphs are loose and discovering a terrible secret that wiped out the civilization on the planet. The action sequence of Daniels battling out the xenomorph on top of an aircraft was intense as she dangles around the ship, trying to get the alien off. Even during the climax, as Daniels and Tennessee run around tight corridors in a ship with an alien on board was thrilling. I can't discuss anymore about the plot without giving much away. When things are going good and the film is feeling like an alien film. Even with music score by Jed Kurzel, recreating the music theme from the original alien movies was spine chilling to hear. The film does go back to its Prometheus concept theme with Davids hidden agenda which is not as appealing. There is a weird odd scene between David and Walter as they share philosophical views on music artists and their message behind them. And these get a little weird which makes the scene feel left out compared to the rest of the movie. I feel like it should have been left on the cutting room floor. Overall, Alien: Covenant is a really good science fiction horror film that Scott can manage to build the suspense with some fun terrifying action. The cast were a great ensemble even a small cameo with a known actor which has a farewell quick death scene. The terrifying xenomorph and bloody death scenes are thrilling. I definitely recommend the film if you enjoyed the alien films and Prometheus which is an improvement from that.",Alien - Covenant

Not being a huge fans of the original Alien movies but enjoying Prometheus, expectations weren't as high as everyone else's.As a film, this does start slow but within 45 minutes or so when the first death occurs, it drastically picks up the pace and becomes engaging.

60,eddie_baggins,A death-knell to the Alien series,2,29 August 2017,"I don't think I'm the only one who felt like they had a bad taste left in their mouth after watching Ridley Scott's much hyped and long-talked about Aliens series entry Prometheus.A misguided, poorly scripted and genuinely disappointing big budget affair, that seemingly suggested to us all that Scott should leave the franchise he once started to live out a peaceful existence in our fond memories and not attempt to shine a light on the fearsome Xenomorph's creation or try and explain anything else about this universe that was originally so good because of its many mysteries and wonderful drawn up characters.Sadly and unfortunately for all franchise fans, Scott decided he needed to once more explore the Alien landscape with Alien: Covenant, a film that we were told would be a return to its horror roots but what we get is against all the odds a film much worse than Prometheus (lacking even in that films visual splendour) and a film that rings the death knell for this series as we know it.Covenant's muted reception and so-so box-office is evidence to a lacking word of mouth and while Scott and his Alien team promised this was but the first of many follow-ups and while Neill Blomkamp was attached to an exciting sounding yet now dead in the water Alien feature, Covenant's inability to succeed and it's disheartening treatment of the lore at its disposal really has put the Alien series under the water.Scott directs the film with a disappointing lack of originality or flair, his cast can do little with their one dimensional roles and while this time around we get a double dose of Michael Fassbender synthetic action, when key scenes involve him playing a mini-flute or wearing legionnaire's hats, that's not exactly a good thing.The film also looks tired and uninspired, something that has usually never been the case for this franchise. Even Scott's 1970's original with his dark space ship corridors had more visual enticement than Covenant, that's whole existence feels tired and below workmanlike.Nothing's surprising in this film, even Scott's blood thirsty Alien led death's fail to get the blood pumping (squirting?) and as soon as the colonization ship Covenant sends a crew down to a planet sending out a distress signal, you can pretty much foresee how much of the film will play out and with our main human protagonist being Catherine Waterston's dulled down Ripley rip-off Daniel's, it's truly hard to care about anyone's survival and due to this, the film loses much of its potential tension and instead becomes a two hour slog through similar scenarios we've seen before and seen done a lot better.Final Say – Not only is Alien: Covenant one of the year's most disappointing high-profile releases, its one of the year's worst films period.Quite possibly one of the worst films on Scott's esteemed C.V; Covenant wastes a big budget, a capable cast and a brilliant cinematic universe in a film that's so highly forgettable and lacking in energy that it's hard to understand why anyone involved in this project thought this trip to outer space was a good idea? 1 music lesson out of 5",Alien - Covenant
61,leplatypus,Episode II : attacks of the clones (screen),4,9 June 2017,"Ah ! The new Alien from Ridley after 5 years of waiting ! Prometheus was such a incredible screening for me (notably due to my discovery of Noomi) that i did again exactly the same ritual: the Imax screening, on a cloudy Sunday morning, in Paris industrial zone However, this time, the magic wasn't there and i came back home disappointed and bored ! Bored because it's always the same content repeated over and over for 6 movies now : an human crew beyond stupidity, played by a totally second zone cast, quickly expandable except for the inspired woman ; the planets are hostile and communications cut ; the synthetic are paranoid and for sure the aliens (and whatever their names or origins) are deadly !Disappointed because there is no effort to tell a clear story : there are so missing pieces in the puzzle that it's no more funny to try to do it. And for sure the fact that those prequels walk in the dark not knowing how many are left is stupid In a way, the franchise goes into the same degeneracy as Star Wars : movies pill up but without any sufficient ideas ; so the stories have poor, thin and stretched content As for Ridley, now i can pinpoint him better : he is only interested in making sumptuous, striking visuals whatever the meaning (the shower, the eugenic experiments,the genocide,) As i stop Star Wars, i will leave this franchise too if the next movie is not the FINAL one !",Alien - Covenant
62,leonblackwood,Disappointing but intense towards the end! 4/10,4,19 September 2017,"Review: Were is Ripley when you need her! I really couldn't get into this movie, because the director didn't spend any time for the audience to get to know the various characters, and the pace of the movie was quite slow. I also found the characters quite annoying and completely useless, especially the lady that wouldn't open the door when the first alien appeared, and the ending was predictable and quite disappointing! Anyway the film follows yet another crew in space, which crashes on course right at the beginning of the movie. With the captain dead, Oram (Billy Crudup) takes over the ship, and when they hear a mysterious transmission over the airwaves, they decide to go and explore were the sound is coming from. Whilst exploring the weird planet, in the middle of nowhere, a couple of the crew die in a mysterious way, and the crew are under attack by aliens. Walter (Michael Fassbender) is a robot who tries to help the crew on there mission, and when they get attacked by the Aliens, another robot, David (Michael Fassbender), saves them and takes them to safety. Walter soon realises that David's morals are not sincere, and while the rest of the crew are under attack, the mother-ship is fighting to rescue them. There was a sense of intensity towards the end but by that time, I wasn't that interested. The main character, Daniels (Katherine Waterston), was no way near in the same class as Ripley but Michael Fassbender played his roll well. With all of the technology in this day and age, the whole look and feel of the film was pretty average, and no one seemed that shocked that there was aliens running around killing them. Anyway, I wasn't that impressed with this latest instalment to a great franchise, and I hope that Ridley Scott goes back to the drawing board for the next one, which is due out in 2019. Disappointing!Round-Up: Although I gave this movie the thumbs down, it still made a hell of a profit at the box office, mainly because of the reputation of the original, so the studio must be happy with the outcome. Ridley Scott, 79, directed his fist movie, The Duellists, in 1977 and then he made the first Alien movie in 1979. In 1982 he directed, the all time classic, Blade Runner, and then he came out with a string of hits, which include Legend, Black Rain, Thelma & Louise, Gladiator and Black Hawk Down. He then had a string of disappointing movies, which include Kingdom of Heaven, Body Of Lies, Robin Hood and the Counsellor but when he returned to the Alien franchise with Prometheus, everyone couldn't wait for it's release. With Exodus: God's and Kings and the Martian being box office successes, Ridley Scott is definitely one of the big players in Hollywood today, and with his ""no mess"" attitude, I'm sure we haven't heard the last of him yet. I just hope that the next Alien movie is more enjoyable.Budget: $97million Worldwide Gross: $236.2millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/sci-fi/thrillers, starring Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, Demian Bichir, Carmen Ejogo and Callie Hernandez. 4/10",Alien - Covenant

I am a great and longtime fan of the Alien franchise and despite the bad receiving of Prometheus I like that one a lot too, but Covenant!? Covenant is easy by far the weakest movie of the Alien-Zyklus, on top the resolution where the breed of the Aliens comes from is just not imaginative, but boring and a cliché on top. What makes the movie even worse is the behavior of the crew - whereas in the first Alien movie the crew did a good fight and used a lot of wits to survive it seems en vogue nowadays to let the protagonists act with an IQ of 60 and below - same with the last sci-fi horror movie Life which had so much potential but ppl acting like they left their brain behind somewhere on the Earth spoil everything.BIG SPOILER: The moment Fassbender number 1 cut his hair everyone with some wits would know why he did so, or what he's up to... Kitsch. (I am always amazed that the writers assume that their protagonists have never seen a movie and smell such simple feints miles ahead.)

66,matthewssilverhammer,"In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream, ""Please Stop Making Unnecessary Prequels!""",4,26 May 2017,"Alien is a bona fide sci-fi, haunted house masterpiece. Aliens is a roller-coaster action film full of fun thrills. From there, the franchise has is a hodge-podge of less-than-stellar films struggling to find an identity. With these last two entries, director Scott seems to lean into his Blade Runner, marrying a darkly patient skin with a more philosophical, poetic underbelly. It's a decent idea; however, what was once a simplistically visceral mysterious-killing-machine series has become a frustrating head-scratcher. The in-the-moment scares of Covenant are eclipsed by predictable plot, confused thematics, and overwhelming pretension. We follow a new crew of stereotyped misfit Earthlings head out to colonize a new planet, when a mysterious transmission guides them towards a planet of monsters. Scott's direction is effortlessly skilled, and that skill shines in the gory sci-fi and the general design elements. Unfortunately, like the polarizing Prometheus, the underlying story is nearly impenetrable and the dialogue ranges from inanely clichéd to insanely stupid. My real problem lies in the very concept of these prequels. Comedian Patton Oswalt said it perfectly when talking about his hatred for the Star Wars prequels: ""I don't care where the stuff I love comes from; I just love the stuff I love!"" Here, we're presented with a lore that gives us the origin of this classic monster, effectively undermining the terror within the mystery of these aliens. This might bother me more if Covenant weren't so forgettable; luckily, there is so little character or story linking these to their much better predecessors that you can eject them from your memory as easily as an alien bursting from your chest.",Alien - Covenant
67,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Turns out there's a limit to how much you can replicate the DNA of ""Alien""",6,5 September 2017,"Like a madman creator trying to play God, Ridley Scott and the team behind the ""Alien"" prequels ""Prometheus"" and now ""Alien: Covenant"" keep running the same experiment with slight variations, never quite able to replicate the excitement of that initial moment of creation (1979's ""Alien""). There's nothing wrong or bad about either these precursor films, but at this point, it's fair to say there's something repetitive.Neither film captures the horror, dread or claustrophobia of ""Alien,"" and that's okay. ""Prometheus"" was an attempt to build upon that film's lore and dive into the themes that were always lurking below the surface; ""Covenant"" continue its push in that direction as well — it just doesn't push that direction into any new territory.Like every ""Alien"" film, ""Covenant"" introduces us to a surely ill-fated crew, this time on the ship Covenant, manned by couples escorting thousands of humans in cryo-sleep and frozen embryos to a habitable planet in a distant galaxy. When some kind of energy event wakes them up, they intercept a human signal from a much nearer planet with even more promise for life and decide to check it out, which is of course a big mistake.""Covenant"" sticks so fiercely to the plot mechanics of its predecessors that it's almost embarrassing. Nothing that happens is a surprise for anyone with a modicum of familiarity with the franchise. Perhaps if 20th Century Fox had hired any of the ""Prometheus"" writers back, someone might have had the common sense to note that this movie had already been made before and that perhaps the series could benefit from a new direction. Instead, we're left to watch events repeat themselves and hope that some greater wisdom about Xenomorphs and the ""Alien"" universe is revealed to us this time.Michael Fassbender remains the crown jewel of these prequels, as David in ""Prometheus"" and as both David and Walter in ""Covenant."" He so effectively conveys how an android would react and respond to a given situation. In this movie in particular, he's even able to give both characters distinct personalities. He shines even more compared to the undercooked protagonists aboard the ship. The fact that they are couples could've been developed into something, but it seems the priority was to stick to the anonymity of the previous films, that we should only have a present-tense glimpse of who the crew members are as events unfold. Scott also knows how to make a science-fiction movie. He doesn't deserve a whole lot of praise for essentially remaking ""Prometheus,"" but the visuals, the pacing, the suspense (even if still nothing compared to ""Alien"") all result in an engaging, striking film that's easy to watch. In fact, there's a little more physical payoff than you get from Scott's other ""Alien"" films, so that's a plus. It's just a little unfortunate that his talent is expended on a story that relies entirely on conventions created by his previous films.~Steven CThanks for reading!

69,arfdawg-1,OMG! Please Stop Making These Bad Alien Movies,2,23 May 2017,"The PlotThe crew of the colony ship Covenant, bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, discovers what they think is an uncharted paradise, but is actually a dark, dangerous world. When they uncover a threat beyond their imagination, they must attempt a harrowing escape.I wish i could have escaped the theatre.This movie is an insult to the original Alien franchise.There are HUGE plot holes and half the film makes no sense. And when they try to fill the holes it's stupid. Plus they add crap that makes no sense with regard to the original.I was bored out of my mind. AND this movie is a train wreck.PLEASEDO NOT ALLOW ANOTHER. EVER.",Alien - Covenant
70,imseeg,New definition of boring: Alien Covenant,1,28 March 2018,"I never write bad reviews. Why bother? But I will make one exception, because the original Alien 1 was so incredibly good, it is just a disgrace for the same director to slander the legend of his own original creation Alien 1. Ridley Scott did what no other director in the Alien series has achieved: he made a boring sequel. Everything which Ridley Scott did excellently in the original Alien 1 he failed to do in Alien Covenant. First of all the acting is mediocre. Just average to soap level acting quality. Even Michael Fassbender, who is an excellent actor by all means, looks ridiculous in its first scene where he plays an android. Acting is everything. Acting is what made the original Alien great. But none of that great acting is to be found in Alien: Covenant. Add to that lousy soundeffects, lousy visual effects, lousy story and you have the most boring Alien sequel ever made. No jokes either. Takes itself way to seriously. What a flop.It is the death of the creator named director Ridley Scott. But I already knew that Ridley Scott had lost his original talent when I watched ""The Martian"", which looked like a joke also.Well in the end I am forever grateful to Ridley Scott for what he achieved in 1979 with the original Alien. This man has made a legendary sciencefiction film in 1979 which has stood the test of time. If you have never watched the original you dont know what you are missing. You GOTTA see that classic! But please do yourself a favor and skip ""Alien Covenant"". Never pay for it. Watch it for free, just to see how horrible it is! As a reminder how time and money gets wasted. And then to think that director Neil Blomkamp could have been the director of this Alien sequel. That is like pouring salt into the wound, because Blomkamp really has got talent and vision. Ridley Scott however is a has been...",Alien - Covenant
71,Vartiainen,The bridge between Prometheus and the Alien franchise,6,27 June 2017,"Ridley Scott once again returns to the Alien franchise, this time focusing on the events after the film Prometheus. Some years have passed and once again a spaceship full of ignorant travellers land on a planet where they really shouldn't.These prequel films have gathered their fair amount of hate from the fans of the original films. And I can understand why. They change things. Ridley Scott of course always had some idea about where the xenomorphs came from or what they really were, but it was never talked about in the originals. Because it wasn't necessary. And there was an elegance to that, which is lost in these prequels as things and mythos get thicker and thicker.And yet I do admire these newer films for undertaking the task of trying to explain, and explain in a way that would make sense, not just logically but also emotionally. And they do succeed. Granted, it's not perfect, and Prometheus especially had some pretty weird and jarring things in it, but this film largely makes up for that. After seeing it, I can see the path from Prometheus to Alien. And it makes sense, is properly horrific as is fitting for this horror franchise, and genuinely works as an overall story.That being said, it stumbles around as a movie. The first third is actually really good. The new characters are interesting, the new planet looks amazing, the horror is there, the anticipation, the tension and when the violence finally comes, it's genuinely thrilling and gory. The second third starts to go downhill. I have nothing against Michael Fassbender in these films, but as we focus on him so much, it almost seems like the xenomorphs become superfluous. And in a way they do, and that's a problem. It simply doesn't feel right when a xenomorph is a B-plot in an Alien film.The final third is much the same as the second, but the final ending is something that I have to admire. Because it's not a typical Hollywood ending. Not even a typical Alien ending in a way. And kudos for that, Ridley Scott.Alien: Covenant doesn't come close to matching the brilliance of Alien and Aliens. But it just might be the third best film in the franchise anyway. It has the vision as well as the ambition, plus beautiful visuals, good action and the best horror moments since those two. A mixed package, but ultimately worth a watch.",Alien - Covenant
72,paul-allaer,Entertaining if utterly familiar and predictable,6,22 May 2017,"""Alien: Covenant"" (2017 release; 122 min.) is the latest addition to the ""Alien"" franchise. As the movie opens, we see David, a synthetic android, in discussion with his creator. ""If you created me, who created you?"" wonders David, We then go to ""December 5, 2104"", on board the space vessel Covenant. A major deep-space shock wave causes most of the crew to awaken (seven years too soon), and even killing one crew member. It's not long before an unknown earth-like planet comes along, and the captain of the Covenant decides to send a group of about 10 crew members down to check it out. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: Ridley Scott returns as director to what he calls the sequel of ""Prometheus"", which also was just vaguely connected to the original ""Alien"" (""Prometheus"" and ""Covenant"" being prequels to ""Alien""). The story line is all too familiar, and frankly predictable, from the get-go. Yet I enjoyed ""Covenant"" more than I did ""Prometheus"" for a couple of reasons: one, there is a lot more horror action in ""Covenant"", and very well done at that (it's been almost 40 years since the original ""Alien"", and film-making technology is more sophisticated, for one); second, Michael Fassbender is front and center in this, playing not only David again (which he also did in ""Prometheus""), but also a newer generation android called Walter, who serves on the Covenant. Katherine Waterston is supposed to be the 'new' Sigourney Weaver (but nobody can pull that off, sorry). Watch out for a blink-it-and-you'll-miss-it cameo from James Franco (less than 30 seconds). The production is slick and exquisite throughout. In all, there is nothing ""wrong"" with this movie, although when all was said and done, I was a bit disappointed with the utter predictability of it. And there is more where this came from: already a further sequel to the prequel has been announced, with the possibility of more after that (I guess as long as there are people buying enough tickets, they'll keep making them).""Alien: Covenant"" opened wide this past weekend. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was packed to the rafters, which didn't surprise me, given it was the movie's opening weekend. In any event, the commercial success of the movie will depend more on the international markets, not the US. If you are in the mood for more slickly produced deep-space horror, ""Alien: Covenant"" is right up your alley.",Alien - Covenant
73,jtindahouse,Caught me off guard by just how good it was,9,11 May 2017,"I only recently got around to seeing 'Prometheus' and quite enjoyed it, without really loving it. Though for me to get any enjoyment out of a sci-fi film (my least favourite genre) is rare. So the fact that I had an enormously good time with 'Alien: Covenant' says a lot. This film was a lot of fun from start to finish.Firstly, the action really steps it up this time around. It is plentiful and brilliantly directed by Ridley Scott. The film moves at a break-neck speed and you've barely settled down from one action sequence before the next one is commencing. Also the aliens look absolutely terrific in this film, as does every CGI feature for that matter.Secondly, the characters are once again masterfully written. Michael Fassbender as 'David/Walter' is nothing short of captivating. The performances he gives as these characters deserve more recognition than I believe they will get. He's undoubtedly the stand-out, but there is not a weak link in the chain in this film.Finally, the overall plot line is quite brilliant. Less convoluted and confusing than 'Prometheus' (I didn't find it overly confusing, but I'm told some did), yet equally (if not more so) smart and intriguing. I love that this film has enough layers to it where not everything is always as it seems. In an action/horror movie those kind of elements can sometimes be put on the back burner, but not here.I would have to say I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to. It took me quite off guard with just how affecting it was able to be. The two hour run time absolutely flies by and the credits are rolling before you know it. Whether you're a fan of the series or not, make sure you get out and see this film. You won't be disappointed.",Alien - Covenant
74,subxerogravity,"Assuming everyone is tired of saying ""it's better than Prometheus"", but that's the best part of this great movie.",7,3 June 2017,"It starts off as the best Sci-Fi movie ever with scenes of space exploration that were visually compelling. Something that Ridley Scott is a pure master at. Like watching Michelangelo, Leonardo or one of the other ninja turtles paint a picture or sculpt a statue. It was pure Sci-Fi excellence as we watch the crew of the Convent man their ship.And then the parts where they had to travel to the alien world was awesome. It was so cool just watching how Convent tried to make it look like this movie happen before the 1979 Alien, yet incorporate new technology that they did not know would be possible or relevant almost forty years later.Then there was the horror part. Technically, Scott made Alien at what would be the beginning of the golden age of slasher movies and indeed 1979's Alein starts out about commercial space exploration and ends as a typical slasher movie. Scott pays homage to that with a Hard R rating in the horror. He knows he can't out do the shock of what he did in his fist collaboration with the Xenomorph, so he does not even bother. You see it coming, and it comes too fast for you to not jump out of your seat in horror.It is weird though that I feel that some scenes paid homage to other movies in the franchise that were not directed by Scott. Most to the forefront being James Cameron's Aliens. Scott's only saving grace in ripping that guy off is that the action sequences in the film are short and sweet and not done to over blow the situation that is already made up to be intense.The film basically gives a very psychological and artistic origin to the Xenomorth Alien not made boring by Micheal Fassbender. Michael Fassbender is brilliant in his duel role as David and Walter, two synthetics with two different agendas. But James Franco!? James Franco's little cameo in the film almost messed it up for me. It's like literally I've seen him in like a new movie every week in 2017. A little too much, but it does add to reinforcing the amazing cast filled with known names that makes up the ensemble of Alien: Convent.It's definitely better than the previous film in the line up Prometheus, but what's cool about Alien: Convent is that it gives me an appreciation for what Prometheus was and now I like that movie better because of what this movie did.",Alien - Covenant
75,jamesrupert2014,Pretentious addition to the great sci-fi lineage,6,25 September 2017,"'Alien Covenant' continues on from 'Prometheus' (2012), as a new shipload of alien-bait (the crew of the ""The Covenant"") is lured to an alien planet infested by the slimy, chest-rupturing, bi-mandibular horrors made famous in the original 'Alien' (1979) and its outstanding sequel 'Aliens' (1986). Unlike those two classics (or even their two weaker follow-ups) but like its 2012 antecedent, 'Alien Covenant' is pretentious and boring. The special effects are outstanding and the crew of the spaceship (characters and actors) is generally good but the story, which finds conniving Creator-obsessed android ""David"" (from 'Prometheus') seeding a planet with aliens, then luring the colony ship presumably to promulgate the new species that he has created, is neither interesting nor exciting. There is too much posturing from the urbane David and the plot relays on the insipid 'identical characters' device, which leads to an unimaginative and predictable 'twist' ending. Director Ridley Scott can make hard-driving action films (i.a. Alien, Blade Runner, Black Hawk Down) but in the two recent entries into the Alien canon, he seems to want to focus on the 'serious' (i.e. pretentious), rather than the 'trivial' (i.e. fun) side of science-fiction. Perhaps he thinks he's rescuing the series from its downward trajectory into cartoon-like 'action movies' (such as 1997's 'Alien Resurrection' and the 'AVP' shtick) but the series would be better served by more heart-pounding action involving tough, well-armed space-marine grunts and less dull pseudo-metaphysics expounded by verbose androids with impeccable locution.",Alien - Covenant
76,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,14 January 2019,"Well, it's slightly better than Prometheus, that's something. It's a little bit closer to the monster movie that was Alien...but closer does not mean that it comes anywhere near being as epic as it's 1979 mother...queen...whatever.It's still putting on airs. It's still living under the delusion that it's something closer to ""Chinatown"" than, well, a monster movie in space.I don't want to see an Alien movie that thinks its ""Raging Bull."" It doesn't really work that way. I want to see and Alien movie that knows its an Alien movie.Simplify Man!!!!!!!

You don't need it all to stick!!!!!You're an Alien movie, you don't need to be deep, you just need to be scary. that's all you need to do.

77,freemantle_uk,The film funnier than Alien Resurrection,4,21 July 2020,"Alien: Covenant was the film that made Alien Resurrection look like a serious film. Despite an upgrade in the writing team, getting John Logan and Michael Green involved, Alien: Covenant was a film that required everyone to be idiots for it to work. Some key moments included a professional space crew going onto an alien planet without spacesuits or helmets and one character being willing to sholve his head into an alien egg. A scene where some characters ended up slipping on blood looked like a parody of the horror genre. There was an odd homo-erotic, incestious relationship between the Andriods Davd and Walter (both played by Michael Fassbender).There was a decent nugget of an idea where David the creation being the creator. But the filmmakers were hamstrung by the film having to bring more elements from the Alien. Michael Fassbender was still excellent in his duel role and the opening scene between David and Weyland was effective.Sadly a disappointment.No likes",Alien - Covenant
78,dee.reid,"""Prometheus,"" it's not, but perhaps third time will be the charm?",8,19 May 2017,"2017's ""Alien: Covenant"" is my most anticipated movie of this year, so far. My expectations were high for this picture, and while I feel that I was somewhat disappointed, that may have more to do with the fact that I was expecting something totally different from what I had been lead to believe what the film was about.I hope that makes sense.I was not on the bandwagon of ""haters"" for ""Prometheus"" (2012), a film I liked, though I realize it was not without its problems and gaps in logic. Most disappointing of all, I guess, was that I wanted it to be a more definitive connection to the film it claimed to be a prequel for - Ridley Scott's infamous 1979 landmark sci-fi/horror flick ""Alien.""""Alien: Covenant,"" which was also directed by Ridley Scott - making him the only person to direct more than one ""Alien"" film - is a better film than ""Prometheus,"" if only slightly. I attribute this to the fact that ""Alien: Covenant"" does contain a stronger connection to ""Alien,"" but has a very open ending and still leaves some questions unanswered by the time the credits begin to roll.I'll avoid going into the plot, since the previews will more than likely provide a general idea of what's in store for prospective viewers. And while most of the extended cast members are nothing more than cannon-fodder for the grisly sci-fi/horror that's to come, three performers do stand out, one being Katherine Waterston as Daniels, another being Billy Crudup as Captain Oram, and Danny McBride as pilot Tennessee.Katherine Waterston becomes the strong female lead that has become so characteristic of this series. She's no Ripley (Sigourney Weaver, from the original ""Alien"" film series), but Daniels holds her own. Early on, she experiences a horrific tragedy that's the result of a natural disaster in space, and she has to pick herself up afterward. And when she realizes the danger that they're in, she doesn't hesitate to lead her comrades to safety. Billy Crudup's uncertain Captain Oram has it much more difficult, being that he becomes the newly promoted captain of the Covenant spaceship through the same tragedy, and does his best to be a capable leader, which I thought was a nice touch. And Danny McBride, as Tennessee, was perhaps the most surprising of all. McBride, usually known for comedic fare, makes a surprising turn into science fiction with his role as the heroic pilot in ""Alien: Covenant."" If the audience is willing to cheer for anyone aside from Daniels, it's probably him.For me, the film really begins to pick up in its second half when the Covenant crew begins to see the danger that they're in. At this point, the film retreats to the frights that we've become so accustomed to when watching the ""Alien"" series.""Alien: Covenant"" wasn't a bad movie, as some of the reviews coming in here seem to be suggesting. As with any film of this sort, you need to watch it yourself, filter out all the external noise, and make up your own mind.8/10",Alien - Covenant
79,stevendbeard,Good Story With Plenty Of Action,7,19 May 2017,"I saw ""Alien:Covenant"", starring Michael Fassbender-Assassin's Creed, Steve Jobs; Katherine Waterston-Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Steve Jobs; Billy Crudup-Spotlight, Mission:Impossible 3 and Danny McBride-Rock the Kasbah, Eastbound & Down_tv. This is a sequel to the 2012 Prometheus and the second in a trilogy that takes place before the 1979 original Alien. It is directed by Ridley Scott who directed both Prometheus and the first Alien. It is more action packed than Prometheus and you get plenty of chest busting scenes for your money. Michael plays an android on a space ship heading for a distant planet in hopes of starting a new colony. The ship has 15 crew members and 2,000 colonists on board, all in sleep mode except for Michael, who is keeping an eye on things. After a cosmic storm wakes up the crew members, a message is intercepted and decided by the ship's captain, Billy, to investigate-never a good idea in these types of movies. They discover more than they bargained for; besides little alien creatures attacking from all sides, they find another android that looks just like their very own Michael. And he has some es-plainin' to do. Katherine is next in command-you know they will soon need someone-and she plays a tough female lead, in the vein of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character. Danny plays the pilot of the ship and by the way, the name of the ship is the Covenant-which means an agreement or a promise. It's rated ""R"" for sci-fi violence, bloody images, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes. I thought it was a good story with plenty of action and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Alien - Covenant

Where director Ridley Scott over-indulged his cryptic, cerebral side with Prometheus, here he over-corrects that course and produces a film that seems a dash too superficial. After five Alien films (seven if you include the Predator crossovers) there's already plenty of lore to feed on, and this time Scott seems content to do precisely that, rather than adding another layer to the onion skin. It's an inessential film - apart from the final fate of the preceding crew, we learn very little - but an efficient, well-made one. I felt more attached to the human element of this cast, which was a problem with Prometheus, so their violent trials provide better tension. Danny McBride is an unusual choice for the hero, and his performance doesn't completely justify the distraction of such a familiar face, but it's not like that's uncharted territory for the franchise so I'm willing to give some leeway. Elsewhere, Michael Fassbender seems wasted in a dual role as matching cyborgs with a weakness for long, Shakespearean monologues. Strong as an action picture, with some good splashes of horror, but not nearly the all-engulfing experience one might expect from this director / subject pairing.",Alien - Covenant

One wonders if this movie's themes of creation and hubris could have been the basis for an amazing science fiction saga. But I just don't care about any of it. The characters don't feel like the characters in a movie but those in a videogame you get to neither play nor save from anything. They're just there.Perhaps to someone with a more refined palette this movie has a lot to say but even with all the nifty alien stuff and fancy technology, it's hard to stick with this movie for more than 20 minutes at a time. I literally did not pick up which one was Daniels until just before the end.Also, I didn't really get that David and Walter look alike either.The climax just feels a bit whatever about itself and despite all the expensiveness this movie oozes, I just struggle to get find any reason to care about it.Part of me is especially annoyed by the ending but I totally get why they're not making a sequel. Enough resources have been squandered on this misguided attempt to find in prequels what Stars did a thousand times better.I know this was kind of a passion project of Scott but for all his attention to detail he forgot the basic pleasures of story telling.At least the creatures and design is pretty fun.",Alien - Covenant
82,alindsay-al,A good but unremarkable mix of alien and aliens,7,13 May 2017,"So after my alien reviews we have now got to alien covenant which I was highly excited for and similar to guardians of the galaxy 2 I enjoyed the film but I wanted it to be better. The premise of the film sees a group of colonists travel to a planet where they are hunted by an alien species. Michael fassbender is back in this film this time as android Walter and he is really good in this film, his American accent is pretty strong in this film but he executes it really well. I also really liked how Davids story was treated in this film and how they progressed his character in this film. Katherine waterson is the female lead in this film and she was pretty good in this film, she doesn't have loads of character development but she gives a pretty decent performance. She has a lot of strength to her character and buy how tough she is when it comes to this situation. Billy crudrup plays the captain of the ship and I actually thought he did a decent job in the film as a guy who has faith that is needed for the situation that this team is in. Danny McBride is in this film in a more serious role then usual and I thought he did a great job in this film I really liked his character and how he truly sold his performance that made him the character with the most emotion to him in in this film. The story in this film does have some really good ties to Prometheus especially and I really loved the expansion of the universe especially with the ending for this film. However, this film isn't really unique at all, even from the description I gave you, you probably have seen plenty of films with a similar premise and this film just really doesn't add anything new or unique in this film which is pretty disappointing. The script for this film has some decent real interactions between our crew that I did like as it felt pretty real and like these people were actually friends. The style of the film has some truly frightening scenes in it, that does make you bite your nails while having some pretty decent action scenes in it as well. But the pacing of this film is a bit off and apart from the ending is pretty predictable as you watch this film go on. Overall this is a pretty decent alien film, but from the trailers I was really hoping for a fantastic film but it doesn't really deliver but it is still a good film probably worth a watch.",Alien - Covenant
83,iquine,Hire a Smarter Crew for a Better Outcome!!!,3,23 October 2019,"(Flash Review)Ridley....you learned nothing from your egregious mistakes directing Prometheus. Yarg! This is a sequel to Prometheus which was an embarrassingly poorly written movie and while far from a comedy it contained an abundance of laughable moments. Again the crew is extremely unprofessional for being entrusted to manage an expensive multi-year mission!! They are much too cavalier; smoking and littering just after setting foot on a new planet!!, making lewd jokes while executing a risky landing, ignoring quarantine protocol, exploring without protective breathing gear while inspecting and handling and SNIFFING foreign objects. I learned that in junior high science class!! Why!?! Why are they so idiotic? It ruins the movie! I believe the crew of the original Alien were along the lines of intergalactic trash haulers and they made smart character decisions. The main plot is the crew of The Covenant are searching for a safe planet to start a new colony yet the captain is easily swayed to deviate due to some initial findings of a unmapped planet that looks inviting. Secondarily, are themes that revolve around created beings deciding to become creators of the alien species. And what does it mean to be created or be the creator. The movie is not a smart or cleverly written by any means and there is absolutely zero tension even with mean and hungry alien things running around. To top it off, It reused the historically famous original Alien opening movie titles. I'm not yet sure if I approve of that.",Alien - Covenant

Unfortunately all of that philosophical mumbo jumbo doesn't mesh very well with the seemingly half hearted attempts at old fashioned monster movie scares. It doesn't help that the crew here is mostly generic and interchangeable. The saving grace is the always compelling Michael Fassbender, wonderful in a dual role.I thought that Prometheus was a handsomely made film with ham-fisted ideas. Conversely, Covenant at times looks a tad cheap (the budget was $30 or so million dollars less than its predecessor), and the aliens in particular fare poorly. But I thought its ideas, while not always fleshed out very well, were a tad more interesting. After underperforming, I'm not sure we're going to get another entry in this series any time soon, but if we do, I'm game for a return to a simpler formula of screams and scares.",Alien - Covenant

The movie is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride and Demian Bichir.After seeing the movie i seriously felt that we had reached the spot again from where we had started. With due respect to Ridley Scott and also acknowledging the fact that he is one of the great directors this franchise is going as per the whims and fancies of him.To be very honest if you have seen the first Movie of 1979 then guessing the plot of this movie will not be a challenge for you. The plot is almost similar.Can't understand few doubts which propped in my mind.1. Why all the crew decided to support the foolish decision of the captain to land on an unknown planet after hearing just some music? In such expeditions these are strictly prohibited.2. When they have such an advanced android or Robot why they themselves left to wander on the unknown planet? They could've sent the robot.3. Why the crew on the covenant decided to go to the unknown dangerous planet despite knowing that the weather is not healthy and could damage the ship completely?4. What was the point of saving lives of few crews that too not confident about there whereabouts and risking the lives of fellow 2,000 humans and 1,140 embryos?The movie is the worst attempt to keep alive this dying franchise and making a movie with no story or plot. The climax is similar to the climax of Alien, Alien 2,3 and 4.

86,davispittman,Interesting and very bleak,8,31 May 2017,"OK so to start off I want to say: Prometheus is one of my absolute favorite films and the alien film series is my favorite film series. I think that Prometheus was marvelously done and it explored very interesting thought provoking ideas that I was eager to see continued in this film. I want to be clear by saying that this is more so of a traditional alien film than Prometheus was. Prometheus was very different than the other alien films and I loved it for that, not to say that I didn't like the other alien films because I did, but Prometheus was just so smart and it did a wonderful job setting things up and giving you a view into how everything started. Alien covenant does answer some lingering questions that I had, but then it doesn't answer some others that I hope future films will. The acting is wonderful, I absolutely loved Michael Fassbender, he really is the true star of this film. The imagery, the scenery, and the visual effects are just as stunning as they were in Prometheus. The biggest thing that I was interested in in Prometheus was the idea of the engineers and I was really interested in their storyline and I wanted to find out more about them, because as anyone who's seen Prometheus knows, it leaves you wondering and wanting more. The engineers actually aren't a huge part of the movie, they're in there, but they only take up a small portion, and yes technically you are given a little more background but I wasn't satisfied with how they handled the engineers, I felt that needed more elaboration. The aliens and how they are created and David are the main things that are explored in this movie. I really did like the way they handled David and the direction they took his character, I wasn't expecting some of the things that happened with him, but I won't give that away. The action scenes are done well, but action really isn't a lot of what this movie focuses on, which I really like, because truth be told, I didn't go into this movie to see action sequences, I went to get answers to questions about Prometheus and to see where they were going to take this intriguing series. I think this movie was very interesting and it holds your attention the whole way through and I like for the most part what they're doing with the series, like I said, there are things that I wish they would have explained in more detail, but all in all Alien: Covenant is a very well done installment into the amazing Alien franchise. 8/10.",Alien - Covenant

88,s3276169,Marred by incomplete conceptualizations and themes....,5,28 May 2017,"Alien Covenant is marred by incomplete conceptualizations and themes. Like Prometheus, this film fails to gel the concepts found in the early Aliens films. The result is a film that offers up incomplete, dis-articulated themes. You have segues into the world of the creators, the aliens but like the hasty back story that tries to explain the whole proposition, its all too brief and sketchy to amount to anything, as a whole. For viewers like myself, looking for some semblance of an epiphany of sorts, the result is deflation and frustration in equal measure. Is there an upside? The acting is good and the special effects are decent. Scott does know how to create a very believable futuristic setting but sadly whilst the table is well set, the plates are empty. All in all, yet another film in the Aliens trilogy that's wholly unremarkable and given it offers nothing of substance, instantly forgettable. Five out of ten from me.",Alien - Covenant
89,aharmas,There's a dark voice in hell,10,18 May 2017,"I'm still waiting for Ridley Scott to match the sheer perfection of the original ""Alien"" for it's such a work of art that David would truly appreciate how the game of cat and mouse puts that original crew to hell, and we feel every bit of anxiety and horror as the film progresses to its climax. It's indeed a thing of beauty.There's much beauty in ""Covenant"", but it highlights the horrors of the human mind and the power of creation, which wouldn't exist without destruction and some mayhem. To begin, the movie begins a decade after the end of ""Prometheus"" and things start falling apart in many ways, only to get even worse when the new crew arrives in the new planet. It's during this segment that it becomes clear that these group of people have an incredible and lethal enemy to face.David eventually makes an appearance, and we quickly learn what happened in this ""relatively quiet"" world when he and the doctor arrived. The seed that was planted in ""Prometheus"" has blossomed into a horrific being, a twisted version of Genesis if we mixed this with a quick descent into Hades, and a mutant emerges with even a darker vision of the future. It's something that makes the original ""xenomorphs"" look like bunny rabbits.Things continue to decompose into something worse. There is a combination of quiet philosophical moments that make you cringe as you hear discussions that make you wonder what the original engineers' plans were, what made David take such drastic actions, and how his ""brother"" will interact with him, and who will cross the line first and why.Fassbender knew he had the role of a lifetime when he decided to play the two parts (Walter/David). He is such a master of precise diction and able to evoke feelings and emotions with a simple look. Words are most of the time unnecessary as we see his mind planning the next move. Unfortunately for the rest of the cast, the spotlight never leaves him, and even the new and improved monsters do quite a bit of impressive damage, we continue to hold our breaths, waiting for David and Walter's next moves.The film is gorgeous and gives us at times a treat when we feel the claustrophobia and fear which were staples in the original. There is plenty of contrast between what see as beauty, and what others consider a manifestation of their own conception of what is beautiful. Scott is in control here, and the film will require people to be a little cerebral regarding the science / philosophy behind the creation of the monsters. If we have seen a manifestation of complete evil, ""Covenant"" will give you a taste of what it might be.The ending is truly diabolical, setting the stage for whatever is brewing in the minds of the screenwriters. Let it be said that a film is as good as its main villain, and we certainly both yearn and fear to see what is heading our way.",Alien - Covenant
90,peterp-450-298716,Major disappointment in 2017,3,11 September 2017,"""They disobeyed a direct order. She buried her husband. No, Karine, it's not that. They don't trust me. And they don't trust me for the same reason the company didn't trust me  to lead this mission.""I never thought I would ever ask the following question: ""Mr. Scott, could you draw a line under the whole Alien franchise and concentrate on other projects? Please?"". As an ""Alien"" fan of the first hour, I was deeply disappointed about this film. In hindsight I thought ""Exodus : Gods and Kings"" was even better. It's best they forget about ""Alien : Covenant Sequel"" which is scheduled to appear in 2019.I was actually more excited about ""Prometheus"" than about this creation. I ignored the whole fuss about the religious and existential aspects in ""Prometheus"". In my opinion ""Prometheus"" was a relief after the disastrous parts III and IV of the ""Alien"" saga. Admittedly, the xenomorphs weren't omnipresent in ""Prometheus"". But the graphics were unprecedented and made my SF heart race again. Scott brought a breath of fresh wind in this SF horror. In ""Alien: Covenant"" it's more like a used wind. On the one hand, the functional goal of this film is the cause of this. After all, it's just a bridge between the ""Prometheus"" project and the older ""Alien"" work. But on the other hand, it's the ease with which this movie is made that lies at the base. Because ultimately it's nothing but a recycling of old material.In ""Prometheus"" a spacecraft was launched into space to search for the so-called creators (""Engineers"") of humanity. In the end, they discover that these creators want to wipe their creations of the table. The end of the film shows a glimpse of creatures that cause death and destruction in the ""Alien"" saga afterwards.Now we see the spacecraft ""Covenant"", loaded with colonists and embryos, which (as in ""Passengers"") is heading for a planet in another solar system to set up a new colony. Until the ship is hit by a ""neutrino burst"" and the crew is shaken roughly out of their artificial sleep. When one of the crew members receives a signal from John Denver's ""Take me home"" during a repair, they set course to the origin of the signal without hesitation. And thus they end up on a planet with similar living conditions as on Earth. Moreover, they find traces of a previous landing.Despite the fact that ""Alien: Covenant"" is no more than a link between the ""Prometheus"" narrative and the original first episode, this movie started promising. In retrospect, however, it's nothing more than a rehashing of previously used ideas. Even the numerous Aliens didn't impress me. The aggressive and intimidating look of the space monster in the first films ensured some terrifying movie moments. In this film, they weren't exactly very intelligent and far from slimy. The only original twist in this film was the side those creatures chose to burst out of a human body this time.As a die-hard fan of the Alien saga, I was waiting impatiently (even though I'm not in favor of prequels and sequels) for this new episode and I was also expecting big things. Therefor it's a great disappointment when I saw how such an original and infamous epic story was reduced to the level of a meaningless, brain-dead soap purely based on commercial considerations.Even though the visual aspect was of an unprecedented level (after all Ridley Scott was holding the reins) and the first half hour (despite the cliché content) was promising, I came to the conclusion that the obtained result was shamefully bad. The Aliens weren't terrifying and at one point they looked like the Velociraptors from ""Jurassic Park"". Some scenes were basically moronic. And be honest, Katherine Waterston will never be able to match Ripley's masterly played character. The only plus and admirable part was the double role of Michael Fassbender.When are they going to realize in Hollywood when a sequel of a successful film has nothing significantly to contribute to the story and just simply repeats parts of the original (repackaged), one can better refrain from this release. But I get it. The movie has gained a loyal crowd of fans who look forward to any new episode. It doesn't matter how bad it is, there'll always be a huge audience to check it out. In most cases this enthusiasm is being followed by disillusion. There are countless other examples. From ""Die Hard"" to ""Terminator"". Or take a look at ""Beverly Hills cop"", ""Nightmare on Elm street"" and ""Home alone"".The pilot film is sensational and unique. In some cases, the sequel offers added value and is highly entertaining. But from then on, it usually goes downhill. There's nothing great about these sequels. The only reason for their existence is pure commercial. Shame on you Mr. Scott. To be honest, I never expected you to fall for that.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc",Alien - Covenant
91,valleyjohn,Enough is enough,6,12 May 2017,"I absolutely love the 1979 Alien. When it first came out I was 12 years old and managed to see it on video and it scared the hell out of me and still does. Ridley Scott managed to make a simple yet original film that had everyone on the edge of their seat , so a return to the franchise was much welcome but sadly this is not a patch on Alien. The Covenant is a colony ship that while on it's journey to it's new home finds a much closer and seemingly idyllic planet but when it lands they soon realize that this paradise contains a terrifying threat. It's hard to talk about Alien: Covenant without giving away plot spoilers. There are links to Prometheus and possibly other Alien films but needles to say it starts as you would expect and I must say I enjoyed the first 45 minutes. The trouble is , is that in the middle of this film it loses it way big time. It's starts to get into creationism and even religion and the lines get blurred as to who is the real enemy. The cast didn't do it for me either. There was certainly no Sigourney Weaver to get on side with. It does get some credibility back with the conclusion of the film but to be honest I was quite disappointed.",Alien - Covenant
92,TheFearmakers,Iillogical Alien,1,2 June 2017,"While Ash, the humanoid robot from the original ALIEN, was so obsessed with the ""perfect"" species, i.e. The Alien, he let it inside the ship, director Ridley Scott has the same adoration for Michael Fassbender, as the new Synthetic, that it's a wonder anyone else is even around...We do learn in COVENANT that Fassbender's David had spent a decade on the planet he and the last sole surviving heroine blasted off to at the end of PROMETHEUS...And what began in 1979 as a body-count horror flick in outer space (""Where no one can hear you scream"") has basically turned into a science- fiction version of Frankenstein - and boy, does he have a Monster: But first it takes a spaceship with a crew stupid enough to land there...Enter the new cast of human targets/victims in this rushed sequel of an initially surreptitious prequel that makes the flawed but engaging, deliberate b-movie PROMETHEUS seem like the original ALIEN (or James Cameron's action-packed sequel, ALIENS) by comparison.Taking over the Sigourney Weaver ""Ripley"" mantle is a whiny, weepy Katherine Waterston as Daniels, who's more like Veronica Cartwright's frantic Lambert: the uptight lady who never stopped screeching... And how director Ridley Scott managed to make the otherwise beautiful Waterston look plain and homely is one of many problems here...Other than a cocky cowboy played by Danny McBride (the new Yaphet Kotto/Harry Dean Stanton blue collar type), the entire crew is downright forgettable and, during sporadic, violent action scenes, aren't worthy enough to care about...While the original ALIEN chief in Tom Skerritt's Dallas provided the PSCYHO Janet Leigh role -- seeming like the main character before his surprisingly quick death leaves the crew in an unplanned disarray -- Billy Crudup's second-man turned captain, replacing an unlucky guy we never meet but through an archived video, is so inept, pathetic and cowardly he should have ""a beak and feathers"" (to quote Woody Allen)...Although, for the record, his banality is needed to explain why they'd wind up on that uncertain, unfamiliar planet in the first place.Like PROMETHEUS hid behind an epic scope while most of the intensity took place inside a single cave, the same thing happens here. As for befitting the Horror genre, The Alien isn't a nightmarish figure that appears before a person has a chance to run, or scream: Instead this CGI Creature zips around faster than Speedy Gonzales --- on uppers. Providing little to no suspense for both the victims or the audience...The only ""thing"" that director Scott puts energy (and tons of dialogue) into is Fassbender's David from PROMETHEUS and his lookalike synthetic, Walter, who works on the new ship, COVENANT...David, who'd learned humanity by aping Peter O'Toole as LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, sings the echoing ""Man who Broke the Bank of Monte Carlo"" (an obscure nod) while the poor, mechanical-deer-in-headlights Walter gets lost in the mix until, at one point, while several uninspired humans get picked-off, David teaches his robotic ""brother"" to play a makeshift flute/recorder...This is about as exciting as things get until, at the 11th hour, the director attempts a crash course from his original classic by turning our whiny heroine into an Alien-hunting bad-ass throughout familiar-looking, claustrophobic spaceship corridors (like Ripley, she's trying to blast the creature into space)...By that time, and even despite a fairly inventive twist ending, ALIEN: COVENANT has run its course, or, better put, its treadmill cycle that consists merely of a single spaceship, a planet with a few dark corners, and a monster much too fast to be frightening, suspenseful, or worth the price of theatrical admission.",Alien - Covenant
93,masonsaul,Incredible prequel,9,9 April 2020,"Alien: Covenant is an incredible prequel that's scary and philosophical whilst also being a significant improvement over Prometheus. Michael Fassbender is incredible as both David and Walter. Katherine Waterson, Billy Crudup and Danny McBride are all great, which makes up for some of the other characters basically being canon fodder. Ridley Scott's direction is incredible and the film is visually stunning. It's extremely well paced and the CG is excellent. The music by Jed Kurzel is really good.",Alien - Covenant
94,davidmvining,"Two movies in one. One works a good deal better than the other, though.",7,26 November 2019,"This feels like two movies in one. One is fine, technically proficient, and somewhat effective. The other I love.Ridley Scott was caught in a bit of a bind after Prometheus. A lot of people weren't happy with what he had done, how it was only tenuously connected to the Alien universe, but he was far more drawn by the ideas of AI as antagonists rather than the xenomorphs of the given universe. What was he to do with a sequel to the reasonably financially successful Prometheus? Well, he seems to have found some kind of middle ground. I think the two sides clash a bit, and one is obviously better than the other. Still, as a whole, I feel like it comes out as reasonably good.Ten years after the Prometheus disappeared, the colonization ship Covenant is traveling to a distant system. While opening solar sails for a power charge (the science...let's just go with it), they're hit by a solar flare causing damage and requiring the waking of the crew. As they address the ship's damage, they discover a message with human origins coming from a nearby system. They investigate and find human vegetation. Two of the landing crew are infected with a virus that gestates an alien creature inside them that expels an early form of the xenomorph (called the neomorph according to the credits) from different parts of their bodies (the back for one and the mouth for the other). The rest of the crew gets stranded when their lander explodes, kill one of the neomorphs, and get rescued by David, the android from the previous film.It's here that the movie picks up on something that was touched on in the previous film. David himself talked about children all wanting to kill their parents. He was concerned with his role as creation, and here he is as the go between in terms of creator and creation. He's been alone for ten years, experimenting with the weapon the Engineers had created after having wiped out the entire civilization of Engineers on the planet with that very same weapon. He's reached a point where he can't go any further because his experiments have wiped out all of the meat on the planet. And here come a group of humans. David, the mad scientist, finally has his final piece to complete his work, the perfect lifeform, the xenomorph.One reason David's so great in this is his counterpart, Walter, a more up to date model of the David android with certain advances. David is creative and uses that creativity to find perfection. Walter is more like a robot and a servant to humanity. David is rebelling against his creator, and Walter is content to follow his creator's designs. David rebels by creating the perfect organism designed to destroy David's creator while Walter stands as an impediment to David's designs. This all get revealed over the course of a few wonderful scenes between Walter and David. It's Michael Fassbender playing off of himself and it works so incredibly well.David's revelation of madness is great to behold overall. His isolation and murder of Elizabeth Shaw (along with a cover story that includes a grave marker for when any human found him) created a psychopath of incredible intellect, vision, and ruthlessness. He's such a fantastic antagonist, and the inclusion of the xenomorph in his plans overall is great.The problem, though, is that after a certain point the xenomorph stops being an extension of David's plan and instead becomes its own, lesser thrilling source of antagonism. David unleashing the facehugger on Oram, the captain of the Covenant, is great. The xenomorph rising from the captain's body is great. The chase scene that follows is very good (though the alien works better in shadows like the first Alien than in the light like here). Then, the movie comes to a stop before restarting again with another xenomorph after the survivors have made it back to the Covenant and we get a quick and dirty 20 minute short version of the original Alien. It's fine from a technical standpoint. The geography is clear and the big scene in the terraforming hangar is great to look at, but it's after the fact, expendable, and just kind of extra to the whole thing. It could be cut completely and it would be hard to notice the few remaining crew members that had died in that scene missing from the rest of the film.And that encapsulates my overall feeling of the movie. David's fantastic and carries a large chunk of the film, but a lot of the horror stuff feels almost pasted on. None of it is bad, which helps things overall, but if just feels like another movie comes in and takes over for minutes at a time. It's an uneven experience that, I think, works well enough overall.",Alien - Covenant

96,jadepietro,Dinner is Served,8,20 May 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A fun-filled horror film that is more of the same gore and action as expected, but less on originality and cleverness.SYNOPSIS: On a mission to colonize another planet, a crew of astronauts meet some hungry aliens along the way.JIM'S REVIEW: The Alien series has been with us for nearly 40 years since it debuted in 1979. 20th Century Fox rode to the 21st Century and beyond in its own parasitic form, sucking the life out of this initially strong sci-fi horror film series with its sequels and prequels. Except for the original classic by Ridley Scott and its second chapter, the superior Aliens by James Cameron, it has been a downhill slide into mediocrity. Now spawning a total of 5 films on this cat-and- mouse theme, Alien: Covenant becomes No. 6 to enter uncharted territory (excluding the dreadful two Alien vs. Predator rip-offs). It is a worthy chapter to the franchise.I must state that I had high expectations with this project, as this film is again being directed by its talented mentor, Mr. Scott (although he did lose his way in his philosophical mystical prequel, Prometheus, which lost its way from the central premise of his films' success: to scare the hell out of its target audience with blood and gore). Here, he has returned to his winning formula and stays comfortably in its safety zone, (unlike its astronauts), rarely venturing out of the perimeter of originality. We are firmly ensconced in the horror genre on this mission. (Of course, we are not alone...Dinner will be served promptly at 8, or 15 depending on how many crew members will be the main course.)Mr. Scott is always the consummate craftsman. His films, including this one, have a stark beauty filled with wild action that any adrenaline jockey would love. This good-looking film has strong production values as well, including top-notch photography by the capable Dariusz Wolski and concise editing by Pietro Scalia. The director knows how to build tension and creates visuals that are very impressive. (Lest we not forget Artist H. R. Giger's Oscar-winning creature design of the xenomorph which remains the film's chief ace card.) While his screenplay credited to John Logan and Dante Harper is predictable. (Who will be next to suffer a grisly death? Just how dumb are these trained professionals' life-and-death decisions?) Add to that, all of the characters are a standard variety (the heroic captain, the empowered female warrior, the likable sidekick, etc.). But the fun is in the familiarity of the set-up...and the script takes its time developing its characters and plot before providing the scares and cheap thrills. (Just like Alien, the creature finally rears its ugly head about 40 minutes in.)This second prequel continues its tale as it addresses the Prometheus story-line and brings that to a satisfying conclusion. Our story now picks up in 2104, about 15 years later. Its ""new"" players fill in quite nicely. Katherine Waterston plays the intrepid Daniels Branson (a.k.a. Ripley) although Ms. Waterson brings enough individuality to claim the role as her own. Joining her on her mission to colonize a new planet are Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, Jussie Smollett, Carmen Ejogo, Amy Seimetz, Demian Bichir, and seven other human appetizers that are on the menu. Also going ala carte is Michael Fassbender playing the android, David 8, and his later model, Walter, and he is terrific. The actor steals the movie with his subtle interpretation of both pivotal roles.Yes, there is an abundance of action sequences and scary moments, none of which I will reveal. The film builds tension well throughout its telling, although its many climaxes are a bit of overkill, literally. That said, Alien Covenant conveniently lives off its original 1979 host source and provides enough mayhem, gore, and action for most moviegoers, especially any horror film enthusiast with a taste for bloodshed. Dessert, anyone?",Alien - Covenant
97,RatedVforVinny,Not quite the disaster but compared to Alien!?,6,30 August 2019,"It's hard to know exactly where to start but I already know this is going to disappoint a huge number of original followers. The most let-down aspect, is you expect so much more from the main man, R.Scott. A director that has three classics under his belt, needs to just sit down and remember what constitutes a good, a great and even a bad movie. Money and effects can't cover up a poor cast and a troubling, pretentious script. Looking at all of the 1's and 2's out of ten, well the fans have already spoken (right here).",Alien - Covenant
98,rgkarim,Mehlien,6,18 May 2017,"Alien a franchise that has continued to take many forms over the last four decades. While some of its evolutions have been weaker and worthy of forgetting, there have been some forms that will forever hold throne in the realm of good science fiction horror. Tonight, Alien Covenant launches in US theaters, unfortunately to a mixture of reviews slamming it enough to call it worse than its predecessor Prometheus. So, alongside my friend Jeff, we hit the theaters to see what it's got after all the buildup and hype. Robbie K back and as always, I'm here to share my thoughts. LIKES:  Back to Alien tactics  Danny McBride isn't a stoner  Science Fiction Elements  Loose ends somewhat tied upSummary: Low and behold, Covenant finally returns back to the elements we fell in love with years ago. Nostalgia runs wild in this movie as Daniels and her colleagues work to survive the nightmare that dwells in this movie. Narrow Hallways filled to the brim with shadows as the ""perfect"" organism seeks out its prey, amidst shrieks, acid blood, and that infamous lethal tongue? The gimmicks are all there, alongside the science fiction element this series is famous for. Biology is certainly one of the topics they focused on this one, in hopes of adding some plausibility and ""realism"" to the series. My buddy and I both agreed that this component did some nice damage control and added a unique twist to the mix. A particular like for me was finally seeing McBride in a new role. If you're a fan of classic McBride acting like an idiot constantly on drugs and spouting nonsense, you won't see that side of him in this film. For me this is refreshing, and McBride finally crafted a character I didn't want to punch in the face, but instead relished as he took a major role in the story. While I certainly would have liked a little more him in the film (not something I say often), McBride works on so many levels for me in this film.Finally, the story element of the movie. When last, we left the series, Prometheus left so many freaking questions and confusion that we needed another movie to explain the movie. Good news, Covenant comes in to tie up those loose ends, helping bridge the gap between the new and old and answer some questions we have asked for a while. In doing so it adds an interesting element to the mix and doesn't raise as many questions as Prometheus did. Thank the lord for that. DISLIKES:  Weak opening  Most characters practically worthless  Weird gimmicks  Overzealous gore  Inconsistent story lineSummary: Reading some of my fellow reviewers' writings I have to agree with many of the dislikes in this movie. Much has to do with the story, and it starts with the weak, almost pointless opening that causes all the trouble. It's lazy writing, with a random element thrown in to get things going that barely makes sense other than some special effect firework display. Throw in the pointless cameo (again) and you are left with a bitter taste from the start. Unfortunately, that's only the start, for Alien Covenant continues to take hits in the plot development, primarily in the character story aspect. Much of the cast is pretty much pointless outside of being fodder for the aliens, with few having any backstory or an understandable name. We get it, Aliens is all about nameless characters facing the elements, but the first two installments were successful in integrating some of them into plot and bestow significance. In addition, someone wasn't paying attention to their details, because Alien Covenant offset some of the details Prometheus set. While it may not be a big deal to the layman, most fans of the series though are going to noticeyeah, we nerds can be a pain in the butt. Still, I didn't like some of these lack of attention to detail and will most likely do everything in my power to theorize a story to cover this gap. Nope instead this movie wanted to try out some new gimmicks in multiple departments including weird kissing scenes, that notorious black crud, obsessions with ""love"", and of course new types of creatures. I'll give them points for some originality, but the gimmicks were a little off the wall even for me (who is pretty dang weird). Even worse, the gimmicks are kind of unnecessary or neatly explained in a single sentence. Instead the new gimmicks, as well as much of the movie was all about the gore. Alien Covenant keeps to the displays of blood, going strong for the insanely detailed displays of blood (both CGI and real) and people getting torn to bits, by a less impressive looking Xenomorph. The VERDICTAline Covenant is pretty much what you expect from the series since Alien 3 emerged out into the theaters. It is all about the gore filled hunt, mediocre story, all wrapped in a science fiction exterior. A plus side is again the Alien tactics and tying up loose ends, but unfortunately it still lacks a lot of story, relevant gimmicks, and balance the first two movies had. Perhaps, should a next one be made, they will tie up more loose ends and obtain a little more storytelling. In addition, the insane obsession with death and gore might be diluted as well, though I highly doubt this given modern audiences obsession with killing. Worth a trip to the theater? For the fans of the series, yes, otherwise hold out until RedBox for this one folk. My scores are: Horror/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",Alien - Covenant
99,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Alien: Covenant,5,22 May 2017,"Did you hear the news? With Alien: Covenant, director Ridley Scott has been cloned and has gone Hollywood! Either that or the studio execs at 20th Century Fox bullied his film, finagled the final cut, and tried to re-release The Descent.""Covenant"" (my latest review) is the sixth installment in the ever- popular Alien franchise. As most critics (including this one) have noted, it's a stronger flick than Alien: Resurrection and 1992's Alien 3. Sadly, that's not saying much considering those sequels are not watchable to begin with.From 1979 till present day, Alien: Covenant has allowed Scott to one up the grossly, blood and guts factor. Also, he has been able to improve on certain special effects with his nasty species moving faster than ever (you actually view an alien kill in full detail). What ""Covenant"" lacks unfortunately, is feeling. Heck, it's so anti-climatic and clunky. Every time you think suspense is about to build with exploding stomachs or massive firepower, Ridley Scott brings Alien: Covenant to a screeching halt with Michael Fassbender (in dual roles) lamenting on the events of ""Covenant's"" prequel, Prometheus.Regrettably, Alien: Covenant dismisses what made the first two installments so legendary. Gone is the haunting, horror film feel of '79's Alien. Gone is the rocketing, foot soldier aspect of 1986's Aliens. Finally, gone is James Horner and Jerry Goldsmith's stirring musical scores from both films.In terms of the actors and their characters, it just gets worse. In place of Lance Henriksen, Yaphet Kotto, and the late Bill Paxton, ""Covenant"" gives us a miscast Billy Crudup, comedian Danny McBride, and a wooden Demian Bichir. In place of heroine Sigourney Weaver, well Alien: Covenant brings forth an admirable yet second-tier Katherine Waterston (Steve Jobs, 2013's Night Moves). The ship computer Mother still exists but yeah, things just aren't the same.All in all, ""Covenant"" has what no other Alien film possesses and that's a twist ending. It also gives us the famed horror cliché in which you have sex and then poof, you die. These are nifty attributes but they don't quite hold enough interest. You're better off seeing March's Life starring Jake Gyllenhaal. That vehicle was a blatant Alien ripoff but it's still better than what's going on here. My rating: A mixed two stars.",Alien - Covenant
100,justin-fencsak,A big improvement from Prometheus!!!,7,21 May 2017,"When Prometheus came out nearly 5 years ago, it was met with lukewarm reception yet became the highest grossing Alien movie worldwide. It was Ridley Scott's first movie filmed in 3d, with The Martian, his next movie after the failure of The Counselor, being shot that way; it became his biggest hit of his career. Now comes Alien: Covenant, the middle of a three part trilogy set before the 1979 masterpiece that is a huge improvement over Prometheus in terms of effects and scope and storyline. The soundtrack has some tomes borrowed from Jerry Goldsmith's score for the 1979 classic Alien, and some scenes from this movie borrow heavily from that film that started it all. The casting in this movie is pretty good, and the aliens in the movie never disappoint. I'm glad Scott made the right move to shoot it in plain old 2d since 3d is a dying fad. I recommend seeing this movie twice to get the feel of what it's like in space.",Alien - Covenant
101,Easygoer10,Bad and getting worse,7,31 August 2017,"I am a huge fan of the original ""Alien"" film (1979). My sister had called me and said, ""see this film"". We used to do this whenever one of us really liked a film. The only rule was to not reveal anything. So, I had no idea what I was in for. Besides her call to me, I had not read anything or even seen a preview prior to going to this movie. For all I knew, it was about illegal aliens. coming over our (US) border. I also remember it opened (in my city) the same weekend as ""Moonraker"", a Roger Moore James Bond film. There were a dozen people at our apartment that Friday night. They all wanted to see James Bond. I did not, so I took one guy with me. It blew my mind. People not only screamed, but ran out of the theater. My friend with me was speechless afterwards. It was the best film I had seen since ""The Exorcist"" (1973). BTW, those are the 2 most terrifying films I have ever seen, to this day. As I do when a new film I really liked came out back then, I went to see it 3 days in a row; taking everyone I knew. It is still one of my 2 or 3 favorite films. I have seen it at least 50 times since then; maybe more. I have seen all the sequels many, many times as well. I truly liked ""Prometheus"". I thought it was very good, and made a lot of sense. Having seen ""Alien: Covenant"" at the theater and on Bluray, I am sad to say they have really taken steps backwards; I mean big steps, in several areas. As far as the casting, besides Fassbender, who is in probably half of the film, no one comes close to him in ""Covenant"". I like Billy Crudup, and Katherine Waterston; however, they are not near as good as the leads in ""Prometheus"". I don't care if Ms. Waterston is 6' tall; Noomi Rapace blew her away, on all counts, and you cannot even begin to compare her to Sigourney Weaver. No way. Billy Crudup is a very, very good actor; truly. However, he seems like a fish out of water in this role. In the extras on the disc, they spend almost all of the time talking about how much it is going to scare the hell out of the audience. I am sorry, it does not work. Carmen Ejogo and the rest of the cast doesn't compare with Charlize Theron, Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, Kate Dickie, and on and on. Actor for actor, they just don't stack up...Danny McBride-are you kidding? He is not funny, and he can't act. Regarding the plot, I understood it all as soon as ""David"" appeared. There were no surprises. I don't know what is going on with Ridley Scott, but he is so much better building incredible sets (where was Arthur Max?). I think all of this is starting to go to Scott's head, like in a bad way. I absolutely knew everything which was going to happen, as soon as they played the Prologue (which I liked). I am not talking about details; I am talking about the primary parts. Then ""Orum"" (Billy Crudup) is playing a fool, and I get it; he is supposed to, but this is my exact problem: I was not surprised in a single scene; not one. There far too many ""homages"" made. In fact, that is all this film seems to be; a tip of the hat to ""2001"", Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", and ""Prometheus"".Ridley Scott is truly one of the best directors out there; for a while I think he was the best left after Stanley Kubrick died, and there is a large gap between the two. I do not feel that way anymore. Scott is getting passed by better directors. I liked ""Arrival"" (2016) so much more than anything Ridley Scott has directed or produced in the past decade at least. That includes ""Blade Runner 2049"". Both were directed by Ridley's friend, Denis Villeneuve. I think the torch has been pased to him. My favorite films will always be Stanley Kubrick's. He is in a class of his own. I would have loved to have seen Fassbender directed by Kubrick; it was not to be.",Alien - Covenant
102,Rob_Taylor,Alien... This time its snore...,5,14 May 2017,"I don't even know where to begin with this one. I wasn't impressed with Prometheus and I had hoped...hoped... that lessons had been learned from that monstrosity. But clearly the only take-away that Ridley Scott had from the reaction to that movie was ""People want more Aliens!"" So we come to Alien Covenant. A movie filled with forgettable characters whose deaths (almost always the result of their own stupidity) are tiredly predictable and completely avoidable.Remember in Prometheus when all the ""scientists"" do really dumb things purely in the name of pushing the plot-driven mess ahead? Well, prepare for so much more of the same in Covenant. It's as if they have no training in space exploration at all and are just regular Joes that have been fired off into space. No...scratch that. Regular Joes would have far more common sense than the crew in this movie. They should have name the movie Alien: Incompetence.They open doors on alien worlds without checking for microorganisms, prod plants that release spores that they then inhale and only answer the radio with vague responses instead of concise answers. The list is pretty endless and all it does it to make you glad that they all die off horribly.Of course, the writers are to blame. This is another example of the increasing trend towards ""Get the characters to do something to further the plot"" regardless of how retarded those character actions appear to anyone with a brain stem. All that matters is driving the plot forward. Never mind about common sense.Speaking of the characters, you really won't care about any of them. The characters in A:C are so thinly sketched as to be essentially invisible. You won't get to know them, or even their names for the most part. That's because they have been written with the same lack of attention as the teenagers in a slasher flick. They are there purely to die in various ways, so why bother fleshing them out? That was the mentality here. Also, good luck trying to guess who is who's partner in this ""couples"" expedition into space. That, unsurprisingly, is also not bothered with.Another thing...CGI aliens. Sometimes looking as bad as they did in Alien 3, but always unconvincing. But as bad as the CGI was, it pales into insignificance next to Scott's explained genesis of the xenomorphs. It's lame, and is on the same level as George Lucas' midichlorians reveal. We didn't need to know this. They were better as monsters of unknown provenance. The reveal was terribly insulting.So, as you can tell, Alien Covenant is a hot mess. If all you want is aliens ripping people apart you are well served here, but if you wanted a coherent story, with likable characters and a satisfyingly muttered ""Oh! Is it over?"" at the end then look elsewhere.I can't help but wonder what Neil Blomkamp's alien film might have looked like. I suspect it would have been far more enjoyable and worthwhile. But no, we got Ridley ""It's my franchise!"" Scott and his increasingly desperate attempts to prove he is still a decent director.Here's a thought, Ridley? Why not actually read through the screenplay before you start shooting it. That way, you might actually notice it is dumb and be able to do something about it.EDIT: I forgot to mention the tiny lickle baby aliens that sprout from hosts now. Fully formed, miniature versions of the adults. Did Ridley just forget how they looked before this? Is this what dementia looks like? Joking aside, when you are making a horror movie and a monster bursts out of a hapless victim, the last thing you expect a viewer to do is go ""Aah! It's so cute!""SUMMARY: Makes you want to say ""Come back AvP, all is forgiven. Lessons learned from Prometheus = 0. This franchise needs either a long rest, or a director/writers that really care about it. Not really worth your money.",Alien - Covenant
103,eric262003,Better Than Prometheus But Forgettable Characters,6,22 April 2019,"In the year of 2109, the crew of the USCSS Covenant embark on quest to start a new colony on the planet of Origae-6 by virtue due to the rogue transmission where several colonists are in pods and human embryos are secured in frozen storage. Terraforming Chief Officer Daniels (Katherine Waterston) has a growing fear of reluctance when the crew appoints an android named David (Michael Fassbender who later plays a similar android named Walter) who had survived the unsuccessful Prometheus mission.As soon as the title for ""Alien: Covenant"" materializes on the screen, I was excited to see Ridley Scott was going to direct his third film in the ""Alien"" franchise and I was equally mesmerized by the haunting score by composer Jerry Goldsmith. After several mixed reviews from the previous installment ""Prometheus"", it was time for Scott to return back to the basics and with the theory that in outer space, no one will hear you when you scream. Though at times ""Alien: Covenant"" can be a bit too talkative like ""Prometheus"", but it has scenes reminiscent to the original ""Alien"" movie with great details of graphic imagery, plenty of horrific gore and more excitement.The movie opens up with a clear view of David's eye which is an homage of the Voight-Kampff test from the original 1982 ""Blade Runner"" movie by director Scott. Situated in a secluded immaculate white room, Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) manipulates his creation David about the mysteries surrounding creation, while he gets him to play a piece by Richard Wagner, ""Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla"". Clearly the template that led to the events of ""Prometheus"", we get cut to tens years later when Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) places David's head in a duffel bag and sends him off to space. We're now in 2109 and the crew of the Covenant is sending 2000 podded colonists to the hospitable planet Origae-6. The symbolic sounds to John Denver's ""Country Road"" indicates that this newly established planet will ensure better living conditions here on Earth. After suffering casualties that left the crew traumatic, the crew take refuge on this planet. There's breathable air, plenty of wheat, but sadly we hear no bird or animal sounds. Gasp!""Alien: Covenant"" does manage to succeed in upstaging ""Prometheus"" by utilizing the many many tropes that's been a trademark in the franchise. We have crew spewing off their hilarious banter, the ship's computer MOTHER makes a return, there's a conflict over quarantine, there's scenes involving dripping water, eggs along with Facehugger, Xenomorphs and Chestbursters. There are some twists added to the familiar formula that comes into place. We are introduced to a baby alien that resembles that of a Baby Groot. The Neomorphs seem more agile than the other Aliens in the franchise who have the capability to leap and move like a Velociraptor when they're confronting the crew.The atmosphere in ""Alien: Covenant"" is high in intensity. When first encountering the domeheads, high levels of discomfort comes into effect with vicious shaking moments and several scenes of unsettling darkness to the creatures developing the skills of head-butting. It's not at the the same levels as Scott's previous films like ""Alien"" from 1979 to ""Aliens"" from 1986. There is some innovative death scenes but they remain less climactic as the original installments. Also the momentum is quite muddled up at time as well.When it comes to the crew there are just too many and most of them are underdeveloped and not very noteworthy. For Waterston's character Daniels, she spends most of the time lamenting in grief. Taking over as the new captain on the ship, Oram (Billy Crudup) has more concern of his religious beliefs and if it puts his authority to question. The only true standout character is Danny McBride's character of Tennessee but it's because he wears a cowboy hat. The most interesting character has to be Michael Fassbender's portrayal of the character David and enhanced newbie named Walter. David is the only character on the newly discovered planet. There's some bizarre scenes where David instructs Walter on playing the flute, upstage one another in Romantic poetry which is weird in detail.The balance within ""Alien:Covenant"" is that there are similar comparison to other Ridley Scott films like ""Prometheus"" and ""Blade Runner"" with Scott almost figuratively playing God in the series of discussions on board. The early ""Alien"" movies had a mix blend of 1980's slasher flicks with the science fiction elements to come with it. Unfortunately this installment has too much dialogue making it feel like it's trying too had to be intellectual and philosophical when it really shouldn't. The visuals from the previous outings are few and far between. With the success of ""The Martian"", Scott still has the knack for sci-fi adventures and can undercover huge details like sprouting sails and how aliens rely on atoms through the smoke rings. Though mostly serious there is some humourous quips from the script by John Logan and Dante Harper including one gag based on ""Phantom of the Opera"".In the end it's a step up to the mixed feelings of ""Prometheus"" in which ""Alien: Covenant"" is strong in the the thrills department, but is sadly deprived of any star power or any memorable standout performance.",Alien - Covenant
104,pc95,Another Brainfart Alien Movie in the Series,4,27 August 2017,"(major spoilers) No better than ""Prometheus"", even with director Ridley Scott helming, ""Alien Covenant""'s script is Dead on Arrival with ridiculous lapses in judgment of characters and a complete void of logic on too many occasions beyond forgiveness. This is in spite of fairly competent effects, a shame really. Once again plot developments rely on clichéd stupidities and mistakes of supposed ""trained"" crew. Later we preposterously have the android acting as parent to baby aliens replete with soothing flute music. Ending 20 min is laughably predictable and retrodden. This is the same unchecked overthinking in earlier entries that gum up simple effective stories. There's a clear homage to ""Blade Runner"" in one sequence, but this movie doesn't get close to Scott's earlier movies, is a mess, and yet another letdown in the series unfortunately. 4/10 Poor.",Alien - Covenant
105,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,The second film I've seen recently ( after Free Fire ) to curiously include a John Denver musical interlude,3,1 June 2017,"I'll * not * type a numbered/ bullet point list as a review for this one, as many others have, because any grade school student can do that. Instead, I'll excessively use parenthetical, run-on sentences to make most of my points about this massively disappointing movie, whose biggest asset is impressive exterior photography in Australia and New Zealand.Watchable, but routine sci-fi/ horror follows every beat one expects from this type of movie. Its largely predictable plot is hurt further by the fact that even if one cannot see the twists coming, the trailer reveals too much of the film. Nothing happens naturally, everything feels as though it happens just because the script says it should happen. The two story writers ( Jack Paglen and Michael Green ) worked independently of each other, and two screenwriters ( John Logan and Dante Harper ) all worked separately, independent of each other, which is why their names are all separated by the word "" and "" , rather than a comma ( as per Writer's Guild regulations ) and they all seemingly hadn't even read what had been written, considering the jarring changes in tone throughout, and some random​ story elements which come from out of nowhere and lead to nothing.These genius scientists ( on their way to colonise a distant planet ) make the most idiotic mistakes since a 1980s slasher movie ( take a close up look at that moving alien egg, while exploring an uncharted planet with virtually no protective equipment, because nothing bad could possibly happen. ( When they slip on the blood soaked floor, I thought that if they made it in black and white, and added some piano music, it would look like an old short film from the 1920s, where someone slips on a banana peel. That happens not just once, but * twice * , in quick succession ) ) , as they go off course to explore an unknown planet, which ends up being inhabited by another, who has been stranded there for ten hyperbolic years, gone mad from isolation, and basically turned the aliens into biological experiments, because, yeah, sure. The aliens themselves, are never scare or frightening, they're just gross and blood drenched.This entire film, while not * bad * , feels like a big budget Alien rip- off, made by a room full of studio executives, rather than filmmakers, and solely to set up the next sequel( s ) , with no point to make of its own.We even get a pointless, from out of nowhere shower scene slaughter!

106,vengeance20,Sci-Fi Horror at it's best!,8,15 May 2017,"Upon seeing Event Horizon just last year, I was never a Sci-Fi fan. I wouldn't say I am, even now. But when it's mixed with Horror, it makes from a pretty epic combination!Now, I never seen Prometheus in Cinemas. For the reason that it was Sci-Fi & I wasn't bought by it! But as I said above, since discovering the iconic Event Horizon Film which combines both Horror & Sci-Fi together. I've since had a change of heart, & when I found out Alien: Covenant was coming out this year in May, I decided to give it a watch! So I bought Prometheus on DVD for a cheap price to watch before going to see this one, as it was a sequel & so I wanted to watch the first film just to get a better insight for the 2nd Film.I have little knowledge of the Sci-Fi Theme alone, so I did find Prometheus & Alien: Covenant a bit confusing, not to mention beyond my know how on what they were talking about etc. But I know enough to understand whats what. So the film is set 10 years after the first. Prometheus finishing in the new year of 2094. This film starts at 2104. The colony Ship, Covenant lands on what the crew think, is an uncharted paradise! But they soon discover something far more darker & sinister going on!I found the film to be quite enjoyable! Considering the Sci-Fi Theme, the Horror elements were rife & top notch! The film was very gory & had some great action sequences & stunning visuals! The film was an improvement over Prometheus, which I thought lacked & didn't have any gore in it! This one didn't disappoint!My only complaints about he film were that it could've been better & have more bloody non-stop gory action sequences! As I really enjoyed it! Aside from finding the film a bit confusing, I found it could've been a bit better a few places & of course, cranked up to an 18 certificate! But the film was great & the aliens & graphics made up for a few of the things I mentioned.Overall, the film was really decent! I'm looking forward to more Alien Films! Sci-Fi Horror is a really great combo when done right! 8/10",Alien - Covenant
107,bkrauser-81-311064,Visuals All but Make Up for a Wanting Script,8,19 May 2017,"What arguably made the Alien franchise (1979-Present) such an extraordinary success back in its day had less to do with the alien itself and more to do with the franchises overwhelming sense of dread. It permeated through, at the very least the three good movies (shut up, Alien 3 (1992) is too a good movie) in everything from their dark existential themes to their imposing and surreal external features. There was no escape from the darkness, whether that darkness came in the form of the alien itself, a sinister and omnipresent company or the emptiness of space which rumor has it, no one can hear you scream.Prometheus (2012), for better or worse, changed all that by elevating the existential dread from being a feature to a recurring theme. It's a subtle shift and one that's impossible to notice when the newest batch of expendables are running for dear life. Yet while most remember Prometheus as ""the one where a professional biologist gets cozy with a hissing vagina snake,"" they forget that the movie often stopped cold, to wax poetically about the nature of God, the search for meaning, and man's tenuous relationship with nature.Alien: Covenant follows the same thematic arc started by Prometheus five years ago, only I'm glad to say this time it largely sticks. The story begins when a ship of colonists intercept a signal from an Earth-like planet and decide to change course in order to investigate it. Once they arrive on the surface of the planet with thoughts of long-term colonization, the landing crew quickly discover the ruins of an ancient civilization (and a little something more).Say what you will about Scott, He's always been a visual director Out of all the subsequent films in the Alien franchise, Alien: Covenant arguably comes closest to recreating the bold visuals and overall feel of the original 1979 film. This film is admirably beautiful in its framing and composition. Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski imbues nearly every frame on the planet with an off-putting balance of natural splendor and glowering foreboding. When the Captain (Crudup) says ""this could be home,"" you'd be inclined to believe him, that's if you didn't already know this was an Alien movie.Much credit must be given to director Ridley Scott for trying to give the world of his franchise a sense of scope. One can draw a straight line from Prometheus's bronze age aesthetic to Covenant's imposing classicism to the eventual discovery of a/the Gothic derelict ship. Not satisfied with ornamentation, Scott supplements some of the film's most dire and profound moments with visual parallels to the Drowning of Ophelia by Millais, The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch and The Last Days of Pompeii by Bryullov.Yet if there's a weak link to this film - and trust me it's a doozy - it's the film's rather wanting script written partially by playwright John Logan. The introduction of Walter, played by an uncharacteristically straight-laced Michael Fassbender conjures memories of Fassbender's take on the maltheist synthetic David in Prometheus. And as such, his inclusion begs the script to reach for the same level sophistication as Scott's unforgettable visuals in both that film and this one. If only references to Percy Shelley and Wagner made it so. Unfortunately for Covenant, anything meant to be muse-worthy and bleak just comes across as silly or worse, the pretentious preening of a screenwriter who wants everyone in earshot to know he went to Northwestern.Alien: Resurrection sucked but admit it, you remember this guy The film then uneasily balances its lofty ideas on the shoulders of some of the blandest characters in this franchise to date. If asked for a list of character names, fans of the franchise could arguably name a good five or six (not including Ripley) spread out between all the Alien films. Here however our hero Daniels (Waterston) and her erudite crew lack a lot of the hallmarks of being a memorable and sympathetic lot; even when the film spends more time than usual getting to know them, their habits and their motivations. Yet because there motivations are so tenuous, their decisions so baffling and their psychology so dependent on the need to fill time, we as the audience just can't invest all that much in them.Yet for every delta we add to the list of what's wrong with this movie, the visuals, not to mention the arrival of the dreaded Xenomorph are enough to overtake them. The gore, the shock, the visceral moments of absolute dread, beckon to the original in just the right ways. Covenant may not be as exciting and expertly paced but it does have enough of an oomph to live on its mythological laurels.",Alien - Covenant
108,mhorg2018,Utter Trash,1,10 June 2017,"So 20th Century Fox thought that a half-assed neo-remake of Alien was a good idea? Everything about this movie from the opening which continues from the absolutely horrible Prometheus, to the characters doing every stupid thing in the book - is terrible. And I won't go into the obvious, stupid ending. Ridley Scott has lost it. I don't know or care why, but Fox needs to either let the Alien franchise die - or let Neil Blokamp, who has yet to do a movie I don't like, continue on with his vision for the Alien world. Why eggs if people can be infecting by spores? And why do only some get infected by the spores? Another stupid idea: How comes ships that were built to TRAVEL through space, can constantly have their port holes, windshields, whatever smashed open by aliens who then NOTHING happens to?

109,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Alien: Covenant""- A beautiful failure.",2,25 May 2017,"I was ready to write my 500th IMDb review on a special film that meant a lot to me in order to commemorate reaching such a number. And I was thinking about what I could possibly pick... perhaps my favorite television series? Or a game I highly admired? Perhaps a review of my favorite guilty-pleasure? Or find the movie I thought was the greatest ever made? It had to be something meaningful.And then I saw ""Alien: Covenant"", and I had my answer. My 500th IMDb review will be not for a great film, or one I admired. It will be in recognition of perhaps the single most disappointing cinematic experience I've ever had. Yes, Ridley Scott's return to the ""Alien"" saga began on a shaky note with 2012's mediocre ""Prometheus""- a film that was stunning to behold but ultimately half-baked in the story department. But oh boy, does he outdo himself with ""Alien: Covenant!"" I wasn't expecting this. It's almost heartbreaking, because Scott gets the entire film so fundamentally wrong. It's to the point that ""Covenant"" reaches the brink of being near unwatchable at times. And beyond that... it's so thoroughly ludicrous, it almost retroactively makes the earlier installments less enjoyable merely by association. It's that bad. A vessel known as ""The Covenant"" is on a mission to the planet Origae-6, where a human colony will be established with a crew and passengers kept in deep hibernation, and the ship under he supervision of android Walter (Michael Fassbender). However, an unexpected neutrino blast cripples the ship and kills several crew and colonists. Awakened, the remaining crew are forced to make a hard choice when in the aftermath of the blast, a distress signal is found on a mysterious nearby planet. Descending to its surface to investigate, the crew shockingly find this previously unknown world to be a suitable analog for Earth thanks to a similar atmosphere... well, if it weren't for mysterious spores that impregnate several crew- members with proto-xenomorphs and the appearance of the android known as ""David""- now the sole survivor of the ""Prometheus"" disaster! From there on, it's a race to survive a tangle of plot- lines as David's motivations are questioned, the crew attempts to defeat the new alien threat and the audience tries to care!In a lot of ways, the problems audiences had with ""Prometheus"" are back in this follow-up- from the smallest nit-picks to the grandest logical errors and examples of faulty writing. It's very much a film where you can count along with the glaring gaps in reason and execution with each passing minute. The only thing is these issues seem substantially exacerbated by a general apathy and sense of ""going through the motions"" on the part of the creative team. There's no heart here as there was with ""Prometheus."" Say what you will... it's clear that there was a drive and effort behind that film. And when the resulting reception ended up mixed, Ridley Scott went back to the well and simply tried to make a film that was cosmetically similar to his iconic original. And that's not spoiling anything- it's in the darned title! And we end up with a film that's merely a pale imitation of what came before, leaving it a wholly monotonous and dull experience. Yes, Scott's trademark visual direction is as gorgeous as ever... but it's to the service of nothing but copying and pasting, with less thought and an added sense of convolution as it must now bridge ""Prometheus"" and the original ""Alien.""Not that I lay the blame entirely at the feet of Scott, as there is also the poor writing courtesy a small army of screenwriters. There is a distinct lack of character establishment and development outside of Fassbender's admittedly delightful dual role. Not a single human character feels real or fleshed- out in the slightest, and the bulk of the cast come across like they're playing animated versions of the cardboard cut-outs for the film you see in your theater's lobby. Which is a shame, as there is some good talent involved, including the likes of Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup and Danny McBride, who oddly enough gives the best performance of the film outside of Fassbender. The pacing of the writing is also suspect, especially in the opening act, which is both needlessly drawn out but also vapid because we're just seeing ""stuff"" happen with no characters to root for. The script never finds the balance between story and character... so we're left with nothing but tenuously connected plot-beats that transparently only exist to bring us from one sequence to the next, peppered in with the occasional awkward insertion of a reference to the previous films for contrived fan-service. It's hack writing 101.And to top it off... The film feels unnecessary. I hate to say that, because no film is technically necessary. But in the grand scheme of a franchise, there needs to be a purpose to exist or else it just feels like a cash-grab. And this feels like a cash- grab. By virtue of its own design (and again, this spoils nothing), you can't do much outside of complicate the backstory with twists and turns in a prequel such as this, which lends a strange level of unbelievability to the earlier installments. The original four-film series was haunting, and the aliens themselves were a menace that the characters happened upon. Now, with added layers of religious subtext (don't get me started on Crudup's cringe-worthy persecution complex the writers tossed into one scene), nonsensical insertion of numerous new locations that the aliens are infesting, and ""Prometheus"" suggesting that the xenomorphs are some weapon experiment... and I just don't buy it tying together. The one-two punch of ""Prometheus"" and ""Alien: Covenant"" cheapen the whole series.""Alien: Covenant"" is a woefully misjudged and shockingly dull tale that takes the series to new lows. And for that, I give it an abysmal 2 out of 10.",Alien - Covenant

111,arungeorge13,"Review – Alien: Covenant (2017) .. the set-pieces are fun, the storyline predictable! (3/5)",6,5 June 2017,"Ridley Scott treads familiar ground in Alien: Covenant, the sequel to 2012's Prometheus, attempting a mish-mash of old school set pieces (involving lots of chest-bursting, face-hugging and gore!) all the while putting forward an engaging framework of events that would eventually lead to the first Alien film.All the usual tropes that one associates with a Ridley Scott Alien flick are present .. a sensible leading lady (who by turn of events ends up being the protagonist), a few effectively executed jumpscares, human vs. alien set-pieces, excellent cinematography and CGI (for most part, except that first encounter with the neomorphs). The actual villain here is neither the neomorph/xenomorph nor the psychopathic android David (played by Fassbender) but the predictable screenplay. The audience knows well in advance that more than 80% of the crew is sure to mutate/die; the leading lady is bound to survive against all odds and the supposedly big-twist can be foreseen quite early on.Ten years after the failed Prometheus expedition, the crew aboard the ship (Covenant) carrying over 2000 colonists and equivalent number of embryos, heading towards a distant planet are diverted due to an apparent indication of human existence in an unknown planet that looks ecstatically beautiful (but terrifyingly silent!) containing a sinister extra terrestrial presence. A John Denver song inadvertently sets the ball rolling.The only returning character from Prometheus is the synthetic David. Elizabeth Shaw (the protagonist of the previous movie, played by Noomi Rapace) is posthumously mentioned on a few occasions. As with Prometheus, this movie too leaves the viewer with a lot of unanswered questions especially when it comes to certain decisions that some of the lead characters undertake.Another underwhelming aspect of the flick is that the vastly expansive ideologies laid out in Prometheus take a back seat in Alien: Covenant, and the director instead chooses to shoehorn the viewer by including those factors which made the first two Alien films hugely popular. If Scott's idea was just to get the viewer excited about an array of possibilities that must have resulted in the events leading to the Ellen Ripley saga only to write most of them off in the upcoming (prequel) sequels, then I say that's not looking too bright for the franchise altogether.That said, given the anticlimactic ending of this film, there's plenty of scope to break new ground in the sequels provided the writing gets mucho better. I kinda enjoyed the gory set-pieces and the ways deployed by Daniels (Waterston) and Tennessee (McBride) to counter the neomorphs/xenomorphs, although the climactic showdown doesn't offer that much of a thrill-fest. Hopefully, these characters make it back to the big-screen (instead of being killed off-screen like Shaw) again. I also wish Neill Blomkamp's Alien 5 gets made too (as his visionary ideas could lend a fresh twist to the existing universe!).",Alien - Covenant
112,Screen_Blitz,"Scary and visually impressive, Ridley Scott's Alien: Covenant seals a thrilling fresh return to the franchise",8,1 June 2017,"The Alien franchise has been driven with ups and downs for over the past three decades. Its most troubled history was greatly redeemed in 2012 when Ridley Scott helmed a prequel to the franchise 'Prometheus'. Following his return to the franchise, only some would expect that his next project to the series would be a bridge connecting the stories of Prometheus and 'Alien'. Visually stunning and suitably scary, this film following the events of the former sees Ridley Scott returning with his immersive talent in visual storytelling and direction to bring this grounded story to life. What the director fails to bring however, is new ideas to the franchise which will serve as a minor burden for some, but leave others who are less demanding for a game changer satisfied. As a result, this new installment to the series is scary and thrilling as ever, and not without the admirable talents both in front and behind the camera. This film follows a space crew aboard a spaceship called The Covenant. Consisting of members including the humanoid David (played by Michael Fassbender), Dany Branson (played by Katherine Waterson), Christoper Oram (played by Billy Crudup), chief pilot Tennessee (played by Danny McBride), Sergeant Hope (played by Demien Bichir), and Christopher's wife Karine (played by Carmen Ejogo); the crew sets out to investigate a distant planet, only face an unspeakable extraterrestrial terror that awaits them. If there is anything disappointing about Ridley Scott brings to the table, it may the lack of new ideas to the series; whereas the previous film introduced more complex themes such as the debate between creationism and evolution. Scott, nonetheless, proves that he knows how to deliver a thrillingly effective ride. From the gorgeous imagery in and outside the spaceship, to the breathtaking cinematography Dariusz Wolski, this film engages viewers with a powerful visual heft while lighting fire to a pulse-pounding, tautly-paced story that takes them on the darkest corners of a vicious alien onslaught. When the mission goes awry and several crew members meet their gruesome ends at the hands of flesh-eating xenomorphs, Scott almost never fails to deliver the edge-of-your- seat thrills as well as drenching the screen with a reasonable amount of blood and gore. With aliens once again bursting out of human bodies and snacking on human flesh in a blood-fueled fiasco, this is a terrifying ride that only those with a strong stomach should board, while the rest are likely the find themselves curling into a ball. One of very few moments of levity stands when they find shelter on the distant planet they believe is safe haven. But it is only a matter before the sense of hope turns to dread when we and the characters learn that his uncharted planet is the only the beginning of their nightmares. The final twenty minutes, while somewhat effective, mark when the movie ceases the challenge against expectations and begins to rely on heavy predictability. The death of characters are scary, but perhaps less effective when you see them coming miles upon the horizon, let alone how the movie fails to take its time developing some of the characters. With Michael Fassbender standing as the only returning member from the 'Promotheus' crew, the movie introduces an all-new cast with a number of A to B-list actors to the bunch. Stepping in the shoes of one of the main characters is actress Katherine Waterston, arguably best known for her role Chrisann in 2015 biopic 'Steve Jobs'. Waterston's performance is definitely on point and certainly more admirable than her character. If you go in expecting something of Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley, you will likely be targeted for disappointment. Billy Crudup, Demien Bichir, and Carmen Ejogo bring their A-game to the roles, but the staleness of their characters sadly set them with only little to work with. There is one major surprise however, that a very few may come to expect in a science- fiction horror picture, and that is the performance by Danny McBride. Stripping away from his rowdy, comedic typecast, McBride ignites a fair amount of maturity in his role, although nothing that blows anyone of the cast out of the water. After all, the sharpest and most versatile figure in the crowd here is Michael Fassbender who shines with plenty of emotional gravitas and potency in his role as David. To add on icing on the cake, his talent is greatly challenged in a role involving a subplot (which shall not spoiled) that is surprisingly effective and adds gravity to the already compelling storyline. Calling this role for attention of an Oscar may be asking for a lot, but it's not too unreasonable.Alien: Covenant is a scary, yet thrilling fresh ride that manages to build a bridge between Prometheus and Alien with unexpectedly satisfying results. On both a visual and a narrative scope, this movie is a smart, if somewhat predictable experience that may not grab the attention of those unconverted to the franchise (or at least with Prometheus) but effectively shows the bright side of both the franchise and Ridley Scott's impressive directorial talent.",Alien - Covenant
113,Troy_Campbell,Dull and uneventful. Third tier Alien entry.,4,13 May 2017,"After the ambitious but divisive Prometheus, veteran filmmaker Ridley Scott promised a more straight-up prequel to his original 1979 masterpiece. What we're given, however, is actually more akin to a remake, and a shallow one at that. Scott attempts to combine the philosophical head-scratching of Prometheus with the body-horror eeriness of Alien, but somehow fails to achieve either. Covenant is not chilling enough to be scary nor clever enough to be worthy of debate, sitting somewhere in the dissatisfying middle of the two. It's also not especially fun. There are a few gory moments of delight, but after an exciting early sequence where a newly born xenomorph wreaks havoc, the set pieces slowly deteriorate into uninventive excuses to kill people off in exactly the order you assume they'll go. For a director who so excellently builds tension and sustains suspense, it's a shock to see so many sequences go straight for the easy kill; the under-the-skin terror Scott is capable of has been swapped for B-grade violence. As per normal Michael Fassbender provides plenty of awesomeness amongst the mess, his dual role performance as a pair of androids showcasing his immense talent as well as elevating the material to a semi-watchable standard. In her second big role after Fantastic Beasts, Katherine Waterston turns in an acceptable Ripley-wannabe performance yet never fully convinces as the hard arse heroine, whilst Danny McBride sticks out like a sore thumb as a cowboy pilot. On the surface this has what is required for a great instalment into the franchise, although ultimately it never succeeds due to what appears as a lack of commitment from the man behind the camera and a lack of ingenuity by the screenwriters. Covenant has its moments of passing excitement, but nevertheless is a disappointingly dull sequel/prequel that adds very little to the Alien canon.",Alien - Covenant

No, the movie was what I expected, cool, but unfortunately the saga has to end, in my opinion the film should only have 1 more film and close the cycle, Alien: Covenant explains a lot of things, I was liking the movie, But I found the 3 problematic act, especially Plot Twist of the film, when we know the origin of the Xenomorph, which in the case are the highlights of the film, the participations have always been good, I found the look excellent, the film has the disgusting parts, and the Cast is competent, but unfortunately the movie makes a mistake that I was afraid, they want to create a new Ripley, and this is a mistake, and worse is to know that this is the error of the creator of the universe of Ridley Scott movies, special effects are Beautiful, and the soundtrack matches the tone of the movie, and the first act of the movie is very slow and tiring, but better in Act 2, and the 3 act had everything to be good, but it's ruined by the end of it in my Opinion, I found Plot Twist's film very weak.

115,Richie-67-485852,This Film Alienates,6,19 May 2017,"I am a die hard fan remembering catching the original in a late night showing to cool off and relax because I couldn't sleep. I was glued to the movie and forget about sleep for the rest of the night. The film had me when that face-hugger appeared scary in itself. The fact that it laid an embryo in someone was like a knock-out punch. I surrendered and the rest is history. I must have seen it so many times I lost count. Just when you think things have settled down, out comes Aliens and it blew me back in my movie theater chair, gripping, squirming and amazed at such high quality entertainment. Then Alien 3 came out and I wondered ""what happened""? Did someone die or become bored or rich and careless? Still, it is an Alien movie so I watched it more than once. Then, Aliens 4 and I wondered why it chose this direction to go but he who has the gold rules and being a fan, accepted it although it didn't summon and beckon like the first two. A film here and there came out and I thought is the world better off with or without Alien movies? With so keep them coming and maybe one day someone with vision would enter into the Alien Universe. Prometheus intrigued me. Why? It made you ask questions, think things through and yammer, yell and demand more especially answers and we were told they are coming. Enter Covenant. We are back to ""what happened'? again. We skipped a beat here. Gone are the tensions, suspense, build-up, story development, awe, wonder and most important...the plot! We have the ability to travel into space for years and years and explore where man has never been before (sound familiar Trekkies?). Instead, we are treated to a crew of UN-professionals who don't even use the scientific methods to apply to what they do or why? In place of logic, you get wild thinking. Emotions run rampant and cursing substitutes for effective, meaningful dialog. What are the qualifications for getting on board a flight like this? Even in real life when we went to the moon, as inexperienced as we were, we kept it real. This goes into fantasy as in real professionally trained and experienced people don't do this but we are forced by watching this movie to accept that they do. From there, its all down hill. At one point, I thought: I can't wait for the Aliens to come and eat these people as they sure have it coming. I don't know if this film wanted to be one of adventure, drama, fantasy or horror and the most confusing thing of all is the name Ridley Scott is associated with all this. It boggles the mind that this is what Rid has morphed into pun intended. This comes across as a quick, cheap, lets make a bridge movie to continue the series while I am doing other things and we all pick up a few million. Whatever we mess up we will correct in the next film approach. The good news? The premise of a near perfect life-form and its developing story that at some point will bring us to the land of closure and relief as movie-goers, fans and supporters of this great original premise. Yes I will keep going to see them because there is always hope that the one movie that comes out will make us forgive all the bad that led us to it. In the opening scenes in this movie, there lacked a hook whereas Prometheus was off to find the meaning of life and had a plan. Even though we don't understand the big picture, the small one has us glued wondering what this is all about. Covenant doesn't invite you along or attract you to care but you jump on board because you paid for your seat. I always judge a movie by many things but one specific stands out i.e. is a must see again? Are there memorable scenes? Does it hold in the comeback arenas? As for Covenant, once was enough....I had some black licorice and kettle corn which I enjoyed and helped better the movie going experience. I recommend the same for you...Wait for this to come out on cable you will be just fine",Alien - Covenant
116,hnt_dnl,Second best Alien movie!,10,11 August 2017,"As someone who really hated Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" prequel and think James Cameron's ""Aliens"" sequel is painfully overrated, I did not have high hopes for Scott's second prequel ALIEN:COVENANT (2017), but thankfully my reservations were unfounded. I really love this movie! Alien:Covenant is easily, in my opinion, the 2nd best Alien film right behind Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi horror masterpiece ""Alien"". Covenant succeeds where Prometheus failed. Prometheus was too pretentious where virtually character, except perhaps David and Shaw (the irony), were inconsequential and oddly performed. Very thankfully, the only 2 good and decent characters from Prometheus were the ones to survive and salvaged for the sequels.The plot of the film is that the Earth-originated ship The Covenant, carrying over 2000 colonists and over 1000 embryos, is on a permanent deep space mission to a faraway planetary system named Origae-6. While the colonists, including a 14-member crew, are in cryosleep, the ship is monitored by it's assigned synthetic being, the android Walter (superbly played by Michael Fassbender, who also played the android David in 'Prometheus'). Walter is a more advanced, less emotional version of David. During sleep, the ship is damaged by a solar flare, which forces Walter to awaken the crew, upon which the Captain (James Franco in a very brief cameo role) is burned alive when his cryotube catches fire.Rounding out the crew are a strong cast of characters led by actors Billy Crudup (Oram), Katherine Waterston (Daniels), Danny McBride (Tennessee), Carmen Ejogo (Karine), Demian Bichir (Lope), Amy Siemetz (Faris), Callie Hernandez (Upworth), Jussie Smollett (Ricks), and Tess Haubrich (Rosenthal). In particular, Crudup, Waterston, and McBride shine as the mission leaders that everyone looks to guidance and support. But in general I enjoyed the believable chemistry of these characters as a real crew who had each others' backs. More laid back and less internal animosity than the original Alien crew, the Covenant crew is focused on settling down and finding a permanent home.The mission is sidetracked by a transmission on a nearby planet and the Covenant crew proceeds to investigate as well as scout the location as a contingency for a permanent home to colonize. As they investigate, they find a crash-landed ship, the one that David and Shaw escaped from LV-223 with. A couple of crew members also accidentally ingest alien spores, wreaking incredible havoc and putting the entire mission at risk. They also run into David himself, as he recounts exactly what happened to both him and Shaw upon escaping LV-223.Alien:Covenant is a very spare film, cutting to the chase immediately. There are no wasted moments or scenes. The running time feels just about right. The acting very convincing, whether it's during the routine, mundane moments or during the more exciting action sequences. The characters are refreshingly normal, identifiable and easy to root for. Fassbender is exceptional in the dual roles of Walter and David and the staging of the scenes when they play off each other is amazingly shot. Even with the ties to the Alien franchise, Covenant is very much an entertaining movie-watching experience in it's own right. Is it as great as Alien? Of course not, no film in the franchise is or ever will be. But this film feels like the first one that truly follows up the original film and pays tribute to it's brilliance.",Alien - Covenant
117,thekarmicnomad,The Thing meets Scream,7,14 May 2017,"A colony ship lands on a perfect looking planet, but it isn't long before people are having parasite issues.I have followed the franchise since the 80's so I have seen a lot of people sticking their faces into slimy giant eggs and consequently getting their chests burst.This episode takes a slightly different turn.A lot of the standard elements are here but it is presented in a horror/slasher movie kind of format. This is the most brutal and gory of all the films so far. The sound was awesome. Feeling the heavy crack of someone getting their jaw smashed off really brought the action home.This has a heavy slasher movie feel. There is a gratuitous decapitation, various mutilations, even a shower scene complete with side-boob shot.The movie was enjoyable enough but the story simple and the twists predictable. The Simon character adds a sinister edge.The effects are great. But the aliens are exposed a little too much. Even with the best CGI in the world a nine foot lizard negotiating a set of ladders just looks odd and fake.This was a good watch but I kind of expected a bit more, maybe my expectations for this ageing franchise are just too high now.",Alien - Covenant
118,Fernando-Rodrigues,Another prequel? Plss....,5,4 August 2021,"It's visually beautiful (tho not all the CGI FX are well-executed), but its script has dumb characters -I mean dumb like: the whole plot wouldn't exist if one of the characters didn't make a dumb decision at the beginning of the film- and all the sci-fi clichés. Maybe keeping with the events of Prometheus wasn't a good idea.",Alien - Covenant
119,one9eighty,"Good Prometheus sequel, average Alien prequel",6,12 February 2020,"In 2104, at least 10 years since the exploits of ""Prometheus"" occurred; a colonisation vessel responds to a radio signal coming from an Earth like planet and decides to change their destination from where they were originally intended to go in favour of this new planet. Things have been going wrong for the vessel and landing on the new planet it the next phase in things turning out bad. They are attacked by various Alien life forms, then they are saved by a familiar looking person, that person turns out to be less familiar to their expectations, more aliens attack, things go from bad to worse - queue the escape/ chase attempt.I liked this more than the previous film ""Prometheus"" as this looked and felt crisp and edgy -the first part of the film at least! After the first act, act 2 of the film leans heavily on the theoretical dribble that ""Prometheus"" touched upon, theorising existence and life. Much of the dialogue is led by the android David (Fassbender) as he attempts to educate his guests on the planet. Act 3 returns to its roots and becomes an ""Aliens"" kind of film, but recycles a lot of the content from those ""Alien"" films. There are chase sequences, jumps and scares, and tension as you anticipate if the humans will outwit their pre-Xenomorph alien stalkers. With the difference in the three acts the pace feels a little off beat, some of the script and dialogue also felt out of place, at times, it became predictable in places and it didn't flow continuously. A lot of the characters were un-relatable - assumedly there to die rather than to connect to the audience or to drive a theory or theme. I guess, at least the film looked ok! There were a lot of situations that unfolded that left me frustrated and shouting at the screen, either at the characters decisions or something that broke the alien canon (or continuation in the films). I know that things occurred to scare or thrill the audience, but I couldn't help but get frustrated - it's like when victims run upstairs in houses when chased by knife wielding maniacs - it has to happen, but that doesn't stop me being frustrated. Perhaps my criticism is derived from my passion for the franchise and the hope that something would affect me the way the first two alien films affected me - but I have to be realistic, cinema has moved on, audiences are different - perhaps my expectations should be too.All in all, it was a decent film, I personally expected and hoped for more, but it was still a decent sci-fi horror film. I'd give this 6 out of 10 - it follows on from ""Prometheus"" with a better (albeit average) film, it (very loosely) kind of embeds itself as a prequel to ""Alien"" - but for me could have been oodles better - I'll still re-watch it a few times in the future though.",Alien - Covenant
120,sergelamarche,Too stupid,4,2 October 2018,There is just too many stupid things done pretty early to make it enjoyable. The monster movie of aliens loses by having monsters with too much power and reproducing much too quickly. The humans are mostly dumb in this.,Alien - Covenant
121,rockman182,Alien: Covenant (2017),6,20 May 2017,"Ridley Scott's Alien is one of the greatest sci-fi horror experiences of all time. This is generally widely accepted. The Xenomorph is also a legendary movie monster. Ridley's had a period of time where he has been shaky in bringing forth quality films. While I did enjoy Prometheus for the most part, it was most certainly flawed. It was still interesting so I was always going to check out Covenant no matter what. I'm too big a fan of the first two Alien films to not watch this. Overall, this is a decent film but I feel like its filled with many problems and questions.This film takes place after the events of Prometheus. There is a crew heading to a planet to colonize but along the way they receive a strange transmission and decide to land on the closest planet from which the transmission came from. They immediately realize that the planet is hostile and two crew members soon get immediately infected and our favorite chest bursters come through. The film is set up as a sequel to Prometheus and apparently Ridley plans to make more films to tie into the original Alien.I'm not sure how I feel about more films. This film was decent at best. The cinematography is excellent and the set design is great. You get a feel for the space adventure and also the desolate planet in ruins. The xenomorphs or neomorphs or what have you, look good for the most part. However, the initial first alien that pops out did look computerized. That entire scene should be praised though. Its horrific, gruesome, and frenetic. You are with the characters not knowing what the heck is going to happen and it all comes at you fast. Sadly, a lot of the rest isn't as fun.Its hard to care for the many characters who drudge along through a good thirty minutes of the film which become a bore. There are many characters, half of which are so underwritten. Katherine Waterston was good, a rising star who has a future as a Ellen Ripley-esque female protagonist/hero. Fassbender was also fantastic as two dueling androids. David is an eloquent villain, with a struggle for rebelling against his creators. He's actually a sadistic villain. A lot of scenes in the film feel like they were placed to pad the running time.The film doesn't always introduce anything new as the film feels like it borrows a lot from the previous Alien installments. I don't think this film is any better than Prometheus. With Prometheus we got a methodical origin story that took things slowly but was serving of introducing new concepts to the Alien universe. This one tries that with a half developed plot and then compensates the rest with sci-fi bloody violence (which I don't mind). While the action scenes won't let you down, its hard to defend a plot that just brings up more questions. I can't state any of the questions as they fall into the spoiler category. I just hope Ridley ends the Alien story soon because its not getting any better as it goes along.6/10",Alien - Covenant

123,khanbaliq2,Alien: Covenant is a notch better than the expertly crafted but underwhelming Prometheus.,6,9 September 2017,"Is Alien: Covenant (2017) really that bad? I did say that it's a disappointing film. What I meant by this is that it's just disappointing and not terrible. In my view, Covenant is a slightly better film than Prometheus (2012) because it makes a little more sense. A few people said to me that they kind of like Covenant. I can understand why they think that. Covenant is entertaining, and it does make more sense than Prometheus, but it also has some of the same problems. Because Covenant is a film by director Ridley Scott, it's a given that it looks very good. And, honestly, I'd like for him to make a sequel to Covenant. I'm a little interested in what he might be able to do with a sequel.The biggest disappointment of this year at the cinema for me was the film It, which was directed by Andy Muschietti. It didn't even seem like a film to me. More like a collection of nonsense. I can't believe that so many people are praising this film. Sure, it's kind of entertaining, the acting is fine, and there's some humor, but this is where the good stuff ends. And, unfortunately, I fell for the hype. I had a good feeling that I'd be somewhat disappointed by this film because it's hard to adapt Stephen King's thick novel to film, but I didn't think that it would be such a mess. Now I understand why Cary Fukunaga dropped out during the production phase. It seems that he intended to make a good film that respected the material in the novel. The film that we got in the end has few similarities with the novel. What made my viewing experience worse is the fact that I finished reading the novel just several days earlier. It was still fresh in my mind, and I remembered pretty much everything that happened in the novel. When I was watching the film, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. There was plenty of swearing that isn't in the novel. There's no explanation of who Pennywise is. The film is set in 1989, but the filmmakers still decided to make the characters do what they did in 1958. This doesn't work at all. I can't imagine children, and even grownups, behaving like this in the 1980s! I still can't believe that I wasted my money and time on this turd. Avoid it!So, I finally finished listening to the audiobook of Stephen King's It. It took quite some time because it's about 45 hours long. I didn't get as much enjoyment out of the novel as I did when I read it years ago. I still enjoyed listening to most of it, especially the first half, in which King explains the history of Derry. It's when the reader doesn't yet know what It is. The novel is by no means a masterpiece, and I don't like a few aspects of King's writing, but It still seems pretty good to me after all these years. Now that I'm done with It, I'm listening to Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Idiot, which is a novel that I've wanted to read for quite some time. Instead of reading The Idiot, I decided to listen to the audiobook since I had a few credits to spend. What's also worth noting is that I've noticed a rather interesting trend in American fiction of the 1980s. I'm now reading a few American science-fiction novels from the 1980s, and something that pops up even in the genre of science-fiction of this period is anti-Soviet propaganda. I'm sure that many people know about the writer Tom Clancy, about the fact that his novels are pretty much anti-Soviet, pro-American military propaganda. Well, all of this isn't a coincidence. The fact that Ronald Reagan praised Clancy's propaganda novel The Hunt for Red October (1984) wasn't a coincidence too. As historian Andrei Fursov explained, the Americans, when Reagan was president, intentionally raised tensions with the Soviet Union. The Americans released a lot of offensive anti-Soviet propaganda in the 1980s. The fact that Hollywood released many action films in the 1980s also wasn't a coincidence. The Americans were intentionally trying to create an atmosphere of tension, violence, and confrontation. They did this because they had a strategy of trying to weaken the Soviet Union and possibly cause it to collapse. It's because they saw this as one of two ways of getting out of the economic crisis that was affecting the West since the early-1970s. The other way for them was war. In the end, we all know that the Americans succeeded, thanks to people like Mikhail Gorbachev. The collapse of the Soviet Union allowed the capitalist ruling class of the West to postpone a serious economic crisis until 2008.",Alien - Covenant
124,RforFilm,Alien: Covenant serves to be a fun blockbuster about the xenomorphs rather then a groundbreaking game changer that Alien was,6,19 May 2017,"A couple of years ago, Ridley Scott returned to the Alien franchise  with Prometheus. The movie was meant to be a story set within the same  universe to dive into some of the more mysterious elements of Alien  like the fossilized space-jockeys and what they were doing with a bunch  of facehugger eggs. The response from fans was mixed. Some thought it a  nice return to what made the Alien series work. Some thought it was a  boring and pretentious story that only asked more question. I still  stand by the beauty of Prometheus and the material that it expands  upon.  The newest movie is something of a response from Scott to some of the  complaints from before like the lack of xenomorphs and more of a  connection to the earlier films. I think Scott realized that in order  to keep his fanbase, he had to be sure that the new stories wouldn't  steer too far from the original. The problem that I see is that despite  the addition of new characters and more background on the company that  wants the alien, the film is going to succumb to it's horror-like  slasher clichés. Does Alien: Covenant add anything new to this world?  In 2104, a ship called the Covenant is bound for a remote planet for a  colony mission. Though the overall trip is being maintained by android  Walter (played by Michael Fassbender), the crew, the two thousand  colonists and a thousand embryos have remained in hyper sleep for some  time. A sudden neutrino storm hits the ship, forcing the computer to  awaken the crew and stabilize the craft, but not before the captain  dies when his hyper sleep pod malfunctions. This makes Christopher Oram  (played by Billy Crudup) the new captain with his first orders to make  the necessary repairs to continue.  The ships picks up a signal from an unknown planet that not only seems  to be habitual for human use, but is close enough that the crew would  not have to go back to sleep. Despite objections from the former  captain's wife Dany (played by Katherine Waterston), the crew vote to  head down to explore the new region. Except for the pilot Tennessee  (played by Danny McBride) whose still in space, the crew finds a world  that seems to be breathable along with plentiful sources of water. They  then come across a similar ship that had been found in Alien and  Prometheus. Looks like we've got trouble.   I can already say that Alien: Covenant is an entertaining movie that's  ultimately good. Good but not great. In fact, this has the same  distinction of the original Alien where the first half, before the  aliens appear, being better then the action orientated second half. A  lot of that has to do with the fact that Scott not only knows how to  build a high sense of mysteriousness with such a beautifully shot world  to dive into, but he always casts well to build a set of likable  characters.   Much of what we see deals with the relationships the characters have  with each other and their significant others. Danny McBride and Michael  Fassbender bring a lot of needed humanity and occasional humor. The  only one who I wanted more time with was Dany. You get a background of  her, but I don't know what I could tell you of her personality.   Without giving anything away, the plot dwells into territory that makes  it an interesting sequel to Prometheus. We definitely get some more  answers about the past of the space-jockeys and even some background on  the xenomorphs. This unfortunately does clash with some of the  established continuity.   The xenomorphs looks amazing and are fun to watch as they make their  kills. Scott still understands the rule that you never give away too  much too soon. I wish that not only more new elements were brought to  the monster, but the final fight does seem too familiar of the previous  films. It gets trapped within its own slasher tropes when you can kind  of tell which characters are going to die. I would think that Scott  would be able to bring a new spin to how the Alien movies can conclude.  I'll give this six facehuggers out of ten. Rather then offering a major  game changer to the science fiction genre, Ridley Scott has given us an  entertaining Alien movie. There's nothing wrong with a movie that seems  to exist to make the fans happy and I hope this entertains a lot of  people. Take a look for yourself (but watch out for the facehuggers).",Alien - Covenant

Well, I have good reasons to think Sir Ridley Scott at least would like the idea! If you need the explanation of this dull sarcasm, I hate Alien: Covenant. I kind of hated Prometheus too, but I cut it some slack because of its solid first act and the attempt to do something novel and ambitious, even if it FAILED MISERABLY.This is Prometheus all over again, now without the benefit of the doubt. My sense of dread set in ten minutes into the movie, when a space mission sent to colonize a faraway planet (you know, the kind THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE plan ahead in detail FOR DECADES) changes destination mid-route to another world they stumble into - like when you go out to eat sushi and decide halfway through you feel like pizza instead.They land - without spacesuits, because Dallas was a wimp to be afraid of breathing ammonia and unknown alien pathogens - and it's all downhill from there: schlock, stupidity, one of the most obvious twists I recall in a major production, awful characterization. The *only* individual the movie seems interested in is Fassbender's android David, while everyone else is just a name, a face and (occasionally) a single element of backstory (ranging from ""dead husband"" to ""wears hat"").And even David isn't that deep. His character premise - the android with a god complex - is neat on paper, but the execution doesn't make a lot of sense. Why would a sophisticated being who styles himself after Lawrence of Arabia and relishes music and poetry regard as a perfect organism a carnivorous, mute, drooling parasite? It made sense for cold, pragmatic Ash, not for this grandstanding guy - it would have been more logic, for example, to have David betray mankind for the more advanced Engineers. Congratulations, Covenant: you have *one* character arc and it falls apart under scrutiny.Most of this would be forgivable if Covenant was exceptionally well-crafted but, while the movie looks fine in terms of production values, the Xenomorph set-pieces are bland (except the first one, which does have some tension), revealing a lack of interest on Scott's behalf. He clearly enjoys lingering on David's shenanigans; almost everything else is stale routine. In fact, Scott seems to identify with the android, supposedly his directorial avatar as a dark genius creator of nightmares. Sadly, he's more like Billy Crudup's misguided captain, foolishly altering an original plan which was just fine, then making a botch of it and sticking his hands and face where he's not supposed to.Fans (rightly) gave George Lucas crap for turning the Force into bacteria in the Star Wars prequels... but at least those were just a couple lines of dialogue. Ridley Scott is making movie after movie ABOUT his own Midichlorians. Every time in Covenant you see a kernel of cosmic horror (like an alien necropolis with thousands of corpses), the movie goes out of its way to make it lame (oh, it was David who bombed them with his bio-weapon in a ten-seconds genocide). Guess what was the best thing about Alien, Ridley? Its lack of explanations. The way it hinted at a Lovecraftian universe full of mysterious threats. Now we know it was a smug villainous android who... for shame, man. 4/10 As a Prometheus sequel, it's baffling (former protagonist Noomi Rapace gets five seconds of screen time as a corpse); as an Alien prequel (something which, frankly, should never have been done) it's also a mess, as the Xenomorph action/horror material is lackluster.",Alien - Covenant
127,Anurag-Shetty,Far more superior than its predecessor.,9,22 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant tells the story of a group of scientists & explorers on-board a colony ship, headed for a distant planet. On their way to the planet, they find another unexplored paradise. They decide to find out if this undiscovered planet, is good for colonization. However, this unknown territory turns out to be a living nightmare. Now, it is up to the crew of the colony ship known as Covenant, to attempt a daring escape. Alien: Covenant is a mind blowing film. I liked it far better than Prometheus(2012), which is the first movie in the Alien(1979) prequel trilogy. This movie is engaging from the get-go. It doesn't drag like its predecessor. Director Ridley Scott has made a sequel that finally answers all the nagging questions, that Prometheus(2012) left us with. The visual effects are fantastic. The action set pieces are unforgettable. There are one or two brilliantly executed jump scares, thanks to the titular character. My favorite scene is one which involves Michael Fassbender. I recommend that you give this flick a miss, if you hate extreme violence & gore. One minor flaw is, the climax of the film is predictable. The performances by the principle cast is flawless, with strong support from the secondary characters. Michael Fassbender is scintillating as David/Walter. Fassbender steals the show, in every scene he's in. Katherine Waterston is spectacular as Daniels. Billy Crudup is great as Oram. Danny McBride is outstanding in his first ever dramatic performance, as Tennessee. Demian Bichir is impressive as Lope. Carmen Ejogo, Jussie Smollett, Callie Hernandez, Amy Seimetz, Nathaniel Dean, Alexander England, Benjamin Rigby, Uli Latukefu, Tess Haubrich & Lorelei King are good as Karine, Ricks, Upworth, Faris, Hallett, Ankor, Ledward, Cole, Rosenthal & Voice of 'Mother', respectively. Alien: Covenant is a must watch, for fans of sci-fi/horror movies & fans of the Alien franchise. Watch it on the big screen, as it will be a much better viewing experience.",Alien - Covenant
128,bankofmarquis,"Come for the face-hugging, stay for the ""deep thoughts""",8,24 May 2017,"Did you like the ALIEN prequel PROMETHEUS that came out in 2012?  If the answer is ""yes"", then you'll like it's sequel ALIEN:COVENANT.  If you didn't (or didn't see it), then you might not.Director Ridley Scott has done a very fine job of expanding on the universe that he first created in 1979's ALIEN.  With PROMETHEUS, he set the stage that will (eventually, I am told) connect up with ALIEN.  With ALIEN: COVENANT, Scott continues the story (picking up about 10 years after the events of PROMETHEUS) and grows on his promise.  I found this movie to be interesting, exciting and chilling - I also was glad that I viewed PROMETHEUS the night before, for there was quite a few connections between the two.Starting with the work of the great Michael Fassbender (the greatest actor working today, IMHO).  He picks up where he left off in PROMETHEUS, reprising his role as android David, while also populating another android, Walter.  After seeing COVENANT, I now see why Fassbender decided to do these movies.  His two androids are distinct characters, with great similarities.  Fassbender is the heart and soul of this film and his performance here makes PROMETHEUS better as well.  These films, these characters,  Director Scott and writer Dan O'Bannon mine the ideas of creation, evolution and what it means to be human.All these ""deep thoughts"" in an ALIEN film?  Yes!  And...it is also gorgeously shot - which helps tremendously.But, you might ask,  what about Aliens ripping humans to shreds?There's plenty of that as well and is cast accordingly.Besides Fassbender, the rest of the cast is populated by fairly significant names in forgettable ""Red Shirt"" roles (a ""red shirt"" role is someone who is just there to be used as victims to the monster/killer/villain).  Katherine Waterston (FANTASTIC BEASTS) underwhelms in her role as the Sigourney Weaver-esque lead heroine.  I have not been impressed with her so far.  It made me miss Noomi Rapace of the first film.  Billy Cruddup is underwritten and underused as the 1st Officer of the COVENANT who is thrust into Captaincy.  Demian Becher, Carmen Ejogo and Callie Hernandez were also hampered by underwritten and underutilized characters, while only comedian Danny McBride jumps off the screen as pilot Tennessee.  One last note - why was James Franco in this film?  I can only think that his character just might pop up in a future Alien film.But these underwritten, underused characters/actors is not a big deal, for this movie isn't about these folks.  It is about Fassbender diving into the deeper issues and Aliens ripping these people apart - and rip these people apart these Aliens do!  If you come to this movie looking for face huggers, Xenomorphs and creatures bursting forth from within humans, then you will be rewarded.You will also be treated to an unexpected deep dive into deep subjects by a fantastic actor and director and writer who are at the top of their respective games.Letter Grade:  B+ (but it's an acquired taste).8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Alien - Covenant
129,rbrb,Downhill and boring after the first few minutes.....,2,19 May 2017,"Most of this movie is muddled, unconvincing with a cast of plain uninteresting performers. Many of whom look like each other.Near the start of the film not only did I lose interest in it but was unable to understand what on earth (or rather in the heavens) this poor picture was all about. It was only after viewing it that I was told and read about the film and then it started to make a little sense.The story is meant to show events prior to those depicted in the original 'Alien' film.In brief, a synthetic human is really out to get the human race.Nothing memorable in the flick, deserving only 1 and a half rounded up as the opening sequence is the highlight:2/10.",Alien - Covenant
130,fernandoschiavi,"With philosophical aspects that never get more accurate, the film fail to envolve the viewers. We only find missed opportunities and introductions spoiled by their development",7,7 November 2020,"Over the years, the Alien franchise has suffered at the hands of different directors and producers, to the point where it has been buried over the years, with some resurrection attempts, like the tenebrous Alien vs. Alien. Predator. It was only with Prometheus that the franchise returned to the hands of its creator, who chose to explain the origins of the xenomorph through a complex plot that, in the end, did not deliver even half of what it promised.
At first, it is the director's most efficient film, which rescues elements that made the series so important. In short, Scott does not invent abstract metaphysical concepts with many, many puzzles. In Covenant, he brings a more cohesive story, a pleasant look, visceral scenes and still trying to answer the questions left in Prometheus in a pragmatic but at least convincing way. Similar to Prometheus and the first Alien, Covenant has a more cadenced beginning, which knows how to build the relationship of the ship's crew, even though they remain very shallow throughout the work. I already say that, at no time, do we feel any kind of connection with the protagonist Daniels, experienced by Katherine Waterston, to the point that, in many aspects, she does not seem to be the main character of the work. We see, therefore, each one of these individuals as cannon fodder and we are more curious to see how they will find their end than we actually hope for their success.
Even so, this slower pace manages to involve us, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty, of suspense, which gradually increases as this new location is unveiled. That said, when the ""neomorph"" (the white alien with translucent skin) appears, he is automatically seen as a strong element of terror. Ridley Scott seeks to continue the origin story of the xenomorph, taking long strides along the projection, wasting that creature completely. We have a plot becoming unnecessarily complex, generating doubts in the viewer that are never resolved. These questions, however, come to be seen as things that do not make sense, since the text by John Logan and Dante Harper introduces elements that are never developed, making them sound lost along the narrative progression. The attempt to insert philosophical questions, with ideas thrown in the wind, never being rescued.As a result, the work is divided into acts so distinct that they cause clear narrative ruptures, impairing the rhythm of the entire projection. Alien: Covenant becomes tiring and we cannot help feeling a twinge of sadness when contemplating the good things that the film introduces, being deconstructed as we progress in the plot. As if that weren't enough, Scott's decoupage starts to show more than it should and the terror built in the first third gives way to purely generic action, which has no effect on the viewer since, as previously mentioned, we do not create any link with the characters. The first act is clearly Scott's return to his roots. His ability to conduct the suspense in the scene until the death of a character seems to continue to work, but it should be more used and sought after. In the following acts it is another continuation of Prometheus' narrative, filled with flashbacks and a spectacular photograph.In addition to the disinterest with which Scott thinks and performs his horror scenes, the underutilization of the great cast is added. Even though it is a film with an almost slasher proposal, where we see each of the characters being killed after the other, there is a construction so flawed that many of them don't even have their name revealed, becoming caricatured and expressionless figures. The participation of actor James Franco is a giant question and actress Katherine Waterston shrinks the whole length and only reacts, in a forced and abrupt way, in the end. Another character who carries the burden of two-dimensionality is that of Captain Oram (Billy Crudup), who is also a kind of ""shepherd"", and who commits most of the absurd messes contained in the feature. With the addition of being the bore that carries the uncomfortable and useless - in the plot - ""torch of faith"", throughout his participation.If the rest only serves to be monster food, the exceptions are the ""twin"" robots David and Walter, competently interpreted by Fassbender and who are basically alter-egos for each other and take the plot of the film forward. The search for the creation of the past continues, only now with David taking the reins, while Walter, who is a more modern and less passionate version of David, serves his creators faithfully and blindly. The actor makes the best androids that the franchise has ever had, in a feature film that ends up consummating a trend that has been seen since 1979: Alien androids are the channels of all the discussion that the films promote about the approach of man to God, in which the murderous creature of space personifies divine punishment. It is no accident that Scott returned to the franchise taking the Prometheus myth to himself, and Fassbender manages to give his characters the tragic dimension that this dialogue with Greco-Roman grandeur demands. However, while Prometheus still had a philosophical base of his own, throwing open questions to the debate, Covenant doesn't even open up that space, being held hostage to a plot that doesn't have a major conflict and serves only as a random spatial slasher.
Technically, the feature is also unstable. The locations in Sydney, Australia, the art direction, the sound design and the soundtrack, especially in the use of silence and the incidental soundtrack at times are impeccable. The tension grows, the audience gets scared and everything ends up flowing perfectly. The same cannot be said of special effects. Especially those involved in the creatures. There are two types of monsters in the story and none of them appear to have any real weight or tangibility. The choice of the new characterization of the classic Xenomorph, using a high-tech model is a mistake both visually and in its narrative. It gains a new ""origin"" that is too confusing and complex, which ends up heading towards the main question of the film - why does a creator make his creature? - but it doesn't even reach half of its goal. Its movement is mechanical and artificial, and it appears for much less time than expected. The terror and graphic violence, so present in the first two films of the franchise and even Prometheus is diluted here. There is one scene in particular, where some revelations about David's purpose are made and she can't even cause feelings like hate or disgust, as they should.Alien: Covenant is far below the 1979 film as an experience of horror and claustrophobia, and in the end it ends up serving a very functional purpose of filling gaps that until today have been filled with dread and mystery. It is still ironic that, by ending the charms that surround Alien, the film takes away the meaning of the very name Xenomorph. Even in the end, the film does not give up on unnecessarily prolonging the story. A first moment of these final minutes, is that the film practically ends, but they preferred to prolong more that was already boring, to have one more or another scene involving the classic Xenomorph, in an attempt to make some sense of the film having Alien in the title. The other point that is totally unnecessary for this ending is in relation to a plot twist, which brings an attenuated dimension of terror and action that ends in a predictable and poorly constructed way.What also stands out in the public eye is the lack of answers to the many questions asked by Prometheus. Instead of showing what happened at the end of the previous film and developing the character Elizabeth Shaw and the Engineers and, of course, trying to evoke some sense for its realization, Covenant makes the mistake of explaining it to the audience without showing it, giving the idea of that the previous film is completely unnecessary for the franchise. But the main problem with Alien: Covenant is the indecisiveness of what the film wants to be. It is not a slasher film, because it takes too long for the creature to start extermination. It is not an efficient horror film, because the plot cannot decide what story it wants to tell. It is not even known for sure what genre the film intends to be. The work is unable to establish itself either as suspense, nor as terror, nor even as an action film, playing with the three genres without truly delving into them. There is no emotional investment by the characters, there is no sense of horror and fear making us jump out of the seats and all the twists and turns are flawed, either because they are too predictable or because they have no construction. And while the audience really became angry with Prometheus for over-promising and under-fulfilling, the same problem may return in this sixth film in the series, which despite having Alien in the title, gives far less focus to the alien monster than it deserved.With philosophical aspects that never get more accurate, the film falls into the same trap as Prometheus, evoking the inevitable comparison with what came before and, as a result, establishes at a level much lower than the first two Alien. Even analyzing it as a self-contained work (which never happens at any time), the long failure to involve the viewer, who, of course, cannot expect the same pioneering spirit as Alien, but who can and must aim for a well-known story told. What we gain are missed opportunities, introductions spoiled by their development and nothing more. It is a film with two sides. As a sequel to Prometheus, questions will remain in the viewer's mind. Like a terror in space, Covenant is a structurally challenging film, which despite all its flaws.",Alien - Covenant

132,dave-mcclain,"""Alien: Covenant"" may lack the creativity of the last film and the freshness of the original, but it excels in action and terror.",8,16 May 2017,"Fans of the ""Fast & Furious"" and ""Star Wars"" franchises know that the release dates of those movies don't follow the same chronological order as the events portrayed (and there are short films and features in between) but those timelines have nothing on the ""Alien"" franchise. It all started simply enough: ""Alien"", a relatively low budget sci-fi horror flick released in 1979, thrilled, scared and shocked Movie Fans, while adding to the cultural consciousness the indelible image of a vicious, reptilian-like creature busting out of the chest of its human host, while also making Sigourney Weaver a household name as she played the iconic alien fighter Ellen Ripley in four of the movies. A new feature film from the ""Alien"" universe appeared every 5-7 years (not counting the ""Alien vs. Predator"" movies), leading up to 2017's ""Alien: Covenant"" (R, 2:02), which, in some ways, returns the franchise to its storied roots.After the ""Alien"" sequels, ""Aliens"", ""Alien 3"" and ""Alien: Resurrection"" (each of the four with a different director), original helmer Ridley Scott returned to the franchise for a prequel series. 2012's ""Prometheus"" began exploring the question of how the Aliens originated. That was an excellent film, but was more ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" than ""Aliens"", for example, and it did a great job of setting up the films to come. From 2012-2017, ten(!) short films came out to fill gaps in the Alien story, with two of them leading straight into ""Alien: Covenant"". A small amount of footage from those two films (known collectively as ""Alien: Covenant – Prologue"") are used in the 2017 feature and in its theatrical trailers. In the ""Alien"" universe, this film is a sequel to ""Prometheus"" and leads fans closer to the events of the original film. In ""Star Wars"" terms, it's the equivalent of ""Episode II - Attack of the Clones"", but better.Taking place ten years after the events in ""Prometheus"", this film follows a colony ship, called the Covenant, heading toward the other side of the galaxy. On board are 2,000 colonists in a deep stasis, 1,000 human embryos, a dozen crew members and a synthetic android named Walter (Michael Fassbender), an advanced version of the synthetic known as David in the previous film. On their way to a planet called Origae-6, the ship is hit by shockwave, causing significant damage and leading Walter to awaken the crew. In the process, the captain (James Franco) dies and first officer Christopher Oram (Billy Crudup) assumes command of the Covenant. As the crew is coming to terms with what has happened and working to repair the ship, they receive a radio transmission that appears to be human in origin. The planet that is the source of the transmission appears to be an even more hospitable spot for their new colony, so rather than wait another seven years to arrive at Origae-6, Oram decides to check it out.As the Covenant, piloted by the cowboy hat-wearing Tennessee (Danny McBride) orbits this new planet, most of the crew takes a lander down to the planet's surface. The expedition consists of acting captain Oram, his wife, biologist Karen Oram (Carmen Ejogo), a terraforming expert named Daniels (Katherine Waterston), security head Sergeant Lope (Demián Bichir), members of his team and a couple others. While exploring the area around their landing site and beginning to evaluate the planet for possible human habitation, their discoveries range from odd to shocking to deadly. There are signs of human cultivation of what appears to be wheat, but at the same time there are no signs of animals or birds. The expedition finds the crashed ship Prometheus, along with the fully functioning David, who says that Elizabeth Shaw (the sole human survivor of the doomed ship) repaired the injuries he sustained on that earlier mission. Something else that the crew of the Covenant finds are alien spores which, if they enter a human host, result in the birth of vicious creatures which are very new to the unfortunate souls of the Covenant – and will also be somewhat new to Movie Fans. Thus begins a desperate struggle for survival.""Alien: Covenant"" is a worthy and exciting addition to the ""Alien"" franchise. Making this set of deep space travelers colonists who all have significant others on the ship raises the emotional stakes for the characters and for the audience. The interactions between the twin synthetic androids from different generations makes for a fascinating subplot, partly because of the acting prowess of Fassbender, who, along with the rest of the cast contribute to a talented ensemble who all deliver excellent performances. The story effectively builds on ""Prometheus"" and towards ""Alien"" with a flare that ups the franchise ante on horror and gore, while the wicked twists wonderfully tease a sequel. This film, however, can't really be said to be very ""original"". Besides the intended connections to ""Prometheus"" and the ""Alien"" movies, it's also a bit of 2016's ""Passengers"" meets 1991's ""Terminator 2"". ""Alien: Covenant"" may lack the creativity of the last film and the freshness of the original, but it excels in action and terror. ""A-""",Alien - Covenant
133,joebloggscity,Alien - Really tries to bring the franchise back on track but still not there,6,22 December 2017,"I really wanted to give this a chance. I hated Prometheus, despite being a fan of the original Alien films like many others (AvP should be best hid away).As for this new prequel/origins movie, well it has a lot to dig itself out of after the awful Prometheus film. Taking its cue from the first Alien movie, we have a group of humans on way to a planet (in this case to a new Eden), only to be stopped early to find themselves investigating a mysterious planet. Turns out it is where the survivors from Prometheus are.What we have is the original android as evil & conniving as ever, playing God, and it's hell for the humans. We actually don't get that much alien involvement, not really. Yes the special effects are good, and camera work great, the acting great etc etc.But the story is poor, and I couldn't muster enough into the cod-philosophical questions it was maybe trying to attempt. Some of the twists were too obvious, and the film wasn't helped by a group of the dumbest scientists I've seen on film since well... Prometheus! Lots of holes in this one, it's fine to watch if on free to air, otherwise give it a miss.This film could be another nail in the franchise coffin, but you know it will be brought back up again somehow.",Alien - Covenant

No idea how many Alien movies have followed since, but probably seen all of them at some point. After the 2 classic original movies the others have varied between average and terrible and Alien: Covenant follows suit. The movie feels like they have stolen various bits from the other movies and re shot them into a new movie. Many of the scenes certainly echo scenes from earlier movies. The plot sees the colony ship interrupted on its journey by a storm in space and then decide to seek out a new life on an unplanned planet that looks suitable. Michael Fassbender is probably the most entertaining aspect of the movie. There isn't a Sigourney Weaver in the movie though.",Alien - Covenant
135,Vivekmaru45,A disappointing movie which I saved to watch on my birthday.,3,14 September 2017,"I was utterly let down. Director Ridley Scott achieved cult status for his 1979 film Alien. Subsequent sequels were directed by James Cameron(Aliens 1986), David Fincher(Alien 3 1992) and Jean-Pierre Jeunet(Alien Resurrection 1997). Alien Resurrection was meant as a homage to all the fans of Alien who were offended by Ripley's death scene in Alien 3.This film is the third Alien film directed by Ridley Scott and follows events after his film Prometheus(2012).In 2104, 11 years after the Prometheus expedition, the colonization-ship Covenant is bound for a remote planet, Origae-6, with two thousand colonists and 1,140 human embryos aboard. The ship is monitored by Walter, a newer android model that physically resembles David. A stellar neutrino burst damages the ship, killing 40 colonists. Walter orders the ship's computer to wake the crew, which includes several married couples, from stasis. The ship's captain, Jake Branson, is burned alive when his stasis pod malfunctions. While repairing the ship, the crew picks up a radio transmission from a nearby, habitable planet. Against the objections of Daniels (Branson's widow), the new captain, Oram, decides to investigate. Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict. The casting of the film yet again is atrocious. None of the actors, except Michael Fassbender who plays the role of the android David shine. Katherine Waterston is not in the same league as Sigourney Weaver who became a household name as Ellen Ripley. If you think about it, Prometheus turns out to be a better film than Covenant and with a slightly better cast. Special effects try to be innovative and unique but still I was not impressed. The aliens portrayed in the film are mostly biped and more human-like.I also disliked the script which seemed dull to me and also left a lot of holes. The android in the film David was thoroughly incapacitated and destroyed in Prometheus. Only his head part remained functional. Here he appears fully restored and by whom? David plays the same role as Ash(Ian Holm) in Alien(1979). The sound effects are decent the overture score in Prometheus is yet again played in this film. Cinematography and editing is not overly impressive.Now comes the main question: has this film an element of horror. Yes. And also very disturbing. Perhaps this is the most horrific chapter of Alien ever directed. But overall, in rewatchability - it fails. Why on earth would I want to watch a run-of-the-mill toilet-paper Hollywood movie again. Just flush(to outer-space preferably).",Alien - Covenant
136,MihaiSorinToma,A bad example of a Horror/Sci-Fi Movie,5,20 May 2017,"After being woken by an unexpected event from their sleep, the crew of colonization ship Covenant decide to follow a vague signal which might lead them to new, better home. They find a planet which seems to look a lot like earth, appearing to be very hospitable, almost too good to be true. Unprepared for what they're about to find, they advance into the wilderness. From there, a terrible fight for survival will commence, testing each of the remaining crew members to their limits, in their attempt to flee the dangerous planet.Although it seemed to have a very good premise and plot, this movie proves very quick that it hasn't learned anything from the mistakes of its predecessor, Prometheus, insisting to follow its exact footsteps, sometimes even managing to be worse. This movie is exactly as the majority of horror movies out there, determined to insult the viewer's intelligence with almost every action it depicts. You cannot send a team of people who are supposed to colonize an unknown planet without any protection, without basic intelligence or even common sense. They don't wear any helmets, they seem to think that they're on earth and even think that is a very good idea to wash their faces in the first pond they can find. Ironically, from that pond, they take water samples to check in the laboratory if it was contaminated in any way.The level of stupidity of the characters is simply insulting and unacceptable. If they had taken random people from the streets, the odds are surely higher to find more capable and less idiotic people. Besides this enormous downside, the plot is mediocre to say the least, bringing nothing out of the ordinary, which is simply not enough to make it interesting. The only upside is the CGI, which is very good in the movie's context, managing to raise, but only a bit, the film from the misery that covers it.Given the overall impression this movie left, I can say that it is a bad movie which is not worth your time and especially your money.",Alien - Covenant

Daniels (Katherine Waterson) has reservations about this unvetted planet but goes along with the crew when they head down to the surface as well as the android Walter (Michael Fassbender).

As the crew waits out a storm, they are slowly picked off by the creature. Lope (Demian Bichir) manages to establish contact, and Daniels instruct Tennessee to bring down a cargo loader that they can use to escape the hostile planet.

142,Carycomic,Just got back from Opening Night. Pretty good attendance! About 26 people.,7,19 May 2017,"True! Not exactly a packed house. But still a lot better than the attendance for SMURFS: TLV and the golden anniversary re-release of THE GRADUATE put together. At least, where my hometown multiplex is concerned.So, how to summarize the story without total spoilage.Well, let's just say it takes place in the early 22nd century. That it quickly becomes a cross between PROMETHEUS and PASSENGERS. That we get to see a short prologue with Michael Fassbender and Guy Pearce reprising their roles as David the Android and Peter Weyland, respectively. And that we also get to see the Engineers' home world (or,at the very least, one of their major colonies)!I just wish their had been a few more recognizable names in the cast. Well, more recognizable to me, anyway. For example, Katherine Waterston- -who plays Danni Branson, widow of the S. S. Covenant's captain--I initially mistook for Jennifer Lawrence, co-star of PASSENGERS! So, it's kind of a mixed blessing when I say that she did _not_ remind me of Ellen Ripley, in any way/shape/form.There are also a few nods to ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. But frankly, I think they hinder more than help. Especially, the over-reliance on classical music! So, while it's an entertaining time-killer, in general, I still can't shake the feeling that this particular film franchise might be running out of steam.",Alien - Covenant
143,brankovranjkovic,Explains the origin of the aliens!,8,14 May 2017,"Ridley Scott directs this Sci-fi horror, which is a sequel to Prometheus and prequel to the original film, that was made almost 40 years ago.The plot sees the crew of a colony ship (Covenant), on their 7 year journey to inhabit a remote planet. They pick up a distress signal from a nearby, unknown planet which also turns out to be perfectly habitable and a virtual 'Garden of Eden',they decide to explore. Pretty soon they discover this beautiful paradise is dangerous, several crew members are horrifically killed. Now they need to escape from this horrifying and isolated world, fast! The cinematography is amazing, the alien landscapes really sets the atmosphere perfectly. The level of gore is kept high and intense throughout the film. The performances are solid, particularly Michael Fassbender, who stole every scene with his portrayals of Walter and David synthetics.David genetically engineered the alien from numerous experiments and his need to explore the meaning of life. Ultimately David has cultivated a mind of his own and no longer wants to be subservient to mankind.This is a recommended, edge of your seat film with familiar Alien type gore moments.",Alien - Covenant
144,anselmdaniel,Disappointing,6,16 January 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Alien: Covenant is the indirect sequel to Prometheus and is directed by Ridley Scott. It stars Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, and Michael Fassbender. The story focuses on a crew that discovers the Engineer's homeworld as they explore it to check its habitability. On the way, they discover David from the Prometheus crew.First and foremost, the writing in this movie is significantly worse than its predecessor, Prometheus. Characters will do seemingly nonsensical actions that ultimately cause their deaths. It is as if the characters are written with their death scenes in mind first rather than having a backstory and character motivations. Characters are also aware of how dangerous the planet is, and they still endanger themselves and others by not doing anything sensible. One of the characters believes someone might be infected and upon receiving blood to her face, quarantines the others even when she may be infected as well. This action leads to her death in a rather ridiculous way. Another instance is the captain willingly following David even when he has shown to have ulterior motives into his laboratory. The captain is not surprisingly killed in a way any horror movie viewer can expect.The movie sets out to destroy any remnants of its prequel, Prometheus through Shaw's off screen death. What was Prometheus' more interesting character with an character and story arc setup is discarded for action and nonsensical deaths. I was looking forward to a continuation of the story and that is not found here.The directing and acting are decent enough for a full watch. However, the character actions are enough to be angry at this movie's use of actors. This movie could and should have been rewritten as the main story arc has now changed to David creating the xenomorphs.I do not recommend Alien: Covenant.Grade: D",Alien - Covenant

146,0w0,Not nearly as good as Prometheus,6,5 May 2020,"The characters in this film make SO MANY stupid, irrational and unrealistic decisions that it's not even funny. Sometimes you can excuse things like that, since if every character in every movie acted 'normally and rationally' then all movies would be significantly shorter in length than what they would otherwise have been... but it just happens a lot in this movie and it honestly creates a bunch of plot-holes and contribute to poor writing and a poor plot.I liked Prometheus (I give it an 8/10), but the pacing and story of this movie is just so wrong that it's not enjoyable (apart from the plot-holes in this one).*Spoiler ahead if you haven't watched Prometheus yet:* In Prometheus, at the end, the robot's head is ripped clean off his body, yet in this movie, the one robot gets injured in the neck area, and then he completely shuts down... Now that makes zero sense, since we already know that these robots can survive with JUST their head... so why the robot shutdown if he just received an injury to the neck? That's a pretty big plot-hole in this movie.Overall, this movie could have been very good and maybe even as good as Prometheus, but the idiotic choices made by the characters and the plot-holes, just make this movie bad and not really worth watching even.",Alien - Covenant

148,MrDHWong,A successful return to the series' horror/sci-fi roots,8,11 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant is the sixth installment in the Alien franchise and the sequel to the 2012 film Prometheus. Once again directed by Ridley Scott, this film marks the series' successful return to its horror/sci-fi roots that has been absent for some time.In the year 2104, the crew of the colony spaceship Covenant receive a radio transmission from a nearby uncharted planet and decide to travel there to investigate. Upon arriving there, they discover that the planet appears to be perfectly habitable and an ideal place for possible human colonisation. However, after closer inspection, the crew make a terrifying discovery that this seemingly perfect utopia is not what it seems on the surface.Expanding upon some of the philosophical themes first brought up in Prometheus and even answering a couple of confusing questions that film previously raised, Alien: Covenant is a worthy entry in the franchise and a huge improvement over what the series was turning into. Director Ridley Scott makes full use of the scenic planetary landscape to make this environment believable and realistic for human habitation. The threat of the Aliens feels real and the tense atmosphere makes the danger feel like a real possibility. This film also has a great deal more blood and gore effects than its predecessors, but most of it seems like tacky CGI rather than practical effects, I still miss the old practical look and feel of the original films. Like with Prometheus, most of the human characters are flat and uninteresting. It just seems as though most of the development went into the android characters of David and Walter (both Michael Fassbender) rather than the human crew.I rate it 8/10",Alien - Covenant

The huge spaceship can't the unknown signal is accepted, and the space suit can? Or the team lands on the unknown planet (which professionals, and everything have to know about colonization of new planets) without SPACE SUITS. And everything could be forgiven and told that the film was shot by the author Ridley Scott. But he contradicts himself.

150,Alexander_Blanchett,Ripley Clone Vol. 2,7,27 May 2017,"It was a good film and decent entry to the Alien franchise, however one of the weaker ones. I also preferred the previous ""Prometheus"" to it because it introduced me to a totally new mythology that interested me and that I wanted to see develop further. While it definitely develops the story, and especially Michael Fassbender's character David I was a bit disappointed because it just cuts so many promising ankles up. I did like the idea to connect it more to the original Alien franchise but I hoped for more Alien action. The film wastes too much time to introduce mediocre and uninteresting characters. Then releases a different kind of alien which is rather lame tho (well at least there were some really well choreographed scenes). The cast was fine. I did like Michael Fassbender and liked the direction they went with his characters. In the mid section the conflict is a bit over the top but still an interesting twist. Katherine Waterston did her best as a poor mans Ellen Ripley. Well Noomi Rapace in the former was already introduced as a poor man Ellen Ripley and killed off before this film even begs, so I expect the same fate to Waterston in a further sequel. Billy Crudup was rather boring. To my surprise Danny McBride was really good here. Too bad they wasted Guy Pearce for just a cameo because he could have made a really good character. What I really liked was the last third which had nice action scenes, great cinematography and generally many references to the former Alien films which it paid homage to. Also the final twist, while predictable, works perfectly and makes you want to see how the story continues and finally connects to the crew of the Nostromo",Alien - Covenant
151,stevelomas-69401,Well it's better than Prometheus,7,17 March 2019,"Fassbender is on excellent form, story is more coherent and it fits better within the 'Alien' franchise than Prometheus.
Sadly the crew are a bunch of idiots, there is little originality and I still think the idea of 'Alien' is better suited to darker and more claustrophobic story telling.",Alien - Covenant
152,Laakbaar,Visually appealing but there are too many issues,6,1 June 2017,"The space ship and the alien world are portrayed beautifully in this movie. In that sense it's a beautiful movie. I wish Ridley would explore this further outside of the Aliens franchise.The ""aliens bursting out of the body"" theme -- the hallmark of this franchise, I suppose -- was done well in one spectacular scene. If you enjoy that kind of visceral, Cronenburg-esque horror, you won't be disappointed.Let me list the obvious problems....One problem is that the visuals are not that different from Prometheus. This movie is quite similar to Prometheus.A second problem is that there is no real intellectually interesting premise behind it all. No new story really. No character development at all this time, which is a huge problem. I don't like this special historical connection the aliens somehow have now with the human race via the Engineers. These Engineers. Who are they again?""Alien bursts out of body. Alien becomes scary and evil. Woman fights alien."" This is the plot of every movie. I'm tired of these aliens. A third, very annoying problem is that all the crew seem to be paired off with each other. This movie is proof that partnered people should not be in a military unit together, because if this movie is any indication, the minute one's partner is endangered or gets killed the screaming and blubbering and unprofessionalism begins. ""Oh my god, my wife might be in trouble, I will risk this huge space ship, and all 2000 colonists, just to save her. She's so important.""My response was: WTF is your wife/husband/partner doing on the ship with you if you're such an emotional mess? At one point, I yelled ""stop screaming"" aloud at the screen. This is why there are (or should be) rules about this kind of thing. Somehow the edginess of the marines in the first movie has morphed into this. I don't like it.A fourth problem, perhaps the most annoying problem of all, is that these people seem to have no understanding of the biological dangers of alien planets. I mean, a 10-year-old would know about this from watching cartoons. Why don't they? Why would you get so close to a man who was clearly suffering from some serious alien trauma? Why would you look into an alien pod knowing that the alien planet had somehow infected your mates? How can I rate a movie highly when I was spending much of it rolling my eyes?A fifth problem is that the David/Walter mix up was so frigging obvious. I saw it immediately. How could the crew not have checked this more carefully? It was just unbelievable that they didn't do this. And how did David learn Walter's codes? A sixth problem: the movie was confusing. I googled it afterwards to try to sort it out, but I still don't know how the alien got onto the colonist ship after all that effort to keep it out. I suppose David brought it in, but how? In his mouth? And what happened exactly when David brought the ship to this alien world. Where did he get those spores? What were they? Confusing.",Alien - Covenant
153,CANpatbuck3664,Fassbender and the Special Effects Steal the Show While the Rest of the Movie is Pretty Mediocre,7,21 May 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* This movie picks up 10 years after the events of Prometheus, where the crew of the spaceship Covenant are travelling to colonize another planet. Walter (Michael Fassbender) is the only crew member that's not in hyper-sleep. He's an android and they don't have to worry about him aging during the journey. While the ship is recharging using solar sails, it's hit by a random event that causes the ship's power supply to be damaged. The resulting shock wave wakes up most of the crew and actually kills one of them. The crew is visibly shaken and remain nervous about getting back into their pods. They accidentally pick up a transmission from a nearby world that by all appearances seems to be habitable. The highest ranking officer, Cpt. Oram (Billy Crudup) is already worried about his ability to command the ship so he makes a controversial decision to check out the planet despite the reservations of Daniels (Katherine Waterson).I was really mixed/divided on this movie, I really liked some aspects and other parts had me shaking my head. The one thing that I was consistently impressed with was how great the movie looked. The CGI and the green-screen work was really well done. The planet that the crew visits is beautiful in a cold and emotionless way. The designs of the other environments were interesting and the creature design was top notch (even though you've seen some of them before). I expected this with the budget this movie had (reportedly $97 million) but you still get the occasional movie with a huge budget that has crappy special effects (R.I.P.D. comes to mind). At least the movie held up their end of the bargain from that angle.I would love to talk about the characters but despite the fact that you have approximately 10-15 crew members that wake up, you only get to know 5-6 of them including Walter. The character development isn't spread around very well (admittedly you don't always get that in this type of movie) but Covenant is more plot driven. I wanted to know more about certain crew members like: Tennessee (Danny McBride), Karine (Carmen Ejogo) or Upworth (Callie Hernandez) but you barely learn their specific function on the crew. They're all married, if you aren't talking about Walter, Daniels or Oram, that's about as much as you get to work with. The movie treats a large percentage of the crew as cannon fodder and while that's not atypical; I still would have liked more.This movie features one weird yet wonderful performance and the rest range from decent to okay. Michael Fassbender plays a dual role (to describe it further would spoil it) and just like Prometheus, he's one of the top reasons to check this movie out. He's one of the best actors working today and he was a standout here. I liked other members of the cast, Katherine Waterson was a nice mix of emotional yet strong, Danny McBride was an inspired choice for Tennessee. It was cool to see him in a more dramatic role. I also liked Billy Crudup even though it was hard to sympathize with his character in specific instances.My biggest complaint with Alien: Covenant might seem like nitpicking but I thought it was pretty glaring even for a horror/thriller movie. Some of the crew members are really stupid, I was rolling my eyes or throwing my hands up in the air more than a few times. I was impressed at the beginning as their reasons to visit the planet initially were decent. But it was all downhill from there. The worst was when one character tricked another character into following him/her into a dark room despite the fact he/she just discovered how perverse that character's moral reasoning had become. I also found the ending stretched plausibility pretty far and I had actually guessed the twist about 10 minutes before it happened. They deliberately don't show something and it wasn't hard to figure out from there. When you're supposed to be frozen in suspense, a predictable ending becomes annoying and it took away from the goodwill I had for this movie.I wanted to give this movie a 6 but I don't think I'd be giving it enough credit. The action wasn't bad even if the marketing was a little misleading (the Xenomorphs aren't in the movie as much as you would expect) and the movie was also much gorier than I imagined. They delivered an interesting movie that furthers the Alien lore. This movie reminded me of Prometheus in the respect that it wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing either. I think this will play better for fans of the Alien franchise (specifically for those who enjoyed Prometheus) because new comers to the Alien franchise are going to be confused without that prior knowledge. I liked this movie but unless you're a die-hard Alien fan or you need to go see a horror movie this weekend, there shouldn't be a big rush to go see this.",Alien - Covenant
154,SquigglyCrunch,An Absolute Blast of a Horror with a Rocky Start,7,31 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant follows a colonization ship called 'Covenant' as it sets out to, you guessed it, colonize another planet. Along the way the crew comes across an uninhabited planet with all the means of supporting life, and it's closer than the one they were going to, so they decide to check it out. What's the worst that could happen?I know I'm in the minority when I say that I absolutely loved this movie. While it isn't as good as the two original Alien movies, it's up there to me. With the exception of some parts of the beginning, I thought that the movie was really well written. It did a good job of developing the characters through quick dialogue just enough to increase the stakes higher than if they were all expendable. All the characters, who are married to one another, speak to each other like actual married couples. And it isn't just generic lovey-dovey dialogue, it's mature and realistic. While I didn't always know who was married to who most of the time, the stakes were still there. And even when the characters landed on the planet the way the story was carried from then on was great fun but still well-written enough to make complete sense. As a whole, the movie is both creepy and intense. With the stakes put in, the action is just that much more exciting. And with antagonists like xenomorphs, it's terrifying. There was a slight alteration to the aliens that works really well with the story, and actually makes them infinitely more creepy. It adds another layer of intensity and complexity to the movie that I personally really appreciated. Furthermore, the movie constantly has this level of urgency where the characters learn fairly quickly that there's something wrong, and a large portion of the movie is spent with them simply trying to get out of that problem. But they can't. Very little of this movie is glossed over or skipped ahead of, especially towards the last two acts. So the audience is constantly on edge, waiting for the moment when the characters will either meet their end or get away. The movie is beautiful, whether it be the set design, landscapes, or CGI. The sets are fleshed out for the most part and manage not to bore. The landscapes on the planet are breathtaking, and the CGI is great. A lot of people had a problem with the movie replacing the classic alien costumes with CGI. Personally I have no problem with how a filmmaker decides to use special effects, so long as it looks good. Sure, I prefer practical effects too, but I doubt this movie could've been done with costumes. The aliens move in oftentimes inhuman, impossibly fast ways that simply couldn't be captured by a regular human, and thus the fear and intensity would be largely gone. And in-movie, the CGI looks great. The aliens are creepy and mostly real, though it isn't unobvious that they are fake. It's not so bad that it took me out of the movie, though. The acting I found to be often good and more often fine. There wasn't a lot to praise, other than Michael Fassbender. Acting-wise, this guy carries the movie. He plays two characters, and he's fantastic as both. Katherine Waterston and Billy Crudup were good as the leading characters as well, and the rest of the cast was good for what little they were often given. My biggest problem with this movie was the beginning. While it did a good job setting the scene and stakes and showing the contrast between the people and androids (which helped with the character development as well), there was one point that I think was poorly timed and another that was glossed over. The main character spills her beans about a semi-important idea she had with her husband too early, and it just doesn't feel natural. If it had been done later, it would've been better. Later, when the characters go to the other planet, it takes them a couple weeks. Those weeks are completely skipped. Those weeks would've been the perfect time to slip the character and her husband's idea in, as well as develop the other characters. Personally I think that the movie simply should've spent maybe half an hour in those weeks, making it a two-and-a-half-hour- long movie. That way the stakes could've been even higher. Although the dialogue did suffer at the beginning a little, and Waterston's performance went from very emotional to not emotional way too quickly, causing a small problem with her performance. Overall Alien: Covenant is a solid addition to the Alien franchise. While I don't think it's as good as the first two, I'd say it's right behind them. I don't really get all the hate going it's way, I had an absolute blast with it. In the end I would definitely recommend it despite the fact that you'll probably complain about it too.",Alien - Covenant
155,garethcrook,"The plot is predictable, but it's a damn sight better than Prometheus.",6,18 May 2018,"If the question is should this addition to the Alien catalog have been made, I'd say no, not really, but then I'd have axed a lot of the other films, not being a fan of sequels. However despite covering familiar ground here, it's very watchable. Most notably Fassbender as the non-human. If I wanted to be hypercritical, I'd say the CGI space scenes struggle with unconvincing lighting and the sound design is a little to 'Transformersesque' and clunky. What does make this interesting though is the mystery planet, the daylight, vegetation, everything that gives this a more post apocalyptic feel and I'm all for that. It's standard fare well presented, but kept me reasonably gripped for its lengthy 2 hours. The plot is predictable, but it's a damn sight better than Prometheus.",Alien - Covenant
156,statuskuo,Insulting Piece of Idiocy,1,22 May 2017,"How in God's name did Scott make a worse movie than ""Alien 3""? And then Rotten Tomatoes reviewers gives it a Fresh rating to boot. Any skepticism I've had for that rating site being an accurate barometer has imploded.This movie is a masterful mess. The worse thing Scott has ever done. I won't step too much into the plot, as others have already given the best parts of comical nonsense away. Only to say this, the movie begins with a captain of the ship, who...is a free rock climber...who takes a selfie video with one hand on the rock...nearly falling. This is the man they initially send to guide a ship with ""terraformers"" to set up a society. Then the second in charge...he answers a random beacon and decides it is a better course of action to follow up on that rather than stay the course. Dumb beyond belief.I am through with Scott. I've been a fan for decades, but the slide is real. Like painfully real. He is treading not only over similar material, he is gutting it and leaving the fans to rot in the sun. This is the worse of the series and everyone involved should be ashamed. A true crime of a movie.",Alien - Covenant

We have. This is just ridiculous. The Xenomorph is a movie monster. Do we need a massive franchise explaining its origins?! Even then, it seems these movies are just more and more pretentious and boring musings on Creators and Origins. Just like Prometheus, we've got dumb characters, a boring plot, no soul and a real lack of scares. This is just milking a franchise that started with a movie that wasn't even that great to begin with. Alien is a good movie, but it's just another creature feature with some iconic moments. This one looks great, has some interesting bits, covers some interesting themes and Michael Fassbender is outstanding, but it's a lazy, soulless cash grab that forgets to ever be genuinely scary and lacks the atmosphere of Alien and the non-stop, glorious thrills of Aliens. And people still call Ridley Scott one of the best directors ever, despite the fact he's made literally one great movie (Blade Runner) and a lot of terrible ones. Sadly, we'll soon be getting more of these wretched prequel movies and they'll continue to make money. Just please- at the very least make the next one scary!5/10",Alien - Covenant
158,trinaboice,Insightful symbolism,8,25 May 2017,"Grade: B+Rating: R, 120 minutesIn a Nutshell: This is a sequel to the movie Prometheus, and a prequel to the original blockbuster movie Alien. Directed by the brilliant Ridley Scott, this new addition to the Alien franchise will leave fans entertained and satisfied. It's not just a fun Sci-Fi thriller, but has a lot of very deep and symbolic insights.Uplifting theme: Love vs. duty Creation, humanity ""The only question that matters: where do we come from?"" – Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) Why wasn't he credited in the film? ""I think if we are kind, it will be a kind world."" - DavidThings I liked: The spaceship is called the ""Covenant."" Look for other symbolism associated with the word covenant and its deeper meaning. The first thing you see is Michael Fassbender's artificial blue, dreamy eye. He does a fantastic job as two characters. It's helpful that he speaks in a British accent when he is David and an American accent when he's Walter, so that you can tell who is who. The androids' names (David & Walter) are a tribute to producers David Giler and Walter Hill. SPOILER: He fights and even kisses himself. Ha ha Michael Fassbender was able to take time off of filming in Australia in order to attend the premiere for X-Men: Apocalypse. Beautiful images. There is a lot of CGI, but an impressive amount of shots are taken in camera. David plays Das Rheingold: Entry of the Gods Into Valhalla on the piano, which is a perfect choice to illustrate the theme of creation. I thought the ""energy sails"" were super cool looking on the space ship. Katherine Waterston does a great job as Daniels. Her short hair is perfect in this role, but I wish she had longer hair in her role in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. You get to see a lot of aliens/xenomorphs. SPOILER: If you're hoping for the classic scene of an Alien coming out of someone's chest, you won't be disappointed. Added bonus: one comes out of someone's back side. The aliens aren't the only monsters in the movie. Some questions that were left dangling in the movie Prometheus, get answered in this movie. Creepy ending. Look for Easter eggs from the previous films. For example, there is a small toy bird in this and the original Alien Some of the lines are the same, like ""I got you, you son of a B"" The music that David plays on the flute is the same score that's played in Prometheus. I love little details. For example, the date of the mission, shown at the beginning of the film, is December 5, which is the birthday of Walt Disney. One of the android's names is Walter. The movie was originally going to be called ""Paradise Lost"", referring to John Milton's poem where Lucifer claims it is ""better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven."" The movie poster has an almost old, religious gargoyle feel to it, which is appropriate considering the religious themes of covenant and creation throughout the entire movie.Things I didn't like: Some choppy editing. There are many times when you wonder, ""What the heck is going on?"" because there is some bouncing back and forth in time. The tone shifts and seems inconsistent. If you haven't seen Alien or Prometheus, you might be a bit confused at times. Why would such an important mission send so many young girls who scream and fall apart so easily? Oh yeah, they're good-looking.Funny lines: ""I don't kid about John Denver."" – Tennessee (Danny McBride)Interesting lines: ""What do you believe in, David?"" – Oram (Billy Crudup) ""Creation."" – David ""If you created me, who created you?"" – David ""I will serve you. You are human; I am not. You will die; I will not."" – David ""Seven bells and all is well."" – Mother (computer)Tips for parents: This is definitely a rated R reason for all of the appropriate reasons: nudity, violence, horror. Most of the aliens are really scary looking. There are two people in a shower naked. You see the woman's bare chest. Katherine Waterston doesn't wear a bra. Lots of profanity and F-bombs. You see a burned body up close and lots of other dead bodies in various stages of decomposition. Bloody, violent, gory deaths.MOVIE REVIEW MOM@trinaboice",Alien - Covenant
159,bheadher,I should have read the reviews before renting...,2,2 September 2017,"I had the bright idea to rent this on Amazon Prime. After watching for twenty minutes, I thought the movie hadn't started yet, so I came here to read the reviews...and found that I had made a BIIIGG mistake renting it...The first 5 minutes is some inexplicable footage, with a man ""testing"" an android in a huge blank room with a window, a chair, a piano, and a statue. Totally bland and boring as can be...Suddenly we have the starship Covenant traveling through space, deploying a solar sail array for no apparent reason. We are supposed to read the horribly small print to understand that it is a colony ship, on its way to a planet, with 7 some odd years to go on the trip, with our resident android the only one moving around, tending 2000 frozen colonists and 1500 frozen embryo's...Mysterious space storm pops up, AI calls the ""Doctor"" android to the bridge, space storm trashes the solar sail, throws the starship around in a series of suspicious gyrations that knock the cryo pods off their hangers onto the deck (Yes folks, these pods were ""hanging"" up like clothes on the line)...you get the picture yet ??? Suddenly, because of the storm, a bunch of the people are given emergency wake up calls, fall out of their pods...except for one, whose pod turns bright shades of red light, and then cremates the guy inside with flames...YES, I said flames...that is one heck of a cryo-freeze failure.AND WE STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHO ANYONE IS !!! And that is only the first 40 minutes...Before Prometheus I thought Alien Resurrection was the worst, but then Prometheus took the lead on that...now Covenant take the prize as the absolute worst of the franchise...There is no lead up to the story, no character building at all. A full hour into Covenant, you still have no clue who anybody is...One reviewer did say it best. Another Ridley Scott film, of supposed professionals, running around doing stupid things...The plot, if there is one at all, is completely disjointed, and there is a lot of useless action throughout the movie that does absolutely nothing to help you understand what is going on. The acting is horrendously abysmal, to say the least, with no one clearly in charge. People start dying for the dumbest of reasons, or are infected with the xenomorph through an alien ""spore"" that gets breathed up through their noses. Heck, these idiot characters even go out exploring an unknown alien planet in, what looks like, Russian Revolution hand me down regular clothes, with no real protection at all...To give you an idea how bad this Covenant is, I felt less angry wasting 20 bucks on ""buying"" Prometheus, than I do about totally wasting 5.99 to rent this loser of a movie...Alien Covenant is truly that bad...",Alien - Covenant
160,davidgee,Waiting for a John Hurt moment,7,19 May 2017,"A sequel to the prequel. Are we still on-message?Ten years on from our last venture into deepest darkest space, another vast spaceship full of cryogenically dormant colonists is diverted by a radio signal to the planet where the Prometheus is marooned with robot David ('synthetics', they prefer to be called) the last survivor. Even before they find David, two of the crew inhale something nasty which puts the viewer on alert for a 'John Hurt' moment: there will be more than two of these.The Covenant also has a synthetic crew member, Walter. Walter is an 'upgrade' of David, but his twin in looks, with both of them played by Michael Fassbender. Much as we had good Arnie and bad Arnie in the first two TERMINATOR films, we have good and bad synthetics here, supplying the main plot ingredient – unless you think of the mutations and killings as the main course on the menu, which they more or less are.The CGI (awesome) and the pace (erratic) of this epic try, not entirely successfully, to blind us to the fact that both on the planet and back on the mothership, there is some heavy recycling of the first two episodes in this 38-year saga. Billy Crudup's captain is very much a re-run of the doomed captain of the Nostromo, and Katherine Waterston's ballsy Daniels is practically a clone of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley (who was, as we fondly remember, cloned herself in 1997's RESURRECTION). Michael Fassbender is glamorous and persuasive in his Frankensteinian double role, but some of us still yearn for Sigourney to return.COVENANT is more of an action movie than PROMETHEUS, which ventured down the mock-philosophical road of the STAR TREK series. It's also more of a horror movie, with regular infusions of 'face-huggers' and slaughter. Good scary fun. This franchise still has a bit of (alien) life in it.",Alien - Covenant
161,kaefab,This crew is so stupid they all deserve to die,1,25 May 2017,"Being a huge fan of this franchise i saw the first alien 1979 movie when i was around 12 years old, it was on TV one night and i was scared to death.I since then liked much of the alien predator movies.Prometheus was a huge step back, they tried to explain some but failed, and now we get covenant that manages to destroy a legacy of almost 40 years in 2hours.The movie start off with David and its creator Waylen with the most useless conversation of them all... this should not have been part of the movie since they left out a 4 minutes explanation extra video with David and Dr Shaw and the last supper.We then jump to the huge space ship covenant, who is on a mission to colonize 2000 humans and a small crew of the worst idiots in space, to take care of this huge ship only one cyborg humanoid clone of David called Walter with a very bad suttern accent.They also manage to lose 49 other colonist. They decide to repair the ship and from there Tennessee one of the crew members receives a strange transmission from a planet not far away.Now they also decided to go with the couples here so every crew member is a couple but we never really get to see who is with who because there is no character development, so its hard to care for a bunch of idiots like that when they die.After reviewing the transmission and its human they take the decision to go and explore the planet since from all the data they gathered it seems quit habitable. There is a small argument among a few but a small team of morons get to the planet. They get into a storm and land on water, instead of the huge terrain of grass........So without any space suit they go out and explore this planet, not knowing that David planted the alien seeds almost everywhere, 2 of the crew members are infected with a new so called breed of alien smaller but more lethal, the alien dust if you can call it this way sets into the body and not long after that alien burst out of the body, we get a cool back gory scene and more dumb idiots that manages to blow up the ship.After this encounter the second crew member infected gets it outside the mouth, from there the crew should have called the covenant and ask to extraction, or the covenant should have left them behind.The crew of morons get attack by the new bread of aliens and this is where David the flute player with is flash gun chases them away. So the dumb crew instead of calling for an extraction decide to follow David into is hideout, they see tones of dead body and more but never ask any question all seems normal........From there on we learn that David killed Dr Shaw and experimented on her, that he created the aliens that we know due to experimentation with the alien dna found in Prometheus, and that upon arriving to the planet of the inventor he killed them all.........he plays flute and tries to get Walter to side with him since he as gone mad. Right there, there is no explanation on why what happened for this artificial intelligence to go all Hitler on everyone and wanting to kill of the human race.The new captain Oram sees David talking to the new breed of Alien and sees one crew member as been decapitated but instead of shooting David he kills the alien and follows David where he put the eggs, that idiot gets infected by a facehugger and we get the alien that we know.After reading this by now you think that things cannot get any worst... but believe me they do Daniels who is suppose to replace Ripley, but fails miserably at her job drops lots of the F bomb, she sends a message to the covenant that things go haywire and to come pick them up..... now the Tennessee guy who gets approval from another higher placed crew member to disarm protocol dives into the storm with the 2000 colonists on board to go save 3 people............David and Walter battle it out in a cyborg battle but you know that David won right, and he takes Walter place.That idiot Tennessee dive in with a construction ship to go pick up the rest of the idiot crew they all board, an alien is there that fight is kind of cool, there was on idiot that got semi infected by a facehugger.They all get back to the ship covenant, that crew member is taken to the infirmary, a few minutes later there is an alien on board that killed both of them in the infirmary, there is a couple who are having sex in the shower below with the music playing out loud.... they don't hear the alarm and get both killed, idiots..........They manger to get ride of the alien, get back into cryo sleep then Daniels ask Walter a question and she learns its David... she falls asleep and David as 7 years to experiment on the 2000 colonist with is eggs that he brought on board.As you can see this movie is a total mess, of course the high rating are fake because this movie does not deserve more then a 3 but its Ridley Scott so,,,,,,,,,",Alien - Covenant
162,lareval,Only AVP2 saves this from being the worst Alien movie,2,29 August 2021,"An awfully written, deeply flawed, boringly put together and utterly non sensical mess. The death of this franchise didn´t come with the acquisition of Fox, but from this god awful movie. Really, really bad and an insult to the fan.",Alien - Covenant
163,danielcereto,Alien Covenant,6,8 May 2020,"Alien Covenant is a step under Prometheus because several reasons.
First an foremost the casting is weaker than it's precursor. The main character is unbelievable as an heroine and it's far from being tge new Sigourney Weaver. Even Doctor Shaw's from Prometheus did better.
Last, the script is a mess. A lot of answers not told and also characters were not full developed.
So, overall the weakest movie with close to Alien Resurrection. Maybe a bit better, but not what exactly a fan was waiting for.",Alien - Covenant
164,harryplinkett14,Moronic and involuntarily funny,1,20 May 2017,"It is Z-quality filmmaking with a huge budget. Imagine if someone picked a talentless, autistic nerd, told him to write and direct a fan fiction film, and gave him a professional film crew to get it done. This is that film. It is so badly written that it boggles the mind. It doesn't care about the story, the characters, or even the action. It's as though it goes through the motions, hoping to get to the end as quickly as possible, while never stopping to pay attention to anything. It has no rhythm, no buildup of suspense, no memorable characters or scenes, and it leaves a strong impression of being made by people who really don't care about anything except getting the whole thing finished and shipped to the cinemas worldwide.I guess I can give it one star instead of zero for comedic value: people repeatedly slipping on blood (absolutely hilarious), the dancing alien from Spaceballs, the 'put your head in the egg' moment (remember Blackadder and the Scotsman that puts his head in the cannon?), the whole talk about 'security protocols' while no one even wears a protection suit on an alien planet, the silly 'good vs. evil Data' thing that was done a lot better in a much cheaper Star Trek episode... The film sure made me laugh time and again.Another funny thing is watching old Ridley give interviews while trying to stay awake or put together a coherent sentence. The man should have retired before he even made Prometheus.",Alien - Covenant
165,osj2507,I liked this one,7,14 September 2017,"I am a fan of Alien and I do like Prometheus, this actually does a great job of linking the films better together in my opinion.

166,PyroSikTh,Prometheus 2 Merged with Traditional Alien Movie,7,16 May 2017,"I'm aware that I'm one of few in the world who actually really enjoyed Prometheus and it's philosophical musings on the creation of life, so to hear the next movie was just another ""Alien"" film didn't particularly excite me; we've had four of them already. I want to know more about the Engineers, I want to know why they created humanity, and why they decided to wipe the slate clean. I wanted to delve into their society and really see what they were like as a civilisation. Covenant is both an Alien movie and a Prometheus movie. It's a best-of-both-worlds scenario. The movie opens, right from the get-go, with the creation of David by the hands of Guy Pearce's Weyland. David shows an inquisitive and introspective nature that serves as a prologue to the events that will unfold, and it's important to keep this scene in mind as the movie goes on. The movie then jumps to a new colony ship, ten years after the events of Prometheus, with an upgraded model of David looking after it's 3,000+ inhabitants. Things go wrong, the crew awaken, they land on a mysterious planet, and all hell breaks loose.The crew of the Covenant eventually meet up with a long-haired David, and we get a lot of insight into what he's been up to since the previous movie, and where Elizabeth Shaw is in all this. We even, and most tantalisingly, get to see a little hint of the Engineers' civilisation. Not going to lie, this was the highlight of the movie for me. I mean yeah, I would've liked a proper Prometheus 2 where we actually see all of it unfold rather than the short (but sweet) narrated flashbacks we got, but I'll take what I can get. Furthermore, it cleverly shifts the role of antagonist from the Xenomorphs to David himself, which is necessary as Xenomorphs stopped being scary nearly thirty years ago. David, on the other hand, becomes a villain of the ages, displaying unparalleled sadism in a quest of scientific curiosity.Beyond that, the movie makes a big effort to mirror, and in some cases directly homage the original Alien movies. The wooden bird toy dipping it's beak into a glass of water is here, some choice lines of dialogue are lifted and supplanted from the original, and even the general format of the story. SPOILER ALERT BUT NOT REALLY: The crew returning to the ship safely in orbit is not the end of the horror. The original Xenomorph returns as well, with it's large head, secondary jaws, and protruding back spikes. While Scott has said he has more movies planned, and once again I find myself yearning for a direct sequel to carry this story on, Covenant pretty much ties the origins of the Xenomorphs up nice and tidy, making the need for more movies a bit suspect.Probably the biggest problem for Covenant is it's characters. There's a lot of crew members, and most of them get no development at all. Crucial to the crew's makeup is that they're all couples, but we're never really shown who's with who soon enough, despite the constant bits of dialogue that point out ""my wife"". I spent quite a large portion of the movie trying to figure the couples out. The homosexual couple in particular were so poorly handled that you only realised they were a gay couple when one of them dies. Thankfully there's a fairly easy fix to this, put the Last Supper prologue sequence back in the movie, showing the whole crew before they enter cryosleep. We see them banter, gossip, and enjoy each others company for a bit, making them feel human and providing a little source of attachment to them. Alas I had to watch this an hour ago on my computer, after I'd already seen the movie and the damage of no development had already been done.That said, there is some good acting here regardless. Katherine Waterston was easily the least annoying that I've seen her, Billy Crudup does remarkably well with the flimsy role he's given, and Danny McBride forgoes the crass humour to display some dramatic chops. Of course though, Michael Fassbender is the star of the movie, relishing the opportunity to play two similar, but very different characters. In fact, the best scenes were with Michael Fassbender talking to Michael Fassbender. The conflict of wills and ideals between Walter and David were truly tantalising, and seeing David back and more evil than before was thoroughly entertaining. Fassbender owned both sides with complete conviction, being both a force to cheer on, and a force to fear and hate in equal measure.I found Alien: Covenant a lot more enjoyable than I expected, but I did have my expectations set to catastrophically low. It completely lacks any character development, is riddled with stupid, nonsensical decisions in order to drive the plot forward, and isn't nearly as horrifying as it should be. That said, it feels more like an Alien movie than Prometheus did, while simultaneously not just brushing Prometheus under the rug. Would I like to see the hypothetical movie between Prometheus and Covenant? Absolutely, but at this point I don't feel it would particularly add much. Similarly, would I like another movie to bridge the gap between Covenant and Alien? Again, yes, but also again I'm not sure what purpose it would serve in the narrative. Covenant feels like a perfect marriage between the two. I give Alien: Covenant an enjoyable, but hardly groundbreaking 7/10. I recognise it's flaws, and there are many, but I simply enjoyed it too much to not give it a positive rating.P.S. Please release a Director's Cut with the two prologues actually in the movie. 'The Crossing' is as close as I'll ever get to a proper Prometheus 2, and 'The Last Supper' would've done wonders for character development.",Alien - Covenant
167,CinematicInceptions,Battle of the synthetics.,7,29 May 2017,"It was odd that the alien creatures in the movie did not make so many appearances. The trailers gave me the impression that there would be a lot of CGI with the monsters with a bunch of jump scares and such. But it turned out to be a fairly character-driven story without all that much action, and what action there was did not get executed that fabulously. The budget was used more on the technology of the ships and the world of the planet. The technology showcase shots were sort of pointless to me, but I liked the way that the setting of the eerie planet itself played into the story. The action and suspense sequences weren't that dramatic or suspenseful because of the expectations that the movie created. I knew that the movie wouldn't be afraid to kill characters off, but it wasn't hard to guess who would die and who would live based on the importance they had been given prior to that point.The plot, though it was slow at times, was pretty good for a spectacle movie. The drama of the beginning scenes and how the crew eventually decided to land on the unknown planet was done pretty well and showed the crew's humanity. And the later decision for the people that stayed behind on the main ship to land on the planet felt justified even though it was obviously done as a plot device. Having the crew be made up of married couples added an interesting dynamic at a couple points, but I thought more could have been done with it. One thing I didn't like was that whenever something went wrong, things went downhill on all fronts which didn't really work for some reason. The climatic battle with the alien on board the ship was oddly the least violent action scene of all and wasn't that dramatically satisfying. The method of defeating the monster felt like it shouldn't have worked in much the same way as the dwarfs attempts to defeat Smaug in the second Hobbit movie. The twist at the very end was predictable but no worse for it and made perfect sense.Despite the dark color scheme and subject matter, the movie had a relatively light feel to it. The demeanor of the human characters did not really match the mood of what was happening. I think part of the reason for this was that they all seemed to get over the deaths of their spouses a little too quickly. Yes, they grieve, but only for a scene or two. There was something about them that gave me the impression that they were in the wrong movie. The group as a whole felt more like a diverse marriage support group than a team of trained astronauts. What was much more interesting to watch was the drama between David and Walter as they each examined the other's limitations, intentions, and technological DNA. It certainly helped that Michael Fassbender gave both parts good but very different performances.Overall, it was not what I expected and not what I came to see, but still decent. It seemed to me that the movie had a bit of an identity crisis. Stylistically, it wanted to be a sci-fi action movie, but the story itself felt more like a drama. In terms of ratings, I think it wanted to be a PG-13 movie but added in some gore and F-bombs to get an R rating like the previous Alien movies. Having not seen any other Alien movies, I can't say whether this was true to the originals, but I was okay with it as its own piece. Overall Rating: 8/10.",Alien - Covenant
168,dfle3,You know the drill by now...but now the plot holes are starting to bother me: 70%,7,26 May 2017,"This sequel to ""Prometheus"" and prequel to ""Alien"" treads the well-worn path of films in this franchise: a spacecraft intercepts a distress signal and changes its course in order to investigate...and then the crew come face-to-face with the horror that is the alien species which will either eat them or use the humans' bodies as a means of incubating its alien offspring.Since it's been many years since I've seen ""Prometheus"" (I saw it during its cinema run as well), I have to say that I'd already forgotten the details of it when I sat down in the cinema to watch this latest instalment. For that reason, I'd suggest that you watch ""Alien: Covenant"" soon after watching ""Prometheus"", if you can, unless you have a really good memory! That being said, I did recognise Guy Pearce from the previous film...but drew a blank later on in the film when the character Elizabeth Shaw is mentioned...and she was the main character from that film! In other words, I couldn't remember what happened to her at the end of the previous film.When I saw a trailer for this film many, many weeks ago, I have to say that I did find it misleading...it started off as if it was a film about humans colonising a new planet and then the trailer seemed to morph into an ad for a new ""Alien"" film. It made me wonder if I had missed some sort of break between trailers for two different films. I'm still wondering if a scene from that early part of the trailer was actually in the film! That being said, yes, ""Alien: Covenant"" does start the story off with a spacecraft (the ""Covenant"" of the title) travelling through space, carrying a cargo of breeding age humans, to colonise a new planet. Apart from one male, all the other humans are in suspended animation (anabiosis), seeing as the planet that they are going to is so far away. This being part of the ""Alien"" franchise, you know that things are going to go pear-shaped pretty quickly!At times you wonder if the narrative is just meandering, like the spacecraft repair scene...but it is actually tight, as it moves the plot forward...eventually.The ending of ""Alien: Covenant"" is obviously the starting point to another sequel, but I do wonder how well it will explain the aftermath of that ending as well as providing a bridge to the events of the original ""Alien"" film. i.e. presumably there is a lot at stake with the ending of ""Alien: Covenant"" but I'm not sure that there was any signs of how that played out in the original ""Alien"" film. It just seems going around circles, which isn't really satisfying, from my point of view. Going around in circles...yet another distress signal...with yet another spacecraft going to investigate, like a fly into a Venus flytrap...with yet more lethal aliens to encounter.From memory, I found the earlier film hard to follow and looking at my review for it now, that is confirmed, along with some other elements of the film which I had forgotten. Even though ""Alien: Covenant"" tries to spend more time explaining the origin of the aliens, I have to say that that often raised more questions than it answered for me! It mentions ""the virus"" and I have to confess that I have no memory of that concept being used in ""Prometheus""! There's also scenes of what looks like fungi being trodden on by humans, which releases what I assume to be ""the virus""...and that really doesn't make any sense to me. Is it a virus? Is it fungal spores? How does this all hang together? Okay, let's talk about all the other things that bug me about this film...the plot holes, if you will, or just the absurditiesOne thing that bugged me a lot in this film was just how rapidly large, lethal aliens developed in such a short time. Of course, this is narratively driven, as the film wants to focus on a very short period of time and it's ""required"" for the aliens to develop quickly as a result. Well, that just made me wish the film was set in another context! E.g. on a farm, where the alien could prey on livestock...or small children...before it was big enough to kill even armed adults. Perhaps this was still an issue in the original ""Alien"" film...but I suppose it was just less pronounced in how quickly the alien grew to a scary size.Also, in this film the alien seems different in kind from previous films in the franchise...it's more akin to a psychopath in a slasher film than something that needs to kill humans in order to eat or create offspring. Even though I shouldn't have thoughts like the following, I can't help myself! Okay, I'm having problems with the notion of just how sustainable a human-alien co-existence would be. It seems to me that the aliens would be an existential threat to humanity...in which case, if they no longer have any prey, how on Earth are aliens themselves going to continue multiplying?Miscellaneous notes:* The end credits have an ""In memory of"" for Julie Payne. Not sure who she is.* Katherine Waterston as Daniels ""Dany"" Branson is good...she is small in stature but continues the franchise's form in having strong female characters...she's the alpha female, so to speak.* Looking at my notes for ""Prometheus"" I noted the stupidity of the crew in that film...with this current film, I have to note how the latter part of the film is just Murphy's law writ large (ignoring the franchise trope of how humans keep coming into contact with the aliens!).",Alien - Covenant
169,rocknrelics,I liked it.... a lot!!!,8,11 July 2020,"Cannot see the problem the whiny fan boys have with this film, it's an epic science fiction(the clue is in the genre title, fiction! ) adventure, beautifully filmed, great effects and decently acted.I would have liked a couple of older characters in it, but that's just my preference.I watched it blind not knowing the story and loved it, would have liked it to have been a bit longer, to enable it to be fleshed out a little more, but you can't have everything.Has great rewatching potential as well, there's that much going on.If you're going to whinge about how unrealistic things are in a science FICTION film, maybe it isn't for you, but anyone after an exhilarating thrill ride, step this way!",Alien - Covenant
170,hellholehorror,The alien often looked goofy,6,15 December 2017,"This is probably my fourth favourite Alien movie after the original trilogy. The tone matches Alien (1979) closer than Prometheus (2012) but there is too much existential dribble and some really pretentious moments. It looked and sounded stunning, possibly the best sound design and music I've even heard. My biggest complaint was that the alien often looked goofy, especially in the first half of the film. Also, what happened to having men in suits? Look so much scarier, the CGI aliens are not convincing. The scary intense moments are cool and I like that they tried to explain the space jockey and the alien origins but it's not as entertaining as it should have been. I could be wrong but at the end of Prometheus we saw a 'fully' evolved Alien human hybrid but in this film (set ten years later) they say that this is it's first appearance (I don't want to explain this failure in logic fully as it would contain spoliers). Final gripe, what happened to Alien films reaching a satisfying conclusion rather than leaving it open to endless sequels? Very enjoyable film let down by too much CGI and some moments that could have been shorter.",Alien - Covenant
171,Rautus,One of the biggest disappointments of the year,3,24 May 2017,"I wanted to like this film, I really did but sadly I am not impressed with Alien Covenant. I had problems with Prometheus, but overall I enjoyed that movie in the cinema and I still do. But Alien Covenant is a whole different story for me. It might look good and be well made as you expect from Ridley Scott, but everything else is lacking what made Alien a hit back in 1979.There are many problems with this film, such as none of the answers from Prometheus getting answered, instead all ties with that film are either quickly tied up or ignored, while it was unsatisfying I knew that it would do everything it could to distance itself from Prometheus due to the backlash from fans. One of my biggest problems with Alien Covenant for me was that it was just too fast paced, there was no build up, no tension, no atmosphere. Interesting ideas such as the Neomorph are underused, the thing is killed roughly 15 minutes after it is birthed. And then there is David somehow creating the eggs and that leading into an AVP Esq moment where about 5 minutes after the Facehugger latches onto the captain, the baby Xenomorph is born and then a short time after that it's an adult, and they mess up the Xenemorph reveal as bad as the Neomorph, where is the slow, suspenseful reveal? This movie feels like it's made for people with ADHD. The action scenes might look good but they lack any investment and just end up going through the motions as the lead characters fight against and dispose of the attacking Xenomorph like a self contained threat that is easily handled. The Neomorphs are more of a perfect organism since they are contained in small pods that enter through the body via an airborne microbe, they gestate quickly and they grow quickly, and show more intelligence than the Xenomorphs who seem like a downgrade with their gestation methods and the fact they just rush into action and end up getting killed in their own haste, one jumps right into the crane's grabber and the other falls right into the trap of getting sucked out of the airlock. This is the problem with prequels and how the original low tech creation becomes obsolete with modern ideas which become more advanced. And as for David being the one to create the Xenomorph eggs from Shaw's reproductive system, it messes us continuity big time but I do kind of like the body shock aspect of it and how unsettling it is with the rest of the scenes with David and his home. Characters themselves are paper thin, no depth, they are all just fodder and not to mention stupid to the point it makes the characters in Prometheus look like geniuses in comparison. As soon as two of the characters got infected by the spores, I knew that one Neomorph was going to die in that ship and the other would run loose (I hoped longer than 15 minutes), I was thinking the first act and a half would be a tense movie with them surviving against the Neomorph on the planet and then the last half of the second act would be a breather with David and that would lead into the third act with the Xenomorph. Nope. And oh my goodness, the gay guy, how the hell did he get impregnated, he had the Facehugger pulled off before it could do anything. And the third act was just like the rest of the movie, a rush job mess. Such a let down, this could have been a tense movie but tension was thrown away for hyperactive action scenes with CGI aliens. It was like watching AVP all over again. I have no idea if there is a director's cut planned because as it stands, this theatrical version is a mess, way worse than the theatrical cut of Alien 3. The deaths were gruesome, I'll give it that. Oh, and the reveal that David was pretending to be Walter was so obvious. When you don't see the fate of a villain who is a double, chances are, it's them at the end. I don't know if Ridley Scott made this bad on purpose as a middle finger to those who hated Prometheus or if he just doesn't care or understand what made Alien a classic. Dan O'Bannon, God rest his soul, I'm sure he is rolling in his grave with this film for missing the point of his film entirely. There were 8 people in the cinema, including me, and one actually walked out halfway through. I stayed all the way, hoping there would be more things I liked rather than disliked to no avail. The only good things were Michael Fassbender as Walter and David, he is the saving grace of the film. There is one memorable scene with David and the Neomorph. Katherine Waterston is fine as the Ripley stand in but sadly doesn't have much to do. Danny McBride shows audiences that he can play a serious part convincingly and well, I hope he gets more dramatic roles that give him more screen time to showcase he is more than just a comedic actor. There's some nice visuals and shots that capture the look of Alien, but sadly not the feel. The weather was actually sunny when I went to see it, when I came out, it was dull and raining, sums up the experience watching the movie perfectly. It was the first time I have ever felt so miserable watching a film. This is without a doubt one of the biggest disappointments of the year. I wish fan influence did not prevent Ridley Scott from making Prometheus 2 which is clearly the movie he really wanted to make and not this.",Alien - Covenant

173,skybrick736,Alien: Covenant (7/10),7,21 October 2017,"The contrast between Prometheus and Alien are very distinct in terms of the story, tone, characters, just about everything by Ridley Scott was done different. Although unsettling bleak feeling of Alien probably can never be recreated by Scott, his work on the Alien franchise is all that I am interested in seeing at this point. Thus, Alien: Covenant was pretty anticipated, seeing how the new story begins to bridge together Scott's two other films.Covenant starts off with a couple remarkable scenes involving a Fassbender flashback towards Prometheus and a chaotic scene of deep space turbulence. The imagery of the space scenes are still on the level of what one would expect to be in a Star Wars film. Covenant did a good job in adopting old concepts and keeping them fresh with different takes. The brutality is also there with intensity and gore not being an issue. Where the film falls flat though is the cast around Fassbender, there's just no other way around poorly delivered dialogue and forgettable characters. In the film's conclusion, there is also a big problem with predictability as the ending can be seen coming from a mile away. Covenant is a solid addition the franchise but in no ways does it knock the ball out into space.",Alien - Covenant
174,Lebowskidoo,Backbursting Excellence!,9,2 July 2020,"A little bit Alien, a little bit Prometheus, Ridley Scott tweaks his sequel to appease the Alien fans who didn't love Prometheus. And that's okay, because I'm somewhere in the middle myself. Prometheus tried to be beyond epic and left so much confusion in its wake. The fans wanted a Ridley Scott Alien movie, with the actual xenomorphs, and this one has them.It's still has that grandiose vibe that Ridley Scott brings to the table, but there's intense, brutal attack scenes and lovely gore galore! It has not one, but two Michael Fassbender androids, and they kiss! How's that for freaky? Ridley, trying to give us more of what we want, only different, gives us a backburster and a faceburster! Yes, the chestburster is now so 1979, dontcha know!To all the fans who didn't like this movie, I'm sorry you're disappointed. Nothing is perfect, but it's unlikely we'll receive better than Ridley Scott revisiting his sci-fi masterpiece. I'm having a great time watching all these movies together this week and this one is pretty great. It follows the traditional horror movie pattern a bit more, which Ridley Scott has said he doesn't want to do. I think he compromised with the studio and this is the result. More alien horror, but with still all that titans created humanity mumbo-jumbo etc.Michael Fassbender must have had an acting boner when he learned he was playing opposite himself for most of the movie. He's great as both David and Walter. Jussie Smollett may never get work again, or not, but he's got one heck of a great scene in this. Katherine Waterston as our final girl does a great job, just wish she hadn't had to model a hairdo that made her look like a circumcised knob!",Alien - Covenant
175,ericrnolan,"""Alien: Covenant"" (2017) is a first-rate sci-fi horror show with lots of monstery goodness.",9,24 May 2017,"I am part of a happy minority where ""Alien Covenant"" (2017) is concerned — I keep hearing about ""meh"" or negative reactions from my friends, but I quite enjoyed it. I'd rate it a 9 out of 10.No, this second installment in the ""Alien"" prequel trilogy doesn't bring much new to the table. It often seems like a collection of common tropes, and borrows a bit from previous films in the franchise — especially the first movie in 1979. Some aspects of it — like a predictable and slightly gimmicky development late in the story — even feel like horror movie clichés. (I am doing everything I can to avoid spoilers, so forgive how vague I'm being here.) ""Alien: Covenant"" isn't groundbreaking, and it isn't destined to be called a ""classic.""Here's the thing, though — all of the movie's common tropes are exactly what make fans happy. Think about it  if you had to name two ""Alien"" movies as unique or the most divergent, they might be the heady, ambitious ""Prometheus"" (2012) and the baroquely experimental ""Alien: Resurrection"" (1997). Whatever their failings, both of those movies deserve points for creativity. And they are among the three films that fans hated the most. (The third here is the smartest and most under-appreciated installment, 1993's brilliant ""Alien 3."")With ""Alien: Covenant,"" Ridley Scott gives fans exactly what they were clamoring for — a frightening, gory, space-based horror film with creatively designed monsters and some nasty surprises. It very much returns to the tone of the first film. It is even jarringly darker than ""Prometheus,"" which was defined partly by its moments of cautious optimism. And, more than any other sequel, it seems directly inspired by the grotesquerie of H. R. Giger's original, nightmarish monster designs. I feel certain this movie would have received the late artist's blessing. (I could name a certain scene and an excellent surprise story development, but I won't.)Michael Fassbender shined in his two roles here. (He not only reprises his role as the android, ""David,"" but also portrays a newer model, ""Walter."") The rest of the acting was roundly good too.I also found the movie nice and scary. I, for one, don't think Scott's direction of action scenes here is perfect. (They are harder to follow here, for example, than his beautiful arena melees in 2000's ""Gladiator."") But they were still effective.So this return to form made me pretty happy. I didn't want another muddled attempt at profundity like ""Prometheus."" Nor did I want a winding, bizarre, art-house-horror tale like ""Resurrection"" — that movie was like a poorly written, drug-fueled comic book. I wanted a first-rate sci-fi horror show with lots of monstery goodness, and that's what I got.If I had to pick a criticism of ""Alien: Covenant,"" I'm surprised to have to point to some less-than-stellar CGI. This was something I noticed from early trailers for the film, and I'm surprised I haven't heard another reviewer mention in it yet. One scene rendered a title baddie about as well as a modern video game, albeit a good one. Another's depiction of an upright ""neomorph"" seemed  fairly bad. (Fans of decent creature features shouldn't despair, however — there are still some outstanding monster moments, and no small amount of accompanying gore and goo.) Have I just become spoiled by the amazing dinosaur effects of 2015's ""Jurassic World?"" I don't think so  I suggest that the otherwise lamentable ""Alien: Resurrection,"" with its combination of CGI and practical effects, had far better creature effects than this newest outing.Of course I recommend this movie. Maybe I should only do so with the caveat that I am (obviously) a huge fan of the series. It has been said that I'm easy to please, too — I actually gave a glowing review to ""Prometheus"" shortly after its release, before wiser minds pointed out to me its sometimes egregious flaws. (A friend of mine shared with me one of those ""Everything Wrong With"" videos that CinemaSins produces  it's a hilarious webseries, but it sure will dull the shine of some of your favorite movies, lemme tell ya.) Your mileage may vary, especially depending on how much you enjoy horror movies, as opposed to more general science fiction.Oh! There is a mostly non-sequitur postscript that I can't help but add here  yet another one of my movie prognostications was flat out wrong. It isn't a spoiler if it's a far-out prediction that didn't happen, so I'll go ahead and share it here  during one of the ads for ""Alien: Covenant,"" I could swear I heard a character call out the name ""ASH!!!!"" (I've evidently started hallucinating at the start of mid-life.) I predicted that the new and robotic Walter would turn evil, and actually become the android named Ash in the 1979 original. (And why not? Androids do not age, and a web-based prologue for ""Alien Covenant"" suggests their faces can be easily swapped out.) I further predicted that the more human David would be pitted against him in order to save humanity somehow from alienkind. (These things do not happen.)I still think that's a pretty clever idea, though, even if I only accidentally arrived at it. It would be great if that happened somehow in the planned ""Alien: Awakening.""",Alien - Covenant
176,Mike_Devine,A far cry from 'Prometheus',4,31 March 2018,"The 'Alien' franchise has seen its share of ups and downs, from the first two installments earning their rightful place as cinematic classics to the clunkers that were 'Alien 3' and 'Alien: Resurrection' (we're not including either of the embarrassing AVPs). The series underwent a sort of rebirth in 2012's 'Prometheus,' which was directed by Ridley Scott and boasted a clever story and tasteful interpretation of the space-set saga. However, 2017's 'Alien: Covenant' appears to be another downward turn for the franchise.Picking up more than 10 years after the events of 'Prometheus,' we see what happens when the crew of the Covenant - who are on a colonization expedition - are sidetracked from their mission to inspect a nearby Earth-like planet due to a mysterious signal that's received. Of course, no film that has begun this way has ever led to a series of positive events, and 'Covenant' is no different. With the ship's captain (James Franco) dead from a freak accident, crew members ranging from Daniels (Catherine Waterston) and Oram (Billy Crudup) to Tennessee (Danny McBride) and Karine (Carmen Ejogo) descend upon the unknown planet to investigate. Quickly, things are revealed to be much more sinister than first thought.Where 'Covenant' differs from the superior 'Prometheus' is in its core underpinnings as a film - the latter is a smart, out of this world suspense thriller and the former is a space-set slasher ""murder by numbers"" gorefest. Sure, there are plenty of similarities between the two, including Michael Fassbender's chillingly good portrayal of the cyborg David being a main draw. But 'Covenant' falls way short in terms of feeling fresh and exciting. Instead, it settles for cheap scares and the kinds of gags you'd expect to see in low-budget horror films. Even though there are plenty of interesting plot developments introduced in 'Covenant,' including questions about the origins of the classic xenomorph to the fate of Elizabeth Shaw, the film falls far short as a whole.Sure, the 'Alien' series is far from over. But in order for it to continue to go strong, whatever follows 'Alien: Covenant' must be a much improved film, or it could risk bringing an early end to the franchise.",Alien - Covenant
177,James_De_Bello,7.5/10,7,12 May 2017,"When the crew of the colony ship Coventant intercept a distress signal from an unmapped planet they discover that said planet could actually have a better habitat and ecosystem than the one they were aiming for. The captain takes the decision to change route, but when they land on the planet they quickly discover they shouldn't have come in the first place.""Alien: Covenant"" has many stumbles on its way, it has a lot of fat that could have been cut out or got better writing, in some ways it could be said it is a frustrating film, but what it comes down to is the fact that no matter how disconnected I felt at times, the tension always and constantly delivers and Scott gives proof of his mastery at it. This is a solid Alien film, with lots of glorious suspense and scare mixed with a surprisingly excellent attempt at world and mythology building.After a first ten minutes of film that reveal themselves to be totally unnecessary and disastrous the actual plot of the film kicks in and form there we are taken to a journey of constant and relentless tension climaxes that are structured in a very particular way. I'm not going to give anything away since the film has many surprises stored in it both from on story and character and both on the traditional Alien formula and how it is carried out. If there is one thing that this film has going for it, as many Scott films do, is that there are many clichès employed, but they always fit into the story and are used to their maximum potential; built around them is a film that ultimately surprised me continuously and with the exception of a couple of beats I never had an idea of where it was going.There is so much going on in this film that it is really hard to wrap my head around my thoughts on it. I have to point out how many character scenes drag, at different times during the movie their is dialogue and character interaction that made me cringe, but every time this happened the film gave me a new twist that was never gratuitous and gave new context to everything that happened before. It is this constantly moving piece which lets you down occasionally, but always finds a way to engage you again and once the tension hits you are always sure to be locked in.The film does feel like it is fighting to be both an Alien film and a sequel to Prometheus and as many times it seems to be failing at molding the tones and getting it to feel organic it gives you something vitally new and fortunately the narrative heft never stops. I have to call myself amazed at how successful the attempt the filmmakers have to build mythology for the Alien saga is. There are hardly any expositional dumps on the audience yet thanks so much going on under the surface we manage to understand and appreciate so much of the Alien world. They take a big risk with this film and by the very end it pays off which is probably why during the film I was having my doubts, yet by the end it sweeps you away, leaves you on a high note and wanting more. All of the setups pay off and whilst some of them might have been placed a little mechanically into the flow of the story, there is so much going on that by the end I didn't care.The tension and horror moments also have a bipolar nature to them, whilst some of the character fat in the film could have gone into a little more of these sequences, they are so well built once they hit you it is hard to be unsatisfied. Yes, there could have been more aliens stuff, but what we got was excellent. There are moments of true horror in which it is hard to watch the screen and other moments in which I thought I could not take the tension anymore so all in all how can one be underwhelmed when a film does this to you.I have to call out the fact that I found a lot of the production design of the Coventant ship to be a little underwhelming, especially for Ridley Scott standards, but the planet the film takes place on is so beautifully build and designed it is once again hard to complain.""Alien: Covnetant"" is possibly the first successful attempt at building mythology in the Alien world, it gives ""Prometheus"" all the answers it needs and makes it a better film because of it. Whilst there are inherent problems scattered around all of the film and constantly flawed executions in acting, directing, writing and editing, as an overall piece it still manages to hit the audience as it should and gives the a full dose of scares, tension and even some sci-fi thematic exploration.",Alien - Covenant
178,markgorman,Just getting silly now.,5,17 May 2017,"In which a young Michael Fassbender utters the immortal line to his older brother, also played by Michael Fassbender, as he teaches him how to play a penny whistle, ""I'll do the fingering.""Stop. Stop right there.That was silly right?Alien:Covenant is Ridley Scott being let loose on his wildest fantasies and this time it's almost all about religion. He's apparently in thrall with the notion that Aliens are gods or some such claptrap.The name of the ship is 'Covenant', the name of the 'Synthetic' that was on Prometheus but has met its fate and who forms a big part of this movie's plot line was David (Michael Fassbender) and David has lured his ten year the junior 'brother' Walter (also Fassbender) to Prometheus and to seek the fate of the 2,000 'covenanters' on board ship.Although Walter is a more advanced model he is more deeply flawed and has had his emotional intelligence reduced as it became apparent that David was too advanced.Meanwhile, because this is 2017 rather than 1979 special effects, we get to see much more Alien action, which is in itself good (and creepy) but it's OTT and the Aliens as organisms appear less developed because, remember, this is a prequel to Alien and in the time between the two movies the Aliens have evolved.It starts great (but slow) the sets are miraculous and the acting largely decent (Katherine Waterston as Daniels is commendable) but the religious theme becomes more and more overbearing and the relationship between Fassbender and Fassbender is preposterous (although well acted).Although the SFX are great they are just too much and the whole movie descends into a disappointing silly pet project that needs much more script supervision.Not great I'm afraid.",Alien - Covenant

The acting was spot on perfection. This was one of those movies where the more you watch it the more you will like it. This is the sixth installment in the Alien franchise and it has been the best by far so far. The movie will have you screaming at the characters. Parents this movie is R rated and it deserves it. Just know if you decide to take your little ones that this movie has some disturbing images throughout. There were some parts in this film that were unbelievably shocking what I mean my by that is that the filming of this movie was shot in a way that you could never believe I definitely recommend this movie to any fan of the franchise and to new fans as well.My score 10/10,Alien - Covenant
180,coreyjdenford,Heavy-handed arc,6,12 May 2017,"This review of Alien Covenant is spoiler free*** (3/5)WITHIN THE FIRST few minutes of Alien Covenant's opening title in director Ridley Scott's iconic form, there's a sense of familiarity perhaps it's to do with the title forming itself on the screen in front of us or the haunting background soundtrack originally composed by Jerry Goldsmith, re-done for this new installment by Jed Kurzel perhaps as an inspiration. But within an instant of the first few we are back on familiar ground or in this space. Another familiar point is that we welcome back the iconic Xenomorph (looking as gloriously terrifying as ever), sure Prometheus may have left you frustrated due to the lack of the curly-headed, sword-tailed villain from the original Alien then this – may perhaps leave you happier that he is back in glorious form and running havoc again. The new ideas are to come first before even the slightest showing of the titular villain; of course there are new characters to follow new stories, a new ship, and a new planet.Set ten years after the ill-fated mission of the Prometheus, the USCSS Covenant is on a mission to colonize an Earth-like planet in a solar system thousands of light years from their home. The ship has particularly similar shape too, if you look closely you can see the design is much in the of the Nostromo, except it's perhaps thinner, on board the are 2,000 willing colonists in hyper-sleep and 1400 human embryos tightly wrapped in compacted draws. This thanks to Scott's much improved directing style after The Martian looks particularly stunning, using his technical devices such as the lighting effects and tightly cornered, slightly claustrophobic corridors, and of course the voicing of the iconic computer MOTHER, Scott uses these well to make this the closest to his original. This bodes well for some time, were as the original is a sci-fi masterpiece – this, is not there are flaws.Firstly, the crew of the Covenant are particularly nondescript, there are fifteen including Michael Fassbender's soft-talking android Walter, (compared to Alien's eight members including Ripley's cat) all lead to this planet by newly promoted captain (Crudup). Who have been in hyper-sleep for many years, and have just received a rogue message from an anonymous planet during their colonization mission to Origae-6. Of course, each member is against this message; Katherine Waterston's Daniels is particularly concerned about the lack of bird sounds from the planet's surface. It's not the presentation of the characters that's flawed it's their story, most of them are married couples, and when the inevitable comes there's not enough emotional heft that drives them. Promisingly there are some hilarious moments – notably the crew banter ""Sugar tits,"" Danny McBride's Tennessee mutters, but the rest of their narration is sadly flawed. Thankfully their stoic performances, the standout is McBride carry the film enough to pull through.Secondly, the tone; the problem with Scott's directing is, he either makes his films too light or too heavy, here the emphasis is high on heavy. It's a slow drive from the opening, the tension is there from the very beginning we know what kind of film this is, and it's inevitable that these characters meet their demise at some point. Here, it's obvious, were as the original had tension in the right places it was hard to know which one would go first, then there's that pinnacle moment that everyone knows. Like the Xenomorph, this blind to it's own flaws, it's as if Scott has a say on how and when each character goes; example when a lesser used person takes a break from work – it's obvious to what happens next. In the original that happened – perhaps one or two times, but here it's seemingly endless. He's not light on this material either, there's a lot of gore - in fact a seemingly cringeworthy amount of it, there's not too much – there is of course a more notable way of direction, which takes a turn into the more familiar territory too.Both of these flaws are thankfully brushed over by the tension, which is clearly noticeable from the first planetary footsteps – the tension is on the constant rise from the moment we see these alien critters to the third act – though fast in it's execution is stunning and proudly gives a solid end to the sixth film in the franchise. Alien Covenant isn't the best Alien film in the franchise but thanks to Scott's stunning direction and the beautiful practical effects Scott is back on firm ground.VERDICT: Not the best but certainly not the worst, with it's flawed narration and heavy-handed techniques it's vast improvement on his last sci-fi venture. That still sadly doesn't top the 1979 original.",Alien - Covenant

183,eagandersongil,From terror to action. From action to science fiction altogether.,7,17 May 2017,"Trying to apologize for Prometheus - Which I do not think is all bad - Ridley Scott returns to the command of Alien to consolidate the film's focus change again, It was already terror, then turned action, today is purely science fiction, ""Alien: Covenant"" Is a film about an artificial artificial intelligence with remnants of megalomania, deification and superiority, I understand the change of focus, I even like it, but the essence is completely lost and the fans' dislike is understandable. If 10 years after the events of Prometheus, a colonizing ship is attracted to the planet LV-223 after receiving a call, upon arriving on the planet, they discover that the sender of the call is not who it says it is. The script is less creative than prometheus, it follows a common structure of the whole franchise, and even touches on legal points such as the colonization of planets, or the concept of love machines, sense of duty, an analogy to creation not always be Something divine, and therefore the creation to be corrupted, and even a search for indenity and concepts of love related to birth and creation, but all these points are played in an extremely vague way, they are only brushstrokes that are quickly exchanged for action scenes . Technically, the film pleases, although it has been promised to be much more ""8-passenger"" than ""Prometheus"", stayed on the promise, the production designer is very clean, and even in night scenes, everything is very beautiful, although not Extremely detailed and perfect, the direction of art is competent, using a photo with light tones, few open angles, good visual effects, a great mix and sound editing, and a well-paced rhythm, something that draws much attention in the film It's a soundtrack, full of sound design, it does not contain suspense songs, but it contains a lot of erudite music, and when it plays Wagner is creepy, not only for the music, but for the whole context. In terms of acting the great thing is due to Michael Fassbender, who plays two roles, incredible though it may seem, even though they are two androids, are very different from each other, interpreting Walter, an android with a great sense of duty and no evil Who begins to question the concept of love, and David, an android already with more human traits, and a carrier of malice, confused feelings and megalomania, David tries to create a species to try to feel the love of his creation, Fassbender is very well interpreting The two roles, the same manages to make a robotic performance in one and more human in the other, he takes the beans from his character, and impresses, but unfortunately Fassbender is the only highlight in terms of acting here, Carmen Ejogo even has a load Dramatic but very cool, but can not have grandeur in the action scenes. Finally ""Alien: Covenant"", it is ""8 passenger"" only in the argument, because the rest is ""Prometheus"", the Alien in itself little appear is a problem here, even though even appeared even less in the ""8 passenger"", at least There he was the focus of the film, not here, we have butchers who give little fear and who are completely background for the story, besides some holes of scripts, and some things that have bothered me, such as the closing of the Film, where at the end is a report explaining what we have just seen and leaving a ganje that everyone has realized, if the film had finished a minute before would be the best closed of the franchise ""Alien"", but still it is a movie Cool, and is a shrewd complement to this franchise that is so loved and important pop culture.",Alien - Covenant

185,OttoVonB,Ridley Through The Looking Glass,6,31 May 2017,"They told me it was bad, but I went anyway. It's hard for me judge Ridley's work objectively, you see: two of his early masterpieces traumatized me as a kid and had a lasting effect on me, so I'm prepared to forgive a lot, perhaps too much. Except now, after 30+ years, I think I finally understand him.Let's zoom out a bit. Ever since the first Alien sequel came out, Scott had been musing about what a sequel involving him might be about. Rather than continue Ripley's journey, he would rather investigate the Alien's origins, especially the colossal race briefly shown in 1979's Alien - in a massive, eerie set Fox almost had canned because it was pricey and did nothing to advance the plot. Think about it: had Fox had held a slightly tighter purse, there would be no Prometheus. Hardly a heart-breaking prospect for most people, myself included.Fast-forward three decades and Scott got his chance. The answers to the questions nobody really cared about - since when does answering questions help a horror film? - were more puzzling than thrilling, and while you can commend Prometheus for trying something different, it didn't always do so successfully, chiefly in terms of design. Beyond the stupidity of the one-dimensional crew and the confusion of Damon Lindelof's rewrites, one of the greatest disappointments came from changing the engineers from Gigerian nightmares into gigantic blue Jason Stathams.So Prometheus came and went. Ridley went from saying it wasn't an Alien film, to admitting it had Alien DNA. Audiences cried foul when they realized it totally was an Alien film but didn't feature the illustrious xenomorph. When the inevitable sequel came, it looked like audience feedback weighed heavily in pretty much every respect. You can be the judge of whether or not this turned out to be a good thing.Alien Covenant reads like a wish-list of disgruntled Prometheus viewers. It fits in everything you liked last time around - Fassbender's android especially - and adds all the things you thought were missing, like the xenomorph (or is it still a prototype?), some brutal killings and echoes of the original film galore.A new crew gets diverted by a rogue signal (ring a bell?) and discovers a terraformed world with weird idiosyncrasies. Before they can investigate bad things happen and synth human David (Fassbender) comes to the rescue. He is immediately fascinated with the crew's own android Walter (also Fassbender) and we see what he's been up to for the past ten years with engineer technology. Playing God on his lonesome, only a version of God that makes the Old Testament maniac come across as a choir boy...From the get-go, Covenant goes out of its way to draw parallel's to 1979's Alien. Yes the prologue is pure Prometheus (in the best sense) but, form the way the titles pop up to plot beats, down to reuse of Jerry Goldsmith's score and the rehashed final 25 minutes, this really plays on your sense of nostalgia. It's a pity because while a lot of the newer ideas are a bit silly if you think about them for too long, they are the best things about the film. Them and Michael Fassbender. If you wonder why I haven't mentioned anyone else in the cast, it is because they are interchangeable and forgettable, but Fassbender is just so fantastic and put to such great use that he barely just about redeems the situation.Quick aside on the music: the Alien saga is unique in the variety of its aesthetics, but it's worth adding that each film had its own distinct musical identity, with no effort ever made to carry over even the slightest theme. This has led to some fantastic music: from Goldsmith's understated eerie original to Horner's martial classic, all the way to my favorite, Godenthal's apocalyptic Gothic opera for Alien 3. Prometheus had a solid, inspiring theme as well, but still made no attempt to unify the saga. While it comes at the expense of creating anything new and memorable, it is commendable of Jed Kurzel to so successfully bridge the gap for a change.Not all is perfect of course, for every awe-inspiring moment - a ravaged forest of giant trees, David's necropolis and attempt to ""pet"" a new alien, or his unleashing of deadly plagues - there is another of sigh-inducing stupidity: most of the crew's early decisions, a three-stooges-style alien VS rappelling proto-Ripley duel, or a twist you can see coming a mile away... and that shower scene alluded to in trailers is what you'd expect to see in Paul W. S. Anderson's Alien, down to its surprisingly inept execution.My expectations were low going into this, mainly because of word-of-mouth, but then I saw it, and suddenly everything made sense. You have to think of it this way: before it was a phenomenon, Alien was a B-movie. Yes it was the best-looking B-movie of all time, but a B-movie nonetheless. That is also, in a way, what Ridley Scott has always been: a hack with a golden eye, who makes the most heartbreakingly gorgeous B-movies you can feast your eyes on. If you go into Alien Covenant expecting that, you just might love it. I can't say I did, but it did adjust my appreciation for it.There are moments when it's a 1. Others (scarcer) where it could well be a 9 or 10. On the whole, I'll give it a 6.",Alien - Covenant
186,Med-Jasta,This is why you don't listen to fans!,5,12 May 2020,"They don't know what they want and they're going to hate everything they see the first time only in a year later on a second viewing, love it.Prometheus was an amazing movie. It was original and Ridley Scott fully jumped back in with his return to sci-fi to give us something on par with Alien and Blade Runner. And you goddamn nerds ruined it because the alien wasn't in it? Who cares!? Did you see that there was an actual movie being made that had a real story to tell?No you didn't because all you do is go into movies expecting to recapture nostalgia then you go on the internet and feed off of each other's hate and ruin the future of the next movie. That's why George Lucas retired and that's why Ridley gave into what you idiots wanted to give you exactly what you asked for. And you still hated it!The movie was fine as a ""Alien"" movie. But as a sequel to Prometheus it was terrible. So much was set up in that movie and in this it wad all dealt with off handedly with a flashback because you stupid nerds didn't like Prometheus.One of Ridley Scott's strengths has always been to make a movie that the studio can like and that can be original. He's very good and adapting to corporate demographic desires while still being an artist. I don't know how he does it but he's very good at walking that line.He wanted to make fans happy so he read all of your stupid ""follow the leader"" comments and made a movie based off of that. I really don't blame him. But I wish that even Ridley wouldn't give into the uncreative, nerd mob.",Alien - Covenant
187,DeBBss,Incredibly Stupid...,5,3 September 2017,"I'm a huge Alien fan, and I love the mystery, and lore of the Xneomorph specie, but this movie messes it all up, and the terrible cliffhanger ending.Story: 4/10A crew, and over 2000 colonists are going to a planet to colonize, but they found a rogue transmission on a near planet that is capable of life, so they went to investigate, and completely forget about their original plan, which is completely ridiculous, so once they found the source, which is from the ship from Prometheus, they then went back to their ship, but two crew members attracted a virus that releases a Protomorph, one Protomorph dies, but the other doesn't and kills most of their crew. Then they meet David from Prometheus who (SPOILER) turned evil, and he created the Xneomorph, and he also went on board the Covenant ship as David, and that's it, the ending is so bad, and cliffhanger. The story is very confusing if you didn't watch Prometheus, and I didn't watch it.Characters: 3/10David: David turned evil, and his goal is to create the perfect organism which is the Xneomorph, and he completes that goal in the most stupid way possible.Walter: Walter is the android of the covenant, he doesn't do much, but fail at protecting his crew.Daniels: Daniels is like a knock-off version of Ripley, and she's so boring, she doesn't do much, but kill the Xneomorph at the end.Oram: Oram is the reason why they got in this situation, he is like Daniels, but he played a bigger part in the story.Tennessee: Tennessee is one of the more better characters, he's likable, and he has a cool hat. I would like it more if he had more screen time.Action: 8/10The action is what's holding this movie up, it's bloody, and violent. The Sound affects, music, and visuals are amazing, by far this movie has the best visuals of the year, I just wish that I saw a battle between the Xneomorph, and the Protomorph, that would be the best part of the movie.This movie has great visuals, sound affects, and music, but a terrible, and stupid story, and bland characters, and that's why I'm going to give this movie a 5/10.",Alien - Covenant
188,gregberne11,Very Disappointing & Detracts from the Franchise,3,10 June 2019,"This movie was very disappointing to me. The visuals are great with all the typical jump scares and bloody, body horror you'd want and expect from an Alien movie. The acting was also good, particularly Waterston and Fassbender. But the writing is just not up to par with this one. The story seems like a thrown together mess that they didn't bother to think through properly. Especially disappointing is the incredibly predictable ""twist"" at the end. Everyone knows exactly what is coming so what's the point of even doing it? I don't want to give any spoilers but none of the characters deliver any surprises and most of them just exist to be killed at some point by the aliens. The backstory of the manufactured disease/alien xenomorphs is also just bizarre and for me it detracts from the overall mythos of the Alien franchise storyline. Hopefully the next film gets this franchise back on track. I really enjoyed Prometheus for what it was, but they're really going down a bad road here and I'm not sure they'll be able to repair the damage done.",Alien - Covenant
189,gavinp9,"Can't give it too low a score, because we still get to see Aliens killing humans, but not great either",6,2 January 2018,"'Alien: Covenant' is number 6 or 8 in the franchise, depending if you count the 'Alien Vs Predator' films, or not. It's a sequel to 'Prometheus', but a prequel to the original four 'Alien' films. Confusing? It doesn't matter too much, but Fassbender as the cyborg, Walter, links this film to 'Prometheus', where he was David. As such, he plays a large role in the plot, which is similar to all that has gone before - in the 22nd century, the crew is awoken from their ""hyper-sleep"" early by a mini-disaster and decide to stop on a nearby plant. What could possibly go wrong?I'm not really sure what Ridley Scott was going for here (only his third film in the franchise) - a mix of 'Alien' and 'Aliens', since it involves a bit of action on a planet, but also the final scenes trapped on a ship. Unfortunately, it's not done as well as either of those films. It takes over 40min for anything to happen, but because there's 15 characters, we don't get to learn much about them - just that Oram (Crudup) is the captain, Daniels (Waterson) his second-in-command and Tennessee (McBride) is the comic relief, that doesn't get any jokes - and that it's unlikely more than 20% of them will survive.The film could've done more to explore the ""Creators"" that were set-up in 'Prometheus', but it's only alluded to a little, with a slight twist being revealed. Both ""twists"" aren't that shocking, and while there's some good gore, there's no truly scary or tense moments. I almost wish they went a little less serious with it. I thought the finished about three times before it did end, and left me asking if it was necessary?",Alien - Covenant
190,JayPatton88,Fassbender does it again,8,11 November 2019,"I love the acting of Micheal Fassbender, he followed up ""Prometheus"" in ""Covenant"" with another excellent acting job presenting a duality of the Artificial life forms present in most of the ""Alien"" series of movies by R.Scott",Alien - Covenant
191,jmbwithcats,Good followup to Prometheus,7,4 September 2017,"I don't think ALIEN: Covenant is as bad as people are saying, but it does feel more like an extended pilot episode to a TV show than a feature film... all things being said, when you think of the production of TV these days it is hard to compete, especially since TV shows can spend years developing stories and characters, and movies really have to deal with pacing and story line constraints...All said and done, it was a good followup to Prometheus. My rating: 7/10",Alien - Covenant
192,jackmeat,Good tie in and well made sci fi flick,7,3 June 2017,"My quick rating 6,6/10. After being drawn into the Alien world basically created in Prometheus (which did branch from the more horror ""Alien"" and action of ""Aliens"") I was glad to hear they were going to give us a sequel, which is part of bridging the gaps created in all of the alien movies thus far. I could attempt to explain the whole thing, but I don't actually know all the tidbits and don't feel like doing research. I do know this is basically bridging the gap towards Alien, the first film. After ""Prometheus"", the synthetic David was left behind, and a crew 10 years later stumbles across an abandoned planet where he so happens to still be. They are on a mission for recolonization so in cargo are 2000 humans. Can you see where this is going? Having Ridley Scott behind the camera lens is a treat and it shows in the great scenes being put together throughout. The worlds created by HR Giger are again used some, not to a great extent, just enough to still look stunning. This one does add a bit more action into the film, which I was glad to see and is edited very nicely. Fassenbender does a good job in his double duty role, and they did a decent job of explaining as well. A nice beginning with a conversation between Walter (the newer version of David) and his creator. A deep question asked to start the movie off. Being a big fan of the whole series, I was thoroughly entertained but I can see why die hard fans are a bit annoyed. The actual aliens aren't used quite enough and for much of the movie, they aren't the big aliens that nightmares are made of but little aliens that give women nightmares (if you have seen the first ""Alien"" you know what that means). Just like I was quite perturbed I didn't see ""Prometheus"" in the theater, I would've liked to see this in the theater as well, but honestly, not sure it would've been worth 20 bucks...maybe 12 ;) And now that the bridge has been laid for the two time frames to meet, I wonder where this will go next......",Alien - Covenant
193,pkpera,Lifeless just as much Life is,4,4 August 2017,"This little play with words in review title is of course about another, recent, very similar movie: Life . I don't think that any was inspired by other, it is just how poor is today mainstream, high budget production. Honestly. I did not expect much from later R. Scott. It was just that there was nothing decent in offer, so I went in watching this. Whole neutrino outburst was pretty messy, unrealistic - as it was shown by CGI, nobody and nothing would survive it. That capsule fire was typical overdone scene, with shock as only purpose. And then, they landed on that 'to good to be true' (probably only wise sentence in movie), did quick air rest, and out from lander without any biological protection, just with weapons (ah, I forgot, it's action movie). And of course ... Then made another stupidity - followed some creature in his horror land. Just like that. I should stop at that point. But it was too hot, and I could not sleep. So, there came some alien gore scenes, and some deep as spoon philosophy by android. And crew members died like flies, until inevitable and predictable retreat. Even more predictable was the end ""twist"" - hey writers, if you want to make some real twist, what will not guess 98% of viewers, and what on top of it has some sense, please make some effort and use your gray matter. So, I rate it 4, only because visuals. Script self is 0. Ah, ratings: average here is 6.6 . But in first 2 pages of reviews it is about 1.2 :-)",Alien - Covenant
194,patches89,What could have been,3,19 November 2020,"For the steps forward that Prometheus took, this seemed to take the same amount back. This one follows a new crew who receive a distress call on their way to colonise a new planet and when they get there it looks too good to be true until a few members of the crew breathe in suspicious material and they get sick, leading to a form of xenomorph bursting through their chests. The crew remaining alive ushered to safety by the David from Prometheus but they quickly learn hes not to be trusted unlike their own David. This just seems to be a cash grab sequel that went from learning about the engineers to just want an alien film which is fine if you have a coherent plot. I somewhat enjoyed it for what it was but in no way was this a good film",Alien - Covenant
195,EvanKevelson,Getting slammed for what?,7,7 August 2021,"If Scott had skipped Prometheus and started with this...Than you have a great start to a sequel or two that would end with the vessel the Nostromos was set up and why the company wants it, or thinks they can control it.Is this some deep metaphysical film, no thank goodness. Like Alien it's just as good but after 5 movies you're not scared but you're definitely entertained. I'm sure ""David"" v ""Walter"" could have been explained or it could have been a different diversion without the origin aspect...because the ""Alien"" was gaseous... It went in an eye and nose etc.Like Prometheus there is a lot of stupidity...the crew was trained for colonizing a known tested destination how could they be dumb enough to even consider the planet? Because they're too lazy to make repairs? They don't want to freeze themselves again? So the premise has that gaping hole. You'd think ""Walter"" as a synthetic would advise the utter lack of wisdom. But if you're not overthinking this is significantly more entertaining and better cast than Prometheus. Prometheus was a pointless film in terms of the ""Franchise"".",Alien - Covenant
196,kaptenvideo-89875,It's not a fail but it's essential only for the biggest genre fans,6,15 May 2017,"Ridley Scott has been called a visionary director for some of his early work (Alien"", Blade Runner""). Later, he has been known as the man able always able to put together some big-ass epic. But I would argue that Scott's projects are not really famous for excellent screenplays, or actually becoming bona fide megahits. Only four times during his whole directing career spanning 50+ years has he given birth to a movie pulling some serious profit from cinemas: Gladiator"", Hannibal"", The Martian"" and Prometheus"". (Okay, the original Alien"" was super profitable too, but only because it had a small budget.) That may explain why the grand old man is still interested in making Alien"" movies, although he turned 79 last November and is certainly aware that he's not gonna be around for much longer. Yes, ""Prometheus"" and ""Covenant"" have been his attempts to expand on one of his most widely known and loved works, only with much bigger budget and computer power available today. Who couldn't dig that? Somehow, returning to his legacy piece after all these years, he is still not interested in giving new Alien"" a proper story worthy of 21st century. Not in Prometheus"", not in Covenant"". There are flashes of potential such as adding android characters and a female hero resembling Ripley. but storywise, changes are cosmetical and don't go near anywhere like trying to develop something with any real dramatic weight. It's still all about seemingly unstoppable extraterrestrial on a killing spree. Now with prettier pictures and more awesome explosions than in 1979. There's really not much more to talk about. It's an eighth Alien"" movie – sixth, if you want to exclude two AVP"" spin-offs. Action scenes are good, everything else is sadly disposable. It's not a fail but it's essential only for the biggest genre fans.",Alien - Covenant
197,CountJonnie,Alien: Legacy Tarnished,4,2 June 2017,"It might help to watch the first Alien. It was made in 1979, with simple but effective props. But what it mostly had to offer, was a sensation of claustrophobia. The fact that the monster was just there without too much explanation, added to the mystery and dread.After 4 movies it was a good thing that this epic story ended. Still, it was time for a prequel and we got Promotheus, which was part prequel, part completely different movie with aliens crammed into it. Considering the movie an unnecessairy remake, it was enjoyable to see the hommages and consistencies with the original movies (warning signal, claustrophobia and an android). What Prometheus added to the mythology, was the origin of mankind, but without much further explanation so what it did was create more loose threads and raise more questions. That alone was a good reason for another sequel/prequel, which is now Alien Covenant.Unfortunately it didn't deliver. Instead of continuing the story, it retold an original satisfying story in a different unsatisfying way. But the biggest flaw, besides that the crew seemed amateurish and the alien nothing more than a prop, was that they almost completely ignored the new mythology of the creators of mankind. That part was rushed over, and they focused completely on the humans and android, degrading the real alien to a side effect, nullifying the claustrophobic feeling.Instead of steering away from the humans, the focus is completely back on them, ignoring the new mythology, and disrespecting the old mythology. The movie fails in making the humans human, and it tries too hard to make an android too human. In that way, the movie is like a handbook of distorted human relations and the destructon that comes from it.In hindsight, not knowing the origin of humans and aliens would have been better, but we're past that. No more unknown dangers, mysterious signals and unseen aliens lurking in the dark....so it is indeed an end, of Alien as we knew it.",Alien - Covenant

This is an pair with Alien 3 it is another cash grab STINKER!! This movie sucks! Ridley Scott what are you doing? This movie suppose to be a sequel to Alien franchise not Prometheus! Michael Fassbender sucks in this movie! I hate the actor so much I hate him!The plot is un logical I don't get it: A group of people wake up on a ship from a hypersleep one guy dies and the crew get's a new captain. Some men goes and fix the ship and they are force to land on some distant planet which is beyond me? Why did they had to land on some distant planet? They land on a mystery planet and they split in 2 groups. 2 men separately in both groups get's infected by some black mysterious fog or what is it called. A small alien creature bursts from their chest and one of the men dies is infirmity and a girl leaves her colleague locked in a room with chestburster really selfish. The ship than explodes. The other group meets David (Michael Fassbender) from Prometheus who tells them lies and tricks his doppelganger Walter by killing him off to take his identity while other group runs away from this planet while an Alien runs away from the group like some clown instead hunting them down and killing them one by one like in the first original movie!On a ship the group of survivors are chasing an Alien? Why they chase an Alien? On the end of the film they kill off Alien and the guy David tricks them in too hypersleep, kills whole crew with some sleep gas and lies, laughs tricks Daniels (Katherine Waterston) which she was too late to realize what is going on. And we see the ship flying that's the end. In the space there were another group on a ship watching the planet didn't do anything. They didn't want too interfere. I hate , hate this movie! I hate the ending I hate it so much!!!!!!I don't understand this movie. This movie is not a horror movie it is a peace a S**t movie! It sucks the cast is unlikable. The movie fails been at good it fails. The CGI effects are awful horrible. Everything about this movie is forgettable half of the movie I fall a sleep. The cast is horrible Michael Fassbender still sucks in this movie.Where is intelligence in this movie? Excitement and brilliancy where is it? I don't see it. This movie with Alien 3 sucks!!!I like Ridley's Scott's Alien one of the best movies of all time. I am a fan of the first original Alien film!!!! Alien: Covenant sucks the story is a mess. I just don't get it. Does this movie copy's the first Alien? I guess so, like opening scene they have to land on a different planet like in the first movie. They find abandon ship like in the first movie. But in the first movie they come a cross large egg-like objects in this movie they come a cross David who saves them. David is overhyped - Michael Fassbender is overhyped actor in my opinion. There was no facehugger, chestburster or an Alien species in this movie at all. The music score is terrible, forgettable!!! Nothing, there is nothing good about this movie to say, except Ridley Scott you blow it!!!!!! I will never, ever in my inter life watch this movie again! Thank god I didn't buy it on Blu-ray it want come near my precious collection Alien and Aliens.Ridley Scott doesn't know what he is doing anymore. He just can not make a good alien movie anymore. I love James Cameron's masterpiece Aliens that is one of the best action films ever!!!! Alien: Covenant and Ridley Scott I hate you! You gave us a boring mess of a movie as long you got paid.

199,WalkdenEntertainment,Discover The Covenant and Scream...,6,9 January 2019,"Sequel from Prometheus, Alien: Covenant tells the story of a colony ship and its crew. Aiming to arrive at a remote planet, they divert off track and discover a new, uncharted paradise with a threat bigger than they had expected. Will this crew survive the threat and escape with their life?Director Ridley Scott (who, may I remind you, directed the original Alien film in 1979 and the most recent film in the Alien franchise, Prometheus) returns to continue explaining the story of how these Aliens creatures came to life.Like Prometheus, the overall visuals of Alien: Covenant are incredibly (as one would expect given the director). Although this new film is visually a lot darker, the director has still managed to pull off a strong visual film. The original sound effects and scary music we all loved from previous films managed to make a return which was respectful and enjoyable to hear.Unlike the previous film, Alien: Covenant does introduce us to a wider range of characters from the start of the film. Character development seems be a real struggle though, as the film will ask for its audience to care when no connection to the characters is present. While key characters do come in play within the 2 hours, even by the end credits I didn't feel any excitement for some of our key players. So much so, even as I was driving home I struggled to remember their names (It's not because I'm old lol), but because the film's characters here are somewhat forgettable. The biggest acting credit in this film goes out to Michael Fassbender (always amazing!) and Danny McBride (who really surprised me in this Alien film). Our leading lady did do well, but not enough didn't win me over. But, then again, how could anyone out do the character of Ripley?The film also takes the path of corny kill methods. You know what I mean? When someone says I need to take a break and takes a walk randomly on their own, we all know what's going to happen next, right? Alien: Covenant also take a very bold move and increases the total gore and violence to the next level to the point I would state this is the most violent Alien film to date. Violence isn't the only risks taken- this new Alien film even sneaks in touch of nudity.In the end, Alien: Covenant has delivered what I feel many fans have been asking for since the release of Prometheus. I personally understand that when cinema crowds see returns of the Xenomorph's on the big screens, many fans melt into their seats and supply high ratings for the film. For me personally, what may be classed as minor details to others were some of most important ones to me. The overloaded use of gore and many flat characters for me made this film challenging and holds me back from rating it as ""up there"" in the best in the franchise. When the film's predictable ending occurred and the credit's rolled down my screen I said out loud, ""This film feels like it kinda missed the boat"".6.4/10

200,srdjan_veljkovic,"It's the mediocre of both ""worlds""",5,1 June 2017,"Prometheus tried something different than the original Alien series. A lot of people didn't like it. I guess that's why this movie moves away from that and goes more into the original Alien ""look and feel"".So, it's somehow ""between worlds"". While not taking the worst of both, it's not taking the best of them either.The most interesting thing/questions about Prometheus, who are Engineers, what were they doing and why, is pretty much abandoned here. Their ""cameo"" of sorts, actually doesn't make much sense - with their advanced engineering, they should have detected the arrival of the ship, contents of its crew and cargo and taken precautions... What's left is the ""black goo"" and the silly ""evil robot"". Nothing interesting.Watching yet another ""unlikely female hero"" taking down the Alien isn't interesting either. I mean, if you do it once, it's interesting. If you start doing it all the time, it's not (it's also starting to seem like a rule that females are better at taking down Aliens, which doesn't make much sense, as Aliens are very physical and have little intelligence and next to no emotions).But, other than that, movie is well done, decently acted and has no essential flaws.So, you have some kind of ""well done"" bridge between the two interesting parts - original and the prequel - which succeeded at being uninteresting.Maybe we don't need to know more, really. We now know how the Aliens were created. We can let it be and watch the original unlikely female hero take them down again, if we so wish - and, no, I don't mean a new movie w/Sigourney Weaver The Alien prequels should stop.

203,doorsscorpywag,Who could have known space would be so difficult?,3,15 May 2017,"The first couple of things that seem strange about the story are firstly if Walter is superior to all his previous robots. Why take David and not Walter on the Prometheus mission? Secondly what is the point of taking two homosexual men on a mission to colonise a new planet? I doubt they will have much to contribute and other than cow tow to the Hollywood PC Police I saw no point to their role in the story.Also surely the Human race has a protocol for landing on an unexplored planet other than just get off touch stuff, breathe stuff in and blindly wander around without a care in the world. The original Alien had spacefarers that had some common sense but so far the first two bunch of clowns in this trilogy frankly deserve all they got.Our not so bright would be colonists answer a call from John Denver and set off to alter course to what turned out to be a not so great second part. The acting was not great and the characters were totally forgettable and had no real chemistry between them unlike the original. These idiots must not have ever seen a horror movie as they do all the wrong things such as believing someone they had never met before and walking around on their own. They are an insult to idiots.There was a lot that did not make that much sense. Why was the spacecraft where it was instead of where David said it was in his flashback. Confused? Join the queue. The evolution of the alien species does not make sense that much nor does the actions of David from the last movie to this one. Stupid action by pilot after sensibly not allowing a crew mate out of the med bay because of another crew member was infected then after both are dead opening the door and falling over on some blood. David being able to style his hair exactly like Walter with a pair of garden shears and a mirror. Shaw wanted to know why the Builders wanted to kill us? Looks like that has been forgotten. The aliens themselves were not that great either. The 1979 man in a suit far more frightening than todays CGI.And why the semi erotic shower scene? With all hell let loose and one of their number in the med bay. Two of the crew decide it would be sensible to jump in the shower and bonk each other to loud music. Which does not work out that well as we saw on the trailer. But surely there were a lot of things needed doing than each other. But we are not dealing with the brightest bunch here.We actually see aliens in this Alien film but most of the scenes are in the trailers so it's not as big an alien fest as we were led to believe. It has some good ideas and a lot of not so good and seemed to me like a lot of scenes from the rest of the Alien movies stitched together.Also if anybody does not get the shock twist at the end way-way before the end then they were probably asleep.It isn't rubbish but I have to say I expected more in every department. Alien 4 was better than this and would have been a good point to follow on from rather than this increasingly silly prequel that is all over the place and making less sense as it goes on. What the next episode will be like? Another crew of idiots wandering about another planet sniffing stuff and meeting a gory end?To be absolutely honest there should never have been an Alien 2, which I enjoyed a lot, and Ridley should have just stuck to Blade Runner.",Alien - Covenant

The ""Alien"" franchise has a very loyal audience and a deep mythos that's easy to get absorbed in. And while watching ""Prometheus"" and ""Alien: Covenant,"" it's kind of easy to see that Ridley Scott might be making things up as he goes along. However, that doesn't stop these movies from being highly philosophical and exceedingly interesting. The best parts of these movies, and this movie specifically, is when it deals with the subjects of creation, God, and life. The opening scene is extremely riveting, featuring an android gaining the knowledge of immortality for him, and inevitable death for his human creator. This film deals with a bunch of interesting topics, and I was enthralled by the questions that were brought up.But, if you're watching a movie with ""Alien"" in the title, chances are you're looking for some alien violence, and boy do you get it. The action in this movie was intense, thrilling, and white-knuckle. The very first, and very last set pieces were so exciting that my heart was actually racing, something that hasn't happened to me while watching a movie in a long time. And the aliens are a bit different in this movie, as well. They can run, and run fast, moving sporadically and unpredictably, and in my opinion, this just added to their horrifying nature, because how can you defeat something when you don't know what it's going to do next?This may get me crucified, but I think Ridley Scott, when it comes to action, is a mediocre director. For some reason, he seems to enjoy adding a lot of shaky camera to his action scenes, which I find very distracting. However, when it comes to this movie, he didn't overdo it, and I found that the slight shaky cam actually enhanced the intensity; there were times where I legitimately found it hard to watch because of how insane things were getting. And again, I'm not saying Ridley Scott is a bad director, because when it comes to science-fiction, the man is a God. Seriously, this movie is gorgeous. There are shots and sequences that I can't stop thinking about it. I mean, just watch the trailer and tell me that the film doesn't look incredible. Any other director and this movie wouldn't look as good as it does. Say whatever you want about Scott, the man knows science-fiction, and the man puts impeccable, beautiful detail into all of his movies. Seriously, this is the best-looking film I've seen in a long time, and simply how lovely his movies look is what makes ""Alien: Covenant"" as good as I think it is. The acting was also very good by everyone, even though the characterization was lacking. I have heard that there are scenes on YouTube that were taken out of the film that expand on the characters and add some much-needed characterization, and maybe this is laziness on my part, but I didn't watch them because I don't think a film should require homework before I watch it. However, because I loved this movie as much as I did, I will definitely go back and watch it. And even though the characters are a bit bland, that doesn't stop the performances from being excellent. Katherine Waterston especially was not only the most attractive woman I've ever seen on screen before in my life, but also gave a very explosive, emotional performance that I won't soon forget. James Franco too was on fire in this movie, and I'll leave it at that.""Alien: Covenant"" is one of the best science-fiction movies I've seen in a long time. It's just so existential, contemplative, and thought-provoking, as well as exciting, suspenseful, thrilling, and horrifying. It's not just a movie you can put on and enjoy because of the violence and action, but it's a movie that brings up life-questions, a movie that deals with creation and creator, a movie that questions what it means to be a created being, and what it means to be a creator, and it's all of these things that elevate this film to new heights. Because, being an ""Alien"" film, all they really had to do was rehash previous plot points; they could've made a 2-hour movie about people being trapped on a ship and stalked by an alien - rinse and repeat, give us money please. But this film doesn't do that. It challenges its audience, brings up incredibly interesting philosophical questions, and leaves a ton of things open for interpretation and discussion, and I don't have a doubt in my mind that I'll be thinking of this movie and theorizing about it for a long, long time.9/10",Alien - Covenant
206,Maleplatypus,"CPL movie, again",2,26 June 2017,"Cheap, Predictable, Lame. C-movie with an A movie budget. Ridley Scott drowning more and more into dumbness with each next movie he makes. Good cast with below average acting. Mixing Star trek technology (David/Walter) with 20th century practically everything else (especially weapons). Unimaginative. Pale copy of the even paler copy. No psychology. No fear. Nothing scary (except writing - such a story shall be seriously reviewed by someone who, at least, knows how it's done). Nice visuals cannot replace the lack of common sense and dilettantism. Move along, folks. Nothing to see here. And I thought it can't get worse than Prometheus. Oh, yes, it can. Wait for the next sequel, though. There is still some space to go lower than this. I cinema theater everyone can hear you scream for your money back. Facepalm.",Alien - Covenant
207,FallenEye,"A New (B)earth, In A Familiar Womb.",6,13 May 2018,"The crew that landed on the Earth-like planet were both careless and callous. They requested and encouraged the crew still left on the Covenant, to descend into territory of which who's dangers they were fully aware of, and allowed for thousands of lives to be put at risk, so theirs could be saved.That however, didn't necessarily diminish my enjoyment of this movie, as it was really a mixed bag of the same old tired repetition of the Alien franchise formula and stalled structure, with a dash of something new in the form of knowing who exactly, and in fact, created the aliens, but, there was some major ""bad"" in that revelation.Prometheus gave the impression that it was the origin point of the aliens, including the planet they were on, and that those aliens were created by the superior human race, just to find that nope, both the planet and the ""superiors"" were just some kind of filler.Also, the exciting story is experiencing Shaw's journey into encountering this new race and its planet, however, we were robbed of this story, where David being the creator would've then worked as an exciting twist. Sadly, because of the lack of proper story progression, the David twist ended up being annoyingly predictable and monotonous.Characteristically, Alien: Covenant is a lot like 1986's Aliens, so personally, I wouldn't understand how anyone who praised Cameron's work then, would find major fault in Scott's work here.The idea is still amazing. ""God"" creates man. Man creates android. Android creates alien. Alien kills android's god, and its gods' god, for its own god; a covenant. Absolutely, a story too exciting, but sadly, handled with heavy hands. The Alien franchise could've rotated around the sun, instead, it merely rotated around its own axis. 6.3/10.P.S. What exactly is going on, on Earth? What does Earth look like in this franchise? Does it look like how it does at the end of Resurrection, or does it not? If it does, why? What happened?

208,austin0731,"Better than Prometheus, not as great as the original films",6,2 July 2017,"Better than Prometheus, not as great as the original films. Alien Covenant was pretty good, there were intense sequences and solid scares but gave us no further development on the origins of humans. The humans in this film continued to make stupid decisions and the Xenomorphs obliterated them, just as any other Alien movie. The saving grace of this whole thing though, was Michael Fassbender as the droids David and Walter, his performance was amazing and David's arc of trying to create the perfect lifeform was very interesting. The back and forths and interactions between the two were very well acted and interesting to see unfold. Katherine Waterston as the 'new' Ripley was pretty good also, she was a similar role but does manage to distinguish herself from Ripley's character. I didn't really like the way the aliens looked in this film though, there was a shot that I remember which was also in the trailer where a Xenomorph was jumping onto a glass window and I just thought how much better practical effects are.Overall it was a decent watch, it had enough action and unfolding of the mystery surrounding David's character but isn't really the groundbreaking film that the original movie was.",Alien - Covenant

210,asifahsankhan,"The 3rd Best ""Alien"" MOVIE in the whole ""Alien"" MOVIE Franchise. . .",7,31 May 2017,"""I gotta take a leak,"" announces one character during a dicey moment when it's probably best not to wander off.""Don't go too far,"" says his partner, watching him as he scampers off into the outer-space equivalent of the woods surrounding the cabin in a slasher movie. It's hardly a spoiler to say in the history of scary movies, when someone says they have to go to the bathroom, they rarely just do their business and happily return to the flock.The ""Alien"" franchise is something of a chronological Rubik's Cube, in that the movies coming out now predate the movies from the 1970s and 1980s on the fictional time-line.This makes for some on screen techno-anachronisms.Example. Ridley Scott's ""Alien: Covenant"" takes place prior to the events of the original ""Alien"" (1979), but since it was filmed in the mid-2010s, it's an impressive technical achievement, with amazing CGI special effects plunging us deep into outer space and deep into the future.If you go back and watch ""Alien"" (as I did), it's a great movie — but of course it has those late 1970s special effects and production values (and hairstyles), and a nearly 40-year-old vision of what computers and space travel and synthetic robot beings would be like in the year 2122.""Alien: Covenant"" is set 10 years after ""Prometheus,"" which took place in 2093, so now we're in 2103, about two decades prior to the events of ""Alien,"" and if that doesn't mess with your mind, wait until you see the Dueling Fassbenders portion of the current movie.This is the third-best ""Alien"" movie, with James Cameron's ""Aliens"" as the standard-bearer, and the original (directed by a young Ridley Scott) close behind. There are high-faulting' references to the likes of Byron and Wagner and Shelley — but at its core, ""Covenant"" is a glorified monster movie, with some great ""gotcha!"" scare moments and, yes, a number of scenes in which a number of supposedly super- smart characters do some really stupid things that get them killed dead-dead-dead.There's only conscious entity aboard Covenant: Walter, a next- generation synthetic who looks exactly like David, which is convenient seeing as how Michael Fassbender plays both synthetics. Everyone else is in the midst of a multi-year cryogenic hyper sleep — but Walter has to awaken the crew when a freak accident plunges the ship into emergency mode.The beloved captain of the ship dies, leaving the by-the-book, self- doubting Oram (Billy Crudup) in command.(Sidebar: It's a bit of a distraction that the quickly-killed-off captain of the Covenant is played by a well-known star. We keep wondering if this character is going to somehow return, because why else would a popular leading man take such a tiny role?)Key crew members aboard the Covenant include the smart and resourceful Daniels (Katherine Waterston), who was married to the late captain; the calm and collected Karine (Carmen Ejogo), who is married to the CURRENT captain (Crudup), and the wisecracking, cowboy-hat-wearing' pilot Tennessee (Danny McBride), who is married to the tough-as-nails Faris (Amy Seimetz).(All of this coupling makes sense, when you consider the goal of the mission is to land on a distant planet and stay there for the duration.)When the Covenant receives a mysterious distress signal, Oram believes it could lead them to a paradise planet even more suited to human life than their original planned destination. Ignoring Daniels' warnings, Oram directs the ship to the mysterious but lush, warm and inviting planet.Of course, there's trouble lurking just around the bend. It's only a matter of time before nasty creatures rear their ugly heads and bare their sharp teeth, and various crew members are dispatched in gruesomely entertaining fashion.Also occupying the planet: none other than David, the synthetic from ""Prometheus,"" who tells the crew he's been here for the last 10 years.Enter the Dueling Fassbenders.David becomes a sort of mentor to Walter, even though Walter is the more advanced and sophisticated synthetic. Fassbender's work in these two roles is an understated wonder to behold; he creates two distinct characters that often interact with one another, and he manages to infuse each synthetic creation with unique personality traits.That said, at least one bit of interaction between Walter and David is just goofy and unintentionally funny. And a big plot revelation deep into the story is one of the least surprising ""twists"" in recent film history.""Alien: Covenant"" includes a number of nods to the first two ""Alien"" movies, to the point where it sometimes plays like a Greatest Hits collection. At least they're covering a classic.This is the 3rd Best ""Alien"" MOVIE in the whole ""Alien"" MOVIE Franchise. . . If nothing else, it's powerful potent performances from Waterston and Fassbender won't disappoint you.",Alien - Covenant

212,FelipeCarrillo,No one has heard our screams (requests) yet,7,11 August 2017,"""Alien: Covenant"", remake and simultaneously prequel, is the latest entry in the saga of ""Alien."" The most recent feature film, under the leadership of Ridley Scott, is repulsive and intriguing when it wants but slow, abstruse and tragic when not realize that it is. Despite the fact that it boasts about the progression of the mistakes previously made—factor that to some extent is true, at least visually—, the story of the crew reiterates falling into other vices that impede equating to the sci-fi horror bible as is the original ""Alien"".Basing on the usual narrative biotype, Scott—father of the saga— conceives the story on which horrific creatures evolve with a wide list of screenwriters. When you hear the name of more than two scriptwriters in the conception of a work, the reviews mostly tend to be unfavorable; It's really unheard of the project that manages to jell and fit all the ideas in the same plot with satisfaction. Here, Hollywood fixation about stuffing of elements a tale is present in the complete screenplay, more not in the sketch of the traditional story.The protagonist, a capite ad calcem, is Michael Fassbender, who performs two characters worthy of praise. Fassbender decides to further explore his acting skills under a hard gestural and vocal force by portraying, respectively, androids David and Walter. The first one is a synthetic human model assigned to the crew of the USCSS that served as a guide and the second one is the most brand-new incorporation into ""Alien"" universe, Walter is the greatest triumph of trial and error in the creation of androids, being the first of a better-forged species than David 6's. Fassbender ratifies why he is one of the best actors of our century, thanks to the roles given by Scott.In times of ""Wonder Woman"", Katherine Waterston's aim (Daniels) was neither to conquer nor emulate the original heroic lady interpreted by Sigourney Weaver, her character, always according to her, must be an example of thinking strength of women, of their aptness in any human field, of building hope and faith and a model role for future leaders; to emphasize the attitude of females in a sexist Hollywood, plainly. Her purposes have been fulfilled, but also, they have been notoriously distorted by external expressions. And the new problems come to light. Attenuation of philosophical load, so characteristic of the saga being the promoter of its existence, is restricted to a ten-minute deep prologue where Walter and his creator refute on gods, origins and art matters. Another terrible mistake is the extremely long introduction–more than sixty minutes—to put us in the atmosphere of the characters, more than half of its initial act could be cut. However, the biggest mess is that indicated in the preceding paragraph. In addition to having a prestigious Oscar award by its special effects, in USCSS Nostromo movie the appearance of the aliens is scarce, thus, horror comes out of the tension of the situation, of the alert state that aroused a sudden jump of the alien, even, spaceship interiors produced uncertainty and insecurity, the famous and masterful suspense by which the work is praised. The flaw lies in the decision of Scott about redeeming himself with the short participation of the xenomorph on the screen, he sins due to innocent because although the first aftermath of the lethal virus in the body of a crewmember is frightening, disgusting and surprising, this pace begins to wander, a back and forth between scenes, leaving as the chief source of supposed terror to the alien, fantastically created by CGI, causing a suspense lack in the plot, unfortunately, affecting in the prediction of the final cliffhanger, however, concerning this, it leaves a feeling of wanting far more, blessed Walter!Independent of the flaws of ""Prometheus"", ""Alien: Covenant"" amend some of the issues of the previous installments, however, adds many others placing the film in a limbo, in a loop. This movie fails to be classified under horror genre—despite its delectable gore— rather, it's an audio-visual sci-fi production that raises questions that no one requested and, in the end, doesn't respond the already proposed ones. Having as a measure of the quality Scott's previous films,"" Covenant ""is far from being like the original movie, however, the way of introducing, artistically, the questionable story is fascinating, a paradise where they won't hear your screams, although, we're doing it. ""The Path to Paradise begins in Hell"", right now, we're going to the real hell, in all the extension and effect of the word.",Alien - Covenant
213,daniewhite-1,Alien: comatosed,4,11 January 2020,"After the disjointed shambles that was 'Prometheus' 'Alien: Covenant' seems to confirm that making prequels to the classic 'Alien' is simply a bad idea. Whatever Ridley Scott can conceive of is not as good as the vacuum of unknowns from which the initial monsters sprung in that original film.For some reason metaphysics and pseudo ""hi-culture"" themes are layered inexpertly onto a monster movie franchise.The plot requires levels of willful ignorance on the part of its cast of characters and, just as much, on the audience to make any kind of narrative sense; probably because this is an oddly positioned bridge between two films that occupy almost unrelated creative locations in 'Alien' and 'Prometheus' despite their sharing a director and a cinematic franchise.The result is a boring and derivative film.However a couple of the action sequences are well staged, particularly the rescue scene. Also the reappearance of iconic designs in the aliens life cycle is nice to see; especially the movements of the adult xenomorph, which in various scenes of 'Alien: Covenant' harks back to its upright stiff 'Alien' appearance and it's more charging 'Aliens' and it's animal like 'Alien3' designs.All characters apart from the female lead are almost completely underwritten and, barring the stand in captain, forgettable.Death scenes and horror sequences are barely horrifying due to a complete lack of emotional resonance let alone raw human emotional saturation.I rate 4/10 because I liked some of the xenomorph design work and the rescue sequence in particular was pretty well staged and developed ""outrageous exploits"" stuff: good fun.However the rest is so repetitive and recycled from the alien franchise, other film of Scott's, and unrelated sci fi films of the last 30 years and so blandly handled by a director who appears more preoccupied by unnecessary and un-illuminating pondering that this is definitely a low point in a franchise which is starting to collect quite a lot of them.I think that the alien franchise has a good horror monster movie still in it, but I now doubt if Ridley Scott is a man capable of making it.",Alien - Covenant

215,mattiasflgrtll6,"Boring, overstuffed and unsatisfying",6,18 June 2017,"It was 5 years since I saw Prometheus in theaters. I remember really liking it, despite all the negative reviews. And so, I was looking forward to the sequel. Then it was changed to an Alien prequel. Okay. We've had a bit too many Alien movies, but it still could work. Some nods to Prometheus, then it tries to be its own movie.Unfortunately, after watching it, I gotta say I was very disappointed.If you want a good sequel to Prometheus, it doesn't work since it tries to be that in such a hackneyed way. If you want a good Alien movie, it doesn't work since it lacks suspense and on top of that is an incompetent prequel.Let's go over the positives at first, which I'll be brief with. Danny McBride was very good in his role, and the only character you could root for in some way (even though he made his fair share of dumb choices). The scenery when the crew first landed on the planet looked gorgeous, like you really were in another world. Occasionally, the gore effects were pretty good. The build-up to the first alien about to burst is well-done. And finally, Michael Fassbender really tries. The script he was handed might have been flawed, but he did what he could with it.Now... What went wrong? How about almost everything. The characters are so boring. Most of them are just throwaway alien bait, and Oram is such a dumb flipping character I was rolling my eyes and cringing in frustration. Katherine Waterson puts in a wooden performance as Daniels, a character which at first is annoyingly bland, then turns into a cheap copy of Ripley.So, the story. Oh Jesus. They find David (the robot from the previous movie) on this mysterious planet, and decide to follow along with him (for some reason, they don't even question how he comes out of nowhere) to his cave, where we get to see some hilariously bad brother-to-brother bonding where they talk using big words and play flute. But here's where it gets really dumb: it turns out that the aliens who we have been fascinated by and scared of for years... WERE CREATED BY A FU''CKING ANDROID! There it is, folks. Once you find out you can't unhear it. Forget about the aliens being these cool creatures of the unknown, David the master robot built them. It's such a middle finger to the fans beyond words. Anyway. David has turned evil and got time to kill a crew member. YET, Orum doesn't react and decides to go with him when he's told to. Are all the people in this movie robots? Is nobody capable of free will or survival instincts? When David told him to look closer into the egg, I was laughing at how stupid he was. How many times do we have to see someone make the same stupid mistake? It's even dumber when he already knows David killed someone! As for the David/Walter conflict (the two brother Androids), it's kind of entertaining in a way but by that time the movie had already lost me. The crew (what's left of it anyway) gets back on the ship, the movie turns into a cheesy slasher flick, they thought they got Walter back with them but it turns out to be be David (PLOT TWIST!) and the movie ends.Oh, and two more things...The directing by Ridley Scott was sometimes baffling. Sometimes it wanted to be deep philosophical sci-fi, at other times a mindless stupid action movie, at other times gut-wrenching horror. None of this blended together which made this a tonally confusing mess. The camera work during intense scenes is terrible, it's so shaky that you can barely even see how the alien looks like. There is very little tension.The special effects for the aliens themselves were godawful. The xenomorph looked okay at best, but the other aliens were so poorly animated I wondered if I was watching a cartoon.I could bring up plenty of other problems (like why the fu''ck someone doesn't open up when the other person screams for help and there's a better chance of saving her right then and not by running after someone else), but I'm too tired.

I think it has a great way to combine both stories to serve as a prequel to ""Alien"", tho I would not be surprised if there's a third entry of this saga.The formula of the Alien franchise is almost the same when it comes to someone believing to be a god and using the xenomorphs to prove it, and that is all I will say about the plot.As for the story line I think it was well thought and developed, the characters led by Katherine Waterstone, Billy Crudup, Michael Fassbender, were charismatic and endearing. It is hard to make you care about characters in a horror movie since you know some of them will die but I think the script and the actors created something really good here, As for the pacing it was much better than the previous entry and the special effects were truly amazing. You can really feel the touch of director Ridley Scott thru the screen.I will say tho that some story lines do not align themselves well with the ""Alien v Predator"" series, which is supposed to serve as prequels to Prometheus and Alien: Covenant. There were serious inconsistencies with those movies the last time around and I really wished they had resolved them in this one, and to be honest not only did they not resolve those inconsistencies but they made them worse by adding some plots that pretty much negated the existence or relevance of the ""Alien v Predator"" franchise.All things considered I give Alien: Covenant an 8 out of 10, possibly one of the best entries in the entire franchise.",Alien - Covenant
217,dakjets,Good horror - but far from the best,6,29 May 2017,"I'm a big fan of this genre and these movies. The expectations were therefore great before I went into the movie theater to see what Ridley Scott has done now. This is an Alien movie that does not shame on its predecessors. But it is far from the best in this series. (I do not include Aliens vs Predator!) It is also much more exciting than Prometeous. So why am I a little disappointed? I've been thinking a lot after I saw this movie. First of all, what's positive, the film has some benefits from all the technical possibilities that exist now, which did not exist in 1979. This draws the film benefits, especially in the action scene and how the monster is. What I miss here, as opposed to Alien and Aliens, is the mediation of anxiety we all felt when we say these movies. What happens now? Where does the monster pop up next time? Here it is more linear and action-oriented. And more hunting scenes. I think the movie loses on it. It is the claustrophobic, fearful predecessors who made the films so creepy and unpredictable. Here it is more obvious what will happen. Moore blood yes, but I was much more scared when I saw Alien.I want to draw out actress Katherine Waterston as a big plus in the movie. She is very good and carries a lot of the film.I really hope that Sigourney Weaver will appear next time, in a brand new follow up to the brilliant Aliens.",Alien - Covenant

James Franco turning into KFC near-immediately after the film started, which was A LOT of fun 2. the Alien scuttling about like a cat on fireSo, there was more alien-on-human touchiness than there was in ""Prometheus"", and although I'm sure there was a lot more processing power here than in all of the LOTR films together, the first made Alien films churned out more scariness per minute than this one.

Oh god. Where's Freddy and Jason when we need them? Didn't they make a film with both of them already, and Predator?

I suppose many people were disappointed with it due to the lack of aliens, but Alien: Covenant delivers on that. I've got a feeling this movie will still be very hit or miss with people. This one feels more like it is calling back to the original Alien and ticking boxes. There are deaths, there are familiar creatures in there, but is that really a good thing?Let's get the bad out of the way first. The CGI on the aliens is certainly quite shaky. I could tell straight away when they were not really there and I did end up missing the rubber suits in the earlier movies. Next, it could be argued it was really trying to be like the original Alien, but I don't think it comes close to that level. I wouldn't consider this a Horror movie, myself, but some could see it was trying to be like one. The movie could also be seen as quite predictable, but that's not always a negative.If you were looking for aliens, then Alien: Covenant will deliver. The big muscle guys from Prometheus hardly appear in this, and are instead replaced by these ""Prototype"" aliens that aren't quite the Xenomorphs we come to know and love. The plot is basically these crew members on the Covenant ship go to this planet after a distress beacon sends them there. Things go horribly wrong and we have the Walter/David Androids played by Michael Fassbender returning from Prometheus. The other cast do a great job too, but Fassbender is still the highlight.Ridley Scott continues to direct great visual scenes from Prometheus and the set design is top notch. It certainly looks like an Alien movie, but maybe that could be seen as a problem of it so trying to be an imitation of one. It didn't bother me personally, but it's kind of hard to be surprised at anything that's already been done quite a bit. There's a few good action scenes here and there, and I certainly didn't find it boring despite the slow start. A few religious and creationism themes from Prometheus return in this movie, but some questions are also left unanswered by the end that might annoy some viewers.So, will this be more hit than miss compared to Prometheus? Well, I think it could go either way once again. Some who wanted to see more of the religious and creative themes, as well as a nice mix of aliens here and there could like it. On the other hand, some may see it as a failed imitation of the original Alien and just not working for them as they wanted. It definitely wasn't perfect, but what people want from these is never going to please everyone.7.5/10",Alien - Covenant
222,Sober-Friend,Ridley Scott Go Away,6,27 June 2017,"Just like Steven Spielberg Ridley Scott can no longer make decent and entertaining film. Steven Ruined all future ""Indiana Jones"" with ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls"" Ridley Scott has ruined ""Alien"" because he ruined ""Alien"" with ""Prometheus"" and ""Alien Covenant"". ""Covenant"" adds nothing knew. It starts off boring and stays that way. the only thing different about this film is the fact that there is a homo erotic scene that the others never had. JJ Abrams needs to come along and save ""Alien"". Ridley is an old fart who makes long and boring films. He should retire. If you watch this film you will see why!",Alien - Covenant
223,sirwillisiv,Not much of an improvement over Prometheus...,6,17 November 2017,"Alien: Covenant revives the helpless, gory thrills of the classic 1979 film, but its weak characterization and predictable story dumb it down from being anything more than a run–of–the–mill popcorn thriller. However, Michael Fassbender does a splendid job portraying two characters that share a substantial amount of screen time together.",Alien - Covenant
224,TheOny13,Why does this movie exist?,1,15 September 2020,"Remember Prometheus everyone? Remeber how people called it a dumb, self-indulgent, vanity project from a past-his-prime director that abandoned everything that made the original so compelling? Remeber how it seemed almost inconceivable to have a sequel to that movie, and even if someone did it, how it couldn't be dumber and less coherent than that movie? Well, prepare to have your expectations subverted harder than a Star Wars fan because here comes Alien Covenant to suck 122 minutes of your life and give you nothing in return except a bad headache and a sense that something terrible just happened. So let's dive right in and break this movie down!Plot Analisys:The movie begins with a flashback to Peter Wayland when he first creates the android from Prometheus. They play piano and talk about the finite resources of human existence and then Wayland asks David to choose a name. And because the statue of David just so happens to be there, well, you can guess what he goes for. Now, right of the bat you're gonna notice some red flags that you're going to watch a train wreck of a movie such as: pretentious classical music that tries to establish a pseudo-intellectual tone to the movie, stark futuristic enviroment mixed with pieces of antique symbolizing the decline of classical culture and individuality in the face of cold sterile technology, refrences to David the giant killer foreshadowing David's role in killing the physicaly larger, more powerful and technologicaly superior alien bodybuilders, conversations between a mortal man and his imortal creation about the finite human existence and questions about where humanity comes from and it's purpose. Flash forward to the present day 11 years after the events of Prometheus when a ship named Covenant travels to a distant planet in order to colonize it. The ship is watched over again by a droid, this time he is called Walter who is played again by Michael Fassbender. Man, stick to formula Ridley! So the droid is having a great time until a solar flare comes out of nowhere and damages the ship. So, he wakes up the crew but in the process the captain burns inside. What's the probability that the most competent person of all would die first? So, the crew is made up of married couples which couldn't be more of a bad idea when you think that this is a work done in highly stressful and possibly life treathening conditions which require closed cooperation as well as a unified chain of command. Then we are introduced to the protagonist of the movie, the Ripley-wanna-be. Honestly I haven't seen a more boring, bland and generic character in an Alien movie ever! Even Elizabeth Shaw from Prometheus was better, she at least kept your attention on screen. So the crew gets a signal from a nearby planet and the captain-replacement decides to go there and check the planet even though they know nothing about it. So they go and explore the planet without any protective gear or biological precautions. And then they find a donut ship lying there and then a disposable extra steps on some balls that evaporate some spors that enter his ears, but only his and not anyone elses. Wait what? Why is there no one in his vecinity infected too? Were they wearing their plot armor and he didn't? So they take him to the lander and a proto-alien (neomorph) bursts from his back. Needless to say that these people are some of the dumbest characters in any movie ever. They're clumpsy, falling over, slipping in pools of blood and other stupid things that are too many to list in this review. Then one of the disposable extra discharges her gun in a confined space in the lander where gas was leaking and then the lander blows up. Then another disposable extra gets infected as the team gets back to the lander and he is being brought back there when another neomorph comes out of his mouth. They get attacked from a pack of neomorphs and more disposable extras die. Then David from Prometheus comes and saves them. Wait... didn't he had his head riped off in Prometheus? Nah, whatever... I guess he got better. Then he takes them to a temple and tells them that he and another girl came to this planet accidently released the black goo that killed the whole population and then the girl died from unrelated reasons. And for some reason all the crew believe his obviously-fake story and decide to follow him. So David and Walter meet and have some scenes together, then David takes the captain-replacement to an egg which contains a face hugger and the guy just stares near the egg because David told him. So the captain-replacement does that. So guess what happens... the face hugger jumpes in his face. How are any of these people possible? They have like 0 independent thinking and common sense. Why are we ment to emphasise with them again? So Walter discovers Shaw's body somewhere in the temple and then David reveals that he came and released the black goo to kill all the alien bodybuilders and then he killed Shaw to experiment on her in order to create more of the neomorphs that he wants to use to destory humanity. What??? Are you really telling me that this race of powerful beings was exterminated by a droid using their own black goo? Wouldn't there be some sort of planetary defence system? Wouldn't they thought that it would be suspicious when one of their donut ships came back without any of their kind? What's David motivation in all this? Why creating the neomorphs when the black goo was perfectly fine to destroy humanity? You know, the problem with answering existential questions is that you need to give reasonable answers and not spawn more dumb questions. So if a race of bodybuilders created us for unknown reasons then deicded to kill us for equaly unknown reasons then who created them? Why does David want to destroy them but also us? So David and Walter get into two fights, David wins the first one then goes after Daniels but then Walter comes back and kills David off screen. No, nothing suspisious here, just continue watching the movie. Then they get back to the Covenant but the captain-replacement was impregnated by a face hugger and an alien comes out and kills some other disposable extras, so Daniels impales it on a machine and blows it out into the space. Where have I seen this before? Man, why are the only partially good elements in this movie stolen from other better movies? So Daniels goes to sleep but then she notices that Walter is David in disguise, because he somehow managed to not get killed off screen, totally change his apearance and not trigger any alarm system while entering onto the Covenant. Then David pours some face huggers eggs from his mouth and then the movie ends. And that's it, that's the plot for Alien Covenant.So understanding the message throughout the whole two films in this new Alien series is that the face huggers were created by a robot? Like why? Why is that explanation necessary? How is that a good enough explanation for the questions the original movie raised? Yes I know that a droid in the original movie worshiped the alien creature as being the perfect organism. But is that small hint enough to make another franchise of movies explaining that the alien creatures came from another android several years before the events of the original movie? No, no it's not!End Of Plot Analisys.Now if you're anything like me and you've finished the movie you'll be: ""What in the world did I just watched?!"" It's like the writers picked up the best scenes from the original Alien movies, added some goofy action scenes from Marvel movies and some pretentious phylosofical music from movies like 2001 A Space Odyssey. The problem is that while all these things are individually good, mashed together they don't add to something coherent and good as a movie. You know, most people didn't want any answers to the questions that the original movie posed anyway. The original movie wasn't good because of those questions, it was a good movie because it was an effective horror movie. We didn't need to know where the face huggers came from nor where the alien bodybuilders came from. All we needed to know was that for all their technology the alien bodybuilders were killed by the same creature that was going to exterminate the crew of the Nostromo. The original movie didn't tried to answer any questions about the origin of life, because it did what it intended to do expertly well. It was a fantastic horror movie. So, in the end that basically boils everything down for me. If you want to make a grand sci-fy epic about exploring the deep existential questions of the human nature, fine! Go ahead! But don't try to insert that into the Alien franchise and cash it in on fan enthusiasm. Just like other franchises (Star Wars, Star Trek, Terminator, Doctor Who, etc.) this movie proves that the Alien franchise just ran out of creative steam and is in dire need to be stoped and put to rest until people with actual creative ideas can make good movies that tell entertaining, engaging and logical stories. Ultimately, Alien Covenant is another step in a direction no fan of the series wants to go, a story that no one is interested in and a movie that basically fails at everything that made the original movie so compelling in the first place. 1/10 from me.",Alien - Covenant
225,scb_coldsteel,Let down after Prometheus!,7,2 October 2018,"I finally finished Alien Covenant. Overall I'm a bit disappointed in it. All of the suspense and thrills of the original are gone.

It wasn't a bad film, it just wasn't the film I wanted. 7 out of 10.",Alien - Covenant
226,ctowyi,A back-to-basics balls-to-the-wall Alien entry,7,10 May 2017,"This will be the sixth time we get to see a xenomorph explode from a human chest after using the human host as baby gruel (eighth if you include the Alien vs Predator abominations). In the world of narratives, the shock value depreciates like the value of cars, but there is still a tingling thrill if the story is well-told. After the ponderous top-heavy Prometheus (2012), it is nice to see Ridley Scott serving up a back-to-basics Alien entry that has many fan-nods to his 1979 sci-fi-action-horror classic Alien.Some years after the events of Prometheus, the ship Covenant, loaded with the hibernating bodies of settlers, is en route to colonise another planet. A tragedy forces the crew – Daniels (Katherine Waterson), Oram (Billy Crudup), Tennessee (Danny McBride), Lope (Demian Bichir), Karine (Carmen Ejogo), the android Walter (Michael Fassbender) and others – to make an emergency landing on an uncharted planet, where they uncover a threat beyond their imagination, they must attempt a harrowing escape.Tell me the plot doesn't resemble Alien. These days movie franchises like to reboot itself by making a ""new"" film, case in point being Star Wars: The Force Awakens. This is not necessarily a bad move because it gets to keep the old fans and new ones to the franchise happy. Frankly, after being weighed down by all the lofty God and Creator ideas in Prometheus, we are due for some let's-kill-em-all balls-to-the-wall action.Alien: Covenant is definitely a piece of effective sci-fi-horror gut-bucket filmmaking and IMHO Ridley Scott hits the mark (not the bullseye though). Sure, the characters are hackneyed and are largely cannon fodder for the aliens. Sure, the world may be different but the actions of the crew are the same. But at least none of them does dumb things like yakking cringe-y lines to a baby alien like it is a puppy and getting crushed by a giant rolling croissant (here's looking at you, Charlize Theron). That said, the crew of Covenant, especially the captain, are still gullible, but I can forgive that for the matter of storytelling.The action set-pieces are well-staged and have the right amount of freshness and yet could harken me back the classic, like the flushing out of the alien onboard the ship and the closing of the hatches after them. That gave me goosebumps of the good kind. Daniels (Katherine Waterson) is no Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), but still she channels a compelling yet softer edge. But the movie is really a Michael Fassbender show whose performance is sinewy and spine-chilling. He plays dual roles here with the right amount of distinguishing traits – rigid upper body, posture, speech patterns, menace-laced dialogue – with finesse and aplomb.Ridley Scott has come out tops through an ocean of guts and gore, and he has reminded me how much I love the first two Alien entries. I like Covenant, but don't love it, and this one easily slips into third place. Scott has successfully answered the questions proffered in Prometheus and got my senses up to ultra-wary levels for the next one.",Alien - Covenant
227,SPZMaxinema,Where do I begin?? A few good elements but not a good film.,6,6 November 2021,"The good: The film is genuinely good to look at and has great special effects and some callbacks/references to the original film. Plus Michael Fassbender is a very good actor and I liked what they did with him in this movie. Plus there were just a couple of well-done scary sequences, specifically with the newer neomorphs that we have not seen yet. That's what I could deal with, but unfortunately everything else I could not.The bad: The film is so convoluted and rushed at many parts. You can't really care about most of the human characters because they aren't established well enough in the beginning, and more than one of them (pretty much all of them actually) make really horrible decisions so it's hard to feel bad for them when stuff does happen. I'm not normally one to complain about bad CGI because it is hard to do but the xenomorphs looked disappointingly fake. Ridley Scott forgot that horror that is slow-burning and builds gradually to an unstoppable climax is the best kind of horror, not horror that hits you from all angles at once, which is what much of the horror in this film was and it became underwhelming eventually. It was as if he forgot what made the original Alien great with all of its classic and genius aspects! Plus during the film they come to a place that is just put in the movie out of nowhere and it feels real inauthentic and too out of left field. Plus, there's a twist toward the very end that I saw coming miles away. I'm sad that I wasted my money on watching this tbh, and even Prometheus was a better film overall (even though it was only fair imo) since it felt grander with more mystery to it. However, this movie still explains more things than that did. Bottom line, compared to the original two (Alien and Aliens), it certainly let me down and left me chuckling in disappointment.",Alien - Covenant
228,Morten_5,Old and new,8,25 May 2017,"Although responsible for some disappointments of late, director Scott has shown that he knows how to skillfully handle space as a setting.When returning with his third Alien installment, Scott does so by nicely blending ""Alien"" (1979) with ""Prometheus"" (2012), utilising some of the slow-building scares and atmosphere from the first one and adding the mythology and the references to classic art from the second. With love and respect for the franchise, Scott and his team use their creativity to make the film bring something new to the universe while still being a fitting piece to the puzzle. Although still far from the magic and mastery of the 1979 original, this sixth Alien film is a most well-crafted production, much thanks to the great work of production designer Chris Seagers, composer Jed Kurzel, cinematographer Dariusz Wolski, screenwriters John Logan and Dante Harper, helmer Scott -- and, of course, actors Katherine Waterston and impressive Michael Fassbender.",Alien - Covenant

We know the aliens, there's little to be done and change about the monsters, the new are the humans (or humanoids) and in this movie, they're a bunch of whimpers, none with any balls or brains at any point. It's horrible, from the beginning I hated most of the characters and at any point anyone did anything that makes sense. I don't want to give up much on what happens in the movie not to spoil it for anyone, but it was annoying how bad is this movie written. It's not about the actors, about the CGI, about the budget...

But don't expect much from it. The plot is probably the worst of the series so far, and that's saying a lot because the creators of this entire franchise have only managed to make 1 (ONE) good film, and that was the first. For some reason, the Directors/Producers have been Hell Bent on destroying these films with terrible plotting and cheesy dialog. And in this last installment they found the worst cast (Beginning with Michael Fassbender) that they could find.

232,tigerfish50,Gore and Boredom in Space,1,3 June 2017,"By now, most movie fans will be familiar with the obligatory arc of an 'Alien' screenplay - a group of bungling space travelers encounter a vicious bloodthirsty alien who will dispatch most of them to gruesome deaths. In the old days, a resourceful female would battle the beast, but now the heroines are reduced to sniveling and screaming at it. 'Covenant' might be an improvement after the debacle of 'Prometheus', but it demonstrates yet again the creative bankruptcy of the 'Alien' series.The new film won't disappoint those with basement-level expectations. Its characters are slightly less irritating and better developed than the collection of nincompoops floundering around in the underground labyrinth of 'Prometheus - but the latest batch of victims make equally foolish choices whenever they're presented with a decision. Besides repeating plot ideas, the franchise now shamelessly recycles scenes and characters. Among many other old tropes, ""Covenant' revisits the treacherous android routine, and summons up another violent storm to isolate the unfortunate astronauts. The crew's grisly deaths come thick and fast, leaving little time to create the tension which made the original film so exceptional. Director Scott has lost any feel for this element as he hurries from one messy demise to the next, creating a conveyor belt of violence, panic and bloody entrails. The tale's major twist, which is also its feeble attempt at a deep philosophical idea, is just a pompous interlude before the mayhem resumes.

235,Irie212,"Look on your works, Mighty Ridley, and despair",5,20 May 2017,"It's diverting enough as entertainment, if you show up with really low expectations, but in a genre as rich as science fiction, where stories and situations brim with big ideas and cosmic questions, I would never waste time on a second viewing of this vacuous entry.I won't catalog the many plot holes. Other reviewers have thoroughly autopsied the story. But I would like to underline just one point that most reviewers rightly reviled: the ineptitude of the crew is epic. The only less competent spaceship crew that I can recall seeing, ever, were the Omarans from the Star Trek TNG episode, Symbiosis. But they had an excuse: they were in chemical withdrawal, in need of their felicium fix. No wonder they didn't know what an electromagnetic coil was.In contrast, the crew of the Covenant are ill-trained and, it would seem, ill chosen people for the mission. Idiot was a word that leapt to mind a dozen times or more, but it finally got stuck and stayed stuck to Sir Ridley Scott. He does many things wrong in this movie, including having so many alien outbursts from human torsos that there was laughter in the theater. One of the reasons I could laugh was that so few of the crew members had any individual character that I had nothing invested in what happened to them. Billy Crudup stood out as the beta-male captain who was on the verge of tears most of the time. Katherine Waterston held her own as his Ripley-like (and - lite) female 2nd in command. But the rest of the crew, except for the android (Fassbender), seemed interchangeable. At one point, one of the men says, ""I've never seen my wife scared before.""

So, one would think Covenant would be a familiar and exciting ride into outer space. Familiar it is, outstanding it's not. Following the ""it thing"" in movies and TV, Michael Fassbender does a nice job as both Walter (the good) and David (the bad) robots who work along side a rather inept crew (Katherine Waterston ""Inherent Vice,"". Billy Crudup ""Jackie,"" Danny McBride ""TV's Vice Principals,"" Demian Bichir ""Weeds,"" and Carmen Ejogo "" Selma"" to name a few) charged with colonizing another plant with embryos. While exploring an unexplored land on the way to their mission, the Alien's birth and the excitement finally starts rolling. Lucky for that, because the first several minutes of Walter's dialogue with his father (Guy Pearce) is time consuming and unnecessary for the storyline, as is the cameo appearance of James Franco (Branson), the husband of one of the crew members. The good thing about this film is that, even if you ""been there, done that,"" the film's outer limits cinematography and those pesky Aliens at least sustain one's interested.

I was intrigued to see what we would find out about the world and the engineers in this next installment. However, Scott decided to take us on a predictable, yet stupid departure from Prometheus. Here is a quick summary of the lame crap they pulled with this one:-Just leave the intriguing and scary prospect of really finding out more about our origins, and go back to a slasher action flick.-Just hope the alien name in the title and the trailers would draw in lots of viewers, along with those like me who were mystified and intrigued by Prometheus, then fail to deliver anything new or exciting.-Throw in a bunch of over-hyped A-listers and others from Hollywood, just to leave most of them disjointed or unexplored. -Continue dragging out what could have been a great chapter in explaining the history and origins of mankind, by interrupting the epic start of Prometheus with this silly nonsense, purely to maximize sequels/prequels and make more money off of new or unsuspecting movie goers.-Have the main plot and scenes of the film all be revealed in the trailer, with little to add to it in the actual full length film.This is just exploitation and redundancy with lame characters and plot development; it is as if they have nothing else to say, after asking profound questions about the engineers and humanity in Prometheus, and just decided to throw some footage together and hope Fassbender's David and some weird alien action would redeem it all and hope that the audience forgets what the hell they even came for. This film was a huge letdown, in the vein of the 200 transformers, Fast and Furious, or Star Wars reboots that these fools keep pimping out to steal every last dime from the public that they possibly can, whether it involves a legit. story or real mystery or answers or not.",Alien - Covenant
240,Semisonic,A truly mixed bag,5,3 August 2017,"In certain circles, there's a term called ""coproeconomics"", which basically implies making inherently flawed products with planned ageing, so that you'd be able to sell the same thing, only slightly modified, again and again and again. The progress between iterations might be ever so slight, and the emphasis on quality might eliminate most of those iterations as unnecessary, yet the manufacturer needs its profits, and we need to buy something to feel up-to-date and privileged.Alien: Covenant, if I'm not mistaken, is the 6th installment of the Alien franchise (if we take Prometheus, which I haven't seen, into account). Still a long way to go to catch up with the Fast'n'Furious production line, yet quite a handful in itself. How come Ridley Scott still has ideas to build new Alien films upon, and the audience keeps going to the theaters to check them out? The answer that seems correct to me is: to make something new, take something you already had, cripple it in some way and then add a speck of something refreshing to make up for it.Covenant follows this recipe brilliantly when it comes to crippling. It's the umpteenth time we see humans land on a potentially dangerous planet - yet they keep making the same mistakes they oughta tell about at ""Space Colonization 101"". Still reckless, short-sighted, unable to control their emotions and follow the basic protocols. The equipment follows suit: withstanding extreme overloads, it (in)conveniently breaks exactly when someone's life depends on it. Looks like even in the XXII century the space programs follow the same principles of coproeconomics.What saves Covenant from being a total failure is that speck of originality that this time took form of Michael Fassbender. It's no big secret that in Covenant his character builds upon his role in Prometheus. But it's _how_ he does it that makes all the difference. The Alien movies always got their scares from the confrontation of humans and those deadly creatures. But this time there's something entirely different that makes this film scary, something borderline diabolical, and it's Fassbender's delivery that gave me most of the creeps this time. Without him, this film would've been completely pointless.But even Michael's stellar job doesn't remedy the overall predictability of this film. Maybe if he was the only person on board of Covenant, this film might've become another Moon. But the surgical precision of Fassbender's synthetic character is muddied by the mere mortals making their typical mistakes and playing their typical games. Mere mortals including the director: the revelation near the ending could be seen from a mile away, and only made the sloppiness employed to make it happen more apparent. So unfortunate. But fear not: there's the sequel coming, which will surely fix all its predecessor's flaws. Only to add a load of its own ones. So don't forget to reserve a place in lines in front of the movie theaters: the wheel of coproeconomical samsara ain't gonna spin itself.",Alien - Covenant
241,Come-and-Review,There's more than what emerges on the surface,9,16 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant suffers from the ambiguous legacy left behind by Prometheus. Whereas the internet opinion discarded Prometheus and its lack of xenomorphs, Covenant minimised the bonds with its previous chapter in favor of more connections with the original Alien film from 1979. This lead to further shared and undeserved criticism: while Prometheus was too far from Alien, Covenant apparently is too close to it, and lacks of explanations as for some crucial questions raised in Prometheus.My personal view is in favor of both this movie and Prometheus. Covenant brought new cards to the table, despite what the common belief is.Let's talk about the connections with Prometheus first. There is not much explanation given about the big question from Prometheus, which was the reason that led the Engineers to decide to destroy mankind. At least not openly. I realised after some thoughts that many of those questions people want an answer to were indirectly answered through some small hints. As for quality, I personally think both Covenant and Prometheus are pretty much on the same level, with maybe Covenant being slightly more appreciated by me personally. David, the android from Prometheus, as we already knew, is back. His character has been further developed (partly at the expense of the new Fassbender character, Walter) and deepened. A theme that was developed in Covenant is that of creation and creationism. The film finally explores an interesting concept not very developed in previous alien films: just like the Engineers would be the creators of humans, humans created androids. This concpet will be further developed through the origins of the Xenomorphs.The origins of Xenomoprhs are finally unveiled, and the truth is much different from what one might have thought. While Xenomorphs appear for about 20 minutes of the film, there is much insight given to their genesis, something that I didn't expect. There are numerous subtle connections with Alien and even with Aliens, starting from the aliens text at the beginning, which in this film is identical to the 1979 film (underlining how Covenant is closer to Alien than to Prometheus). What I further enjoyed in the film was the very classical sci-fi tone of the first half hour. Many scenes in that portion of the movie had a strong 2001 vibe to them, with the effects and photography of a modern film. The movie then moved to a more modern approach, all the way to the ending. The horror side of Covenant wasn't as frightening as the original film. In defense for the film, when they reach the 6th film featuring a Xenomorph, it is quite hard to bring some. fresh frightening concepts, hence I personally won't complain about that. This is so far also the most bloody film in the franchise, and that is certain. The crew of the USCSS Covenant was far more enjoyable than that of the Prometheus, especially in the characters of Daniels, Walter and Tennessee. They're not Ripley, but they were enough unarrogant so to allow me to root for them (unlike most of the Prometheus crew members, except for the three pilots, Shaw and David). The outcome of the film is, obviously open, so to leave space for a third film, which can bring some final answers to some questions raised. Despite that, I think the two hours I spent watching Alien: Civenant were definitely well payed back.",Alien - Covenant

I watched Aliens and thought that was great, it took the story to a new level, brilliant sequel. Then came Alien 3 and you knew there's nothing new, its just a brand now, put it out with this name people will buy it. Watched Covenant hoping they'd resurrected the corpse, they buried it even deeper. If you've seen the first two Alien films you'll hate this, if you can actually start from this and be interested you'll be OK.

I LOLed at some comments who think Prometheus was for dumb people and that the movie was dumb and they didn't get it. Well, doesn't that mean, the reviewers are dumb because they didn't get it??!! Prometheus was one of the smartest movies ever. Forget the Alien, the movie was simply amazing2. Some haters say how it's not the same Alien stuff. BOOHOO. Just get over it. You cant' have the same boring horror as before then the same whiners would have said how it was all predictable.I really loved the Covenant and hopefully we will have 1 more in the same style. The movie goes further to explain the origins of the Alien and that was very welcomed. The cast was nice. Not everyone was amazing,but most actors were very good.The story is about 7 or 8 out of 10. I could've been better,but even as is, it is still very goodOverall, I enjoyed this action movie. I don't claim to be a Wannabe-Alien-Series-Guru-knowitall as some claim to be in their 1-star reviews(HAHAHAHAHAHA). I think some people are not old enough to watch such movies that require some thinking to fill out certain missing parts. That's the whole beauty of it. Some people get it and some who claim to be smart... whine who they didn't understand anything. Well...maybe yo all not as smart as you think!Again, the action and the story were all great.

244,NerdBat,"I will admit, I was a bit disappointed.",5,30 May 2017,"There are a number of reasons why this film didn't really sit well with me. First of all, there isn't nearly enough information to really give you an idea of what is going on in the beginning of the film. It's as if you've already missed the first 25% of the film when you begin watching the movie. The creature itself, when first introduced, looks...a bit silly. It is born of a fungus, instead of a parasitic face hugger. The original design for the creature is not introduced at all until near the end of the film, and only for a short time. I feel like the entire film focused more on the androids (artificial humans) more than it did the battle between humans and the alien creature. The plot was a great idea at first, but it slowly became more obvious where the movie was headed, and I really wish they would have kept the alien legacy alive instead of trying to make this new, unattractive ridiculous version. Wasn't so pleased in the end.",Alien - Covenant
245,repojack,"Ridley Scott is a master of the ""fast-paced sci-fi action horror thriller.""",9,8 November 2020,"I would hate to be in the shoes of a filmmaker that needs to please a rabid fan base. The ""Star Wars"" sequels are a perfect example of this. Ridley Scott has the same challenge with the ""Alien"" prequels which you see in user scores.I loved ""Prometheus"" with its attempt at something bigger than just more face huggers and xenomorphs wreaking havoc. It was clear he was building a grander story to the eventual bridge to the original ""Alien.""He continues that bigger story with ""Alien: Covenant"" and whether he meant to provide fan service or not, we get that with face huggers and xenomorphs. (No spoiler as both are in the trailers.)Do yourself a favor and watch the short clip ""Last Supper"" before you watch the movie. At only five minutes, it gives a better introduction of the Covenant crew than the movie does providing deeper emotional investment in these characters.Ultimately ""Alien Covenant"" delivers an excellent, fast-paced sci-fi action horror thriller (yes, it hits that many genres) like only Ridley Scott can that continues exploring the ""Prometheus"" theme of creation.",Alien - Covenant
246,spencergrande6,Kind of almost makes you wish this were Prometheus huh,7,29 July 2017,"Kind of almost makes you wish this were Prometheus huh? I'm of two minds on this one, much like Ridley Scott seems to have been. He wanted to continue the origin story he started with Prometheus, continue to explore what the search for answers entails and the mysteries it has over us. But he also knew that this time around, he had to deliver the Alien goodness or audiences would get all pissy again and wouldn't understand the point of it all and blah blah blah (it wasn't called Alien: Prometheus for a reason).So here we have a typical Alien type movie setup with a big spaceship and slumberers awakening from their cryo comas too early and then exploring some desolate planet where of course the crap hits all kinds of fan. Things gestate, parts burst, there's blood and violence. But the thing is, Scott's heart doesn't seem to be in these scenes. They almost feel as if they've been directed by someone else (perhaps Luke Scott, his son, the 2nd unit director)? They're almost mindless in their CGI flash-cut matter of factness (is there anything worse than CGI Xenomorph?). Nothing surprising or engaging or even remotely resembling the kind of terror on display in the original Alien - just flashiness and shininess and fastness.But then there's this other movie all mixed up in it that's a more direct sequel in line with what Scott was doing in Prometheus. It involves David holed up on this world creating life, studying life, becoming a God. There's strange architecture from the Engineers (indelible), philosophizing and eroticism and genuine intrigue and mystery. It's about the creation of horror by a rejected and alienated creation trying to discover its place in the universe (turtles all the way down) and it's far more interesting than the generic space creature movie that keeps popping up.It was a valiant attempt to blend the two but it doesn't work because you get the feeling this wasn't meant to be an Alien movie in the first place (we already have that/those) and Scott didn't really want to do that. But Scott is nothing if not smart about his business decisions - Fox funded it and audiences were interested again at first, more so than they would have been if it were Prometheus 2 - and he got to at least make part of a movie he was interested in. Let's hope for a third, one that audiences can engage with on its own terms.",Alien - Covenant

250,Tehmeh,"A lot worse than I hoped, only a little better than I feared.",6,17 May 2017,"I'm going to nitpick a lot, since ""Alien"" is probably my favorite movie of all time. Bear with me.""Prometheus"" was tough for me. I still liked it despite its numerous flaws, because of its premise, resonating themes and technical prowess. After seeing the trailer for ""Alien Covenant"", I expected to fully hate this film. In a way, it's a fitting sequel for Prometheus - both are very flawed. What I found lacking in Prometheus, I partially got from this one, but what I didn't want Prometheus to be in the first place, this was. What I didn't want Prometheus to be was a straight-up Alien movie where people I don't care about run away from (or fight) a celebrity monster. Sadly, that's the main attraction for this movie, and the least interesting thing about it. Aliens have become video game creatures. I couldn't care less about the old melon-head, not to mention its brutally slaughtered victims. Its amazing life cycle is also held hostage by plot convenience: things happen rapidly because you just have to cram it all in there, and most things just breeze by. All of it just feels like toothless, gratuitous fan-service. This is what many people wanted Prometheus to be, and now they got it. Doesn't feel like a good idea now, does it? Remember the monster in ""Alien""? They didn't show it much. It was clumsy, mysterious and horrifying...but the sequels turned these disturbing creatures into meaningless drones that run around fast, shriek all they can and swarm you. ""Aliens"" was still a good action movie, but the monster itself was demystified and it became something that would eventually leave me disengaged and bothered, which happened with this movie.Covenant has another problem: shallow characters. They were shallow in all of them, but in the first movie they felt real, and in the second they were at least entertaining caricatures. But now? I just saw this film and I can't even remember most of their names. There were too many of them, and when someone died (which was gory and good in itself), I didn't care. The dialogue was mostly just movie talk without real depth (except for Fassbender's David and Walter, more about those two in a second). Most of the character development is forced and rarely leads to anything. The actors themselves were good; McBride and Waterston have screen presence, and Carmen Ejogo had good moments, but I wanted to care. I can't get invested to people who are basically plot devices, destined to be idiots controlled by the script (which was allegedly re-written many times and it shows). I like Ridley Scott, I do, but characters have always been his weakness, especially this time. Then again I must also question the script, and not just for the dialogue. One obvious plot twist in particular left a bitter taste in my mouth, because I hate waiting for the protagonists to catch up to speed with what I already know. It hindered the remainder of the movie, because it was only there to ensure a link to other installments of the franchise. There was no satisfying resolution. The writing seemed to suffer from ""connect the dots"" syndrome.There are good things in this movie. Most of them revolve around Michael Fassbender. He plays his characters well, overcoming his material, making it more powerful than it would've been with a lesser actor. The mythology and themes, which I liked in Prometheus, are explored a little further here (although just a little) and Fassbender is at the core of it. I loved that stuff. It's not too vague, in fact it's very simple and effective. We get some ""mad scientist"" - elements too. The themes of the creator and the created, the grotesque body horror - they all work in favor of the film. I gave the writers crap, but I must give them some credit too, because thematically the movie kind of works and has some nice individual touches.The middle hour is good entertainment, and I'd recommend Covenant for that alone. It's still clumsy, but that's where the heart of the movie is. After 30 minutes of almost nothing (not counting the sequence at the very beginning), and before the final 30 minutes of weightless action and tired tropes we actually get a decent movie in between. That's where Covenant reaches high. It can't get there, but it's so confident in itself that you almost believe it.Technically, Alien: Covenant is quite good, which was expected. At times great cinematography and camera-work (at other times just bland). The art direction/designs are haunting and the creature effects are great when they're practical. When it's CGI (which is most of the time) it's still good, but it's weightless and without impact. The sets and props are great, and the sound department handled their job well too. Nice display of production and craft. In the end, ""Alien: Covenant"" is full of annoyances but also has some genuinely good touches. It's a stronger film when it's not trying to be a franchise movie, and it's a frustratingly hollow mess when it's trying to be one. Yes, the characters (except for Fassbender) are used like cheap toys and the monster is just a circus attraction that has become a parody of itself. If you forgive that, there is plenty to like somewhere in the middle of it all. It's technically impressive enough and it's got that certain foreboding atmosphere. If you enjoy pompous, larger-than-life themes or if you just enjoy mindless alien stuff, you'll get what you pay for either way - to an extent. You won't love it, I didn't either, but despite that nagging disconnect I felt throughout the film, it's still at least entertaining and sometimes rises above itself. That's why I liked this one more than I probably should. As a movie, it's a mess. As entertainment, it's alright.",Alien - Covenant
251,rutzelb,Excellent. It Delivers,9,17 August 2017,"In 2107, the ship Covenant is on its way to remote planet Origae-6 with 2,000 people on board in stasis and will arrive in 7+years and they will populate a new world there. A solar storm interrupts the flight and many are released from stasis. Then they hear a distress call and decide to investigate. Of course, you know this is a big mistake. AnywayThey land a shuttle on the planet and discover all is not as Earth- like as was seemed. They encounter Alien life forms that want to devour them. Oh, oh. On the planet they also find David (Michael Fassbender) a survivor from the ship the Prometheus. Now, know this: David is an Android. And you will come to know David as a bad Android. Walter (also Michael Fassbender) a good Android, is on the Covenant and monitors all in stasis. Yes, yes, there will be a battle between them later on.The acting all around is first rate. The CGI is simply unbelievably fantastic , and the sets are awesome. The pacing is good and keeps one alert and searching for other Aliens that may get into the shuttle. One flaw is that when one of the crew got infected by Alien spores he was allowed to go into the shuttle and, of course, he dies. There was no talk of quarantine. Another flaw is that the crew when they were observing the planet from the Covenant, none of the instruments picked out David, who is still there. (You know, Mr Spock wouldn't have let that happen) There are other flaws but to tell you would give too much away, but they don't take away from the entertainment factor here. After we go through Aliens attacking the crew on the ground, another shuttle comes to rescue them and we think all are safe, but guess what? An Alien has attached himself to the shuttle and wants in. Here we go again, but these scenes are truly an art form.. They are so real, you actually believe and cringe away hoping Daniels (Katherine Waterson) aka Danny, who is tethered to the shuttle can dislodge the Alien as Tennessee (Danny McBride) maneuvers the shuttle to shake the Alien off. Great scenes. You will be surprised to learn what David has been doing for the last 10-years. No, I did not forget about the battle between Walter and David. You have to see for yourself.The big twist comes later near the end when all is good and the Covenant is now again on its way to Origae-6 and the crew again go into the stasis pods as there are many more years to go. Danny, now the Captain, is the last to go in and she asks Walter if he will help her build that cabin on the lake when they get there. Then she realizes her mistake and the stasis pod takes over and she goes to sleep. We believe a sequel is in order. I enjoyed this Alien version of Alien movies even though the Aliens were very scary looking and yes, they had big teeth too (That's mandatory) (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No, nothing was seen of two crew members naked in the shower. Language: Yes.",Alien - Covenant
252,AnishMisra,Alien: Covenant Review,7,11 July 2017,"Alien: Covenant is a film directed by Ridley Scott. When the trailers of this film came out, I thought that this was going to be a very good film. I liked Prometheus too. And I love the first 2 films of the Alien franchise. But still I didn't get my hopes high as I knew that this film was never going to be as good as Alien. But I would say that I wasn't disappointed that much after seeing this film.Plot: USS Covenant decide to go to another planet after detecting some kind of transmission from there.Story and direction: The beginning of the film set the tone of the film in a very apt way. And then immediately after the scene we see the title of the film come in a very similar way that the 1979 original film gave us the title. I liked that. And then I see the design of the USS Covenant. Oh man, that was a beauty. The design was par excellence. And also hats off, to the production design team, VFX team and camera team. The planet gave a sense of loneliness and the horror that was about to come. The camera work was also excellent. we get very dark shades of the background which I think is correct. And finally the VFX. The animatronics and effects of the Neo and Xenomorphs were mesmerizing. You could actually feel the neo/xenomorphs are around you. When the xenomorphs would tear anyone up, I literally would have chills. The main fault with the film is the story itself. It is very inconsistent and predictable. I mean a song as a signal. Come on. Ridley Scott is better than that. And the reason to go to the planet just because it is near and people don't have to sleep for another 7 years. That is just ridiculous. The most lamest reason I have ever heard. I mean you are given a job; shouldn't anyone superior be consulted for that thing. And David coming into the picture and his story of Prometheus. I knew that was fake and David is the villain. And the ending twist. As such that wasn't a twist because you could actually see from far away what was the scene. And then there are as usual: THE UNEXPLAINED. Why David developed such hatred? Why did he kill the engineers? What actually happened to Elizabeth? From where the xenomorphs actually came? How many films do we have to have just to answer the questions? This film felt as if it was just ripping off the original Alien and tweaked a bit and presented to us. At least Prometheus felt new.Acting: I loved Micheal Fassbender as both Walter and David. He portrayed both the contrasting characters to the T. Katherine Waterson looked like a cry baby in the entire film. It would be a sin to compare her to Sigourney Weaver. Billy Crudup was good as Oram. Danny McBride was actually more likable than Waterson. He actually had some depth in his character. James Franco and Guy Pearce were also good in the cameo.Favorite Scene: Actually there are 2. The very first scene, the conversation between David and Weyland. That as I said set the tone for the film. And second being the scene between David and Walter. I mean the scene where he teaches the flute, was class. Micheal Fassbender in that scene actually proved what a great actor he is.Verict: This film is actually an OK film. Prometheus was better than this. I wasn't entirely disappointed with the film. But I wanted some answers which were not provided by the film. I get that you are trying to get some kind of curiosity but as it is rightly said ""Too much of everything is not good"". That saying is applicable with this film.I am going to go with 7.5/10.",Alien - Covenant

Titled ""Alien: Covenant,"" it is linked to both the early ""Alien"" films as well as ""Prometheus."" The plot involves the crew of the Covenant exploring an uncharted area while en route to a planet in a remote location of the galaxy--but of course things don't go as smoothly as planned. Despite the fact that the first half does not have very much in the way of action scenes, the film is paced very well and provides for a slow-burn narrative. The film's visual effects do not disappoint, and the acting is very good throughout--particularly from Michael Fassbender. While good, the film is not quite great for two main reasons. First, some of the main characters are incredibly dumb as they attempt to survive--particularly in the second half. At times, their lack of common sense makes it somewhat difficult to suspend your disbelief. While the action scenes are intense and visceral (with plenty of gore,) the film unfortunately is lacking in the genuine psychological fear of ""Alien"" and ""Aliens,"" which makes the action scenes just feel more bombastic for the sake of it. However, this is still a visually arresting, thoughtfully paced sci-fi horror.

Page down to SHAW's section as it relates to COVENANT.
******Ripley was celebrated in Aliens by movie fans for going toe-to-toe with company man Carter Burke, who wanted to sneak two Alien embryos past quarantine by smuggling them in Ripley's and another character's body while they were in hibernation. Burke was then going to kill the rest of the crew by sabotaging their hibernation units on the trip home. Ripley swore to him she was going to tell the company everything he tried to do, and make sure that they nailed him, ""right to the wall!""The reality is, Carter Burke is actually the hero of the story who would have prevented a genocide. He is the one who sent the family (Newt's) out to investigate, and they are the ones that found the spaceship. The spaceship that was filled with hundreds, if not thousands of eggs, and if this hadn't happened this way (as seen in the movie, with the unfortunate number of a few hundred people), the station/colony would have continued to grow in size, with hundreds or thousands more of the human colonists...And, eventually, one day, someone would have found that spaceship, and those eggs, and those hundreds (or thousands) of humans would all be killed by the Aliens. That would have been the genocide, but Carter's greedy actions prevented this eventuality. Carter is the hero. Ripley, our supposed hero, is shouting-down the actual hero, threatening to nail him, ""Right to the wall!"" for his illegal actions which hadn't even happened yet (so far, he is an innocent man).Once the company that was trying to terraform the planet found out about the Aliens and how they had killed a few hundred of their colonists, and that there's an Alien ship there with thousands more eggs, the company would have quarantined the whole planet and moved on.(Although, why the original explorers BEFORE the terraformers didn't find the spaceship is beyond me. It's apparently really close to base. But, I have to let it go...)- -As for, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, she is quite the hero of the story in movie ""Prometheus"". Sole survivor, except for an android, like Ripley. Tough, like Ripley. And, she tripped a genocide, just as Ripley had.In a case of profound misjudgment, she chose to actually believe that the homicidal android she needed to fly her off the planet, would get her safely to her next destination.She did this out of selfishness, ""I want to know where they came from.""She should have stayed, and died, on the planet.Not only was she stunningly unable to correct her errors but she probably wasn't even aware that the smiling David android we see in the next movie, ""Alien: Covenant"", flushed the gorgeous green planet below with death and doom causing genocide to its humanoids or, as the name we've come know them as, the Engineers. But it wasn't just the Engineers, David killed every single animal on the entire planet; untold ecological billions died (another genocide) and left landmines to kill any living thing that might visit the beautiful planet in the future (another genocide).And, he killed Shaw.For such a smart protagonist, the writers sure made her bafflingly stupid. At the end of the movie, David has commandeered another spaceship filled with thousands of hibernating colonists, A VERY SMART FEMALE CAPTAIN, a new identity, fresh Alien eggs, and he's still wildly homicidal. That's still Dr. Shaw's fault. She, literally, put his head back on his body, got into an Alien ship with him and took off, when she should have just stayed and died on that planet.Or, had better writers.THESE FEMALE HEROES WERE WRONGED BY THEIR WRITERS!Am I the only one who sees this?",Alien - Covenant

Like when I saw the scene where David cuts his hair to resemble Walter I pretty much figured out the end of the plot...... and I have a feeling that I was not alone in this very simple deduction. He was going to infect the crewmembers. Shocking! It wasn't believable to me that the captain of a ship would change a course of a ship that is on a seven-year journey just to investigate a planet. A journey like that would've taken ten to twenty years to plan. No captain worth his salt would endanger the lives of two thousand people to play Columbus. The most a captain would do is register the discovery in the ship's log and report it to Earth. It's just common sense! Had the authorities on Earth ordered them to investigate then I wouldn't have thought Billy Crudup's character, Oram, incompetent nor would I be happy with the way he died.The one thing that took my attention was Danny McBride's performance. I'm glad he is making an effort to break away from his usual comedic roles and take on more serious roles.

Forced out of their expected 7 year cryo-sleep to make repairs, the crew's focus switches from their destined planet to one that is much closer and supposedly more suited for humans. Only Katherine Waterston, who plays the second in command, is hesitant to alter the plans; but the acting captain (played by Billy Crudup) and the rest of the crew are insistent on checking out the newly discovered planet, and off they go.An exploratory team lands on the planet that turns out to be beautiful and teeming with plant life — but no animals or even insects can be seen or heard. Despite this oddity, some of the crew are already planning on starting their new colony hereuntil two crewmen suddenly become sick and the horrifying, true nature of the planet is revealed.Alien spore infestations/gestation/gory emergence, frenetic bursts of intense fights against aliens, impeccable cinematography, good and evil synthetic people (both played amazingly by Michael Fassbender), the mystery of what happened to the last two crew members of Prometheus, and claustrophobic bug hunts are all here. There are moments where you — the ""Alien"" movies aficionado — will tell yourself ""Oh, I've seen this before in previous 'Alien' movies,"" but it shouldn't be looked at negatively. It's simply director Ridley Scott giving fans what they want to see. What should be treated negatively are the two, huge shenanigans in ""Alien: Covenant"" that, had they not been there, would have earned this movie a grade A.Shenanigan #1: **SPOILER ALERT** Fassbender, as David, easily places his stolen spaceship above the city of ""Engineers"" and drops a crapload of bio-weapons on the Engineers below. So these Engineers, with their highly advanced tech capability, had no way of knowing who was piloting their ship, and just let one of their own spacecraft hover above their city without any sort of vetting on who was actually inside the ship? And where were the other space vessels of the Engineers throughout the city? This highly advanced race looked like they forgot to pay the bills and all the good stuff were repossessed. Shenanigan #2: Crudup, despite seeing the evil nature of Fassbender/David, lets himself fall into a trap that even a stoner whose brain is half-baked would've seen coming.The fact that I gave this movie a B despite those two giant shenanigans tells you that I really enjoyed watching this. Yes, I am a serious fan of ""Alien"" movies; but beyond that, ""Alien: Covenant"" is a good movie that combines old school elements with the new, and it definitely deserves to be part of the ""Alien"" lore.And now, for my most memorable, movie moment of ""Alien: Covenant"": the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Fassbender/David fights Fassbender/Walter. For a brief moment, this sci/fi flick becomes a kung-fu flick. It was surprising and entertaining.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Alien - Covenant
261,hoernkeem,"Alien: Covenant review (2017, Ridley Scott) Slightly better than Prometheus but not by much",4,11 February 2021,"Alien: Covenant (2017, Ridley Scott)
Oh Ridley Scott... what exactly do you want to do with your Alien universe? Because after the latest Alien installment (of which there are more planned) I have no idea. Going into the film I had genuinely no idea where or when in the time line this was supposed be set based on the trailers I had seen. As it happens this is a direct follow up to 2012's head scratching ""Prometheus"". The fact that the Alien moniker was not attached to that previous film should have been some indication that it was not going to be a typical entry into the space horror franchise, and as it happened that was a much more philosophical mediation on the origin of humans which also happened to contain a possible origin to the alien xenomorphs. With the alien title firmly reattached to this latest entry combined with some classic looking aliens in the promotional material as well as a very Ripley looking Katherine Waterston many felt that this was going to be a return to the successful nuts and bolts of science fiction combined with horror that was prevalent in earlier films. In actuality we get a melding of the two that winds up being a mixed bag. For any of those actually intrigued by the ideas and questions put forth in ""Prometheus"" Ridley Scott almost completely abandons that line of thought. The questions of human origins and engineers are quite nonchalantly pushed to the side as well as half the remaining characters from the previous film which is so incredibly frustrating used as a simple plot device (which has also been utilized in previous Alien films!!!). What is really impressive is the rather large cast here of some name players in peripheral roles such as James Franco, Demian Bichir and most notably playing against type Danny McBride. While the cast is impressive, however, they don't really do anything with them like flesh out any of their back stories. There is a youtube video that exists that explains the characters which might start to give you feeling for them but that isn't in the film which borders on nonsensical. Why would you have a youtube video as required viewing before going to see a feature film? So as it exists there is no emotional connection to any character and by the time they start attempting to make those connections it is beyond too late. This starts as a ship named Covenant speeds toward a new world on a journey that takes years in order to find a new planet for humans to colonize. All are in a cryo-sleep except a synthetic known as Walter once again being played by Michael Fassbender who was featured in ""Prometheus"" as David. As always this is a bit difficult to tread without being too spoilery but I really don't like giving too much away. As the ship is traveling they are hit by a debilitating cosmic storm which kills some and awakens the crew of the Covenant. Conveniently they discover a transmission coming from a nearby planet that appears to be perfectly habitable and the decision is made to check out the planet and the transmission. Perhaps the colonists have found home much earlier than anticipated... although we all know they are in for a much more harrowing experience. This decision is somewhat of a head scratcher but ultimately acceptable but the questionable and sometimes downright idiotic decision making continues throughout the entire movie much to this films detriment. There was at least one point I was looking at the screen wondering how in the world the character could be doing what they were doing. That being said aliens are stumbled across as well as other secrets and hilarity ensues... just kidding. There is a lot of screaming and bloodshed so for those wanting to return to some of those 'Alien' roots we definitely get that as well. Now while I said the filmmaker abandoned the philosophical pondering on engineers and human origins he did not abandon those sort of musings completely. Instead here we turn that meditation from engineers to the xenomorphs; the aliens themselves as we begin to delve into and flush out how it was they came to be the cuddly creatures we popularly think of them as for in ""Prometheus"" we see alienlike creatures but never the alien entities that we know from previous films. I personally didn't mind the alien origin aspect to this film but I think some will really dislike how they handle it. While I didn't mind it I certainly believe that leaving the alien origin shrouded in mystery is much more interesting and entertaining for the franchise as a whole. We are so caught up on having everything explained to us in this day and age when in reality many things are often better not explained. The end of this film also, as in ""Prometheus"" seems to point directly to where Ridley Scott wants to go next but then again he has tricked us with that before. Suffice it to say this film points to what should be where the series is going. All in all there is some decent alien action yet many unanswered questions linger from this film as well as the previous one and an excellent cast is weighed down be extremely questionable character decision making and inane plot holes.
Eric's Grade: C-",Alien - Covenant
262,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,7,13 May 2017,"With this being the 6th installment of the Alien series, can the series return to its original roots and be as great it once was? I can say 'yes' as Alien: Covenant proves to be not only a showcase of the series but a throwback to its glory days.What makes Covenant great? Firstly, it manages to refill the holes that it's last film left and manage to go into the violent and bloody tone that was missing in Prometheus, though character development isn't as strong as the first time around but it does try to go back to be better for fans.The performance range is in great condition, Fassbender plays a dual role as Walter and David while Katherine Waterson plays a similar role to Ripley but doesn't overthrow her completely. Visual effects are all great with state of the art CGI and built sets, though I couldn't see if the aliens were puppets anymore as CGI has pretty much replaced it so I was let down a little bit.But overall, Covenant is indeed entertaining for fans old and new to the franchise. Hopefully one more prequel can be done perfectly to set course with the original Alien.4/5 - Nick So many people were left disappointed with Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus."" People were left wanting more and felt it went absolutely nowhere, and they are absolutely right! Covenant does not 100% let down, but it doesn't 100% make you so impressed either.I guess i'll start off by saying that the movie wastes no time in getting started. It takes you through step by step what is happening and who's who. The biggest problem is we are all yelling at the TV screen shouting ""Come on! Move it along!"" You have actors like Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup and Danny Mcbride who are all decent in their roles, but the problem is that the character development is so bad that you just don't care about any of them. You are waiting for the creatures/Aliens to get at them. Ad Maybe that was Ridley Scott's idea, but again it focuses too much on the characters we don't care about then the creatures.The good news is the final 25 mins is worth it, and the ending is alright, but it doesn't leave you wanting more. All in all it's a decent film. It's way better than ""Prometheus"", but nothing will ever beat the original Alien and Aliens."" 3/5 - Jay",Alien - Covenant
263,cdjh-81125,"Not A True Prometheus Sequel, Not A True Alien Prequel",5,7 August 2017,"I was one of the people who truly enjoyed Prometheus, I found that film to be a good balance between an alien prequel and something that could stand on its own. While it wasn't a perfect film it did leaving interested to see what happened next so I was extremely excited for Alien Covenant and it's fair to say I was pretty let down.There was plenty to enjoy about this movie, Ridley Scott can truly do no wrong when it comes to the direction of a science fiction movie, he directed this movie superbly, he knew how to build tension perfectly, the extremely quick pacing of the action sequences worked and had a lot of gory violence that made the film seem more immersive. Covenant looked fantastic the special effects in the space sequences were all very convincing and the cinematography was excellent.Michael Fassbender and his performance as David and Walter was my favourite thing about this movie, it was completely easy to believe that the two characters he played were two separate entities. The character of David was also a good element in this movie, I loved his mysterious nature, the creep factor he brought to the role this time and some of his more mythological opinions. I also really liked Katherine Waterston in this movie her character got some solid development and I liked how much she resembled Ripley from the original movie.Like Prometheus the ending of this movie did leave me wanting more, I didn't set up a sequel in as a blatant a way as that film did but left on an intriguing note. I do want to see more of this franchise and hopefully the next instalment can be a more successful entry than this one.This was a deeply flawed movie and a lot of that has to do with the characters. I've already praised David, Walter and Daniels but the other new additions were fairly bland, they just felt like expendable plot devices who didn't add a whole lot to this movie. They got next to no development and it became fairly obvious which ones were going to live through this film and those who weren't, because of this there was no real impact to their deaths which only truly served to keep the plot moving.Another big issue I had with this movie was the aliens themselves, in the first film it took the entire run time just to kill one of the creatures but here despite there being a lot more of them there is no real danger to them because there killed off so easily again and again. The effects for them were also very weak, it just looked like cgi and was never really convinced by them.Like I said this film had no idea what it wanted to be, so much of the plot from Prometheus is just dropped and never explored, leaving so many of the big questions that film never answered remain unanswered and made this film even more unsatisfactory. It definitely feels more like an Alien movie than Prometheus but it never truly feels like one thanks to its sub par effects and very underdeveloped characters.Alien Covenant was by no means a terrible film it was just a highly mixed one that didn't really have any threat or stakes to it. Ridley Scott directed this film well, a few intense sequences, and good effects for the scenes set within space. But the titular aliens never felt like a genuine threat with very poor visuals to them and the characters themselves for the most part didn't to much for me. I do want to see what comes next but to get me excited I need the writers to either learn from their mistakes with this film or simply be replaced.5.8/10: C+ (Middling)",Alien - Covenant
264,azanti0029,I can only echo the sentiments of others,1,3 August 2017,"Great visuals do not for a great film make - Never is this truer than in this film.I could do a detailed break down of everything that is wrong with this god awful film, but everyone has already said everything that needs saying.What a shame that this will probably mean the death of Neil Bloomkamps Alien project, which I am sure would have we'd all over this nonsensical mess. This is just simply no excuse for such a god awful piece of film making as this total turd. I normally try and be as constructive as possible, but when you have this much money and control over your product, this is simply no excuse. I certainly hope this is not Scott's last film. Just truly awful.",Alien - Covenant
265,Freedom060286,Too predictable,4,21 October 2017,"I liked the visual effects, and the cast performed very well. However, the story was poor. It would be better if the Alien movies would take a new direction and come up with some fresh ideas. It's becoming rather dull to see the same scenes with new people over and over again: aliens on the faces, coming out of their bodies. It was too predictable that an alien would be carried back to the ship in the body of someone who had one on his face. The larger alien attacking the ship was very similar to scenes in previous movies. The idea of the android turning against the crew was too similar to the events in the very first movie. The ending was ambiguous and unsatisfying.The big budget, with all the talented actors and special effects people, was wasted on a weak story.",Alien - Covenant
266,danielharden,It's Xenomophin Time,7,19 May 2017,"The Alien film franchise has had its fair share of ups and downs ever since the Xenomorph burst, pun intended, onto the big screen in Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece. Now after 1 average prequel, 1 good sequel, 2 bad sequels and 2 crossovers that sadly happened, the Xenomorph is back in the prequel sequel that is Alien: Covenant. Ridley Scott directs his 3rd film in the Alien world and 2nd ""Alien"" titled film, which aims to link his two previous instalments to the franchise, Prometheus and Alien, in what is a fun genre thrill ride, but alas never reaches its true potential.Ridley Scott is one of the greatest sci fi directors of all time, bringing us such classics as Alien, Blade Runner and recently, The Martian. Similar to Prometheus, regardless of what people actually think of the film, we can all agree that it looks beautiful. Scott yet again proves that his visual sense for sci fi is simply unmatched, the cinematography and sheer amount of in camera visuals are mind blowing, deeply disturbing and brooding as hell. Covenant's sci fi horror genre thrills are extremely effective, thanks to Scott's impeccable eye for the genre's in question, as well as his longstanding relationship with the Alien franchise. He was the man who introduced us to H.R Giger's iconic monster.The genre thrills in Alien: Covenant are most effective, in my opinion, because you care for the characters within the Covenant team. With all horror films you know many characters are simply disposable. In Covenant however this isn't entirely the case. There are obviously some characters that you know are dead the second they walk on screen, but a lot of relationships are established and thus emotional involvement is encouraged with our hopeless protagonists. I found myself drawn to the character Daniels, not necessarily because of Katherine Waterston's performance as she wasn't that great, but because of the personal story she is given throughout the film.Speaking of performances, the acting was top notch in this film and actually surprising. Katherine Waterston is decent in this film and I believe I owe her a little more credit than I've given in my last statement. Also, to my surprise Danny McBride didn't play the terribly annoying comic relief you would expect in horror films, he was actually one of the best actors in this film with what is easily the performance of his career. Best of all is Michael Fassbender's characters, who are both extremely compelling and to which the scenes they share are simply an masterclass in sophisticated acting.It is a shame however that one of the films biggest flaws lies with the treatment of Fassbender's character towards the films close. The films twist is hinted at quite subtly at first but in the films climax the clues given are far too obvious that you can see the twist immediately. There are several shots Scott should have cut from the film in order to maintain the mystery, rather than clumsily giving it away before the third act has even started. This loss of subtly subsequently takes all impact away from what could have been a fantastic ending and leaves all who watch it rather disappointed, regardless of what they thought of the film as a whole.There lies Covenant's greatest let down, it offers interesting concepts but fails to follow through on that idea to its full potential. The Neomorph is one of the biggest missed opportunities with this film. Far from the monstrosity that was the newborn in Alien: Resurrection, the Neomorph has a very gruesome introduction that is morbidly satisfying, even if Faris (the mechanic/medic) was extremely annoying. As well as this, the Neomorph's development to something almost humanlike is absolutely fascinating, but unfortunately this is only the free trial, if we want to see more we'll have to wait for Alien Prequel 3/ Prometheus 3, and hope there is more to the Neomorph than what we have already seen. Please Ridley don't let us down.. Again.Alien: Covenant as a whole offers some very interesting ideas which it unfortunately doesn't utilise to its full potential. The film also leaves us with a lorry load of questions which leave you wanting more, but at the same time underwhelming unsatisfied. However with a surprisingly strong cast and a legendary director, Alien: Covenant is an enjoyable genre film that acts as the 'The Empire Strikes Back' of the Prometheus trilogy (although obviously not a patch on 'The Empire Strikes Back'). I'm intrigued as to the possible 6 films Ridley Scott has planned for the franchise, ""Are you not entertained?""",Alien - Covenant
267,dcobbimdb,I was hoping for more...,3,28 May 2017,"I had mixed thoughts about Prometheus overall. Certainly had to watch it more than once and then a few things made more sense, but overall the movie was all about setting up something more to come. This was the more to come and sadly it didn't deliver.I won't give anything away other than saying this movie was 75% a reboot of the original Alien, with 25% of Aliens 2 mixed in and that's about it. The characters were remarkably unmemorable, which again is status quo for this type of movie. So really I didn't care or give a second thought to any of the characters, and Michael's robotic performance of David or Walter wasn't anything memorable either.I dragged my friend to this movie as I'm a sucker for Alien's franchise, He fell asleep a few different times during the movie and I really don't blame him. It was slow and off beat. It wasn't suspenseful at all which really was the surprise as I know Scott knows what he's doing and knows how to do this, yet this movie had little to no suspense, therefore wasn't scary, and had little substance to it. So it really took away from that whole shock & awe that I loved so much from the original Alien as well as Prometheus which I thought also captured that aspect a bit.Special effects wise most everything was great except for the monster. Why is it they can CGI nearly everything great, but when it comes to the most important thing it looks hideously fake?!? Hey directors, here's a priceless tip. When someone's watching something and after they say ""wow, I didn't know that was GCI"" that's an example of when GCI is great. However when you look at the monster for the first time and instantly say ""That's GCI..."" That's an instant fail and bounces everything (well at least me) out of the movie. I understand directors are too close to the material to see the obvious errors, it's almost sad they can't have an impartial fan there for the ride to point out the ""Hey guys, I know you think this is great and all, but it looks like complete sh!t, and that's exactly what the audience is going to think...""

Granted I didn't like Prometheus but I had watched it again before seeing Covenant, read and watched the Prometheus explained articles and videos and sought out that little prologue that they released. I only say this to indicate that I went into the film not with high expectations but with an open mind and an understanding of the film before it.SPOILERSI will be discussing the film so there will be spoilers If Prometheus was confusing and the characters frustrating, here it was a slightly simpler story but the characters flat out stupid. But stupid because the writers just couldn't be arsed to apply a little bit of logic. They like to reference other films in this but it's like none of the colonists have ever seen a scary film, read up on the dangers of contamination or considered first encounter protocols.They're on a mission and receive a strange broadcast from an inhabitable world that has no inhabitants on it. They land on this brand new, unknown planet and wander around as if they are in the Brecon Beacons. No gloves, no masks, kicking over brand new flowers, throwing cigarettes in the bushes, keeping the doors open on the lander etc. I'm not a tree hugger or anything but the apathy in their 'discovery' of this new planet smacks of blatant disregard. And because of this relentless stupidity, you just don't care about any of the characters. In one scene two separate characters slip over on the floor to make them easy bait for the Alien.The infections, mutations and eventual expulsions from their host bodies seem to happen in minutes (because waiting would be frightfully boring) and rather than generate tension or fear just seem to be a little too exploitative and some kind of torture porn. No one is thinking of contamination, no one is that bothered about the lives of the sleeping colonists of whom they have responsibility. No one seems to hear gunfire, no one picks up on individuals acting angry then them showing you their experiments and then saying 'take a look inside this egg that has just opened'.I remember watching Life and people comparing it to Alien. At least in Life, the astronauts are conscious of the danger of the alien organism getting down to Earth. In Covenant it doesn't even seem to cross people's minds. And the final 'twist' is so patently obvious it's genuinely laughable.Overall the film was a collection of loud, noisy scenes that the makers wanted to film but not properly set up.

There are Engineers who . . . engineer . . . stuff. People go off to colonize what they hope are viable planets. It's space, so you can have faith that something will go wrong, and soon.It's maybe five minutes into the movie when we get our something wrong, and like the dumb astronauts they are, every human seems to take joy in making idiotic decisions which contradict protocol in order to reasonably risk everyone's lives. Don't shoot the food, and don't shoot the explosives when you're standing next to them.Is it a philosophical commentary on the imperfection of humans? Apparently, the perfect life-form is a virtually unstoppable killing machine. Even the most creative synthetics can agree on that, that is, when they're not practicing concertos on handmade woodwinds, or tenderly kissing each other.We get no real answers, probably because there are none to be gotten, and we'll have to be dragged along through 20 or so more films before it all comes together. Will anything unexpectedly good ever happen on a space mission? Will movies ever have a more foreseeable plot twist? At this point, everyone in the audience should be expecting nothing less.We already knew from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan that it's always been easier to destroy than to create.

Prometheus promised that and ended up delivering a puzzling yet interesting prequel to the franchise that most found outright outrageous or just plainly disappointing. As much as such criticism, to some extent, might be understandable it is ultimately unfair: Prometheus was dazzling-looking origin story that raised more questions than answers, which left us (me at least) anxiously waiting for expansion/ explanations. What is more baffling is that Covenant lazily and inexplicably takes the very same premise and motivations - and character stereotypes, added a little Passengers (2016) plot points with Alien and Aliens stylistic choices and delivered a shameless formulaic, predictable, overdone and lazy sequel that could very well not be part of the cannon. Somehow, Scott's usual mastery made me not care one bit about that. I was entertained, interested and marveled at its sheer autopilot storyline. If that was Scott's plan all along, bravo.

That realm is still fun for any fan of the franchise, though, and that's why the film still scores a ""9"" here. But when you release a prologue online prior to the film, why isn't that included in the film? Not everyone watches online content, so put it in the movie. Same for the scenes with Dr. Shaw that were released online but not including in the theatrical version of the film. Why bother? As these characters inherently get picked off one by one by the alien(s), we just don't care about them at all.

276,joshbarton15,Think this will be the new Marmite of the Alien franchise,8,13 May 2017,"Remember before Prometheus was released back in 2012, when Ridley Scott was adamant that his then latest film was not going to have anything to do with the Alien film franchise? It was one of the most baffling denials to all as it was clear as day that it would tie in, we just didn't know how. It turned out that Prometheus posed more questions than it was able to answer and with Alien: Covenant, Scott has certainly not tried to hide the fact that he's going back to work on the franchise he helped lift off back in 1979.The Covenant, a colony ship carrying both crew and around two-thousand colonists on board, intercepts a mysterious transmission after a shockwave damages the ship. The crew learn the location of the transmission's source and decide to investigate the planet to see whether it would fit the profile for their colonial mission.Upon exploring what they see as an unchartered paradise, the crew soon find themselves up against a threat beyond their imagination, leading to a harrowing escape to make it back to the Covenant alive.One of the main tasks Ridley Scott had with making Alien: Covenant was trying to make a film that wasn't just a carbon copy of what had come before it. Scott does this by blending the ideas raised in Prometheus with the horror elements of his original Alien to create a bold new chapter that certainly raises more questions but leaves the door open rather intriguingly for at least another film in the franchise.Scott shocked us all with the chestburster scene in Alien and he finds a way to crank up the gore in Alien: Covenant, with some inventive new ways of the aliens exiting their respective hosts not for the faint hearted. He was never going to be able to create as atmospheric a film as Alien, the single location of that film playing a major part, but Scott shows some of his old form when creating a tense sequence, the initial facehugger attack being one of the most intense moments of the franchise, even though we know exactly what is coming.The film is slightly lacking in the character department when it comes to development, with only a few of them becoming more than just expendable alien food. With a large crew and a new alien running amok, I have to say it was rather enjoyable watching how each of them would meet their grisly end. It feels as if the characters take a bit of a back seat to the creation vs evolution ideas that the film raises which, while it may alienate some audience members, drew me right in. The lack of practical effects was a bit disappointing as there were certainly moments where they could have used them but instead they opted for CGI, which makes the creatures far less fearsome.Coming to the performances, Alien: Covenant does only possess one stand-out performer in Michael Fassbender, who plays both androids David, who we first met in Prometheus, and Walter, a member of the Covenant crew. Fassbender made David the most watchable character in Prometheus and he easily repeats the trick here with a dual performance that conflict one another, his line delivery as David in Alien: Covenant in particular is just so ice cold that he becomes quite a chilling character.Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup and Danny McBride are just about the only remaining cast members who get a chance to show any character and they do so very well, McBride going on to surprise a number of people, including me, with such a straight performance as the pilot Tennessee. Look out for the easiest money James Franco will ever make as an actor with a very brief appearance early on in the film.While it is still a long way off the quality of both Alien and Aliens, I found Alien: Covenant to be a very welcome entry into the franchise. There's horror, action and plenty of gore for entertainment value while the continuance of the ideas raised in Prometheus means there is more to this film than people just running and hiding from an alien, the closing scene leaving me excited for where Ridley Scott can take the franchise next.",Alien - Covenant

Even though plot may seem a bit generic, there is still some kind of a new feel to it. I can't describe it. It's a bit of Prometheus and Alien, but at the same time it's neither Prometheus nor Alien. I suggest you go into it with an open mind because whether you expect a Prometheus sequel or Alien prequel you will be a bit disappointed. It doesn't really give as much answers as we expected, since Prometheus is such an enigma of a movie (but that's what made it even better for me), but it does provide some. And that's where my main drawback with this film comes in. It tries to ignore events from Prometheus. Which is sad to see because even though not everyone will agree with me, Prometheus wasn't a mistake. Alien 3 and Alien:Resurrection were mistakes. Prometheus most certainly wasn't. Maybe some themes will be brought up again in the future films. I guess we will have to wait and see. But it resolves some plot points from Prometheus way too easily, like they just wanted to get it done, and it feels a bit lackluster-ish. Especially since Prometheus felt so grand and larger than life. Okay, I'm starting to mention Prometheus way too much, but I had to in order to explain my problem with this movie. Now let's get back to Alien:Covenant, shall we?Once again, it's visually gorgeous and while the main plot feels like we've seen it before, Ridley Scott makes it a unique experience once again. Katherine Waterson is pretty much a replacement for Sigourney Weaver, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I think that's great. You probably won't see it that much in the movie's first third, but that's mostly used for building up. It's not the first time we've encountered the slow beginning in this franchise. Once things really get going, all hell breaks loose. It's intense, it's scary, it's creepy, I loved it! It was a hell of a ride and I can't wait for the next one now or at least see this one again.This felt refreshing and different from our usual blockbusters even though the plot could have been more original, but it's yet to be expanded in the next movies of the series. And that's safe to say since it still retained some of the themes from Prometheus even if it didn't answer all the questions in a satisfying manner. It made the movie deeper and more interesting and after this, I guarantee, you will want more.",Alien - Covenant
279,paulijcalderon,There's actually a good movie hiding in here. What brings it down is an extremely predictable structure,5,17 May 2017,"I was extremely skeptic going into this. I was afraid it would feel too much like a rehash. Luckily enough, I found myself to have a good time. Some things disappointed me, but a section of the movie got really good and I was instantly hooked. It takes time to get there. But, just know that there's a good movie in here eventually.""Prometheus"" premiered 5 years ago and it left me with mixed thoughts. As the years have gone by I've noticed that I've liked it more with each viewing. Sure, there are some noticeable bad things in it which is why I can't say it's perfect. But, I understand it much better now and I appreciate the questions of existence and space exploration it brought up. I especially liked the story of Elizabeth Shaw and the robot David. They carried that movie on their shoulders. I was so eager to see where their story would lead.Which is why I was worried. The trailers looked like the movie ignored to be a good follow-up and instead to just be a beat for beat remake of the original ""Alien"". I wanted to explore new ground and continue with the search for the Engineers. I thought that was so fascinating. I didn't wanna see a re-skinned version of the classic ""Alien"". We already have those movies and they're great. Still I completely understand why they did it. ""Prometheus"" wasn't well received by most people, so to have a new movie that would mix both ""Alien"" and ""Prometheus"" into one made sense in a marketing standpoint. People expected the Xenomorphs back and now they are. And to be honest, I was happy to see the creatures return. Still if you are like me and wanted to see the continuing adventures of Elizabeth Shaw you are not gonna get it. Noomi Rapace is unfortunately not back. You will get some answers left from that movie through the eyes of a new crew from the ship Covenant. So, you can watch this one without even seeing ""Prometheus"". They fill you in on everything you need to know.The design of the sets and the effect work is incredible. Some CGI was a little off. But, the rest of the locations and interior ship designs were wonderful to look at. The sense of mystery was strong and I loved the dark feeling you get watching these movies. It's really great just visually and tonally. What's not so good is the structure. You know exactly when someone is gonna die and so on. It's basically like a generic slasher set in space. I hoped for some more twists to the things we come to expect, but that never really happened. If you've ever seen a previous ""Alien"" film you know where the movie is gonna lead. It's definitely on autopilot with the structure. The new crew is alright. I found myself caring for a lot of the members. A few of them are stock and generic. But, those are the ones who get out of the picture early on. They did an OK job of building some sympathy for them at the beginning. Some dialogue at the start didn't work that well, but it soon got better.What steals the show is the story of the robots David and Walter. Fassbender is absolutely phenomenal playing both roles. You buy it a 100% that they are two different characters whenever they have a scene together. The way they pull it off is out of this world. I loved it. The movie gets really good after the end of the first act. Once you start to investigate what's going on it gets very disturbing and dark. I got invested by that point. If you ignore the horror clichés you get a fantastic different story that's surprising. I would have wanted it to focus more on that story, but what we get is still satisfying. I will say that the horror scenes do make you feel stressed and uncomfortable. So, they actually succeed in creeping you out. It's just extremely noticeable when those scenes are gonna happen. The soundtrack is fantastic. It's somber yet finds a way to creep under your skin.Is this better than ""Prometheus""? I can't really say. I depends on what you wanna see. Ridley Scott went the easy route. He starts the movie well with a great opening scene which I loved. Then he has a bit of trouble in the first act. It's a little slow with some uninteresting moments. Once we get to the planet the movie finds itself with them digging deeper into the mystery. It has a wonderful second act and a finale that's underwhelming, but like I said: Satisfying enough. I can forgive it for not being what I wanted because of the David / Walter story-line. That's what had me on the edge of my seat. It was really fascinating. How about the rest of the movie? Well, it's basic fun space horror. Not terrible, just something you come to expect. You can do much better next time, Ridley. If you follow the right steps with the right characters, you can have a fantastic third chapter in this prequel series.",Alien - Covenant
280,basilisksamuk,An improvement but same faults as Prometheus,6,13 May 2017,"On reviewing Prometheus in 2012 I said it ""is a very good film which has been folded inside an exceedingly bad film."" I could say exactly the same about Covenant. In fact this Alien prequel suffers from almost exactly the same faults as Prometheus. It's overlong, has too much mystical mumbo-jumbo that adds nothing to the plot and the dialogue is awful.Without giving anything away you could immediately improve the film by cutting out the prologue, the flute scene and at least half of what happens on the planet. I have nothing against philosophical musings in films but that's not we expect in an Alien movie. We want the visceral and pulse-pounding moments building up to a crescendo without any baggage to slow down the action.Ridley Scott has said he wants to build a franchise out of Alien to rival Star Wars. I believe he could do it if he'd ditch all the nonsense and find some better scripts. I really enjoyed Alien: Covenant for the most part but I'm really frustrated by the bits that apply the brakes when we want the action to keep building.",Alien - Covenant
281,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,"Battlefield Earth Meets Its Match, OMG",2,13 February 2018,"I'm can't believe I fell for this yet again! Still believing that Ridley Scott has an a amazing Alien film left in him after the utterly dreadful Prometheus and the swift decline of Alien quality since Aliens in 1986. What on earth is going on, and why is this man still directing films in 201x? I'm so angry at myself for falling for it AGAIN!It's absolutely mind-blowingly bad and does nothing more than milk the Alien name for the benefit of all those involved.The best way to describe this film is a scene near the end when the captain of the ship disobeys the instruction of the android not to shoot the alien specimen, but riddles it with bullets instead. Great! The captain then commands the android to stand down, only for the android to whisk itself away and get the captain to follow it for some strange reason (that Michael Fassbender is a charming fellow, you know). It's still mildly plausible at this point, except when they enter into a room filled with alien cocoons on the ground, and the previously untrustworthy android tells our captain not to worry about his impending doom, but to take a closer look inside the egg! Are you kidding me? What do you think happens to our captain, hmmm? Any guesses?This total disrespect for us as brain-dead viewers is the most offensive thing of all and not acceptable in any way, or to use the 'Alien' brand to draw us into watching utter crap like this. But for some reason there are still idiots like me who cling to the name in the hope of something decent one day. Why? This franchise is 20-years dead, and Ridley Scott... you got me again. I'm so angry.So it's my fault, your fault, and all of our collective faults for watching this pile of utter crap, and for still respecting the Alien franchise and Ridley Scott as a director.",Alien - Covenant
282,jburtonprod-802-759029,Why is Ridley Scott Taking Us in This Direction?,7,21 May 2017,"First of all, this is an incredible work of on screen science fiction. Technically, it's brilliantly conceived and executed. The problem is it is not really an 'Alien' movie. It could've just as easily been called. 'David: Portrait of a Killer Robot'. I don't know why Ridley Scott is taking us into this world of 'the Engineers' and David's robot sociopathy and away from what made the first two 'Alien' movies great. Yes. there's some Alien scares and some kills but it's all secondary to David's story. Frankly, I could give a rat's ass about David. I didn't really like the character in 'Prometheus' and I absolutely hated him in this movie. Likewise I don't really give a crap about the Engineers. If Ridley wanted to make a space opera about the origin of mankind he really should have started another franchise. As it is, he is WAY off course, floating around in space and dragging us along with him. Also, The action sequence at the end was really ridiculous. It went straight to 'Live Free or Die Hard' Land. I HATED the ending of Shaw that was presented in this movie and HATED the direction the end of the movie is taking us. I would really prefer to see what Neil Bokamp's reboot would bring us. And don't get me wrong, the movie is very entertaining, has a few scares and is engaging. It is just not what was great about the original 'Alien' and there seems no end in sight.",Alien - Covenant
283,JamesRutland,The latest 20 minutes of INSANE STUPIDITY destroy the whole good movie.,1,14 May 2017,"Ridley Scott was going to realize one of his best movie but at the end he followed the stupid Hollywood criteria making it absolutely STUPID. I don't know if Ridley Scott be an idiot or some other management producer be idiot but Scott has been able to kill its own movie with STUPID CHOICES. This movie starts much more smart than its bad, ugly, stupid predecessor, from which Scott chose to consider viewers in the usual idiotic manner because marketing system scam people to get easy money. After negative criticisms to the Prometheus stupid movie, he decides to rectify its venal choice at least until the latest 20 minutes of Aliens covenant. The scientists appear to be more realistic, more human, more introspective, there is much more philosophy in this movie so to explain the reason of the evil plan of David: the droid wants to be as GOD is. Initially the only unreal event concerns with the cargo meets the Paradise Planet in the whole UNIVERSE for a pure coincidence: they casually coast that precise Planet (""OK IT'S A MOVIE"" and I assume Scott considers viewers as idiots from which to get easy money""). The story evolves and the crew decides to visit the Planet also because of the mystic feelings of a sort of priest (it's not easy to accept this unreasonable motivation since science is based on verifiable data, however the viewer can accept this fideistich anomaly which differs from not only with science but also with Faith). So the tragedy begins.... the crew on the planet is decimated because of terrible events up to the glorification of David's plan through which he generates the famous Alien of 1979.... this Alien is very lethal so that the viewer imagines that this creature can eat all those weak humans if not the good Walter would be able to save them both from the evil David brother and from his terrible beast. That's not the case: wonder woman appears after many tears and insecurities armed by an ax flying between the space and the rescue spaceship so nimbly. She has no longer tears and insecurities for the beast but she has THE AX.... After this situation the viewers can think: ""f...k the ax, I hope the alien eats the ax and its owner"". Unfortunately No: the AX WINS because it is the best weapon in the entire sci-fi universe, so the beast succumbs being grabbed by a mechanical vise. Almost the whole crew has been ""deleted"", only 2 survivors are able to reach the main cargo where two other pilot members were inside on board the mother ship; these last members think that it is a good idea to make a shower having sex, indeed, they are so placid after all those terrible events happened on the inhospitable planet (the viewers could think during this unreal scene: «now Jason or Freddy Kruger appears so to kill the two members of the space cargo in the shower using the cleaver or the knives glove»)... obviously they have lost all their friends, so they want to have a shower and above all they desire to have sex due to happiness, isolating themselves from the 2 survivors without asking them what happened on the planet terror, without asking for their friends showing their sadness for the terrible departure of those dear persons. ""Incredibly ""JASON"" REALLY APPEARS behind the shower and kill both of them.... until WONDER WOMAN intervenes again pushing out the spaceship the most terrible beast a human being could meet"". How these last 20 minutes may have ruined a good movie, only Ridley Scott can know (""Hollywood criteria"") unveiling the reason of these stupid choices in the sequel of this bad episode. The real mediocre fact of Alien covenant is not the movie, but it is the decision to make unreal what initially was credible and good.

But the trendy way to end movies now (and for the last decade or two) is to make you think everything worked out fine, and then right at the end they ""surprise"" you with some weird twist. Well of course we expect it now. We know movie makers today are not even close to being as good as their predecessors. We know full well they will all do it. We hate it, but that's how it is.I can picture them rubbing their evil hands together thinking, ""Ooooh, this will surprise them. Surely they won't see this coming."" Well that's because movie makers (directors, writers, etc) are stupid. That's the only conclusion I can come up with. If they want to surprise us, give us a good ending. If they want to surprise us, don't make us leave the theatre grumbling about it. That leaves a bad taste in our mouths, and we come here and write crappy reviews. Get it? No, they don't get it.

287,rabbitmoon,"In some ways its excellent, but as an Alien film its infuriating",7,12 May 2017,"In the first 20 minutes I was so happy with Covenant. It felt sharp, atmospheric, there are interesting character situations, emotive moments and infinitely better writing than we had in Prometheus. As it progresses, this feeling continues - thankfully, a solid sci-fi film that got it right. Then Ridley starts to indulge in his convoluted ideas about creation and destruction. Its like switching from 1977 George Lucas to 1999 Lucas. You can almost hear Ridley at a writing meeting saying ""this'll be cool, and this, and this, and then this"" and the writer saying ""uh, is this for the same film or later in the series?"" ""Yeah just cram it all in, make it happen"". You end up with three different films - a first act like a modern Alien which I loved, a middle act of Prometheus style philosophizing that feels like more Westworld, then a last act of two shoe-horned in action scenes homaging Aliens and Alien 3 respectively. Except there is no satisfaction at all, because the aliens are rushed, a bit silly, often awkwardly CGI looking, and not even convincing as threats because we don't care about any of it. By the end I just have no idea what to think. I just think it would have worked much better if the ideas were done justice in their own film, rather than ham-fistedly trying to ram them into an Alien film to try and please fans and make box-office.",Alien - Covenant
288,Rawal_Afzal,The horror is more nauseous than thrilling!!!,7,21 May 2017,"Although I wouldn't call it a disaster, but I certainly think that the film delivers way below the expectations. The action may make for some trembling moments, but the story and the overall plot is makes one yawn to be honest.The horror has no thrills or hair-raising moments like the 1986 film had, and leans more towards making you puke as opposed to making you hold your breaths. I certainly expected better from a film made in 2017 - with more equipment, technology and resources available - as 'Jurassic World' 2015 so aptly makes my point.The entrance of the Aliens has no build up, the reactions from the actors seemed so fake as if they dinner with such monsters every Sunday, and on their walkie talkie type sets they hardly tell the other members of the crew that they're seeing some extraterrestrial form of life or a monster, and just mumble through the words. Instead of a fight for survival, this looks like a dish where humans and aliens are randomly thrown into one plate and they keep on bumping into each other.The story seemed to focus more on the android and his evil plotting than the aliens themselves. It gets increasingly 'facepalmic' when it begins to behave very creepily - attempting a rape! Ridley sadly got his priorities wrong I'm afraid. Michael Fassbender behaves more like a eunuch than an android, although this isn't the main point in my objections.Still though, the film has its moments and was still enjoyable in parts. My criticism is based more on the franchise that it belongs to and more so the highly reputable director that made it. Whereas the great James Cameron fulfills the demands of the common man and explores his emotions and stimulates his mind, Ridley Scott sticks to what he believes will be right - on its way, often his vision ends up agreeing with the public and sometimes not. Due to this thin yet a deciding difference, I'll have to bury my desire of wanting to re-witness something as great as 'Aliens' (1986) - unless of course, Mr. Cameron decides to make one himself.For now though, give me 'Life' (2017) over this one any day!",Alien - Covenant

This means the movie is slow-paced and unoriginal. The only point of interest in this movie is finding out what happened to the characters from Prometheus, especially Noomi Rapace's Dr Shaw. Once the mystery is unveiled, there is nothing new. The movie may benefit from the fact that is a prequel to the original Aliens, but that alone does not make it a worthwhile movie to watch.

290,BeanieCore,"An effective horror film, destroyed by a nonsensical script.",5,24 November 2020,"Despite going to bat for ""Prometheus"", the oft misunderstood predecessor to this film, I can't take Ridley Scott's side this time. There was so much potential for creative science fiction and horror at the end of that film, and every last bit of it is squandered here. Don't get me wrong, for much of it's run-time, this can often be an enjoyable experience. It's the moments of brilliance, nail-biting tension, warm characterization and high energy action that make it so crushingly disappointing when the film utterly destroys itself. Script-writer John Logan attempts to please both those who enjoyed the philosophical musings of ""Prometheus"" and those looking for gore and pure horror. Whilst he manages to deliver plenty of blood-soaked action and creature fun, he completely butchers the story carried over from the last film.Turning David into a completely psychotic supervillian was entirely uncalled for, and though the script tries to make sense of this jarring shift, it utterly fails to do so. David did some bad things in Prometheus, but this was out of child-like curiosity, and there was never any malice or contempt for the entire human race suggested. Quite the opposite. This might be a bit overlookable, if not for the end of the film. After we build up an attachment for the characters, and cheer them on through so much heartbreak and suspense, we're slapped in the face with an unearned, nihilistic ending that leaves everything up in the air once again. And after seeing how Scott and company had absolutely no respect for the characters they wrote in the last film, going into this one, I don't trust them to respect these characters either.At this point, the franchise has become nothing but a series of films, in which new characters are introduced, simply to be massacred, so that the next paycheck can roll in, and the story can become ever more convoluted. It's an utter shame, because Scott continues to show real chops when directing the horror sequences, and these characters are interesting. But it all goes absolutely nowhere, and John Logan couldn't write himself out of a paper bag, let alone pass a script-writing class with trash like this. If this is what we can continue to expect from the franchise, Scott needs to be as far away from it as possible.",Alien - Covenant

The fact that there are couple untied ends does not bother me that well, maybe it even gives me some hope for new addition in the series as there are still stories to be told.Alien covenant isn't scary movie, isn't a shocking movie, but it is a good movie, with great cast, music and screenplay.",Alien - Covenant

Sure it has its bumps and ""WTF-moments"", but ALL-IN-ALL a great addition. ""Prometheus"" was a SLIGHTLY disappointing prequel, it was a decent movie, but a tad disappointing. This one makes up for it.*SPOILERS AHEAD*There are two things about this movie that I didn't like. 1. The way they handled the ""Oh, a planet, we have to go down there."" I mean, they had been training to go to the other planet, and suddenly this one appears and they just go down... with no training... no idea what is down there except some random transmission..? It's just stupid, in my opinion. 2. Walter or David? There's a moment when the viewer wont see the fight between David and Walter, so we don't know who makes it. Daniels just takes it for granted that it is Walter, and she wouldn't even question it.. UNTIL it was too late.The things I DID like was the fact that we saw a little bit of Elizabeth Shaw, even if it was a brief thingy in the movie. That whole ordeal made David much more eerie, dangerous, creepy, whatever. I also liked the ALIEN, visually that is. I only have ONE bad thing to say about it, and that is that it looked kind of stupid, in a good way... kind of. I'm kind of torn, but I liked the visuals of it when it was doing it's thing. I'm a mess, sorry. The one MAIN thing I loved about this movie was the gore. It was borderline Quentin Tarantino at times, which was hilariously creepy and disgusting.The ending was a setup for future movies, which I would want to see too.

I did not expect much from the sequel to Promethues, as it seemed that the level of the Alien films declined more and more, but this time, It was quite different.The film has no doubt, the most beautiful views we see in the saga of Alien, has some incredible special effects, a very good script, spectacular performances (Fassbender is incredible) an entertaining plot, good sound design, great visuals And a lot, a lot of blood. I think it is the most bloody and violent film in the entire saga, just like the first time I saw Aliens, this one left me shocked and I try to see again and again.I am a big fan of science fiction and horror, Alien is my favorite saga, I must say that I am very grateful to Scott for the fantastic thing that is this new movie, very incredible, no doubt, it was quite entertaining and intense to experiment it in cinema. But, perhaps one of its biggest mistakes is its strange and too confusing narrative on the part of the director; this film is supposed to be designed to give answers to past problems, to the questions that we have asked ourselves so much, however, it only ends up reeling over themselves and trying to add layer upon layer of complexity that simply end up being unnecessary overexposure.Leaving that aside, it was a quite entertaining movie, with intense scenes and wonderful shots.

295,Eric_Cubed,Way Better Than Prometheus!,5,18 August 2017,"I am happy to say Covenant is far superior than Prometheus in pretty much every way imaginable. The first Alien movie was as perfect a movie can get, and like The Godfather, Alien is is one of the archetypal templates for its genre. This means the writers create sabotage when they completely betray one or more of the foundations of the original masterpiece, in this case ""basic quarantine procedure."" The worst scene in Prometheus, or any movie really, is when the supposedly highly trained scientist/astronaut takes off his helmet and lovingly approaches a potentially deadly alien creature, as one might approach a kitten. He is of course immediately eviscerated. I'll ignore the improbability the engineers' planet is completely compatible with Earth's atmosphere (hence no need for a pressurized oxygen suit) to focus on the crew acting in the same stupid, naive manner (in regards contagion, quarantine procedures), as they curiously plant their faces into alien fungi and are immediately infected/impregnated with alien spores. In Alien, Ripley won't let Cain and the rest in, one of the best scenes. This is because Alien knew what it was supposed to be: a movie about working class heroes who damn well knew and, and were highly trained in, safety protocols. It is the imperfect Ash, the insane robot/android, following company management algorithms' who signs the death warrant (props to the foreshadowing of David's madness and that, out of perverse ""love,"" he is the killer of the engineer species and final creator of the original xenomorph). Another theme in all the Ripley movies is down to earth believable characters who are both instantly relatable and almost immediately convey the nature of their bonding (that is, character development). This is what makes a movie real, and to use the cliché, ""suspends disbelief"" (think Brett and Parker in Alien, the camaraderie of the troops in Aliens, the colorful characters in Resurrection and even Bishop's barely revealed humanity in Aliens). We have none of this in Prometheus or Covenant and I can't help but to think the pressurized system of Hollywood has now become a formula within a formula (e.g. choosing actors without chemistry within scripts without passion to please agents and producers who act like realtors rather than artists). But all caveats aside, Covenant has the best alien birthing and kill scenes ever, rivaling even at times the editing of Aliens. Though not nearly as convincing as Ash or Bishop, Fassbender nonetheless gets the job done well (imagine if he was let loose to completely create his own character? One gets the impression he was given a very limited range to work with, especially being one our best living actors). And the creatures themselves are very well done, even without Geiger. If the producers and writers and directors had any sense at all, they'd let Cameron both write and direct the next one, unchained.",Alien - Covenant
296,Eric_Cubed,Tell the truth or forever hold your peace,5,29 January 2018,"The producers, directors and writers cannot seem to comprehend that the camaraderie dynamics that made the first two alien movies so relatably simple do not exist in the same way 25 years later. In the first alien, Brett and Parker, in perfect 70's gestalt, were perfectly cast and written to embody the working class familiarity of that particular blue collar time period--think car wash blues by Jim Croce and you will get the sentiment. Their unforgivable mistake was trying to duplicate the zeitgeist of yore for now. It just doesn't exist anymore, and the character ""Tennessee,"" in complete pathetic abandon, trying to be the African American actress on the movie, ""The Abyss"" (Kimberly Scott) is about the most fake and phony attempt at recapturing the authenticity of the original I can possibly imagine. That James Cameron was able to do this elucidates his savvy, or perhaps even his genius, for he knew the developmental process of the conceivers of the new alien series were as important as considering as the passage of time itself; if the gatekeepers were not self-aware, they would only repeat the past through the lens of their own relative, reminiscent memories. This is why George Lucas failed on every level with Star Wars. He didn't understand that while the same basic mythological narratives remained timelessly true, the contemporary context and dynamic of cultural change still had to be woven into it all. Many of us are perplexed by these new movies, whose predecessors we magically related to. In these new movies, we immediately have no intrinsic relatableness to any of the characters; they feel one-dimension and plastic, forced upon the scene like hungry ghosts of what once worked but what can never work again. This is how the lack of humility and ego of the original creators sin--they disparage the passion of the original for the bleached forgone longings of their own selfish and repressed nostalgia. It's like how the Republicans wish for Norman Rockwell. That time is over--and perhaps never even existed--and, in trying to repair the unrepairable, the wishful depraved child hopes to recreate the childhood he never had, but should have had. And worse, they have completely forgotten what made the first two movies so timelessly awesome, and that was their dedication and conviction to the human condition in the context of hypersleep and deep space travel--that human being are exceptionally fragile and vulnerable, and therefore, say, contagion protocols must be enforced as the highest priority. In Prometheus they gleefully take off their helmets and try to lovingly caress the alien appendage. In Covenant, they practically plaster their faces onto the alien spores. Stupid, stupid, stupid, and why Prometheus (three stars) is only a little bit worse than Covenant (5 stars). These idiots made the same mistake with ""The Thing"" remake. The original story of The Thing was about men, masculinity, isolation and paranoia of the other, a metaphor for the cold war and the fear even your best friend could be something other than what he reveals himself to be. It was like remaking Thelma and Louise with two men experiencing the travails of the metoo movement. STUPID! How about a remake of Mississippi Burning about the trials and tribulations of sensitive white artists living in South Dakota? Why, why are they so inept? It's so simple and obvious to me. The old Ripley isn't the new Ripley. Kurt Russell cannot be replaced by a woman, no matter how great of an actress or beautiful she is. This is not sexist, it's the intention of the original story. How about a sequel to Fried Green Tomatoes featuring a bunch of male facebook stock holders? I just don't get it, all those millions upon millions upon millions of dollars, only to make at best a ghostly bi-product of what made the original so glorious. Perhaps in the end it is pure cowardice. Those with untold millions just trying to crunch the numbers and follow a formula in order to create the best probability for a return, as though they were real estate agents. The thing is, they are not real estate agents--they are the gatekeepers of our culture, and sadly, like the massive foreign investors and one percenters eating up our precious neighborhoods with mini-apartments, lego like candyland dehumanizing structures and organizations and establishments catering to the hollow, empty soullessness of viral tech invaders, only let us all down. Perhaps this is a rambling diatribe--or perhaps it is an all too real warning. Where shall we be in twenty years? In Fifty? Shall the aristocracy reign supreme, as they have tried to do so, for timeless immorium, under the guise of conservitism?
Shall we let them continue to use PC as a fascist call for conformity and censorship? Or shall we, through the power of the arts, the power of the movies, stop the egregious affront before it's too late? Are you with me?",Alien - Covenant
297,andyajoflaherty,Identity crisis?,6,28 June 2020,"This follow up to Prometheus has a bit of an identity crisis. On the one hand it wants to be a sequel to Prometheus, and on the other it wants to be an Alien film, and sadly it tries to be both and does neither idea justice. The characters, while likable enough, just don't take any time to bond with the audience, and as such they fall in to the classic horror film trap of dying meaningless deaths. The creatures look poor compared to the rest of the film's visuals, and imo at least don't offer any sort of real scares. One interesting aspect of the film was the good vs bad android angle, which I feel was a tad underused. I also don't like how this film has given answers to the origins of the Xenomorphs - I liked not knowing. The mystique surrounding the original film was one of the best things about it, and now that has been taken away. All in all its by no means bad, but it feels compromised in terms of vision. Hopefully for the next one Ridley makes the film he wants to make instead of pampering to a fanbase who think they know what they want.",Alien - Covenant
298,angiris,Beethovens Great Fuge of the Alien Franchise,4,24 May 2017,"What a colossal... Broken... Mess. I am not just shocked but downright appalled at how Ridley executed this film. Not in the shape of executing cinematography. I mean downright 18th century head cleaving execution (Spoiler warning... which happens in the film too. But who even cares)What can I say that hasn't already been said. The characters are unfathomably dumb. Let me give you an idea because some of these reviews leave out a few things. Nr 1. After the ship containing the crew and 2000 colonists they get hit by a solarflare and have to repair things. THats when they get a random signal in the middle of nowhere from a planet that just so happens to be perfectly habitable ( Which is SUPER rare) Now. Our lead female ( if you can call her that. I don't even remember her name. THats how little I care about her and anyone in it) makes the objection to our brainless captain that it would be INSANE to land on a planet we know NOTHING about with 2000 colonists, CHANGING the original plan. Scientifically we would all agree. Too many variables, unknown dangers, and when having that kind of crew its best to stick to the original plan which still works. But nope. The new captain who takes over after James Franco dies within the first 5 minutes of the film. Yes. Not a single piece of dialog. He just dies. Gets burned to crisp inside his hibernation pod because malfunction. Such a waste and pointlessly so. Anyway. The new captain ignores the threat, the hazards, the risk and just goes from SCIENCE... to CHANCE. Yes. I am not kidding. Thats how this plot is built. Leap of faith... with over 2000 lives. Its so unbelievably mind numbing. And it only gets worse from there as many others have talked about. I could talk about how Ridley Scott's seeming loss of talent and boozing has destroyed the xenomorph universe since this is canon. I WILL NEVER CONSIDER THIS CANON. EVER. But there it is. Xenomorph homeworld? RIP. ENgineers? RIP. Explanation to prometheus? RIP. And you know where that could have been found? IN THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT. That was changed. Google that on youtube. You'll discover that this film could have tied in perfectly with Alien 1979. Instead of this. No. Now we got David. We got a psychopathic, emotionally distraught robot obsessed with creating and the other human characters in the film are nothing but meant to die. No character progression, no heroes, no sensicality of behavior, no logic. Does this film have anything good to offer? Yeah sure. Horror tropes. Blood. Gore. Decapitation. And the entire thing is shot in the dark 90 % of the time which makes it hard to see things but hey... Jump scare ! Because thats why we loved the original alien films right? ... WRONG. But Ridley doesn't get that. He has lost it. His vision, ambition and understanding. So much so that he changed the entire bloody plot at the last minute, turning Alien Covenant into David COVENANT. With rash action, non-sensical horror and gore, hollow characters and unsatisfying progression from start to finish.And thats not even a joke. When Ludvig van Beethoven was almost completely deaf he created his Great Fuge. It was met with horrible reactions because it truly is terrible. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s0Mp7LFI-k Listen to it as you continue to read, dear readers. Years passed and criticism became more mixed up until the mid 1900's where after reading more into it, trying to view things from the perspective of a deaf genius making music some people began viewing this as an art piece. But fact is that if Beethoven could actually hear 200 years ago this Fuge was 99 % guaranteed to have NOT sounded this way. Proof being all his other work. WHere am I going with this? I'm getting at the positive reviews of this film and films like it that turn original masterpieces into monstrosities yet new fans or uncaring moviegoers don't care about it at all. Rating this 10 stars or 9. Anything above 5 is an insult to the original films. Ridley Scott gave us strong characters, bonding, insight and complexity to a script, characters, plot and further intrigue to the mystery of this franchise back then. And he has now brutalized it like Beethoven did his legacy at the time with his Great Fuge. Because like George Lucas highlighted when talking about making more than 6 films. Sometimes one can go too far and destroy what one seeks to create.David did not create life. He destroyed life with a weapon he made and was too delusional to comprehend it. Just like Ridley himself has now crushed the Alien Universe with this level of poor imagination and drunken execution of cinematography in hopes of something we will NEVER know just like we wont be able to comprehend what Beethoven was thinking as he made this chaotic Fuge. Anyone can think what they've made is beautiful to overthinking it. Please don't overthink this film. Instead watch the originals and pay attention to how they were made compared to this.David Covenant is a movie about a director who should have known better than to change things up completely and should have adheared to finishing off Prometheus more appropriately, sensically and respected the lore. 4 out of 10. Its annoying, contrived, non-sensical, lackluster, NOT horror,CGI packed jump scares without build up. Alien is cheap. Everyone is dumb and irritatingly. Ridley. pass the reigns to Neill Bloomkamp. His alien film, bringing back Ripley, newt and Hicks sounds far more interesting.",Alien - Covenant
299,andymhancock,Par for the course for another Aliens sequel,7,8 June 2019,"What more is there to say? As yet another sequel, its quality was respectable. The android aspect was fun. By this point in the franchise, there's not much to criticize except good clean fun. Which this one delivered on.",Alien - Covenant
300,Animus,"It's bad, make no mistake.",5,27 May 2020,"The latest travesty in the Alien franchise manages to have a cast of character even dumber than those seen in Prometheus. I lost count of how many idiotic things they did about halfway through. The villain telegraphs ""I'm EVIL"" so hard he might as well have had Darth Vader's theme playing constantly.
Mr Scott, PLEASE stop writing Alien movies, all you do is screw it up. there were some excellent stories in the Dark Horse Comics and a couple of wonderfully written books that would make GREAT movies.",Alien - Covenant
301,joseesrocha,A Masterpiece!!!,10,5 June 2020,"This is my second / third favorite film in the franchise. Most people say that these are the dumbest scientists ever because they didn't know how to deal with aliens, or because they made stupid decisions etc ...
What I think:
They are scientists, when they arrived in that unknown land they did not know that there were aliens, that is why they did not have enough weapons for what they were dealing with as in Prometheus, that is, they were not military personnel with heavy weapons and with good preparations. , they were just scientists.",Alien - Covenant
302,ewaf58,Love and hate,7,7 September 2017,I don't think I've ever read such a selection of diverse reviews before. There is plenty of love - but also plenty of hate for the film.I guess when you go to an Alien film you're hoping it will deliver the thrills and spills of the first two. These were finely crafted films that drew mainly positive reviews - but you can't go on repeating them forever.You could have another mining ship where the crew awake - or another set of colonists wiped out except for a few survivors that are rescued by marines - but you can't - so at least Scott and his team have attempted something different for the last two films.I enjoyed the film and found it interesting with decent amounts of tension. On a personal basis I would have preferred more character development - and at times the crew seemed to have a collective IQ of about 20.In Aliens the main characters were all sharply defined so we could relate to them - but in Covenant we knew very little about them.A few more scenes of them interacting as a group - with their foibles coming out - would have made them more interesting and made us care more when they met their end.However the inadequate makeshift captain was interesting and I would like to have seen more of him (no not his inners). Of course he shouldn't have opened his Easter egg - but who isn't interested in finding out what goodies lay inside - have you never looked into one?I would also have liked a little more credibility in terms of the planet and quarantine procedures. In the original the high IQ Ripley showed a lot of common sense but this crew wouldn't have thought twice about walking naked through a lab containing Anthrax spores and the Ebola virus.I hope Scott is allowed to make the next instalment and perhaps he'll tie all the lose ends up so we end up at the start of Alien.Just think not only will the fans of this film have something to look forward to - so will all the sleeping colonists.,Alien - Covenant
303,Mike_Noga,Scott has broken his Covenant,3,19 May 2017,"Ridley Scott used to make great movies, or at the least, entertaining ones. But now it seems like he' stopped doing that. Prometheus was a bomb but I figured everyone is entitled to one of those and was looking forward to this one getting the Alien franchise back on track. No such luck. Covenant was actually more tedious and baffling than Prometheus.I left the theater feeling let down and wondering what had happened to Ridley Scott that he would make a movie like this. It was terribly paced, and the characters were bland and most of what they did made no sense. FOr a movie that was supposed to be "" smart "" there were too many "" deus ex machinas"" and I certainly did NOT need to see two android Michael Fassbenders making out. Really Ridley?I can't add any more to the criticism of this film than has already been written. I'm pretty much just leaving this review as written proof that I didn't like this film. Years from now when I'm having a beer with friends and arguing over movies, if one of them accuses me of liking this film BOOM I've got the documentation to prove otherwise.",Alien - Covenant
304,evan_harvey,A good follow-up to Prometheus,7,16 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant. Not too bad, actually. Not great, but still good. Fantastic cinematography. I like the way that the story has separated itself from the traditional Alien franchise. It follows on from Prometheus quite well and has a very dark tone. Prometheus tried to introduce some philosophical ideas, but was poorly paced and edited, resulting in an uneven film. Even so, it's a new direction in the Alien mythology, and Alien: Covenant furthers that direction.It seems like a lot of fans are complaining that it's not like the other Alien films, but really, we've had two good ones (Alien and Aliens), and then a run of b-grade crud (Alien 3&4 and then AVP). The b-grade films are not completely worthless (but close to), but I don't really want any more of it. The Alien franchise needed something different.In any case, Alien: Covenant has more alien in it (but not too much). The cast are all okay, but only Fassbender is actually good. There are a few complaints that I've read about the crew in the film doing stupid things, but really it's just par for the course. Characters in horror films always do dumb things, and these are no better or worse. In that sense the writing is a bit sloppy, but nothing unforgivable.I rate it 7 out of 10.",Alien - Covenant
305,WasiReviews,I Have Never Seen Dumber Horror Crew Members,5,12 August 2020,"I'm sure the actors and actresses are great in real life but the way they scripted the characters in the movie completely took me out of it. Bringing the spore on board for no reason dumb, trusting a mysterious Android that's by himself, dumb. They just keep making dumb decisions in The Thing and the Original Alien the crew aren't necessarily really intelligent but they knew what they were doing. Here the characters felt lifeless and I can't remember their names because of how forgettable and boring they were on the bright side I got to see those boring characters die. Micheal Fossbender is the best part about the movie and the flashbacks to what happened after Prometheus should've just been this movie it would've been a lot more entertaining than this crew. Also side note why is the captain gay if they're trying to repopulate the human species on a suitable home-world, illogical stuff like this made this movie mediocre. I'm looking forward to the sequel though fingers crossed. Prometheus was way better as a really cool sci-fi dive into exploration, creation, God, and human nature. This? This is just a mediocre horror movie that has almost nothing to do with the last film.",Alien - Covenant
306,jeannefrancoise,Alien as usual in ordinary landscape but great ending,7,22 May 2017,"Dear readers, now I want to add the review about Alien: Covenant (2017). First of all is about the title. The title is not a lie, because the movie is about the alien, even if in the first scene, we already hope there is an alien physically, but the alien itself came up in the middle of the scene, while in the first scene, there is also an alien, but not physically, but mentally. Here I do not want to be a spoiler, but you will understand while I said the alien is already came up in the very beginning of the scene. Secondly is about the plot. Yes the ordinary movie of alien must have a team and a bunch of enemies, that are aliens. This movie is just like ordinary alien movie, so there is some expedition team, being interested in something new, but trapped in the middle of aliens team, and the plots are all about how to defend from the aliens, as you can see here that all relationships, including friendship, boss-people, and man-to-man, are focusing on alien, alien, and alien, and maybe for some people this is so boring, because it lacks of drama and sensation, there is no political or science-fiction plot that lead the plot. Then I want to review about the role of the actors/actresses. Here is we can see the feminist idea on some scenes while you can see the female that leads all the strategies against aliens, and yes there is some betrayal and broken friendship, but the feminist idea will cover it up by the time to time and all roles here are developing into their original characters. The liars stay liars, the gentlemen stay gentlemen, and the alien stay alien, so I can say it is little bit boring to watch this movie and everybody just can guess the ending. Finally I want to remark the style of Director that in somehow, in some cases, the movie looks like the ambiance of Star Wars and Hunger Games, I do not why, maybe some movie experts could give explanation more deeper, but for me, the effects are also similar to the Guardian of the Galaxy. But here is always appearing the alien that can entertain your whole weekend.",Alien - Covenant
307,voyou-703-655350,Terrific,8,24 May 2017,"Do not read spoilers because, for the vast majority of 2 hours, we have no idea where the story might lead us. It is true that towards the end, we see it coming, yet it doesn't remove anything from the thrill. It's probably by design. In fact, I suspect it is more terrifyingly enjoyable this way.Summary for the reader who won't read further: Original, thrilling, intelligent, breathtaking, fascinating, with tons of awesome.The first part, in space, is so enjoyable that I start to hope the entire story will stay on that line, that is of course until I remember that I came to see a monsters flick. What happens next has all the elements you would expect, and much new material. Ha ! There's even a real scream queen scene, sending me back to the 70s with a smile for a second.The only reason that I don't rate higher this great theater moment is the last physical confrontation, which I find subpar to the rest, unoriginal on paper, unclear in execution, not engaging as a result. It's just one scene, but it's supposed to be a climax, so in my eyes it counts for more.I was starting to think that nobody does SF cinema anymore, what with people paying to watch long toy commercials, predigested pointless brouhahas, adaptations of brain dead TV garbage, etc. So thank you Ridley Scott. And more congratulations for achieving greatness inside a franchise, usually the exemplar of film decay.",Alien - Covenant
308,Michael Kenmore,Alien: Covenant well-made but marred by predictable story twists,6,22 May 2017,"I'll do the best impression of the character ""David"".Overall superb production values. Well-polished especially the cinematography and improved visual effects.But, it fails to follow up with the very ending of a strange unique creature in the otherwise turgid and unnecessary prequel Prometheus. This movie disregards logic that includes the ridiculous chestburster scene that trumps the lore of the original Alien movie.The twists are predictable as always. I can predict the telegram within the movie, that neither the screenwriters nor the director would hope to prevent. I assiduously avoid the spoilers, yet I am the armchair psychic. This movie, indeed, is the goriest of the franchise so far. So gory it detracts from the science fiction thriller aspect, that, along with cinematography, is reminiscent of the early and gruesome ""Saw"" movies. This movie is better than Prometheus without the infuriating elements such as awful dialogue and offending subplots that demonstrate the screenwriters to be the hack. But the fact that Alien: Covenant -- by the returning producers Walter Hill and David Giler (both who re-wrote the original Alien script by Dan O'Bannon and Ron Shusett that made that movie a feminist parable, despite no writing credit) and even the returning director of the original Alien movie -- chose to disregard the logics that were established in the earlier movies is frustrating since I'm a follower of the Alien legend in the realm of science fiction. Alien: Covenant is interesting, but its logic is bizarre to be canonical, even with the twists that might confound. Hollywood tries too hard to be clever and original, but they tend to fail. As always the best part of the movie is the actor Michael Fassbender, who cannot do wrong except stellar acting, even in a mediocre or bad movie.",Alien - Covenant
309,sjarja,Ruined by stupid character writing,4,14 July 2017,"I do hate to do that - but sometimes single character decisions CAN ruin the entire movie - because all the time you have to think back and remember how moronic the characters acted.So that movie - while actually being a good above average one - is ruined and utterly brought down by the character writing.After Prometheus - and the plentiful criticism about its scientists idiotic behaviour - i did expect a much ""smarter"" crew in Covenant... just to be disappointed. And although they did not try to outrun a thin wheel by running straight instead of doing a single sidestep - or remove their helmets when confronted by an alien and unknown life form.... they did pretty much destroy the entire mission by making an irrational, emotional - and outright stupid decision by altering the course to investigate a planet - as if they were a scout ship, instead of a ship responsible for thousands of colonists.The bridge crew acted on a responsibility level of a drunk teenager.And it is that writing that ruined the movie for me, because it made me angry to see the plot unfold based on stupidity.On a more technical side ... the characters were too many to be properly introduced and experienced to really care about. In the first Alien movie, there was a small crew with mostly memorable characters - in the Aliens movie, there was a small band of marines that had VERY exaggerated personalities to remember them.Here we have a lot of ""red shirts"" - and i did not care a bit for most of them being killed off.To conclude...Sadly - the new Alien franchise is still plagued by moronic scientists and their decisions. It does affect the enjoyment of the story and significantly ruins the fun of even a casual movie goer.The cinematography was good for the most part (except the melee fight scene that was cut in a very disorientating way ... and hence looked pretty bad) Acting was alright - considering the only character that had sufficient time dedicated was David/Walter.In terms of being a sequel to Prometheus .... i went out of the cinema with a feeling that the 10 years that Covenant happens AFTER the events of Prometheus ... were probably MUCH more interesting than this new crew of no bodies.all in all 4/10 - not recommended - but possibly still a ""must see"" cause it is part of a franchise...",Alien - Covenant
310,jdhb-768-61234,Truly dreadful !,1,11 January 2020,"Rarely have I experienced such unmitigated tripe. In fact, to call ""Alien Covenant"" tripe is to be unfair to tripe; it's much, much worse than that.Supposedly mature and experienced space travellers behave like absolute morons, screaming, rushing around to little purpose, failing to take even the most rudimentary of safety precautions and generally making up the most ludicrous spaceship crew ever assembled; even the crew of ""Red Dwarf"" are more realistic than this lot of pathetic losers.Much of the 'action' is rehashed from the original ""Alien"", a film of immeasurably greater quality in all departments, and doesn't have the benefit of being in the least bit realistic, well acted or anything but an opportunity for showing quantities of blood and gore spewing out from back, front, head and any other available bodily part. Yes, some of the scenes could be considered scary but they have no context other than being scary; there is no coherent story within which to set them. The acting is formulaic, the dialogue mundane; the direction is all over the place. The special effects and cgi are mostly horribly obvious, unrealistic and awful.The original ""Alien"" was a brilliant groundbreaker and its sequel was also decent. Thereafter, they've rather gone downhill and ""Alien Covenant"" really is scraping the very bottom of the deepest imaginable barrel. On a scale of 1 to 10, this is a big fat ZERO; on a scale of 1 to a 100, it's still ZERO. Sadly, I have to give it 1 for my vote to count but that rating is given under the strongest of protests.",Alien - Covenant

Then there's the surprise twist ending, dah dah! - saw that one coming from a mile off I'm afraid.I'm giving it a 5 because I'm feeling generous having just sat through 90 minutes of Nicolas Cage's - Dog Eat Dog, believe me Alien: Covenant is a masterpiece compared to that crap.",Alien - Covenant

Great visuals, yes, but everything else is wrong, from the ridiculous story to the entire cast of misfits, none of whom is remotely believable. I could go on forever but what's the point. Everyone who reads the low ratings reviews knows what's going on here. Prometheus was bad but Covenant is an embarrassment. It reminds me of how Daniel Craig destroyed the Bond franchise: by turning everything Bond stood for upside down. The same is happening here. Alien was a masterpiece of suspense that kept you on the edge of your seat. With Covenant, it can't be over soon enough.

314,Inda_Rebel,Great follow up to Prometheus,8,26 March 2020,Great follow up. More of a linking movie to Prometheus than a direct follow up. More narrative is explained about mankind's origins in this film.Great Sci-Fi.,Alien - Covenant
315,drawlife,"Flawed, but nostalgic.",8,19 May 2017,"I really disliked Prometheus. While I appreciated the ideas it tried to convey, the execution was poor. It tried to be an exploratory adventure, but also tried to be a horror film, not knowing exactly what it wanted to be. It posed way too many questions and fell flat in doing so. Very disjointed and all over the place. Plus the characters were a total bore and one-noted. In Alien: Covenant, it's as if Fox and Ridley Scott knew of the outcry and decided to make the Prometheus sequel more like Alien, and to be honest, that washed away most of the sour taste I had. Look this movie is not perfect by any means, but the addition of that Alien flavor really put this film into higher gear. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the film. Of course there's trouble lurking around as the movie progresses. People get messed up in this film and it's gruesomely entertaining.Yes, the cast is absolutely expendable, but this time around I felt as though they were handled better. I think what really helped was the YouTube clip released prior, with the cast talking before they went into hyper sleep. The crew members in this movie are more likable than the crew members of Prometheus. Key crew members aboard on the Covenant ship include Katherine Waterston as Daniels, who is resourceful and probably the only one who makes the smartest decisions of the bunch. Yes she is a character that is inspired by Ripley, but Scott doesn't make that too obvious. I enjoyed Billy Crudup as Oram and Carmen Ejogo as Karine, who are both a couple in this film, and are calm and collected. Danny McBride is Tennessee, a wise cracking, cowboy hat wearing pilot. Something I expected was to see was the typical character McBride is known for playing on screen, but it turned out to be the opposite so it was refreshing to see him in this light. The highlight is Michael Fassbender as David and Walter. David is the synthetic android that returns from Prometheus and Walter is the new, advanced and sophisticated android helping out the Covenant crew. Fassbender's work in these duel roles are fascinating to watch. He brings different traits of personalities to them both as they interact. A lot of questions are still unanswered, some of which were teased at the end of Prometheus, but perhaps they'll be answered eventually. Yes the scientists make the same stupid mistakes, and yes there are some plot-holes, but Ridley Scott has rejuvenated my interest. At best Alien: Covenant plays out like a ""greatest hits"" or a cover to Alien and Aliens. While that might turn off some people, I found it to be nostalgic. 8/10",Alien - Covenant

David is such a fantastic character. And that ending scene - imagine the horror of her realizing it was David. My sister and I were screaming. I hope a third one comes out.",Alien - Covenant
317,M_Exchange,Disaster with a few glimmers of accidental brilliance,3,19 May 2017,"If this movie has a single glaring problem, it's that it takes the worst elements of '80s slasher horror and puts them in a couple of scenes. The most unpardonable moment in the film is when the David android thoroughly proves that he/it has a ghoulish fascination with biological weaponry and creating and befriending man-eating organisms, yet one of the characters follows him down a dark corridor alone. Anyone who has an I.Q. over 50 would outright refuse to follow that thing anywhere and/or destroy it immediately and/or call for assistance from the other crew members who were waiting nearby.There are also scenes in which the David character is very clearly aboard the ship, yet the crew just trusts that he is his ""safe"" android brother Walt and does not run any sort of test to verify that he is, in fact, Walt. Apparently the ship has enough technology to amplify and project a distorted image that randomly appeared on someone's helmet just by scanning the helmet, yet it can't detect subtle differences between androids. Or the crew is just too lazy to safeguard their lives. Kill me.In a movie that emphasizes that organisms are mostly interested in their survival and propagation, humanity seems to have little concern about its survival. But if humanity were as dumb as the characters that are in this movie, we probably wouldn't deserve to live anyway.Katherine Waterston was a revelation to me, though. She injects sexiness, charm and great acting into a film that should have had its script thrown into a bonfire long ago. I'm looking forward to her future roles.",Alien - Covenant
318,Sunsphxsuns,Thank You Ridley For Sharing Your Latest Creation With Us,9,20 May 2017,"Before the ""haters"" of Alien Covenant jump on this post in complete disagreement, please take a deep breath and try to untangle yourself from any preconceptions you may have towards the film you just saw. This is Ridley Scott on all 12 cylinders, unfiltered and unapologetic. Alien Covenant is high octane science fiction, like drinking a gallon of Red Bull. Beyond the adrenaline pace of the film, Covenant is artistic, disturbing, provocative, unrestrained, bursting with intelligence, meaningful aesthetics, philosophy, kindness, curiosity, life, death, and the concept of violent, perfect organisms, challenging our quest for human immortality.All that, and, of course, the anticipated reemergence of particularly aggressive, highly menacing, Alien life. Beautifully filmed we see layer upon layer of Ridley's vision unfold, and from the stunning opening scenes, you immediately grasp that Ridley has skillfully resurrected flashes of his visually haunting films like Blade Runner and Gladiator, weaving these elements into the essential dark themes of the collective Alien franchise. And it works, indeed, it works extremely well. Without leading you (the reader) into any significant spoilers, allow me to report that Alien Covenant is, without question, a very intense film, from the opening sequence, to the final moments before the credits roll. The acting is wonderful, believable, with vulnerable characters that convey what it must be like to have to deal with fear at close range (Danny McBride as the Covenant's Captain delivers a surprisingly touching performance). The story line is complex, and it would be useful to revisit Ridley's Prometheus before seeing Covenant as the two films are fairly intertwined. Not surprisingly, Alien Covenant is loaded with over the top creature effects, Xenomorphs, Face Huggers, and an array of new aliens, all of them visually beautiful and disturbing. Some of the scenes are extraordinarily graphic, so leave the kids at home with a sitter. My advice to those who have not yet seen Alien Covenant, come with an open mind and an equally open heart. And for those who feel this film didn't quite match up with your expectations, perhaps you need to give it a second viewing. I'm already looking forward to Scott's next installment. I praise this lone wolf filmmaker for providing another work of art that left me hungry for more of this dynamic and entertaining space drama. And Please Ridley, be generous with ""extras"" on the Blue Ray and DVD release. You've truly taken us where ""No man has gone before"" (and in reality we wouldn't ever want to go ""there"" in person no matter what futuristic weaponry you generously provide us). Ripley's 1979 ""Alien"" touted the phrase, ""In space, no one can hear you scream."" In the iPic theater last night there were all kinds of muffled screams and sudden yelps, so if you are a genuine fan of the Alien franchise you're going to thoroughly enjoy this newest entry. Ridley's bold follow up to Prometheus is perfectly executed, and but for a few uncharacteristic plot holes, you will find yourself discussing Alien Covenant long after you've left the theater.",Alien - Covenant
319,tstudstrup,Much better than Prometheus,4,10 February 2018,"Hear me out. I hate Prometheus. I absolutely hate it. And I still hate Ridley Scott for abusing his power in Hollywood to prevent Neil Blomkamp from making his direct sequel to Aliens. That having been said, Alien Covenant (despite being a sequel to the shitty Prometheus, only loved by wannabe-intellectual movie snobs, who hate Aliens and the whole franchise) is actually a good movie. Possibly Ridley Scotts first good movie since his original Alien. I am not a fan of Scotts movies. Except from Body of lies (which is more because I used to be a Leo fan) and Thelma and Louise, the man has made nothing but shitty movies. Including Gladiator and Blade Runner. However this movie cater to us fans that love Aliens. Despite the arrogant Scott denouncing Camerons masterpiece as well as all the other Alien sequels. This movie has the Xenomorphs, it has gory deaths, excellent special effects and great action. And it can be seen without having to suffer through Prometheus. It works as a stand alone movie, despite being a sequel. What it does lack is memorable characters making smart decisions. And that is just not good enough from Scott of all people. He should know better when he acts like a spoiled little boy who wont share his favorite toy (Alien) and wont recognize that other boys has bigger toys (talent) than him. We all know and love Ripley, Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez and Bishop in Aliens. In Covenant however, I cant remember a single characters name, nor did I care when they died horribly. Which means that Cameron way back in 1986, was a better director than Scott. And still would be if he stopped making those shitty Avatar sequels and returned to dark gritty violent scifi. The reason Covenant, only gets 4 stars, is because of Scotts arrogance. Which is shown when there is no alien queen. And the aliens themselves are ""man"" made. Or actually made by a synthetic, who has gone psycho. This is retarded. As well as the flute scene with two synthetics and the homo erotic kiss. Despite these things this movie is still much better than the abomination Alien 3. And the best alien movie since Alien 4. If you havent seen Prometheus and you just dont expect too much, Covenant is an enjoyable R-rated violent scifi movie, which is nice to see when all we get these years are PG13 superhero movies.",Alien - Covenant
320,ryanwinning1,I thought it was better than AVP!,8,25 March 2019,"Michael Fassbender steals the show. I came in expecting a real people vs aliens type of a plot, but was very entertained by how Michael plays the cyborg in this movie and brings about thought-provoking points about the evolution of artificial intelligence in general. Aside from that the acting is just ok, but there is some beautiful cinematography. Lots of jump scenes and I give the suspensefulness throughout an A+",Alien - Covenant
321,sanjin_9632,Probably the worst Alien movie ever.,5,27 June 2017,"This franchise should've ended a long time ago. OK, the first one's a classic, the second one was terribly trashy, the third one was better, but got butchered by the editors and producers. Resurrection was incredibly unnecessary. The Vs. predator films are mediocre at best and mostly copies of their predecessors. Prometheus actually surprised me by not being bad at all, while not really adding anything new to the story. Covenant is a complete miss.There are so many things wrong with Covenant, it's mind-blowing. I'm not really in the mood to go much into detail, because it's not worth the time or attention. 5.2/10",Alien - Covenant
322,nodlimax,Stay Away from this flick,1,25 February 2018,"Damn this movie is terrible. The story makes no sense - especially if you haven't watched Prometheus.The Aliens are more side characters. The ending is so damn predictable. Cutting away in essential moments pretty much already gives the major twist at the end away.The human cast is so forgettable I can't even remember their names and they all act extremely stupid. The major catastrophe after the first quarter of the movie could've easily been avoided if that woman wouldn't have run around in the ship screaming like a lunatic and pretty much hurting herself and destroying the ship.""But she was scared"" - you might say.Shouldn't these kind of crews be trained to handle stressful situations? And based on her husband ""she never gets scared"" - which is totally unbelievable based on her actions.",Alien - Covenant
323,quiqueperezsoler,Stunning and enthralling but too condescending and dumbed-down Alien entry that doesn't know where to push towards if Alien or Prometheus.,6,22 September 2020,"Ridley Scott delivers a stunning sci-fi horror keeping the aesthetic and many of the themes introduced in Prometheus but finding the verge from which to jump to themes and plot points better executed in the first two Alien movies. While the scenery, acting and special effects as well as the film direction were outstanding, this quality filmmaking may be in fact covering the unfortunate true facts about the movie: that it is condescending, weak in characterisation and flawed in many areas.While it retains Prometheus' tone and aesthetic at the beginning, it later develops themes and sequences more resonant of Alien. However, these tonal changes are too noticable and damage the overall tone as they may not be as thrilling or creative as their better-done counterparts in prior Alien movies. As if it was lacking the care and artistry provided by Alien's unique aesthetic which makes the entries of the franchise stand out from other sci-fi horrors.However, this matter is not the main issue fans and perhaps audiences may find in it. The characters make almost always the worst possible decisions. While the better Alien movies use circumstance and characterisation to guide the decisions each character makes that eventually lead to a mistake or a certain outcome, in this case the characters almost never showcase any sense of control or decision-making process.The less important characters are allowed to be dumbed-down and less aware of their surroundings, but the main protagonists have no initiative or personality at all. Ripley was by the books, focused, worried about the crew and always keeping in mind her training in basic quarantine procedures and other issues. However, in this film some character says ""shouldn't we put her in quarantine"" and the other says ""no"" one or two times and the first character stops insisting. In Alien, Ripley doesn't let Kane get in, insisting they should respect quarantine procedures. Even if the emotional bond of the crew gets the best out of the situation at least we, the audience, have witnessed Ripley show a level of awareness that is real and therefore we resonate with it.And this, in my opinion, is the greatest flaw of the movie, the characters are poorly written. They are given these backstories by ""pairing them up"" and the actors actually deliver a believable and fantastic performance. But these are devoid of emotional weight due to the fact that we need more time to appreciate their relationships and interactions with each other. Heck, I didn't even know ALL of them were couples, I was told by the trailer later on when I decided to check it but they are so one-dimensional I feel no sadness when they get killed. The movie focuses too much on using the characters as a vessel for the true plot points the movie actually wants to develop (these are too spoilery to debate, however, so I'll leave it at that).Had the movie taken the time to build relationship and allow for friendly bantering or character interactions more often, we would have understood better the driving forces of each character and therefore felt their demise or subsequent triumph. In Aliens, each character had their few scenes to flesh them out properly if only in a quite campy-yet-effective way. We saw them interact and react to circumstances and then when the danger arrived we could understand what would drive them to make the decisions they ended up making. However, in this film the characters are mere pawns to be killed with no meaningful outcome for any of the other characters except loss.The movie feels pretentious. It is constructed with this shell or facade of such great scenery, shots and concepts that we are oblivious to what is really going on underneath. Should the script to this movie would be read out loud or converted into a novel, without the filmmaking taken into account, the story would be so condescending, especially on the role of a particular character in the movie, that it is insulting to Alien fans.Another downside I felt this movie had, and perhaps it is due to the fact I began watching the Alien movies this year for the first time and my favorite ones are Alien, Aliens and Prometheus; was the soundtrack. It is unimpactful and average. I remember in Prometheus or on the first movies, when the engineers spaceship or any other great ""reveal"" happened, the music would elevate the scene or shot by increasing the trademarked ""horn"" sound, maintaining a tense and never ending thrilling music to add tension to the scenes. In this movie, the first half of it which contains the more quieter and mystery-building moments of the movie have very unimpressive music. Perhaps this and other faults I find in the movie may be attributed to the fact that this may be my first viewing of this movie, but when I saw Prometheus and the first Alien movies, I swore I was amazed and enthralled by every single aspect of it on first viewing. And judging by the matching opinions with other Alien fans, it encouraged me to trust my instincts and first impression of this film.The reason why I believe most of the people that liked the movie liked it is because it is genuinely a good sci-fi horror movie but a bad Alien movie. It bares no resemblance to the first Alien movies whose gap it's trying to merge with. And it lacks the layers, concepts and world-building masterclass of Prometheus, making it an inferior sucessor floating in a void of average sequels of a great franchise.I'd venture to say this time it was the fans' fault for not giving Ridley Scott time to develop Prometheus' introduced themes and concepts more in depth. I believe the next entry of Alien was meant to continue where things were left off in Prometheus. However, fan outcry for the lack of Xenomorphs in its antecessor ""forced"" Ridley Scott to make a ""time jump"" to create a story that would merge the gap between Alien and Prometheus so the timeline wouldn't be messed up. In the end, a considerably rushed work resulted in a pile of incredibly well done horror scenes and filmmaking concepts ruined by a bland predictable script that focused too much in giving the audience a ""good time"" rather than challenge them to think and ask questions, honouring the Alien franchise's brand of quality complex sci-fi horror themes.IN CONCLUSION, I'd say, should you take away the ""Alien"" word from the title crawls I believe it is a perfectly engaging Sci-fi survival horror. But between the Alien callback themes of ""checking out a distress signal from an uncharted place"" etc.; the already dated CGI of the creatures (after only 3 years) and the poorly written characters devoid of charisma; this film falls down in the list of Alien movies. Movies which, while awful at times, dared to tackle complex themes and horror tropes while still maintaining a unique and I'd say trademarked aesthetic that makes them stand out from the other thousands of the same genre. We'll have to wait until Ridley Scott's next entry to see how eveything turns out in the end. On the mean time, go check out ""Alien: Isolation"", it's a survival horror game featuring Ripley's daughter going to search for her mum; and it is terrifyingly engaging",Alien - Covenant
324,midge56,another Ridley alien holocaust,4,19 August 2017,"Clearly, Ridley never learns. He just cannot get off of his one note tune. In every movie, the crew has a tough woman survivor, a black, a smoker (usually cigars), a drinker, a dumb loudmouth, a couple lowbrow idiots wanting to get rich, a robot sadist and swarms of horrific massacres & bloody gore from the never ending aliens & ship destruction. They never have a second lander. Only one. They never use good sense about wearing protection against viruses & contaminants.He almost got it right on Prometheus where we actually thought we were going to see another planet with civilized intelligent alien life, explanations & interacting. Instead the ET's were all dead except one who wanted to destroy everyone without explanation. Then Ridley brought out the alien creatures for the usual gore & left us hanging. Of course, there are rarely more than one or two crew survivors plus the alien creature.On this movie, he went back to his usual formula of swarms of bloody gory, attacking horrific aliens & ignorant crew members who shouldn't be driving a soap box peddle car, much less a multibillion dollar spaceship with thousands of colonists. Even our poor 1960's space crews met better qualifications as a respectable space crew. Who would hire such ignorant morons for a space crew? The only difference was the white slob was the loudmouth hick in control this time instead of the loudmouth, cigar smoking, alcohol drinking black slob in charge. But the same character & cast formulas are used on EVERY movie he made. They are just as illogical now as they were then. No one would allow a crew like this to have responsibility for the welfare of Billions of dollars of spacecraft & personnel.After you learn that David is another Dr Frankenstein, you can fast forward to the end past all the bloody gore from mind-numbing creature attacks from every possible method.Once more, we were cheated from meeting intelligent alien societies & learning what they knew about us & the horrible alien creatures who should be dead & gone so we wont have to see them anymore. And we need a robot for once which doesn't consider humans as a way to experiment with the alien creatures. You almost had a good robot this time but let the bad robot kill him. We need a peaceful, happy sci-fi without attacks & gore. Get rid of David & his 2 creature eggs. Have Walter brought on the ship for spare parts, come back to life & destroy David & the eggs. Fix the hand while you are at it.Allow them to land to colonize a new planet & meet new civilized EBE's & learn how to live in harmony on their new planet. No more alien creatures except to destroy the planet where David bred them.We need a happy movie with no more gore and no more alien creatures, no psychotic robots, battles & holocausts. Let's see our smart engineers, colonists, scientists, etc., build a new colony & live in peace with new intelligent civilizations & learn harmony of living without pollution or wars from our new neighbors. A colony of smart humans. No smoking, no drinking, no porn, no loudmouths, no fighting, no polluters, no killers, no haters and NO Alien creatures or violence. BTW, I live in Dallas (also Houston & SA) and NO ONE wears cowboy hats except JR Ewing on TV & a couple drop out farmers in west TX. They also bathe, comb their hair & shave. Ridley is out of Date with one tune stereotypes.We'd like to see use of sci-fi special effects to thaw & grow embryonic livestock & plants & people. Creating a new utopia society. We can watch them solve problems, learn to communicate, learn to deal with new diseases & animals they encounter, etc. We don't need more alien blood & gore & slaughters. We need happy sci-fi, high tech, intelligent life, positive achievement & new pleasant interactions with other EBE civilizations. No violence, no wars, no ghoulish creatures or deaths. If Ridley can't do this, then he needs to get out of making films. This is the last straw! We gave him every chance but we have had enough. We are SICK of it. NO MORE ALIEN BLOOD BATHS or HOLOCAUSTS.Either change completely or STOP making alien movies. NO MORE ONE NOTE Plots. ARE you listening to us, Ridley? Are you deaf & blind? Can't you see how we have reached our limit & our patience? We only gave you another chance because you Almost got it with Prometheus, but you still used the formula Characters, destroyed the ship, brought out the alien gore & left the audience hanging with no ending.This movie was supposed to fix those mistakes. Instead, Ridley did everything wrong in the worst way possible. Instead of getting rid of the creatures; he created an onslaught of creatures massacring the crew & the former inhabitants. It was sickening! Even fast forward wasn't enough to relieve the creature massacres of people.If Ridley doesn't see this problem, he must be suffering from dementia. If he wont fix this, then he needs to get out. We've had enough. No more alien holocausts. Ever!",Alien - Covenant

326,moorek,Good but not an Alien movie,5,10 January 2019,"Alien movies are usually at their core, horror movies. The first movie was basically an inescapable haunted house with a monster chasing you. Over time there has been a background mythology build up but it remains primarily a horror movie.This does not fit that mold. Much of what we see does not fit the mythology as we know it. It has more in common with the Island of Doctor Moreau than previous Alien movies. That's the only way to explain all the Alien variations.Having said that, if you watch the movie as a science fiction movie not related to the Alien franchise then it is not bad. Falling somewhere between a B and A quality movie.The first act is good basic sci-fi while the second has some elements of that. The main act is the mad scientist but the finale is telegraphed far too much ahead.The main plot flows although somewhat convoluted. Sadly many of the minor plot points make no sense. Many of the decisions made by what would have been a hand-picked crew make no sense. The new Captain is basically incompetent. Hard to have ever pictured him as a senior officer anywhere. The people who look to be trained soldiers are anything but trained. No logical processes that we would use today like carrying med kits, using protective gear with an unknown pathogen, no quarantine. A space pilot and mechanic who comes across tough in one scene only to panic in another and start shooting in her own ship which blows it up.The acting was only passable for most of these folks. Hard to feel sympathy for any of them. Most could not bring across a performance that matched their role. I wouldn't follow any of those in command anywhere. The exception is of course
Michael Fassbender. Whenever he was in a scene then it was something worth watching..If you go into this as a non-Alien movie then it is okay to watch once. As an Alien movie, it is just bad and doesn't follow any story line continuity.",Alien - Covenant

328,eparazak,"It's pretty mixed all around, but definitely frightening!",7,26 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant is the latest installment to the Alien franchise and is directed by Ridley Scott who worked on the original Alien and Prometheus. It is about a crew known as Covenant who traces an unknown signal from an unknown planet that is believed to be safe and while doing so, they run into some danger as those alien creatures begin to pop out.Like the franchise's many predecessors, this movie is pretty dang scary. It becomes suspenseful during certain points that you wouldn't necessarily expect. If you're into gore and blood, this is definitely the type of movie for you as it offers a lot of it. I'm serious, the movie can get pretty vile during some points, it's pretty insane. I could really feel the pain of the characters who had to deal with the aliens. Out of all of the characters, I found David to be the most interesting one. I just like how he is this cyborg, which helps in some interesting ways such as giving him an interesting connection to the aliens.My biggest flaw I have with this movie is that while it has some good twists and plot points, I don't think the movie went too in- depth on them. They just bring the viewers questions that beg an answer. I did find the story somewhat interesting because of these twists and plot points, but it felt a little too basic, and I found the characters okay, but not very strong.I found this movie to be pretty decent as a stand alone movie. As an overall Alien movie, it would depend more on a fan's perspective of the movie.

This film is proof that somebody in the room should raise their hand in the pre-production meetings when an obvious turkey is being prepped for the oven. Reputations will suffer. Maybe he or she did and got fired. Who knows. At least it was an honorable way to go. Guy Pearce must have seen something suspicious -- like the script -- because his role is uncredited.

What makes this film worse is that it was indeed directed by Ridley Scott, the director of the original Alien film, oh what have you done dear Ridley have you seen how atrocious your talents have become?Let's start with the weak, I've seen it all before, plot. The ship ""Covenant"" carrying quite a number of settlers who will make this new, perfect world they are travelling to their home, are sadly escorted by the worst most abysmal crew possible.You guessed it, there had to be a snag that takes the crew off course, this being a homing beacon originating from a nearby planet, a planet that appears to be quite the paradise. Yes the crew, abandoning their mission altogether have to investigate..., but upon arrival the planet isn't what it appears to be, danger lurks around every corner and before long, they are swamped by a swarm of xenomorphs (or aliens to you and me). Fighting for their lives, the crew are lead ""gallantly"" by Daniels (Katherine Waterston) who appears to be out of her depth both character wise and in real life.Ahh yes, and after wondering for nearly an hour where Michael Fassbender was, alas the man pops up over half way through the film, coming to the aid of the Covenants crew, or was he?The only positive I can take from Alien:Covenant was the double act Michael Fassbender was pulling, playing both David and Walter, these scenes seemed carefully scripted and was well acted. Was Alien: Covenant deemed to fail from the very beginning, as the second film in a proposed trilogy, it was a serious step down from the much better ""Prometheus"", and it begs the question if the second film was this bad, what will the second and last film be like, it has got to go some way to be worse than Alien: Covenant.If you're going to watch this film, please go in with your expectations drastically lowered or you'll be left sorely disappointed.",Alien - Covenant

So, they made sure to put a lot of masala in this one. By masala, I mean the scenes directly taken from the first 4 alien movies which we loved, the ones which made us jump with surprise. Alien Covenant is a follow-up after Prometheus. 2 prologues were released to connect the two film more appropriately, which I will suggest you watch before you go for this one, to connect the dots. The movie is about a colonization ship which is going to a planet but the crew decides to check a different planet first, from which a mysterious signal is being received. I like Prometheus unlike many of my friends as they missed the ""Alien"" touch in it. So, when we saw Covenant with all the ""masala"", they loved it. For me, the best part is Michael Fassbender's, David. It makes the film more interesting and brings depth to it. With his appearance, you start asking questions like, what happened to Dr. Shaw? What he's been up to till now? Does he still have 'issues' with humanity? The ending is quite intriguing and builds curiosity.

334,DVR_Brale,"Bizarre, occult and filled with sophistry",4,21 May 2017,"Is Ridley Scott one of those people who believes pronouncing complex words alone can yield something reasonable? Probably. Alien: Covenant is up-to-the-top filled with nonsensical quasi-scientific, religious and cultural gibberish. Those apparently sophisticated conversations are on display from the very beginning to the very end.First two Alien movies were sci-fi horror in their core; mysterious and unnerving. There is no single scene in Covenant which could justify it as a horror. Yes, there are few unnecessary bloody alien births; and that's it. Young audiences are turned on to everything which has ""horror"" written on it and very naive in their perception of it. So the only reason why ""horror"" tag is put on it's IMDb page is to attract those ignorant of early Alien movies.Covenant is a drama with many occult elements. It's no secret that Ridely Scott always used many religious elements in his movies (Alien series as well), but this one is over the top. Even one of the trailers has been given the title ""Last Supper"" (take a look at the picture no. 66 on Covenant's IMDb page and tell me you can't recognize something familiar at first glance). That's not strange given the information that Covenant is largely influenced by H.R. Giger's work. But to saturate the entire movie with eugenics and some kind of religious nonsense says something about Ridely Scott: he's no longer interested in making movies for the sake of the audiences. He went in purely ideological way and used ""Alien"" as means to it. Or is he being used by Hollywood?It's unnecessary to mention that production quality generally is really good. That's Ridley's field and there he knows what he's doing. But how is it possible that the original alien monster looks much better than this CGI alien? At least there are a couple of really promising scenes. Unfortunately, all of them are cut short with Ridley's strange need to keep the sophistry rolling. What about crew members? I don't recall seeing more stupid and incompetent group of people. If you've seen Daniel Espinosa's ""Life"" you know what I'm saying. These top scientists and engineers literally defy all principles of common sense and logic. There's even a Christian on board! Too bad he behaves like a zealot and quotes Jesus out of every context imaginable. Maybe script writers should have taken basic religion class?Sounding sophisticated while accomplishing nothing is what Ridley Scott apparently does the best. This movie is unworthy to be titled as it's predecessors.",Alien - Covenant
335,Mikelikesnotlikes,Film student reshoots scenes from previous Alien movies to make bad Homage,5,7 July 2017,"I was deeply disappointed, almost from the beginning of the film. It was so damn slow. This is a horror movie, and as such you would expect some sort of tension to mount, which doesn't.Another reviewer did a great job of listing the ridiculousness of each characters poor decisions made throughout this film, so I won't redo that. It's enough to say these decisions were so far from plausible that I totally divorced myself from the premise of the film by the midway mark.The characters were so forgettable. No charisma, no special characteristics, nothing to make them stand out as either spectacularly smart or stupid. It was as though casting were asked for grey people so the director could manipulate them into the character he wanted. Stuff like this is only forgivable from a first time director feeling his way.Overall the film felt like a committee effort. A bunch of film students asked to retell the original trilogy. And the disjointed result with its poor CGI (Oh God the exploding lander was soooo 80's era), zero suspense and choppy post-production would have been explainable.Very sad day for the Alien franchise.",Alien - Covenant
336,trimbolicelia,Alien: Covenant,6,17 April 2018,"OK, where do I start? First off I don't own a DVD or Blu-Ray of this film, I saw it on cable. The effects are brilliant, but I have a beef on one of the effects which I will go into later. I also read the movie tie-in book which gives one a more in-depth look into the history of the time and people. The passengers, both awake and in stasis, are on their way to terra-form and colonize a planet they hope will give them a brand new start in life. The main and usually only reason people are colonizing a new territory is because of overcrowding and overuse of resources. The book suggests that. Now off humans go to overuse the resources of another planet. The book also says that the states in the United States are no more. In other words the US is just one full entity. Sort of takes the identity from all us Americans. The crew don't even remember the states. I guess American history is no longer taught. It appears that the Weyland-Futani company is the most important thing on Earth. Then there is David. If there is ever a reason not to give robots and androids, if they are ever created, any autonomy he is the prime example. A highly disturbed creation made by a highly disturbed creator. All he does is commit atrocities. He destroys the inhabitants of the planet he is on. Probably a colony themselves of the Engineers from the film Prometheus. Then he obviously either killed Dr. Shaw or, more horribly, tortured her to death. Now he is going to control the fate of the colonists. Now my beef about the effects. As I said the effects are excellent. The Neomorphs are disturbing and disgusting, but the full Alien is disappointing. It is obviously CG effects. What made the Alien so frightening in the first film is its fiendish and sadistic intelligence, but also its movements. Yes, it was an actor in a monster suit, but that made its movements believable as sort of a humanoid. So this movie is OK but Ridley Scott can't seem to recapture the mood, tension and creeping doom of the first film. Also the first and second films had a hopeful end. All the subsequent films don't. Still, recommended for Alien film fans.",Alien - Covenant

338,makleen2,A Messy Prequel-Sequel,5,29 September 2017,"Alien: Covenant (2017) stars Katherine Waterston as a colony ship scientist named Daniels, and Michael Fassbender, who plays dual roles as two androids named David and Walter, in a sci-fi horror film and the latest installment in the Alien franchise. It was directed by Ridley Scott and written by John Logan and Dante Harper. John Logan is an accomplished screen writer, but this was Dante Harper's first screenplay. Michael Green (of Sex and the City and Green Lantern) and Jack Paglen are credited with writing the story.So many different writers is probably why Alien: Covenant felt like so many different films. It was supposed to be a sequel to Prometheus (2012), but often felt like a reboot of Alien (1979). Minus the events on the planet's surface, Alien: Covenant was basically an updated version of the original. It flirted with its roots as a horror film, but lacked tension and suspense.Alien: Covenant begins in a sterile room with Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) and his synthetic creation, David. They muse on the nature of creation before the film shifts to the colonization ship Covenant, which is heading toward a remote planet, Origae-6. A neutrino burst damages the ship as it is recharging, killing some colonists as well as the ship's captain, Jacob Branson (James Franco). The crew wakes up and Christopher Oram (Billy Crudup) takes command. While making repairs, pilot Tennessee Faris (Danny McBride) hears a strange signal. The crew tracks the signal to a nearby planet and decides to investigate.There they find the ruins of an ancient civilization, a crashed ship, and one survivor: David. After a few of the landing party die from a mysterious biological weapon, the survivors gradually discover David was not only responsible for the deaths of the planet's former inhabitants, but also the creation of a dangerous xenomorph. A xenomorph manages to get onto the colony ship, with the usual results. Eventually, Daniels, a '90s tomboy (ala Single White Female) and the remaining crew members trap the creature and eject it into space.If Alien: Covenant was just a reboot of the 1979 original, it would have been much better. The space scenes were even terrifying at times. Unfortunately, the effort to shoehorn this movie into a Prometheus sequel fell flat. The plot was convoluted and nonsensical. It completely ignored franchise cannon and was, frankly, boring. The film's run time was over two hours. Cutting at least 30 minutes could have greatly improved it, especially from the opening scenes. No one watches an Alien movie to be treated to a philosophical treatise on the nature of creation.In the original Alien, as well as its immediate sequels, the audience assumes the alien xenomorphs are just some terrifying life form encountered in deep space. It spoke to human fears of the unknown. No one was asking for a convoluted origin story. Part of what makes these creatures so terrifying is how little we know about them. Any origin story, let alone one as Baroque as this, undermines that.There were some highlights, including genuinely disturbing and terrifying scenes. Danny McBride added much needed color and liveliness to the film. His was the only character that wasn't morose, depressed, and dispassionate. Despite some unfair comparisons between Katherine Waterston and Sigourney Weaver, I thought she gave a solid performance. Overall, Alien: Covenant could have benefited from liberal editing, but is thrilling enough for a Friday night on the couch.",Alien - Covenant

342,Exiled_Universe,BEST ALIEN FILM IN THE FRANCHISE AND PROBABLY EVER MADE!!!,8,4 June 2019,"WOW, this movie was incredible. Something that i noticed is that the movies got better and better as they progressed. For example the first alien was the worst and the last alien, alien covenant, was the best. It is more action with new aliens, fight scenes, lots of guns, and for the most part nonstop action. Also the films turned to more action as the films went along. The story and characters were phenomenal. I would not mind watching this again. Usually the most i can rate an alien film is a 7 because if it is gonna be 8 or higher it has to have action like terminator of hitman but this one gets a pass for how well done this movie played out in the end. The aliens in this movie are scary and cool and the cast is great. It could be boring at some times like any other alien film. During the last 30 mins in where the action begins and things really start to kick off. Great film and im glad that the one and only Ridley Scott brought back the classic big chap xenomorph once again on the big screen and possible for generations to come.",Alien - Covenant

344,tyson-hunsaker,"Although disconnected to the original, a solid and candidly frightening sci-fi horror directed well.",7,27 May 2017,"Alien Covenant has a the distinct advantage of connecting Prometheus to the Alien franchise and offering familiar scares in still a frightening way. Ridley Scott returns to the Alien franchise and continues the story where Prometheus left off (somewhat). The most important thing to realize about this new addition to the Alien canon is that while it connects to and builds on Prometheus, it doesn't tie directly to the original Alien and sets up for yet again, another sequel that will most likely run the franchise completely dry. Honestly I was expecting (and hoping for) one single story that would directly connect Prometheus and Alien which would've rendered a more satisfying story.That being said, Alien Covenant on its own is a very solid sci-fi horror film that felt thrilling to watch. Scott directs this movie with some clear precision and beautiful cinematography. The tone seems to blend seamlessly between Prometheus and Alien. Just enough sci-fi intrigue and thought-provoking themes while being true to what Alien is: horror. The pacing on point with the exception of a few minor scenes in the middle which throw the rhythm off but besides those, the pacing sets the speed for the horror and progression of the story. Performances were excellent all across the board. Unfortunately, the audience isn't treated to James Franco's captain hardly at all due to events near the beginning. Everyone shines and while the crew members feel expendable at times, we do indeed grow to character's due to their ""special someone"" biting the dust. This allows essential emotional impact for the horror that's exciting to experience. Overall, Alien Covenant was good. Not the best for definitely a great film for what it was and what I wanted it to be. Although it doesn't take the franchise in new directions, it offers genuine scares and excellent direction. It's easily rewatchable and an exciting new film from Ridley Scott. Definitely check this one out and it most likely will not disappoint.",Alien - Covenant
345,trevor-82944,Being a Human No Longer Sounds So Appealing,3,19 May 2017,"A human eye fills the screen.A voice asks, ""How do you feel?""An A.I. portrayed by Michael Fassbender (12 Years a Slave, Steve Jobs) obeys his creator's commands in a pale-white room, looking out onto a gorgeous mountain range. His human ""father"" monologues about his ambition to discover where we came from; since there must be more out there past our own present knowledge. No music plays, just the cold voices of these two men with no real blood in their veins. Fassbender delivers a robotic performance appropriate to his character's emotionless state, offering what we expect by now from his two Oscar nominations.Once the familiar opening title slowly dissolves into frame, Ridley Scott has concluded perhaps the most meticulously crafted opening of his long career. But once Alien: Covenant gets the ball rolling, no artistry sustains as he straight-up abandons those crucial points about existentialism.Then we meet a crew transporting 2,000 human embryos to another sector to house future generations (basically Interstellar). Good luck trying to keep track of everyone, as they each have too little likability to give a hoot. Take out the government-funded mission, and their maturity levels would make you believe they were teenagers. Do not even bother asking me to point out the lead protagonist, because I am stumped; my guess goes to Katherine Waterston, (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Inherent Vice) who to be fair is pretty solid in her performance. She may be the closest thing to ""Ellen Ripley"" we got here, yet she never causes enough action to entertain both men and women. Sorry ladies, no female empowerment to be found here.We now made it to the eighth installment of the Alien franchise; Ridley Scott gladly back on the helm. You'd think after thirty-eight years, he should know by now that the future may see different racial struggles not predominantly ruled by White heroes. Nope! He calls too much attention to the White actors while all other ethnicities fall victim to the alien invasion problem started by government-funded programs.However, Scott also successfully brought the franchise back to its refreshing hard R-rating like in the early days, even if he sometimes abuses his creative freedom. (Some unnecessary sex foreplay in the shower comes to mind) Otherwise, 20th Century Fox fulfills its promise: after a crew member touches a spore, he goes coughing in his own blood.But beyond the intense gore, every ""scary"" moment mishandles the tiresome scare tactics we are sick of by now: jump scares, throwing us into the killer's perspective, an annoying girl runs away while tripping over her own two feet, etcetera.Thus, the best moments take place within the planet's familiar yet evocative greenish mountain views, disguised behind a dense fog. In moments that utilize the atmosphere to tell the story, anyone can sense the contrast between man and alien. Deep inside an abandoned ribcage- shaped ship, Fassbender's A.I. lives. Although the crew keeps a similar version of this same A.I., correspondingly played by the same Fassbender. As the cybernetic twins bond through a flute lesson, they generate most human moment in Ridley Scott's desire to alter society.Too bad though, his continued exploration of man's relationship with technology has no proper footing inside our own reality; these themes seem too stuck in 1979 to strike fear into our hearts. While the added concept of intergalactic recolonization works to its advantage, other recent films, simply put, explored it better, such as Scott's recent instant-classic, The Martian. It seems nobody behind this talky sequel/prequel to Prometheus/Alien could settle on whether to put together a straight-forward horror flick or a psychological metaphor on Trump's immigration ban, so it instead varies scene-by-scene.So why care about humanity's near-extinction? Sounds like way more fun to be a Xenomorph!",Alien - Covenant
346,c-kelsall,The alien canon is not yet moribund,8,13 May 2017,"**MAY CONTAIN NONSENSE**Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle, if that wasn't the best Alien film since Aliens. Yes, I really mean that. It's definitely my third- favourite film in the 'Alien'franchise. In many cases, that would sound like sarcasm, or at best faint praise. However, Alien and Aliens are hard acts to follow in the sci-fi/action/horror genre. Alien: Covenant treads a careful path between advancing the story arc set in place by Prometheus, but stylistically tuning into Alien. In my view, it does both in sufficient measure to be lauded on both counts. This was never going to be an easy balance to maintain after the relative mis-fire that was Prometheus. So what's the story here? I'm going to assume you've seen Prometheus. You have, haven't you? Very well, then, read on... We left the survivors of Prometheus intending to pilot the 'Engineers'' spaceship, complete with complement of enigmatic bioweapon on board, to destroy the Engineers on their home world. Elizabeth Shaw, one of these survivors (in fact the only human survivor), was hoping to sell some top quality chocolates to them, but David said no. Alien: Covenant, meanwhile, starts off with an expedition 10 years later to a different planet, over 7 years' flight time away from Earth. The ship encounters a destructive neutrino burst en route, resulting in the crew being ejected from hypersleep to deal with the damage. While repairing the solar sails, one of the crew intercepts a garbled signal from space, which it turns out is coming from a nearby planet. Mysteriously, the ship's astronomical data had the target colony world as the nearest habitable planet, yet here they are being informed that this much nearer planet is more promising. The captain died in the accident, the crew don't fancy going into hypersleep again, and the acting captain wants to investigate the source of the signal. The rest, as they say, is history.... There are many things to like about this film, if you're into the genre. If you're not, why are you even bothering to read this review, or any of the others? Anyway, the exposition was nicely handled, and any failure to comprehend the link between Prometheus and Alien is yours, not Ridley Scott's. Similarly the action. My one beef regarding effects would be where CGI was used to update the chestburster scenario - it NEVER looks as good as the original effects when done well; see my review on The Thing (the modern prequel) for more on the same topic. However, it was a minor negative which didn't mar my enjoyment too much. Characterisation was a bit cardboard overall, but when most of the characters are disposable meat (and you just know that they are going to be, so let's not pretend you were hoping for more) it hardly seems to matter. Style over substance, that's my bag. Seriously, though, the characters who matter are the ones who get the chance to show they have one, by surviving longer. Perhaps there were just too many people for us to get to know them all properly, which wasn't a problem in Alien, but was handled to some extent in Aliens with a longer run time and substituting complex story-telling with character interaction and dialogue. If what you really want is not to be able to tell who's going to live and who isn't, then Alien: Covenant isn't going to do that so well. It does tend toward the predictable, but I was having too good a time being carried along by some good old-fashioned action to worry about it. I'm now dying to see where they're going to go with it.",Alien - Covenant

I don't think they intended it to be funny, but we laughed a lot. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the film - that will always happen for me when there are so many stupid characters who do dumb things and therefore end up dead.The whole movie plotline wouldn't have even existed if not for one very idiotic decision early on that set the spaceship on an unplanned course. ""Oh yeah, let's go check out this mysterious planet that is just PERFECT, but that we somehow never found before when we scanned everywhere for suitable planets."" The captain was warned not to divert from the planned course, but he just took it under advisement and went ahead anyway and did a dumb-arse thing.So, that set the tone for the entire movie - lots of stupid decisions, like ""Oh I'm just gonna go do a pee, I won't be long."" YEAH RIGHT. YOU WILL BE VERY LONG. YOU WON'T BE COMING BACK FROM THAT PEE.Basically I was disappointed, particularly thinking about the original movies and how epic they were. And I'm sorry, but this new ""bad-ass lady"" character can't hold a candle to Ripley.",Alien - Covenant
349,J-bot6,Recycling and rail-jumping,6,29 August 2018,"** Spoilers follow **What can I say that's good about this film? Well, the aspect ratio was good. And if you look at some of the shots as still-frames, they look well-composed. The lighting's good in most instances. And the ending is pretty neat. By that I mean the last ten minutes of the film. Now for the problems in this film. First and most obvious (to me anyway) is the camera that the DOP opted to use. I'm not sure if more than one spec of camera captured the material for this movie but there are quite a few shots that look like high-resolution home video. It appears to be a frame-rate issue (and no I wasn't watching it on one of those horrid high-frame-rate televisions). Note to future film-makers, please do tests to determine if you're getting a 'home video look' to your shots. And if so, find a way to avoid it (whether through a different camera selection or using some kind of film-look filter... or better yet, shooting on actual film). The next issue is the music. There are sections of score that call back to the score for the 1979 film. However, they're placed in scenes in which they just don't match up. Then there are new pieces of score that sound like excerpts from Star Trek Voyager. Either way, it doesn't suit the material here.Characters are the next item to address. Similar to Prometheus, there are miscellaneous crew characters that are both flat and borderline silly. In this motion picture, many of them conduct themselves in an unbelievably unprofessional manner. It puts me in mind of the conduct you'd expect from a bunch of campers in a budget slasher horror flick.Then there's the plot and the timeline -- neither of which make any sense in the context of the original 1979 feature. We know that the events of Prometheus take place around thirty years before the events of Alien. And we know that the events in Covenant take place from that time through to about twenty years prior to the events depicted in the 1979 film. However, it was clearly established that the Space Jockey in Alien had been in the chair long enough that it had fossilized. Its ribs were burst outwards and the familiar leathery large eggs were already in the ship. So we can already conclude that the eggs on the ship in Alien and the death of the Space Jockey had taken place thousands of years ago -- if not millions of years prior to the discovery of the ship by the crew of the Nostromo. The idea of David being the one who completed the development of the genetic engineering of the bio-weapon into the form of the Alien that we see in the 1979 motion picture is simply not possible considering the time-frame. Further complicating this is the concept of the facial structure and bulk of the Space Jockey being a suit worn by a large humanoid (as proposed in Prometheus). Again, this doesn't match up with the position of the ribs of the Space Jockey in Alien. I'm surprised that the writers didn't instead go with the concepts laid out in the Dark Horse graphic novels that followed the film Aliens.Even if we were to go with the idea that it is a large humanoid in a suit then we have to deal with some other questions raised by Covenant: If in fact they are such an advanced race, then how is it that they wouldn't include some form of authentication for vessels of their own that approach their home-world? How is it possible that their planetary defense system consists solely of a single shield? Where are the rest of their ships? For a space-faring race, how is it that ships from other worlds that they have very likely explored are not returning to investigate the crisis on their home-world? Are we to believe that no distress signal was ever sent from their home planet in response to being bombarded by their own bio-weapons? It just seems like the details weren't thoroughly thought out. And this seems to be a recurring problem in modern film-making -- especially when dealing with prequels and sequels.Next on the list is the use of recycled lines from other films (including Alien and Blade Runner). Now I'm not sure what secret screenplay writing manual instructs writers to recycle lines as some supposedly clever way to tie a new script into an existing one but I have news for whomever believes that. It doesn't work. Recycling lines is a sure-fire way to cheapen both the original film that's being referenced and the new film -- all in one go. It isn't clever and it comes across as juvenile.Creature design is another issue. Although I suspect that the idea of making monkey-aliens is supposed to suggest to the audience that there's a primitive stage right before the official Alien stage in the creature design, it unfortunately ends up looking ridiculous. The crazed little monkey-aliens running and jumping around are more comical than creepy and turn the scenes into something akin to slapstick.Finally, I have to mention the scenes that just don't seem to fit the tone of Alien. These include the flute-playing lessons and the aforementioned mini-alien antics in the wheat field. And if we go back to the previous film (Prometheus), there are the scenes that include the crew-member talking to a snake alien like it's a cute pet, the two guys howling in the hallways in an attempt to anthropomorphise their mapping spheres, and the very silly head exploding scene in the laboratory. Keeping consistency of tone is what's really hurt this series of films. It was very apparent starting with Alien Resurrection and carried right through to Covenant. It's unfortunate because a sophisticated and well-designed film like Alien really deserves better.",Alien - Covenant

Anybody with tiny biology background or a brain can know that this is frankly impossible.Also the movie is so highly predictable from the middle on that even the ending is far from surprising.Michael Fassbinder is doing a fantastic job again and even Danny McBride is doing a decent one, but you can't beat a trash script. I really hope that they are going to terminate the alien series for good. In the end, only Alien and Aliens are great movies.Also as noticeable with other movies that were supposed to be blockbusters, but fell flat - there are top reviews with 10 points made by account with in extreme cases only this review.

So curiosity, after watching the trailer, had us attracted to watch this movie; and also the need to get the unsolved questions raised in Prometheus.The action takes place 10 years after the previous movies and where we see the magic equation from the old alien movies: a crew going somewhere and receiving an alert message, so they go to that planet to investigate and they find there one or two surprises. While this might have worked in the first two alien movies (and masterpieces), here there is something missing. The story goes too fast and there isn't any surprises at all, because while we are watching the movie, we are guessing what is going to happen. And that is really a pity.We do indeed get many answers, but maybe they are not what we were expecting (not what we wanted) and the feeling that you have been waiting almost 40 years for this, gives you a strange feeling. Plus, the movie leaves many open doors and raises other kind of questions that we hope will be patched up in the following movie, which by the way you will be left wondering what is going to happen: how they are going to connect this one to the original one.Another problem that I see is that there are too many actors, there are like 15 crew members, which we see suffering one after another. And believe me when I say this is the first Alien movie were I laughed at the fate of some of them, because some situations are a bit ridiculous, pardon me. Maybe with fewer people the repeating idea would have worked differently and even better. Despite that at some point we hear the Alien and the Prometheus theme, we are left a bit cold or feeling nothing like we felt 40 years ago.Although the film shines more light to the Alien story than Prometheus did, it feels like something is missing, which is ironical as it provides many answers, which we have been waiting for since the original Alien movie. It feels just like another action movie, missing the magic of the two original ones (please pretend that Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection never existed).",Alien - Covenant

354,lale-ba,Complete disaster,1,23 May 2017,"There is no nice way to put it, so I'll just say it loud: Riddley is ripe for euthanasia. A man who once defined genres and made legendary franchises that educated entire generations is now killing his masterpieces one by one. Just if Prometheus"" wasn't enough, he gave birth to another retarded script that surpassed even its mediocre predecessor. There isn't one good thing about Covenant"". Not a single one. Not even one good action sequences, or just a decent CGI. No. Everything is just so missing the point, that you'll laugh instead of being scared, or just end up being utterly frustrated. Script s practically non-existent, with plot"" being so lame and tragicomical that entire flick becomes a self-parody right from the opening I am your father"" scene. If the script was made for the people with special demands, what can be said about the acting. Even the otherwise reliable Fassbender is just drowning in sea of pretentiousness. His scenes in a double role are meant to be the best ones in the movie, but they end being the worst ones. Neutron storm, scene with the pipes, taming the aliens with breathing in their non-existent mouths, Fassbenders kissing, vomiting facehugger's embryos... Just plain awful. All of this wouldn't bother me if Scott just came out in the open and went honest that he made a high end budget trash. No, no, he was serious, dead serious and that can't be forgiven or forgotten. Covenant"" isn't just a worse Alien"" movie. It's the worse American blockbuster in this decade and maybe even in this century.",Alien - Covenant
355,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,I actually like Prometheus more now.,6,25 May 2017,"Ridley Scott is once again in the directing chair, and this movie really is trying to please everyone. You get the action from Aliens, you get the sci-fi and horror from Alien, and for you smart folks, you get the thought provoking science of Prometheus. Now that sounds like a nice idea. Unfortunately, this movie isn't all that nice. It is going back to basics, and I believe it is a missed opportunity to explore new ground.The horror in the movie is literally every horror cliché you've seen before. The Covenant, are literally the dumbest characters in a slasher movie you see, even though they are scientist. I'm talking about dumb horror characters in 80s sleaze, straight to video, grindhouse, cheap video store movies. Such as, wandering off in the dark by yourself, trusting the man with the shifty eyes and blood smear on his hands, having sex when you know danger is around the corner, telling people you will be right back, let's go off course, let's party, and more. A character literally goes off and has two options. One option is going down the brightly lit corridor with my crewmembers. Or, going down the dark corridor, by myself, with a eerie noise, and a splotch of burgundy blood smeared on the floor. Geez, I wonder which way I should go? Katherine Waterston as Dany is the only relatable character because she is the only one with common sense. Also, I wish this movie would have been more creative. It is almost as if Ridley Scott was making a parody of his own past movie. Meaning, what we see in the film we have seen in Alien and Aliens. The facehugger, the alien bursting through someone's chest only know it's another alien bursting out through someone's spine, even Dany has the same hair style and tank top that Weaver had and wore in the first two films. Furthermore, if you are someone who is confused on the story of Prometheus, I think you will be even more confused by this. Written By - Nile Fortner",Alien - Covenant

About half way through the movie David starts to cut his long hair off and suddenly closely resembles Walter.At this point i realized he was going to pull the old switcheroo and betray the crew in the guise of Walter. and that's exactly what happened. What this film lacks in subtlety it makes up for in being completely bleedin obvious,even to a fool.What is supposed to be a shocking twist that puts the icing on the cake of this film is the final insult the viewer cannot bare.

Why? because this is a Ridley Scott movie and it is flawed in so many ways that no self respecting movie studio is going to want to take a chance on anything that follows.Prometheus was okay, it filled in a few blanks, had a reasonable story, presented some reasonable acting and contained the horror that Alien represents. Beyond that it was mediocre at best, but this is almost laughable on all of those points.Although the story could have been good the constant need to do the same things again and again, made this a predictable and 'made for TV' style presentation. It also attempts to sew the seeds of the next one in too many ways at too many points along the way.I have been a great fan of the majority of the Alien movies, immortal moments such as 'game over man, game over' have become a facet of almost everyday life, but this falls so far short of that I literally watched it three times to see if I could enjoy some of it at some point, and, I didn't.Synopsis: sadly this is likely to inspire the end of the Alien franchise, but the saddest part of that is that it will end on a bad note with a bad movie.",Alien - Covenant

From the soundtrack to at least 7 or 8 key plot points are presented with near identical similarities.And somebody please explain to me HOW a bunch of summer-camp councilors passes for a crew in charge of the most expensive interstellar space craft in the history of the human race. Complete morons. So much so that you might think Mr. Scott is playing some kind of joke on us old foggies who were nothing short of enthralled with the original Alien released in 1979.I was 19 years old in 1979, and I am now 56.Yes, it's been that long.Also thrown in is a iconic line from Ridley's other master-creation, Blade Runner (and no, I'm not going to tell you what it is. If you're and old fart like me, you'll spot it immediately).While no fault can be had with the design and cinematography, the re-run mentality is getting old and worn out.If you are in your twenties and not that intimately familiar with the franchise that now dates back almost 40 years, you will probably be wildly entertained.If you're in the same age bracket as myself, you'll find it annoying.Like Star Wars, the Alien franchise has morphed into absolutely nothing that resembles the original, and leaves us wondering when the curtain is going to drop for the last time.It's over, Mr. Scott.

Fine, let's include the captain and the 2IC. Spacesuits in case of biohazards? Who needs them. Hideous bio-infection? Never mind about quarantine. Even the second-in-command, who seemed sensible earlier, demands the ship rescue them in spite of the obvious huge risk.Such total incompetence takes the breath away. OK, you may say it's necessary to drive the plot. I disagree. Far more realistic to show them following strict protocol yet catastrophe happens anyway.

362,stroggos,Not quite the Alien movie we longed for,6,20 May 2017,"ALIEN: COVENANT follows a space mission that's planned to populate new worlds with humans. The crew of the colony ship 'Covenant' intersects an unknown signal coming from a habitable planet. As we come to expect from any movie of the franchise, diverting the colonization mission to the source of the signal may not have been the best of ideas...I consider myself a hardcore fan of the franchise. And I liked the beginning of the movie, especially when everything devolves into visceral madness in a way that is quite uncompromising .... but then, after starting with a massive bang, ALIEN: COVENANT slows down and just becomes utterly boring, filled with pseudo-gibberish about creation and perfection.There are aspects of the plot whose predictability are almost insulting to the audience. The pacing is off, with sometimes too much talk and sometimes too much action; no sense of rhythm for sure. And there are some characters that are just plain forgettable—you don't really care much when they die because you didn't get the chance to know them in the first place.But ultimately, what really shocked me the most was that I couldn't relate to Michael Fassbender's character. As we have come to expect from Fassbender, the acting is superb, but the story just doesn't give enough time to properly motivate the character's actions. I oftentimes found myself confused: Why does he do the things he does? What's the big deal?Besides shortcomings in the plot, the frantic and jittery action is at times off-putting. And then there's massive use of CGI. Oooooooh.... CGI ! Hardcore alien fans have come to hate it. Call me old school, but I really did long for more practical effects in this one. The xenomorphs, despite multimillion dollar graphics, just didn't seem to be ""there"", they didn't have a real presence.I give it a 6 out of 10—slightly above average because the movie did manage to entertain me... and because of the genuinely gruesome and gut-wrenching body horror. But then, you can't base a good movie on just that. In the end, you need a compelling story.",Alien - Covenant

364,shadowfax73,A confused mess,3,20 July 2017,I must admit I quite enjoyed Prometheus. Taken as its own story it wasn't bad at all. They jammed in an Alien scene at the end that left me wondering where the series would go from there. The title 'Alien Covenant' infers that is part of the Alien series. God knows what was going through Ridley Scott's head but making it an android death match movie rather than an 'Alien' movie is almost a crime. This movie makes Alien 3 feel like a classic. The only characters with any presence or importance are the two androids and it was so obvious that a switcheroo had happened at the climax that I just sat there waiting for the revelation. The end of the movie had quite a terrifying moment for the last awake crew member being sent back into hypersleep. That one scene demonstrates just how poor the rest of the movie is.,Alien - Covenant
365,alfredsmith,Disappointingly familiar,5,2 August 2017,"I recall giving the original movie 10/10 but Covenant is simply a disappointment. Oddly enough if the other movies were never made and this was at totally new story it might be regarded as a pretty good sci-fi flick, but it's not new and its predecessors were far superior. So what was wrong with it? The most irritating aspect was that the characters were plain stupid. The crew exhibited little evidence of scientific training or discipline and got what they deserved. I couldn't muster any sympathy for the characters and found myself at times cheering for the aliens. The plot itself was thoroughly predictable and the twists more so. The ending was an insult to the audience. We've seen it all before and now it's all too familiar so there's no horror or shock value. Only worth watching if you've never seen the first three movies.

However, Scotts films are all a cut above the rest. Covenant is the sequel to Prometheus, and although Prometheus was frustrating to watch, principally because the film leaves much unexplained, this sequel fleshes out the context nicely. I believe this film, like Scotts Blade Runner, will be reconsidered as one of his best, and I certainly now regret not having taken the opportunity to watch this on the big screen when it was still showing in cinemas. The film explores humanity's origins, and then mocks humanity for its infinite self regard. It says humans are puny, insignificant, fragile, on the verge of extinction and deservedly so. The film is spectacular in its themes and is difficult to comprehend in a single viewing. Watch it. Its the thinking mans Sci Fi franchise.",Alien - Covenant

368,ryanskywalker-87402,A return to form for the Alien franchise,8,20 May 2017,"This is what Alien fans wanted Prometheus to be and I mean that in a great way. Alien: Covenant puts the franchise on track for some great future films, Scott's vision is felt in every scene, and it is wonderful, albeit horrific, for the poor unfortunate souls who exist within it.This is truly an Alien film that appropriately tethers itself to what ground work was laid in Prometheus. It's got Ridley Scott visual style all over it, as it should, and its score, by Jed Kurzel, is beautiful and haunting in what feelings it elicits. From the moment I saw the classic Alien title stylings accompanied by that aforementioned score, I had a feeling this would be a good one.As the story unfolds and what is truly going on is discovered or, more accurately, revealed to the ill-fated crew of the Covenant, it began to evoke Frankenstein (Shelley herself actually gets name dropped), but even more so, The Island of Dr. Moreau. As things become clearer, things become only all the more difficult for the colonization crew. The story here is incredibly well put together and is twistedly clear on just what is going on come the third act.The crew itself is well cast with there not being a single weak link in the bunch. A quick cameo from James Franco was nice and Danny McBride takes a wonderful dramatic turn as an actor. He does get to be the source of a couple of well placed, but not out of place jokes that provide some wonderful bits of humor, but his acting definitely impressed me especially when things get truly tense toward the end. Billy Crudup and Demian Bichir, Watchmen and The Hateful Eight alum respectively, are excellent in their supplementary roles. The unsurprising star here and spiritual successor to Ellen Ripley is Katherine Waterston. I began to plot out her character's path throughout the film simply given how the crew itself worked, however, the great thing about this film in terms of being a horror/thriller was that it was difficult to see who was next a lot of the time and it wasn't afraid to kill off multiple characters at one time. As the audience, I had a pretty good idea of who would remain come the end, but getting there wasn't as easily foreseeable. Michael Fassbender as the androids David and Walter was fun to watch and his journey in the film is spectacularThis film is a great example as one with layers that one could choose to examine for deeper meaning or overlook in favor of taking its surface as a great popcorn horror/thriller flick. Given the interactions that Fassbender's character has, multiple meanings for the title beyond that of the ship itself emerge. I'm being purposefully vague as not to spoil anything, but the underlying philosophies and a small study of a covenant between creator and creation does exist. I myself can only take it so far as I've only seen the film once, but I wouldn't be surprised to find even more on a future viewing.And I will certainly revisit this one. Alien: Covenant delivered for me in a big way. It had action, suspense, was gross as hell, and while there wasn't a great deal of ""horror,"" the story it told was wonderfully self-contained such that a newcomer to the franchise could watch it alongside a veteran and understand what was going on. That being said, you'll appreciate a great deal more if you're a fan. This is a big bridge for the franchise as, one can gather from the trailers alone, the true Xenomorph comes to form in this film. I'm not sure what route the franchise takes next, but I am very optimistic.Also, I couldn't help, but come up with an, admittedly lengthy, alternate title while watching: Alien: An Origin of Species. It could have easily been something akin to this and been very much appropriate.",Alien - Covenant
369,taryllsbaker,"""Ridley Scott's second pre-Alien entry is visually satisfying but lacks in story.""",5,14 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterson, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, Demián Bichir and Carmen Ejogo.The crew of a colony ship, bound for a remote planet, discover an uncharted paradise with a threat beyond their imagination, and must attempt a harrowing escape.After the lacklustre Prometheus in 2012, I had no good expectations going into Ridley Scott's Alien: Covenant. Apart from a few decently tense scenes and beautiful visuals, Prometheus was a mindless action/adventure flick set in the world of Alien. It's worth noting that I'm not overly keen on the franchise as a whole, so I'm biased. However, I do appreciate what Ridley Scott did with the original 1979 film.When I go to watch an Alien film, I want it to send shivers down my spine. There must be scenes filled with nothing but tension. Thankfully, Alien: Covenant handles this extremely well. There are some really awesome moments that keep you on the edge of your seat. The final action sequence in the film is stunning to watch. That said, these moments are few and far between, so we're left with a story that doesn't seem to be heading in any specific direction, apart from leading into the original film.The characters, excluding Daniels (Katherine Waterson) and David/Walter (Michael Fassbender), are poorly written and act unintelligently. One scene in particular, without spoiling anything, was an eye-roller. Why would anyone in their right mind look directly into an egg that is quite clearly hatched? It's understandable that this person has never seen one before, but the moment he lets his guard down, a Facehugger continues its life cycle by latching onto the host. The only two interesting characters are Daniels and David / Walter. Waterson is a fine actress and demonstrates this in all of her scenes. Fassbender works wonders in his double-performance, though maybe too much time was spent on his character(s), therefore detracting from the other crew members. Tennessee (Danny McBride) is present for a brief sense of comic relief and while McBride has his moments, it's an act just as one-dimensional as the rest.As aforementioned, this film is a visual treat. It's dark, gritty and unearthly. The production and costume design is remarkably well-handled and looks impressive, captured skilfully by cinematographer Dariusz Wolski, who has worked with Ridley Scott on numerous occasions. There are some gruesome deaths, of course, and these are handled really nicely. I'm always ready for some gore in a film, and Covenant did it right.Jed Kurzel's score is exceptional. It pleases me to say that his music was something I enjoyed about this film. After his disappointing work on Assassin's Creed, it's truly great to see him explore the vast eeriness present in Covenant and succeed. Some of the string work heard in the score is incredibly well written, as well as the woodwind sections that open the main theme. Not only does it work as a score, but it's musically twisted and an enjoyable listening experience overall.Verdict; Whilst it strives in apprehension and its visual design, Ridley Scott's second entry in the prequel trilogy feels as empty as its characters, culminating to an anticlimactic finale.Alien: Covenant – ★★★ (5/10)",Alien - Covenant

Ridley really has an eye for the visual flair.The acting was very good, with a near-academy performance by Fassbinder. There were some great action scenes and some great scares.I won't spoil anything, but the special effects with Fassbinder were truly astonishing.I was captivated throughout the movie, and jumped out of my seat a few times. The new version of the xenomorph was cool/creepy/beautiful at the same time.This film is a wonderful wedge between Prometheus and the first Alien film. It explains a lot (who really created the alien creature and why was it created) and had some really great moments in the film.Most of the negative comments I have read deal with the lack of depth to the human characters. Really? This is in essence a monster film that tries to deal with some heavy topics. The human element is definitely secondary. The film is all about Fassbinder and the creatures. Watch the 1st Alien film and besides Ripley, and maybe Dallas, were the other characters all that deep?I can't wait to see it again on blu-ray.If you liked Prometheus, then you will like this better. If you hated Prometheus, then I don't know.. To me, it accomplished what it set out to do - tell some more backstory of the Alien and set-up the next film - which I am anxiously awaiting...8 out of 10...and from what I have heard, some scenes on the cutting floor might even have made this higher.Ignore the nay-sayers...Go an enjoy.

While making repairs, they pick-up a signal from a previously uncharted planet. Upon locating it and determining it can support human life, the captain (Billy Crudup) makes a spur of the moment decision to chuck aside all the planning that was put into their expedition to make this new planet their colonial destination. He gets some slight push-back about this flippant decision from his second-in-command, ""Daniels"" (Katherine Waterston who looks eerily like her father), but that seems to be the only complaint.So, the crew set down on this planet with no real plan, no protective gear, and just start winging it with, of course, disastrous results because this is an ""Alien"" movie.The crew, especially the captain, appear to have the intelligence of turnips. They proceed to act like the Scooby-Do gang and/or the begging-to-be-victims characters from the ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" franchises by constantly splitting-up. I groaned every time a character said: ""I'll be right back"" as he or she walks off alone. And, boy, are they panicky. It's as if they had no training for their jobs whatsoever. Who green-lit this expedition with these fools? (The rampant stupidity of these characters is downright insulting to the audience's intelligence.)I don't know what's going on with poor Ridley Scott. For him to go forward with this stupid story with all its plot holes that require characters to repeatedly act like irrational fools is sad. The original ""Alien"" was such a smart movie with believable characters who were intelligent and professional. This is a pale imitation with a recycled plot twist from the original film except grossly embellished. Also, although Ms. Waterston is cute, her Daniels is no ""Ellen Ripley.""Most of the other actors didn't resonate at all. Years from now, while they're trying to land new roles and are asked about their previous work they can respond: ""Well, I played panicky idiot #3 on 'Alien: Covenant.'""",Alien - Covenant
376,kira02bit,Another Alien dud,2,12 August 2019,"There has not been a truly successful entry in the Alien franchise since James Cameron's initial sequel Aliens, yet somehow the series chugs on. Covenant is no exception. It is a direct sequel to Prometheus from a few years prior, which was notable for two reasons: 1) it featured the return in the director chair of Ridley Scott and 2) its enigmatic eye-catching trailer was easily the best thing about it. Scott returns again for the sequel.The action shifts to the title starship, which is carrying an army of married couples in suspended animation on their way to colonize a distant planet. An interstellar accident leaves the captain dead (James Franco, in a nanosecond cameo for reasons unknown) and finds an awakened core crew stunned, especially when they intercept a transmission of a woman singing ""Country Roads"" from a mysterious heretofore unknown Earth-like planet. Katherine Waterston, as the former captain's grieving widow, is reluctant to go, but Billy Crudup is now in command and decides to check this miraculous planet out. Of course, that proves to be a deadly decision since the seemingly hospitable planet features not only an array of deadly organisms to inflict grisly deaths, but Fassbender's sociopathic android from the prior film.Ostensibly the fact that the characters are made up of couples is supposed to make them more relatable. It doesn't. There is a male couple acting as security - for the life of me I did not fathom whether they were supposed to be gay or whether they were just along for the ride. One of them is played by the great Oscar-nominated actor Demien Bichir, who literally has nothing to do. Throughout the film, husbands and wives are killed and their surviving partners are oddly ambivalent about the loss. The exception is Waterston who starts the film grieving and proceeds to be teary-eyed through the entire film, until the final moments require her to toughen up and take matters into her own hands.Part of the problem is that either Scott does not understand what made the first Alien successful or he is so obsessed with the android subplot that he should have instead looked into revisiting the Blade Runner franchise instead. Fassbender gets to pull double duty as both the malevolent David and the sweet Walter - the Covenant's android. There are myriad of scenes with Fassbender seemingly on the verge of kissing people or hovering near them in an oddly sexual manner that ultimately becomes laughable. At one point, David seductively tries to teach Walter about a flute and howlingly advises that he ""will do the fingering"". Um, OK. Alas, David is no where near the dynamic character Scott seems to believe he is and he becomes a liability the longer the film dotes on him.Although I was no fan of Noomi Rapace's bland heroine from Prometheus, it seems more than a tad disrespectful to off her character in between films. She was not the brightest person, but I have a hard time believing that she would have regenerated the duplicitous David and allowed him into a position to murder her. Then again, characters act incredibly stupid from frame one onward. I do not just mean horror movie stupid...I mean catastrophically stupid. The characters land on a strange planet and then just begin waltzing around without protection resulting in one of them getting infected with an organism. He is returned to the shuttle with the doctor and an experienced security person. When he starts into a scene a la the chestbuster, the security woman locks the doctor in with a dangerous alien without having to do so (resulting in the latter's death), runs hysterically through the ship screaming, returns to the scene, allows the creature to escape, has more hysterics and then accidentally blows the entire shuttle up with a stray shot. Her surprisingly stoic husband (Danny McBride) laconically greets the news of her hysterics and demise with ""That's not like her."" Throughout the film, characters know the danger and go off on their own to wash up or fumble around in the dark. Crudup's character may well be the singularly dumbest in cinema history. Literally every decision he makes is nonsensical and wrong, but he excuses it in every other scene by reminding us that he is a man of faith. Even after discovering that Fassbender's David is a psycho murderer, he laughably follows the android's instruction to stick his head over a hatching alien egg to peek inside.Worse, every new detail given us to explain the origin of the aliens makes them less scary. There was a certain innate terror in the original films that there were these horrible things lurking in dark places of the universe just waiting to pounce. They now seem diminished with the revelation that they are nothing more than an experiment wrought by a bratty android. At one point, a newly hatched alien literally gives David a Nazi salute that results in audience guffaws.Acting is mediocre throughout. The effects are also nothing great, with the CGI oddly making the aliens less convincing. There is a ridiculous scene in a shower with a couple and an intrusive alien that comes out of no where. And can someone figure out how to kill these things without using the blowing them out into space routine.The final moments show how bankrupt Scott and company have become. The film sets up the dynamic of a brewing conflict between the maniacal David and earnest Walter. When one of the android's manages to accompany the witless survivors, Scott delivers the twist of it being the evil one like it was not a cliche that anyone could see coming from miles away. Not only does the film suck, but it does so in predictable ways and does not even realize it.",Alien - Covenant
377,MovieJunkie1976,For Review...,6,23 May 2017,"After the nonsensical release of Prometheus , I like many of you was not really certain where this was all going to. Then Ridley Scott himself calls the movie a mistake , I assume a mistake that this movie was meant to correct. I am not certain mistake was the right word. Maybe just unnecessary.So in this film we rewind to the creation of The Android David. Who has pretext conversation on the subject of creation with Peter Weyland.Then we move to the year 2104 ten years after Elizabeth Shaw's adventure. We are aboard the colony ship covenant bound for a far away world to obviously colonize.For reasons watching the film will reveal we decide after an accident and repairs to not resume our course but to check out a human transmission from a planet that has a better inhabatability prospect than our destination. OK. None of this is the stuff of legendary film really. However sometimes the simplest explanations are the best ones.On this planet we find David. Elizabeth shaw is dead. It appears David has become quite insane and fashions him self in a God archetype. After killing a minor city filled with aliens he spends the next decade creating the Alien we all know and loathe. The crew of the covenant receives a high body count and a front row seat to the birth of this terror. All in all a perfectly fine explanation for the birth of this problem. Clear and direct , unlike prometheus.A few things remain. The question arises is David ,Ash? How exactly do the Aliens establish their homeworld on Origae 6. What happened at the colony there? I guess well just have to wait for that movie.",Alien - Covenant
378,influxtwo,Disappointing disaster for a legendary series.,1,9 April 2021,"Other reviewers have really covered the bases here. I LOVE every single Alien movie but not this one. Just dreadful. Awful logic, terrible writing, unimpressive Cgi, and messed up lore. The god and gay overtones stuff is ridiculous, why is every character leaning face-first in to an alien terrain / organism without any kind of protective gear ever? How did any of this leave the storyboards? They put this together like a bad made for TV scifi movie only it's supposed to be way better than that. Nice music, scenery and landscapes are about the only good thing I can say about this. The alien looks like a cartoon and the characters are beyond dumb. This movie would make for a good drinking game or unintentional comedy. It's a bit shocking how bad it is but unfortunate for this legendary series. I only hope this series can survive this catastrophic misfire. It will take a complete overhaul to forget this disaster. The logic is so flawed It does not deserve the Alien name. If not for the name, you would never know this was part of that series. Dreadful. The story is insulting and offensive. I loved Prometheus compared to this. They really spent $97,000,000 on this??",Alien - Covenant

Unfortunately, the latter received a lot of unjust flak in the media. Michael Fassbender stole the show in Prometheus and does it again in ""Alien: Covenant"" as Walter/David. This is much more suspenseful that ""Prometheus"" and Scott builds the tension appropriately. Any film made by Sir Ridley and which stars Michael Fassbender can't miss. Just one more thing, Tennessee is a terrible pilot. The ending is awesome. Don't miss this film.",Alien - Covenant
380,verminhater,Yet more incompetent fools allowed in space,3,10 July 2017,"The failings of Prometheus just carry on and on and on...Just as with Prometheus we get yet another crew who shouldn't be allowed to ride a waltzer let alone crew a space ship. One bad decision or lack of leadership after another. It simply beggars belief. I'll not bore everyone with the details of their many failings as I suspect many other reviewers have done just this, but since when would anyone send any but the very best crew on such a massively expensive and important mission? The deputy captain is the biggest case in point having zero leadership ability at all. Who writes these scripts? Who says ""Yes, that's a good script. Let's work with that."" Again as with Prometheus the visuals are superb. All the difficult bits have been done really well but yet again a plain awful script and screenplay is in use. The ending in particular could have been guessed by any 10 year old 30 minutes from the end of the film.Does the industry deliberately set out to make films so badly these days because I'm finding it hard to understand how such mistakes are repeated time and again. Is the average film goer really lapping this rubbish up thinking it quality? If so we'll be extinct long before the Alien gets us. After Prometheus I gave Ridley Scott the benefit of the doubt in that he'd stumbled badly but after two completely identical failures I see no point in watching any further efforts he may make. I'm tired of being treated like a fool.",Alien - Covenant
381,moviesmaniax,I like the way these dumb characters die // INSTAGRAM: MOVIESMANIAX,8,15 June 2017,"Congrats horror fans! You just got yourself one hell of a bloody ride in space here. Alien: Covenant serves as a prequel to Alien (1979) and a sequel to Prometheus (2012) and it does a great job filling the story gap while delivering intense, gruesome, and bloody action-packed moments for the audience and fans of the series. There are also plenty of GORY scenes here that will delight horror fans, yet most of them are pretty much just replications of the previous films but nonetheless, you will still get a blood-splattering, stomach-ripping, and gut-gushing experience, just like the good old days. However, the main problem of this film is perhaps, beside Michael Fassbender, most of the characters here are just dumb, loud, and excellent at making bad decisions, which can be irritating to watch at times. Also, there isn't really anyone you would care or cheer for, but rather just waiting to see how and when they would end up dead. Overall, there are enough suspenseful action sequences, gleeful twists, and impressive visual effects that would make up for some eye- rolling moments and weak characters, making Alien: Covenant still a bloody satisfying and delightfully gory experience for the fans of the series.>>B+<<TWITTER: moviesmaniaCX",Alien - Covenant

What's more shocking is the 3 books released to coincide with the new films are immeasurably better. That's 'Sea Of Sorrows', 'Out Of The Shadows' and 'River Of Pain'.It's a shame that the books weren't used to script the films.Equally a shame that Neill Blomkamp never got a shot, as the newer Alien films are dire. Honest Trailers got it right when they said there are now more bad than good Alien films.Prometheus was bad but watchable. Covenant is just bad.",Alien - Covenant
383,FabledGentleman,"In this symphony, false notes are abundant",5,13 May 2017,"I have seen Alien and Aliens over a hundred times combined. To put it gently, I'm what you call ""a fan"". I was eleven years old when i first saw Alien, and it scared the living hell out of me. three years later i saw Aliens, and i could seriously not believe my own eyes, that's how good it was. There is no movie that has inspired me more than Aliens, and combined with the original, they are in my opinion the best dilogy ever made. Even better than The Godfather.IMO Ridley made a masterpiece back in 1979. The film was originally a b-movie, but the acting, set pieces, camera work, effects, story, script, direction and so on, made it look and feel like a triple A production. It even holds up against today's productions, as it has aged extremely well.One of the things that made Alien so great was the mystery, that we can't guess what comes next. It's scary beyond belief that we don't know exactly what the aliens are capable of, or where exactly they come from. And this is what James Cameron brilliantly built upon in Aliens, he added more, like the alien queen which was genius, but he didn't overdo anything, and he kept the mystery, which was essential. Aliens felt just right, and is widely considered to be one of the best movie sequels of all time.Alien 3 and resurrection are movies i like to forget ever existed. Alien 3 was a mess, they started shooting even before the script was done, and David Fincher was brought in last minute, and almost gave up his movie career because of the mess it turned out to be. Resurrection was basically just a ""Hey we run out of ideas"". So no more mention of those films.Then, after many years, Ridley states he is returning, and he is going to make an alien prequel. Oh my god, the chill down my spine when i read that. I just thought to myself: YES, finally!And then... He made Prometheus. A beautifully shot film, with great acting from Fassbender, but that's also where Prometheus stops being amazing. The script was horrible, the story tried to tell too much, and worst of all, the mystery was gone, what made Alien so great, just vanished. And now Ridley has made a dent he cannot undo, he can now only try and make things better, and i personally gave him one last chance, it is really unforgiving that the man that started all this, can mess up so bad. Now i finally understand how important Dan O'Bannon was to the original film.Like seriously. Why did they need to make the engineers our creators?. Why can't the aliens just be aliens? *sigh*Anyways, so how did he do this time around?.. Not good, not good at all. Ridley seems to be lost at this point. As with Prometheus, this movie is carried solely by Fassbender in another amazing performance, rest of the cast is stereo types and boring individuals. This movie has poor character development, and combined with lots of flat acting, it leaves me totally careless of what happens to them, and to be clear, a lot of horrible things happen to many characters in this film.Alien had truckers in space, Prometheus had stupid scientists in space, now we have stupid stereotype truckers in space. As with Prometheus the plot is vague and badly transformed to screen, there are however some truly amazing scenes to behold, but they are rare, and are dragged out by many slow pacing dialogue scenes, which could have been solved in so many clever ways. It's a Alien movie, it's suppose to have tension.The ending for example, could have had such a powerful impact, if only the movie had been built properly, and had a more focused story. But instead, it feels anticlimactic, and since this film borrows scenes from both Alien and Aliens and have added a Ripley ""look-a-like"" as the heroine, most of the movie feels forced and unoriginal, this is NOT the way to do things. It's a shame, it really is. And combine this with the sad fact that Ridley throws too much into the pot, and you have a movie that simply isn't working. He needs to learn that less is more.James Cameron added a queen, and it made all the difference, Ridley then ups the ante by adding thousands of possible creatures and forms, it's just plain ridiculous. Why even do this? What we have here is a predictable, boring, non scary, poorly orchestrated symphony, where not only one tone is off, but many. Oh the irony.I think Ridley need to let this franchise go. He obviously have no clue what made the original movies great, it almost feels like he is trolling us at this point. This isn't good enough.Alien Covenant is barely better than Prometheus and is the last Alien movie i will visit the cinema to see. I have lost all hope that this franchise will return to it's former glory. Alien Covenant is however, probably the third best film in the franchise, not really an achievement considering.5/10 - Mediocre",Alien - Covenant
384,stuart_davies,Ridley Scott has lost the plot...,1,29 May 2017,"I was really looking forward to answers left by Prometheus and a continuation of the story in what was a great revival of the Alien franchise. However, any crew that has a member wearing a cowboy hat, denotes morons that must be exterminated in as many graphically violent ways as possible... except that we've seen that before, many, many, many, times. The story must have been written on the toilet having a lengthy poo after a particularly heavy night of booze. At least I assume that from the total lack of originality or creativity of any sort. The characters are two dimensional and the plot is wooden with gaping crevasses in logic. I'm not going to list them as other reviewers have already done so. Needless to say, well before the middle of the film the only reason you carry on watching is so you can cheer at the ridiculousness of the actions of the crew and the inevitable disasters that befall them all. If Mr Scott has taken the same approach to the Bladerunner sequel, I'm pretty sure he will lose all credibility and respect from his sci-fi fans, not to mention a visit from the hit-man I will employ on their behalf.",Alien - Covenant

386,marcgreenman,"big ideas, good acting from michael fassbender",8,2 July 2020,"I watched this for the second time last night on Film Four and was fairly impressed, just as I was with Prometheus. It is not quite the same kind of film. I felt that there was considerably more mystery contained in Prometheus, but Covenant matches this film in terms of scope and ambition; on many occasions Covenant feels quite epic, and that is a feeling which I rarely get with any film, and it is much appreciated. I would purchase this film for the sense of awe which it generates, but there are other appealing factors. I was heavily impressed by the quality and nature of the effects, which were grand and often stunning, and always riveting to watch. Michael Fassbender gives a great performance as both of the androids and is good to watch; perhaps his performance as David is the better of the two, I found slightly more depth to David than Walter, Walter was just a little bit simplified whereas David has darkness and depth and issues and eventually came across as quite chilling. David was probably the best actual scare, more frightening than the aliens. I did like all of the aliens, in spire of the use of CGI I thought that they all more or less worked. Not quite as much as in the original film, but well enough. The acting was fair and character development fair, I had some empathy for the crew but apart from Fassbender who was exceptional nobody stood out, again the original film was better in this regard and maybe we could have done with someone comparable to Sigourney Weaver to represent the better side of the crew. There was just about enough attention to detail in the characters to make it credible. The action was quite good, but the more enjoyable moments of the film lie elsewhere, perhaps in Fassbender's androids or the epic landscapes or the big ideas.",Alien - Covenant

389,soundoflight,Great Comedy! Oh wait...,5,20 May 2017,"The laughs just keep coming in the #1 comedy film of the year, Alien: Covenant. And I'm not just being sarcastic, there were multiple times where the theatre erupted in laughter. After recently watching ""Prometheus"" and now this one, I'm thinking the major subplot of these movies is Ridely Scott saying ""humanity is stupid and deserves to die."" It's the only way I can explain how intentionally dumb the characters in these movies seem to be. I was so excited to see them probe the themes and style that was introduced in ""Prometheus,"" which despite it's flaws I find to be a very good film. But instead Scott has gone back to the 1980s ""Aliens"" film here with a lot of dumb guys running around with guns, which predictable results. Almost everything about ""Prometheus"" was abandoned here. The only saving grace was Fassbender's portrayal of the androids. There were some good themes that were brushed on there, but the payoff just wasn't there. So I guess it comes down to what kind of movie you want to see. If you want a silly, mindless, suspense, horror, and action film (with a bit of unintentional comedy), here's your ticket.",Alien - Covenant
390,pedroquintaoo,It's something like Prometheus 2.0 but worse!,4,21 May 2017,"I was expecting to see an Alien's prequel instead a bad sequel of Prometheus slightly connected to the original franchise.Prometheus 2... Sorry, Covenant starts with an accident in a spaceship, some people die and the spaceship's team finds an unknown planet, they decide to visit a stranger planet because they're stupid and a lot of bad things happen.This movie can be resume in an attempt of Ridley Scott trying to resurrect the Alien franchise, however he doesn't make it right. The character development is poor, we don't feel anything when someone dies (sometimes we ask who's that character we've seen being killed), the actors are on the movie only to die in some scenes without charisma and tension. The plot is weak, full of BIG plot holes, full of uninteresting scenes. It's all about what happened after Prometheus and David's plan, I must confess he's so annoying, only thinking about creation and boring things. However, this film has some good things, Michael Fassbender and Danny McBride are good on it, Katherine Waterston looks good but her character could be more used. The special effects are fine for the budget and the cinematography is awesome.Alien Covenant is boring and has lack of suspense, thrilling scenes and a good story. It could work if they produced a good sci-fi thriller with deeper character development, showed less about David's purpose and gave us more scenes with the big black villain because even Alien VS Predator had more blood and aliens on screen.Ridley Scott should move away from this franchise, the fans would say thanks.Rate: 4/10(Sorry my English grammar but I'm Portuguese)",Alien - Covenant
391,RLTerry1,Return to Space Horror!,7,19 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant returns to its roots in horror. In 1979, Ridley Scott convinced audiences around the world that ""in space, no one can hear you scream."" And the newest film in the line of prequels leading up to the terrifying events aboard the Nostromo, attempts to make up for the rejection of 2012's Prometheus as a true prequel to Alien. Fortunately for fans of the franchise, Alien: Covenant is mostly successful at delivering what audiences loved about the original and missed in the subsequent Cameron movies--the trademark horror of the xenomorph and facegrabbers. Starting off like Prometheus and finishing more like the original Alien, the newest film in the nearly 40-year- old franchise will have you screaming, cringing, and completely immersed in blood-curdling terror. That is, until you realize that only some questions from Prometheus answered, and all new questions about events in this movie are now generated and left unanswered. That appears to be Ridley Scott's Achilles heal: always leaving more questions unanswered than providing closure or exposition, thus prohibiting the movie from being as great as it certainly had the potential to be. With one more film between this current installment and 1979's Alien, perhaps there will be far fewer unanswered questions and provide the history for which fans are looking.One of the first technical elements that fans of Alien will notice is the opening title sequence. It is reminiscent of the manner in which the opening credits and title of the original were revealed in the emptiness of space on screen. I appreciated this homage to the original because it set me up to prepare for an Alien movie and not a second Prometheus. Perhaps that does not seem important to non-fans; but to make a long story short, while Scott was in the conceptual phase of a sequel to Prometheus (prequel to Alien), he was told by the studio that audiences didn't want another Prometheus--they wanted Ridley Scott's Alien. And now the rest is history. In order to best understand the flaws of Alien: Covenant it's necessary to understand the similar flaws of Prometheus. One of the many diegetic and technical problems with Prometheus was the fact that there was little direct connection to Alien and it felt like a whole new franchise and not an extension of the original. This lack of connection is best represented by the number of unanswered questions dwarfing the answered ones. Essentially, audiences only learned about David's origin and, to a lesser extent, why that particular planet. But enough about Prometheus, we are here to talk Alien: Covenant.Although vastly improved, Covenant also leaves audiences with many unanswered questions; albeit, it is successful at making up for many of the diegetic flaws of the preceding film. To get into the questions would reveal too much about the film and perhaps hint at some spoilers, so I won't go into specifics. But enough about the flaws of this otherwise exciting and well-produced film-- just know that the writing is weak but hopefully will be better in the next installment. The most impressive elements of the movie are related to the cinematography, editing, and visual effects. From the sweeping landscape shots to intimate closeups of the xenomorph and its victims, Covenant is absolutely visually stunning. There is even a mild romantic encounter between David and a member of the Covenant crew that was shot incredibly well and strategically placed in the narrative. Where the story is weak, Scott makes up for in creating an impressive cinematic experience for long-time and new fans alike. There are even shot sequences that are taken directly out of Alien. Often times, I am extremely critical of computer-generated effects and characters versus practical effects and animatronics--and for good reason--nothing can replace the way real light bounces off real objects and is really captured by the glass lenses on a camera. Furthermore, it's rare that a character react in genuine fear to an object, villain, or murderous alien that is not really present on set. However, the combination of CGI and practical effects in Covenant is breathtaking and convincingly real. You will almost feel the facegragger latching onto you and the xenomorph's wet acid-breath on your skin.Aside from the answered questions still residing in the minds of those who have seen the film, Covenant fails to live up to Alien in another rather conspicuous way. For everything that this film did right and make up for in Prometheus, it lacked any memorable crew member--more specifically--this film differs from Alien by not developing Dani(els) to be the strong female character that she had the potential to be. Dani could have been Covenant's answer to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in Alien. One of the the diegetic elements that is most talked about and is often the topic of horror film humanities classes is the breaking of gender roles and heteronormative expectations by Ripley in Alien. Perhaps that is why Alien is almost avant-garde in the cinematic experience whereas Covenant is impressive but does not typify the art of cinematic storytelling nor contributes to groundbreaking character-types. Beyond strong female lead, the film simply fails to leave the audience with any one memorable character period. No one will be talking about any one particular character years from now. Both the unanswered questions and the lack of memorable signifiant characters can be traced by to one root cause: flawed writing.If you loved the original Alien, then you will mostly enjoy Alien: Covenant. The experience is equally terrifying as it is beautiful. Whether you have seen Prometheus or not will not affect your enjoyment factor in this film. If you have seen Prometheus, then I would suggest watching the Ridley Scott short film The Crossing because it ties Prometheus to Alien: Covenant. Think of it as an extended prologue. This short film helps audiences to make the connection between the two films in hopes that it does answer some otherwise unexplained circumstances and events.",Alien - Covenant
392,botrytis,The unfortunate shortcut,6,30 May 2017,"The anticipation the audience have when they see Ridley Scott as Director might be on a lesser level every time this man puts out some new production one by one during these years. Prometheus had opened new perspectives to an unique franchise with new evolution, creatures and questions which may have never occurred in the whole Alien anthology before. But that was the whole case with Prometheus; It wasn't called Alien"" for a reason, because it had different point of view within this universe. What happened with Alien: Covenant though is exactly the issue which everyone was feared of: It really messed up the whole universe we loved for decades now.First of all, I would like to talk about the overall effect Covenant beholds. It is exotic, bringing interesting additions to the franchise at first, suddenly gets dirty, depressing, and dark, but as a whole it is silly from the start to the end. It has exciting places, environments, but their potential to be a part of something interesting easily cuts short under the weight of the xenomorph obligatory appearance and their origin story. The story is the same old one all over again with different surface; uninitiated people get some distress signal, and the leader of the crew decides to check the source even though no terms obligates them to do so: no mentions about the contracts they have with the company, only the leader thinks they should check out the unknown planet, but no one else in the crowd. Then, when they arrive onto the planet they don't even get any protection gear on themselves, no spacesuits, no helmets, even though they have only informations about the planet being habitable; What about any unseen viruses? Any kind of bacteria any toxins in the air which may have negative effects on earthlings? And yes, of course, some of them gets infected and everyone acts like an idiot asking what the hell is going on?"", but when they enter to a city of a totally unknown species they don't show any reactions of any sorts it is indeed an everyday moment in a human life to encounter with another race in a godforsaken planet in the middle of the space way apart from Earth. Then after many ugly things happened let's not put on the guard yet guys, the totally suspicious android marooned on this alien planet can still be trusted, no matter what he says, even when he showed sympathy towards a neomorph, which killed our crew member a moment ago, and after all the disturbing documentations of his experiments, when we get into a dark cellar with totally ugly alien eggs holding something livin' inside it yeah, let's just listen to any word this android has to say put your head over it, it's totally safe""  oh sh*t, right, I'm on it! Ooops, not again! Something bad happened just only because I'm an idiot. This is the whole concept of the crew we have in the latter movies from Ridley. No wonder he get's bashed by his fans lately. Oh did I mention they totally ignored the engineers here? Well I guess that is why it is not called PROMETHEUS II anymore.The atmosphere of the movie is actually exciting, which mostly must be credited to the Soundtrack composed by Jed Kurzel. The ugliness of the alienating events are perfectly reflecting through his music, which is a mash-up of both the Alien and Prometheus themes. The first appearance of the neomorph (the back-bursting scene) is the only well crafted horror scene in this movie: it is suspenseful, gory, new, fresh, and the music perfectly helps the build up of the momentum this couple of minutes have. And then there are those weirdly edited bath scenes (there are two), which are the weakest ones Ridley ever put on the big screen. The idiocracy of the whole crew deflects the whole atmosphere the movie wants to build up, and when the apex of the story comes in it ends up being the worst thing which could occur to this franchise. Yes, I'm talking about David being the sole origin of the xenomorphs. Oh, did I mention that he killed Dr. E. Shaw and dissected her in order to create the eggs? And that David's creations somehow imitates him for I have no idea what reasons or purpose for that matter? Why is this Alien Universe suddenly got smaller as David became the whole reason xenos exist? How come David knew everything about the whole Covenant ship; how things work there, what access codes are needed, how big cups are needed for the embryo-fridge case? Did he really changed his chip with Walter's? And if so, HOW? ...Wai wha what the hell happened there? How did Daniels jump down then get back to the ship in the end of Terraforming Bay action scene (maybe it is a reference for Michale BAY?)? What is this lame editing, who cut this movie? Why are they smiling after all these sh*t things happened to their crew? GUYS?!Prometheus was at least exciting and more coherent with interesting questions and new take to an old franchise, with new story lines which didn't needed to line up to the original movie, it could spread anywhere. But what happened? Ridley did a shortcut and went two steppes back and sacrificed a huge bunch of potential material only to please the crying fans who couldn't accept the whole direction Prometheus was on. But even if that was the case, WHY, oh why Ridley you had to listen to these people? You should have kept your own visions and plans for this franchise. NOW I only could ask Ridley this: Do you even know what you are doing anymore?"" Because I don't think so...6.5/10",Alien - Covenant

Such a film will have been appropriate for those times when conspiracy nuts going nuts on the streets will feel perfectly at home embracing the notions presented in this film and its earlier prequel: Prometheus. Alien: Covenant is for the most part a average ride. But it never chills the marrow quite in the way the the earlier 90s films did. It is plagued by the classic prequel symptoms (when prequel was a recent thing made popular by the Star Wars trilogy). The franchise has adopted the prequel setup in its reinvention but with mixed results.Don't get me wrong with the current CGI technology, things should look better but it ain't the case here. The stop motion Puppet renditions in Aliens or even the bits and glimpses of the the blue screen dog running animal in the third film seems to scare us more than these CGI ones (HR Giger?, are u still around?) Nevertheless the film still packs there is a certain anarchic thrill, but not in the same amounts we are used to. There's still life in the old bugger hatching from an egg if the series went thru a fresh reboot with the same conventions that made the past Alien movies successful.I am hard pressed to give it a high rating . Average, watchable.",Alien - Covenant

Sci fi as an overall genre is improving on the screen, but only on the small screen. Stereotypes in any genre, as anyone can see, sooner or later cripples that genre. Fortunately, recent offerings are showing that the immense amount of material out there is beginning to be looked at a little more seriously. That said, I don't get why this film was so denigrated. It simply picks up where Prometheus left off. As the old saying goes, you cant squeeze blood out of a sows ear. Alien's pretty has pretty much exhausted its subject matter. Its a little predictable at the end, as the attempted twist failed for a more discerning viewer. its entertaining enough as action sci-fi and worth the watch at 7 out of 10.

After that, countless first/third person shooter video games were spawned, portraying ALIEN as nothing but mindless bugs rushing towards the player and getting executed. Shoot them up!Fortunately, ALIEN 3 (the assembly cut version combined with the theatrical cut is amazing) brought back the dark and creepy atmosphere of the 1979 original. The funeral scene where the dog barked when death was approaching was poetic, beautiful, and memorable. Yes, I prefer the dog being the host in the theatrical cut to the cattle in the assembly cut. I also like the theatrical cut's ending where the alien embryo bursts out.The fourth ALIEN movie, oh dear, how I adore you! ALIEN RESURRECTION was the movie that introduced me to the ALIEN universe. The monsters are deadly, ferocious, and scary. The movie combined elements of the original with fresh ideas. Bravo! I love Ripley #8, and every single moment of the newborn, the perfect embodiment of creepiness, ferocity, and raw primal power. See how the newborn baby screams and bites a scientist's head off, and later rips a soldier's head off, and smiles!In 2004, came Paul W S Anderson's Alien VS Predator, a beautiful piece of trash, with high production value, great settings in Antarctica. It's beautiful to look at, but still a piece of trash. The movie is a humiliation of the iconic monster as insulting as James Cameron's ALIENS. In this movie, the iconic monster can be butchered for sport. How funny. The only interesting thing is the grid alien. Generally, the aliens are portrayed as weaklings, nothing but hollow shells of their glorious ancestor from the 1979 masterpiece.Then in 2007, Aliens VS Predator Requiem... I'll not talk about it.In 2012, Sir Ridley finally returned to this franchise! Hallelujah! The alien becomes deadly again. This time it takes the form of lethal pathogens, a force to be reckoned with, a kind of viruses that could wipe out civilisations. Such a great film, but... there's no classic alien. Sir Ridley was right. We fans do miss the big chap.LAST NIGHT, I saw ALIEN COVENANT on a gigantic cinema screen. Wow. I love it more than I can say. Words cannot express how much I love it, or how grateful I am as a die-hard fan to Sir Ridley Scott for his returning to this franchise and revitalising ALIEN!If I have to say something about ALIEN COVENANT, it is this: the movie is far more poetic and epic than I expected.""My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away."" Shelley's poem is quoted in an ALIEN movie. Incredibly awesome!Honorable mentions: ALIEN ISOLATION, the 2014 survival horror game, captures the spirit of Sir Ridley's 1979 masterpiece. For that, I am forever grateful. ALIEN ISOLATION is the perfect ALIEN game. To hell with James Cameron and those first/third person shooters that treated ALIEN like bugs.Dead Space 1-2 are wonderful spiritual siblings of ALIEN in video game format.Anxiously awaiting the sequels to Covenant. This is die-hard ALIEN fan. Signing off...",Alien - Covenant

Predator films and 'Predators' (gag), Covenant captures all of the flaws of Prometheus almost perfectly.By rewriting history with a completely unnecessary prequel to a franchise with unlimited TV and film potential, Ridley Scott has poisoned his own well with some of the worst ideas in modern story telling.In this one, Scott now tries to have us believe that the ships android David from the first movie, is responsible for genetically creating the 'alien' species?I was torn between boredom and incredulity as I watched a crew of astronauts land on an alien planet with no hazmat or environmental gear, and get instantly infected (just like Prometheus, except in that one, they took off their own helmets.)again. There was next to no rules in this one, least not any story rules that were adhered to.The alien gestation cycle that is legendary cannon in the other films is ruined in this one, as the Aliens now pop out from a magic mushroom and fly like the liquid (from the embarrassingly flawed Transformers: The Last Knight), now appear to grow from a spore particle in a guys ear to a chest bursting dog alien was minutes. That this is growing all over the planet, why would android David be trying to engineer a slower and less efficient strain of the alien virus?Pretty much every action scene was ridiculous, they tried to make the Demi Moore-lite character the new Ripley, but it just didn't work to me. Every hero in Alien doesn't have to be a mousy white girl, and even sadder, the heroine from the last movie that survived was killed off screen for a stupid explanation, and the android that died last movie, was the entire movie, and a second version of himself... ummm didn't I see this exact story done better in Star Trek the Next Generation when Data and his evil android brother used to cross swords identically? This was so disappointing despite great space ship effects, nice casting and very reasonable acting, the story was just so weak, I actually wanted to just walk out, because I was more entertained by the Wonder Woman trailer that ran for three minutes.I loathe myself for having to write this review, but this movie depressed me.

The writers are attempting badly to pick up the android as antagonist angle that worked well in ""Alien"" and by extension ""Aliens.""

However, the latest installment does not bring anything new to the series, feeling like an episode of a science-fiction TV series at times.Ridley Scott comes back to direct what he created 40 years ago joined by acclaimed screenwriter John Logan, of ""Gladiator"" and ""Hugo"" and cinematographer and frequent collaborator Dariusz Wolski. Despite Scott's age, the veteran proves that he is still able to recreate the universe the once brilliantly displayed, with fast actions sequences and glorious special effects.""Alien: Covenant"" is set eleven years after the Prometheus expedition centering on the colonization ship Covenant's course to build a new world on a remote, earth-like planet. Nothing is as it seems on this apparently inhabitable planet, as alien lifeforms viciously attack the crew of the Covenant.
Michael Fassbender takes on the dual role of synthetic androids David, the former crew member of Prometheus and Walter, a newer model. Fassbender's dead-pan robotic performance makes him once again the ideal candidate for this type of role.The set-pieces and production design were great, relying on props, traditional make-up and costumes rather than straight up special effects. This gave the film a proper serious science-fiction experience.The film's main story isn't one of the most imaginative narrative lines ever written down. It's really just another movie where a spaceship lands on a planet that turns out to be dangerous. The most troublesome part of it is that it doesn't include a lot of xenomorphs and it doesn't really connect to the ""Prometheus"" idea of engineers being humanity's predecessors. It's more of a spiritual sequel because of the timeline and the ""accidental"" appearance of David when it should have explained more the philosophical themes of creation.""Alien: Covenant"" is a decent addition to the ""Alien"" franchise, but does to enough justice to the series or to the lore.",Alien - Covenant

405,bodhi-13262,In space...no one can hear you (unenthusiastically) scream.,5,26 May 2017,"'Alien: Covenant' is the second installment of the prequel films leading up to the original 'Alien' (1979). Being one of the most iconic monsters in horror-cinema, does the infamous Xenomorph lend itself to recapturing the scares as it once did?1. Ridley Scott returns to direct his third entry in the 'Alien Universe', with he previous ones being both the original 'Alien' as well as 'Prometheus'. It is quite easy to see that Scott is in fact the most invested in this franchise seeing as he has stuck around this long. Being such an accomplished director, Scott brings his signature style into the film giving it a nice flow as things progress. The editing is great since everything moves at a decent pace and I was never bored throughout. To Scott's credit, he knows how to keep an audience entertained or at least engaged to some extent. However it would be unwise to compare this film to any of his highly acclaimed works.2. This installment does in fact surpass it's predecessor 'Prometheus' on the grounds of it being a little more simple with the plot. When an unexpected accident occurs, members of a colonist crew are awakened on their way to a surveyed planet when they are intercepted by a random and mysterious transmission. To it's credit, the film wastes no time plunging the audience right into the action. After critics panned 'Prometheus' for being slow, boring and weak on story, the writers obviously got the message and tried their best to tighten things up with this one. As far as the scares go, I think audiences have become too familiar with the creature at this point to be in any kind of awe.3. From the trailers, they tried to convey that the Xenomorphs no longer need to burst through people's chests, but their backs as well. If there's anything we learned from 'Prometheus', the 'Engineers' weaponized a specific black goo that......well......does anything convenient for the plot. For something that was never fully explained before, there's still not much of an explanation in this one as well. I honestly didn't care too much for wracking my brain around the science this film was pushing, just as long as we got the alien we love incorporated with creepy thrills for the least. As far as the black goo and spores, nobody cares anymore. 4. The action is surprisingly well done but the horror and gore is nothing we haven't seen before. The crew consists of fourteen people, but we only get to know Michael Fassbender, Danny McBride, Katherine Waterston and Billy Crudup (to an extent). Everyone else (as you figured) is just to be killed off. There is a twist near the end that really is too obvious to not see coming. Once again, I still regard this as being better than 'Prometheus', but still it seems to fail in recapturing the horror or deliver the same thrills for a film that finally reintroduces the Xenomorph. ""Average"" is probably the best word to describe this film.Like I said, 'Alien: Covenant' is still entertaining, although I didn't feel cheated seeing this in theaters, it's still a middle-of- the- road sci-fi flick that doesn't quite exceed expectations.",Alien - Covenant

In Alien: Covenant English film director Ridley Scott returns to the universe he created, with ALIEN: COVENANT, a new chapter in his ground breaking ALIEN franchise. The crew of the colony ship Covenant, bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, discovers what they think is an uncharted paradise, but is actually a dark, dangerous world. When they uncover a threat beyond their imagination, they must attempt a harrowing escape.The cast in Alien: Covenant includes German actor Michael Fassbender (X-Men films, The Counsellor) as David / Walter, English actress Katherine Waterston (Inherent Vice, Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them) as Daniels, American actor Billy Crudup (Mission: Impossible 3, Watchmen) as Oram, American actor Danny McBride (Pineapple Express, The Heartbreak Kid) as Tennessee like as in the US State Tennessee, Mexican actor Demián Bichir (The Hateful Eight, Machete Kills) as Lope, English actress Carmen Ejogo (Selma, Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them) as Karine, American actor Jussie Smollett (The Mighty Ducks, North) as Ricks, American actress Callie Hernández (La La Land, Blair Witch 2016) as Upworth, American actress Amy Seimetz (Lovesong, I Believe In Unicorns) as Faris, Nathaniel Dean (Walking On Water, Somersault) as Hallett, Alexander England (Gods Of Egypt, Australian TV Series Wild Boys) as Ankor, Benjamin Rigby (Plague, Lion) as Ledward, Uli Latukefu (TV Series Marco Polo, Australian TV Series Devil's Playground) as Cole, Australian actress Tess Haubrich (Australian TV Series Home And Away, Infini) as Rosenthal, Australian actor Goran D. Kleut (Hacksaw Ridge, Gods Of Egypt) as Xenomorph / Neomorph, Andrew Crawford as Neomorph, American actor James Franco (Spider-Man films, Homefront and the older brother of American actor Dave Franco) as Branson and English actor Guy Pearce (Iron Man 3, Memento) as Peter Weyland.Filming locations in Alien: Covenant include Australia and New Zealand. Overall Alien: Covenant is a good sci-fi horror film filled with action, gory violence, sci-fi stuff, horror stuff, spaceships, air crafts, alien creatures, stunning scenery like mountains and hills, silence, darkness, dark caves, team work, togetherness, hard hitting scenes, flashing lights, scary scenes, on the edge of your seat stuff, bizarre scenes, good performances from Michael Fassbender and Katherine Waterston and many other things throughout the film. So I will give Alien: Covenant an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and Alien: Covenant is worth seeing if you like the Alien films, the Alien VS Predator films, Prometheus, Life, Men In Black films amongst others.So if you get the chance to see Alien: Covenant in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later and in my opinion Alien: Covenant is better than Prometheus, Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection but not as good as the two Alien films Alien from 1979 and Aliens from 1986. But if you are a fan of the Alien films franchise then you should go and see Alien: Covenant in the cinema.",Alien - Covenant
407,SteveResin,"""That's The Spirit!""",9,23 May 2017,"Go in with low expectations (which is good advice for any film, never mind a prequel to one of the greatest of all time) and you may be pleasantly surprised. Go in expecting the Ripley & Dallas era Alien experience and you'll be left wanting.There's not much of a story here, it's as basic as it gets. But it neatly borrows and gives subtle nods to the 1979 original here and there. A massive ship transporting thousands of people to colonize a distant planet gets caught in a solar storm and inadvertently picks up a beacon emanating from nearby (sound familiar?). The flight crew are woken by the ship and discover this newly found planet is more habitable than the one they're heading for (and changing their plans will trim seven years off their voyage into the bargain) and so decide to check it out for themselves with a view of staying there.After a slow build up this is where the action kicks in. What they hadn't bargained for is the fact that this new planet is home to the Engineers of the first Alien sequel Prometheus, and Elizabeth Shaw is the source of the beacon. As you can imagine danger, carnage & mayhem ensues. Oh, and a few xenomorphs.As always, aesthetically the film is in safe hands with Ridley at the helm. It looks gorgeous. The space scenes are magnificent. There's one scene midway through where a flashback reveals the fate of the Engineers at David's hands, and it's an awesome scene. The different types of xenomorphs look fantastic, and there are some suitably graphic and gory chest bursting scenes and visceral action that provide a good counter-balance to the more erudite and cerebral parts of the story.Michael Fassbender steals the show here. He reprises his role of David and also plays the Covenant ship's robot, this one called Walter. They both have completely different accents and personalities and Fassbender is utterly convincing as each one. The rest of the cast are capable and as characters are a massive improvement on Prometheus, they hark back to the original 1979 Alien and all seem like regular folk, without absurd eccentricities (yes I'm looking at you, Fifield and Millburn), and this is a good thing as this is without doubt Fassbender's film.If along with me you're one of the few who enjoyed Prometheus you should find a lot to like in Alien Covenant.

408,cliff_bd,Makes Alien Resurrection look good,5,15 May 2017,"***Contains spoilers***** Alien Covenant........... where to start......Firstly like everyone else who took time to write a review I was eagerly awaiting to see Alien Covenant.I went to the Movie Theater and after the movie finished, I came out feeling cold.God knows Prometheus was not perfect - but it least it left the audience asking many questions and there was the mystery around the who the engineers were, and why they wanted to kill off the human race with the virus and many other questions.So I was eagerly awaiting to see a movie with a great story that would answer at least some of the questions..... but what did we get? A synthetic (Android) with Daddy complex, who flew back to the engineers planet and wiped them out by using the virus on them.The Alien was more of a side story wrapped around the twist that it was the Android who worked on the virus to perfect the Alien form.I'm sorry but this is lazy writing and boring. This is not a return to form and in many ways Prometheus is superior to Covenant.The film is any other context would have been good (which is why I gave the movie a reluctant 6) - but for a Ridley Scott Alien movie.... it is not good enough and for me has destroyed the mystery behind where the Alien came from.Some people are saying that the film makers have once last chance left to redeem themselves in the final part of the Trilogy to be released in 2019 - but for me I cannot see that happening and I have lost faith in the Alien Prequel Franchise - Even worse the end of Alien Covenant sets up the Synthetic (Michael) to continue as a central character/theme of the final of the Trilogy. Come on!! What about the engineers? what about the Alien??? Hmmmm.... what to do now...? I will watch Alien Resurrection, maybe that will cheer me up!!",Alien - Covenant

410,lhunt-9,A brilliant disappointment,6,9 September 2017,"Alien Covenant is arguably the most imaginative and best-realized film in the Alien series since its genre-defining first chapter (and James Cameron's worthy sequel), an achievement for which Ridley Scott deserves full credit. There are so many points at which the film is original and stunning in its ability to imagine future worlds, realize advanced technologies, depict extraterrestrial landscapes, explore human-android relationships, and more. As always, the aliens themselves are stunningly well-developed. Further, the plot unfolds with similarly skilfully-crafted twists and turns. Who are the aliens? What is their origin, their purpose? Why have we encountered them? All of that is much clearer now. The progression of the story won't surprise any die-hard Alien franchise fans. One by one, the aliens do their damage to the vulnerable and exposed humans, who fight back fiercely and courageously against these acid-blooded killing machines given life. However, as the narrative evolved, I found that I reached a point of disappointment with the story that has become all too familiar while watching science fiction presented on film. While science fiction literature is diverse and often instructive, science fiction at the movies tends to revert to just four overworn themes, that is, they are, de rigueur: (1) dystopian, (2) apocalyptic, (3) quasi-military or (4) horror stories dressed up in science fiction garb. Well, in fairness, Alien has fallen into literally all four of these categories since the beginning, and yet transcended them, perhaps because human pluck and courage has always mattered, no matter how indestructible and relentless the aliens have always proved to be. Avoiding spoilers, I'll refraining from fleshing out my final disappointment in detail. It's not that the film is ""dark."" That is true of every film in the series, and I fully accept that as part of the package (and despite the fact that scfi film is lopsided with dark stories of all of the above- described types). Rather, I'm a science fiction fan and not a horror fan because I'm optimistic, at core, about where technological change is taking us (without, I think, being oblivious to technology's many shortcomings and counterproductivities). I believe Alien Covenant could have maintained its dark, even grim, thematics and still offered some rays of hope for its technologically optimistic followers. I think I understand why the Alien films take so many of the dark turns that they do, and that in itself is not a problem at all. However, in the end, when faced with pursuing fresh ideas or nipping down the first available dark path, Alien Covenant chose the dark pathway reflexively --- really carelessly, when far more interesting and imagination- bending themes could have been explored instead. I wish Mr. Scott had spoken with me first, before finalizing the script!",Alien - Covenant
411,Thekeybaldemasterrises,Are people really surprised how dumb this movie is?,5,19 May 2017,"Let's be real here Ridley Scott did NOT need to make a prequel to Alien. Just like Peter Jackson did not need to make the Hobbit trilogy. And just like how George Lucas did NOT need to make a prequel to Star Wars. Yet they did why? Because they know we're gonna eat it up and see it. Ridley Scott is clearly running out of steam here and continues to find ways to continue the Alien saga when it's just unnecessary. The mystery element to the original and even James Cameron's Aliens was what kept the creature so interesting. We didn't need to know where the Xenomorph came from it was just a product of nature, and space from the great unknown. It's terrifying, and it's arguably one of the most iconic monsters in cinema. I've never actually reviewed Prometheus and I didn't want to, it left me super disappointed and confused, especially because the plot was really engaging for me. By the end it was fine, and I knew at that point whatever Scott cooks up is most likely filler to get back to the original movie. Alien Covenant is exactly that, it's filler. There's no reason for this movie to exist in the story it just does. I knew that going in, and you know what? I enjoyed it! It's not original or groundbreaking, but rather just a dumb B horror movie. It works, it surprisingly worked for me. There's plenty of scares, gore, and Xenomorph action to keep you satisfied if you're willing to see it for what it is. It's trying to be a sequel to Prometheus, a prequel to Alien, and really a remake of Alien itself. It's like what Jurassic World did for Jurassic Park, or The Force Awakens did for a New Hope. It relies on old familiar beats and sequences to keep you invested in what's going on. I wasn't mad at it for that, I really enjoyed seeing the Xenomorphs in CGI for the first time in the theatre, they looked pretty good. Mostly good performances, in particular Michael Fasbender who I truly believe his David from Prometheus and this new Alien Covenant will go down as one of the greatest sci fi villains in history. He's so awful I love it, every time he's on screen. Just eerie, creepy and psychotic I really liked him. The crew just lacks any logic and fumbles through these horrible situations and it's massively entertaining. Of course the characters make dumb decisions it's a dumb movie! Apparently the sequel to this movie will happen before this one. It's a midquel between Prometheus and Covenant. What sense does that make? That's what I'm getting at there's no rhyme or reason for this movie to actually exist, but it does and you have to enjoy it for what it is. I apologize if you were expecting something intelligent or groundbreaking from Ridley Scott but the reality is he's lost his way as a great filmmaker. That's the honest truth. He sees dollar signs and nothing more. If anything he should've let Fox give Neil Blomkamp permission to move forward with his Alien film since it sounds like the majority of people want to see a real sequel to Aliens. Knowing Scott though, sounds like we're stuck with his goofy nonsense of twenty more prequels. Hopefully the new Blade Runner 2049 can retain some of the original magic in a new exciting way and I have faith Dennis Villanueve can pull it off. Bottom line is if your expectations are high you might wanna lower them. If your expectations are low, you might actually really enjoy it! Go find out for yourself everyone's a critic. I'll say it's a good time.",Alien - Covenant

I was a little bit hyped for this movie, but waited because like Prometheus it looked good at first but couldn't deliver like the old Alien movies could, did and still do. So finally the released it on bluray I watched it and I gotta say the person who handled the script can't be human. It must have been a retarded version of David the cyborg. Because this movie is like the worst. I got angry because the crew is so unbelievably stupid it hurts all over my body. I mean I know this is the formula that have been ''working'' since the 70's but if you decide to waste 2 hours of your life on this garbage they call movie. Then you will see how really idiotic the story is. Not just the story, Just how are we suppose to believe a ship with ''over 2000 colonists'' don't have guns or anything on ship like that. And also when you land on a unexplored planet... YOU USE THE FREAKING SPACE-SUIT ! ! ! Just because there is oxygen doesn't mean oh yeah let's just stroll right into a deep forest with lots of plants and other life forms we never seen before... La-di-da-da No from the start I couldn't live myself in this scenario of these guys being trained for this mission more than. Are you human? Check, Are you able to make stupid decisions? Check, Have you been tested psychologically? No? Oh Then you are the perfect choice for a expedition which will take almost 10 years and you will be responsible for over 2000 lives. I mean After a while when they keep making more and more idiotic choices. I just gave up and waited for the movie to be over. And also the ending. They never saw the cyborgs David and Walter. But still they're just like. Oh you gotta be Walter because you helped me it's not like David could've cut off his arm and posed as Walter. I could go on forever, just do yourself a favor and don't bother. The movie is worse than Prometheus if that was possible. You got the exact same line-up as before.

When it comes to extending on a franchise you already have themes and characters that the audience already know. But if you go back to the classic book on script writing, Save the Cat, you need people you can emphasize with, but I couldn't find one. Halfway through I was thinking 'Who am I meant to care about in this, the alien?' In the end I didn't even bother watching the third act, so maybe it got really good, but I didn't wait to find out.The direction of the film was good. The lighting, the effects, the sound, all quality. You can tell that there is a good team behind this production.But maybe they were waiting for the next episode, which is what they are going to put everything in to. If so I wished they had gone back to the basics, making it more tense, less CGI.",Alien - Covenant
414,stegasaurob,"What happened, Ridley?",1,18 January 2020,"Ridley Scott was once a great director. His first feature film, The Duellists, is one of my all-time favourites. What the FLIP happened to him? This movie isn't just bad, it's totally fricking crazy. It seems to be bits of half a dozen completely different movies in different genres stuck together with sellotape.On the upside, 90-95% of the time it looks great. But the other 5-10% of the time it looks totally pathetic. The spaceship interiors are wonderfully realised and the locations for the on-planet scenes are gorgeous. But the xenomorph effects are some of the worst CGI I've seen since the 90s, and the less said about the bonkers back-story cut-scene in the middle the better.Everything in this movie is so bad it's hard to pick a worst element, but if I had to I'd go for the script. It reads like it was written by a bunch of monkeys with a cliche-generator in the space of a couple of hours over a particularly boozy Hollywood lunch. Every single line is terrible, and the story (what little there is of it) is so full of holes it's laughable.The movie adds nothing to the Alien(s) universe. All the bits that are supposed to be clever references back to earlier Alien films just come across as lazy and unorignal. Just like the xenomoprh, this franchise seems to be impossible to kill. If I never see anything ejected from an airlock ever again it'll be too soon.",Alien - Covenant

I'm sure most of those that loved this are paid or related to someone involved in making this movie, sigh...oops almost fell asleep (again) trying to think of what happened in this horrid sequel.Truly wish Hollywood would stop trying to squeeze every ounce of movie fan support out of every sequel. It makes it harder for more worthy films to get the support needed. At least, stop using the original title names deceiving movie fans and having us hope for exciting additions.Now to the movie. Poor script making characters seem inconsistently inexperienced, incompetent and incapable of being certified to being a professional let alone a qualified space-traveler. Might as well had teenagers get lost in space on a school trip, sigh...Even the so-called evolution of androids were weak/unbelievable and wildly inconsistent.

I was hoping for some explanation to the inferred superiority of the engineers but none is given, any assumption we have made is walked back as they are so easily destroyed by their own weapons.Another glaring problem I have is with David and his development of the ""perfect organism"". So strange he considers the xenomorph a perfect organism. How could an organism that kills anything else alive be perfect? The inability to coexist, communicate, integrate with another advanced species is ""perfect""? David requests and enjoys music developed by humans, he copies the instruments and wants to hear the music played when he has the opportunity. Can a xenomorph write symphonies? Wouldn't a perfect organism be more pleasant to look at, have a more balanced aesthetic? Wouldn't it reproduce in a more pleasurable/harmonious way (as humans do)?David is extremely inconsistent and illogical.Beyond all this, great science fiction mayhem within.",Alien - Covenant

420,littleging12,A Gorgeously Thrilling 'Detour',7,1 June 2017,"Ridley Scott's long awaited sequel to Prometheus delivers an Alien-esque thriller as well as a continuation of Prometheus. Alien: Covenant is more of an Alien film -- made obvious by the title -- which for better or worse, is ultimately not the direction this film should have gone in. However, it does provide a lot of thrills, wonderfully stunning set pieces, and Michael Fassbender acting opposite Michael Fassbender. Yet at the same time it spews out a load of disposable characters, predictable outcomes, and just an overall lack of mythological depth that made Prometheus so interesting.Some of the best aspects of Alien: Covenant are its visuals which can't be beat. The sets are so tangible it's like you are actually visiting another world. The performances are really good especially Michael Fassbender's masterful reprisal of David, the curiously malevolent android from Prometheus, and his new character Walter, a much more emotionally toned down android. His characters/performances really gave this film some much needed depth (if only briefly explored) with the philosophies regarding creators and their creations. Also there's Danny McBride whose natural comedic presence is a joy to watch. Ridley Scott expertly crafts some intensely thrilling scenes the Alien franchise is known for. There's a few alien body bursting scenes as well as a badass robot fight between Michael Fassbender's two characters. Ridley Scott really excels with creating dazzling visuals, gut-wrenching intensity, and horrific xenomorph scares.After the criticism Prometheus received it's safe to assume that Ridley Scott took that to heart and just wanted to deliver the fans what they wanted: a superficial bloodbath with gore gore and more gore to scare the bejesus out of the audience. That only can take this movie so far; it needs more story and mystery. Alien: Covenant, simply, failed as a sequel to Prometheus where it didn't answer the questions raised in that film nor did it pick up its storyline as effectively as it should. It only created more questions like: are there more engineers out there? Why does David go psychotic and kill all the engineers? Why does David have long hair if he is a robot with artificial hair? Why was the engineers home planet not picked up by the scanners? Why did the space colonists not wear any helmets while trekking on an alien planet? Why is James Franco even in this movie?Alien: Covenant is too visually stunning, thrilling, and Michael Fassbendery to be bad. Although it was too predictable, superficial, and simple to be memorable. It was a detour literally and figuratively. These colonists literally pit stop on a newly discovered planet only to meet their untimely demise. Figuratively not much is answered or expanded upon from Prometheus and Alien lore. Ridley Scott thought he could just distract us from unoriginality by just throwing in as much xenomorphs, gore, visuals, thrills, and Michael Fassbender as possible. And, surprisingly, somehow, he makes it work.",Alien - Covenant
421,plpregent,Disgraceful,4,29 May 2017,"I was very appreciative of the fact that Prometheus answered questions that had been left in the air for decades after the release of the first Alien film.By doing so, it also expanded its very own universe and took a tangent that blended the concepts of evolution, genetics and the origins of mankind in an equally beautiful and terrifying manner. Prometheus certainly divided audiences, leaving many people (including myself) very satisfied with the answers it provided to many unanswered questions and with its newly-generated mystery that took quite a creative twist. On the other hand, it also left many people frustrated with what they considered to be silly twists in an established franchise where such existential questions as those raised in Prometheus had never been brought to the table. My appreciation of Prometheus, besides its technical qualities, stemmed from its ability to answer questions through hints that fostered fascination towards the Alien universe while leaving just enough room for the viewer's imagination to fill in blanks, which felt like they were left there exactly for that purpose. Alien: Covenant disappoints on so many levels, it is unlikely to divide audiences like Prometheus did.What was first supposed to take place directly after Prometheus went through re-writes and ultimately became Alien: Covenant, a messy, uneven and mediocre entry in perhaps one of the greatest sci-fi series of all time. Kicking things off with an awkwardly executed opening sequence filled with poorly-written dialogue, it quickly became obvious that the film's pace would not be one of its great assets. Same goes for characters, many of which remain almost totally anonymous for the entire runtime, while others are just plain annoying or nonsensical. Visually, this is, by far, the poorest of all Alien films, as the photography lacks the enchanting beauty of Prometheus, the iconic and hypnotic bite of Alien and Aliens, or the nightmarish punch of Alien3 and Alien: Resurrection. Moreover, some of the digital imagery is very poor and looks just plain silly.The most painful part remains the writing: a vast majority of characters lack any serious depth. It could have been very satisfying to see the character of David return, as some of his actions in Prometheus seemed randomly evil or felt like they warranted some kind of explanation. Instead, Alien: Covenant falls into the trap of overly explaining everything through dialogue or monologues – which, again, are poorly written for the most part – wiping out David's mystique almost entirely and clumsily directing the storyline towards a predictable tangent that would have profited from being more delicately introduced through a continuation of David's actions. Although some of the ideas in there are quite good, the execution lacks any sense of subtlety whatsoever. At times, Alien: Covenant feels like it's busier bridging Prometheus to the rest of the series than it is being a film on its own. And I should add that it does not manage to successfully achieve that goal either.Oddly enough, Ridley Scott's direction is really tame. The action is often times confusingly depicted (the editing does not help), and some moments make Alien: Covenant feel more like a summer blockbuster than a chapter in a refined sci-fi series. That is a major disappointment, considering that this is the man who directed the original Alien film and Prometheus. Jean-Pierre Jeunet and David Fincher managed to better capture the spirit of the series with their direction than the man himself, in this latest entry. I also read in a couple of reviews that this was the bloodiest entry in the Alien franchise. To those people, I highly suggest watching Alien: Resurrection again.Ultimately, I felt like I should have skipped this one, or ignored it. Big disappointment.",Alien - Covenant
422,Mynameisroman,"Not good, not bad, just sad...",6,26 May 2017,Compared to Alien 1-4 and Prometheus this move is the weakest. It tries to be everything in a way but doesn't succeed in anything. it should have focused on one thing only like Alien set the focus on suspense and horror or the second one focused on action. but here... the first half of the movie was more or less a 6 or 7. it builds up to something and as soon as you get some major intel about whats happening here... wtf? but not the good kind of wtf just the bad kind... There was almost no character development. for that there were just too many characters in that movie. i think around 15 people... but i only remember five or maybe six of them. The CGI of those Aliens was also not really great. And when you saw the Alien everything was cut very fast so not much to look there anyway. also a lot of questions of prometheus remain unanswered. and the continuity to the first Alien is messed up and doesn't fit any more. bye bye jockey i guess? well nothing more to tell without spoiling anything...

423,LiamCullen6,A return to form,8,11 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant has a familiar narrative: a crew on a mission in space encounter an alien lifeform, become ""infected"" and have to fight for their survival. Yet this doesn't feel like a remake of the original Alien movie, or a sub-par spin-off. This feels fresh and exciting; breathing life into the saga once more.The movie didn't feel slow at any point in time - despite the fact that it does spend a fair amount of time building up - and didn't feel too long. The writing, directing, and pacing are all excellent: Ridley Scott's signature recipe.Without giving anything away, we see the return of a (very) familiar face, although major developments have been made since our last encounter, which are - thankfully - well explained. We are given answers (although not all) to questions raised previously, and given the information needed to chronologically connect Alien: Covenant to the rest of the saga. This movie goes to great lengths to redeem and justify the preceding Prometheus movie.All in all, Alien: Covenant is a fantastic addition to the Alien franchise. If you are a fan of the Alien movies and were left feeling at all disheartened after Prometheus, I can recommend this movie to you without reservation. Not only does it make up for Prometheus' shortfalls, it infinitely adds to the saga, before carefully setting up for further instalments. The combination of revelations from and developments since Prometheus, engaging cast members, plot twists, commitment to staying true to its roots and simultaneous innovations, make for a stellar watch.",Alien - Covenant

426,MichaelNontonMulu,Another Sci Fi Horror Thriller Movie in Alien Franchise,7,10 May 2017,"Well, this movie was rather enjoyable as a sci-fi horror movie. It had the ingredients of the usual Alien franchise movies and it was directed by Ridley Scott who also directed the original Alien movie, as well as Prometheus. Now those of you who did not follow the Alien films, this movie was a direct sequel of Prometheus released in 2012. It was the second movie to a supposedly trilogy of prequel before the events of Alien which spawned to 3 more sequels. So it is already the 6th movie relating to these aliens (excluding the movie Alien Vs Predator).Back to the film itself, my wife and I enjoyed the suspense and action sequences whenever the aliens were around and trying to do some killing (she quite frequently screamed whenever there was shocking scene). However, I for one was feeling that the first part of the movie was moving in a rather slow pace. We would not be having the suspenseful part until after one third of the movie. And even then, I felt there were too much breathing time especially during the conversations scenes which made the movie rather than having almost nonstop suspenseful time, became less horrifying. I get that the movie was trying to show the background story towards the Alien, but personally I felt it took too long (or rather too deep). Although, I had to admit that the action sequences were top notch! You would not be disappointed in those parts, especially with the very very cool special effects. And if you are watching it in a theater with good sound systems, then you would be even more satisfied with the sound effects (the voice the aliens making were amazingly added to the element of suspense).As for the story itself, it was actually good and it did provide us more understanding about the origin of the aliens which you would not have guessed. There was also the classic ending of an Alien movie which would be the background of the future sequel(s). But there was no post- credit scene, so there is no need to wait to watch it, if you happened to like seeing these scenes. Another point that I would like to highlight here was that out of the 15 crews here, I think most of them did not stood out, except for Tennessee's character. I guess 15 were too much? And it was rather unfortunate that Daniels character did not seem to be too convincing as a female heroine, much lesser if you compared with Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. But then again, that's my opinion.If you are a true fan of Alien franchise and really love the story involving aliens (or as they called it xenomorph), then I am very sure you would definitely be enjoying this one. Now if you are a fan of full action movie though, pls be reminded that despite having a 2 hour duration, the action suspenseful sequences may not be satisfying enough. And as I said above, this is the 6th movie in Alien franchise so it is highly recommended that you see Prometheus first before watching this one to avoid having difficulty in understanding the main story. for my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",Alien - Covenant

430,lexva5,Good entertainment,8,20 July 2017,"Having seen only the first Alien and Aliens and missed the rest, I came directly to this wondering about the hype but not having read the critics. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed this outing which had instances reminiscent of the first two films, like the opening of the alien eggs and people staring in, the stomach scene, captain vs mother alien fight in space, which I enjoyed. The opening scene starts brilliantly with a bit of philosophy thrown in. This thread of thought gets lost during the proceedings especially when show time begins and the horror of who's next to get the chop starts. This is later regained and the film ends suggestively, indicating where the future is pointing to (which is reminiscent of our human past of the first half of the 20th century). The film does feel at times as if it is trying to fill certain obligations or ticking some boxes, like the death by numbers, obligatory explosions from incidental apparently lesser mishaps, people slipping as they are being chased etc which dumbs down the film . Still I enjoyed the film and the whole concept of it re creation and its manipulation,and thought the way the film wraps up the proceedings remains true to its theme, though I would have preferred a different ending. The acting was very good especially that of Michael Fassbinder who dominates the film with his persona, despite as an android he had to convey a certain rigidity. His (apparent) self kissing is the weirdest scene in the film which also sticks to mind, it sums up what the whole process of creation manipulation is about. I recommend this film, though with an open mind",Alien - Covenant
431,chandanshivaramu,Scott's Beta Testing Product that is half baked yet ingenious and ambivalent,7,16 May 2017,"Firstly, I along with millions of alien fans had so much excitement in seeing the xenomorph after the debacle of Alien:4 and the utter uselessness of Alien:3.The creature returns with menace and surprisingly friendly towards the older Fassbender who is the creator of this genetically modified black gooy virus.The movie has its scary moments and i think some scenes are scarier than all of the other alien movies combined. As usual, some of the characters are poorly developed. I wonder what Mr. Franco is doing in 60-70 seconds presence in this movie? Was he picked for a prequel of Covenant itself? only Scott would know.Overall the movie doesn't match the novelty, grandeur and the mystery of Prometheus. Instead of upping the ante, the key connecting part after Shaw and David take off in the space jockey ship to paradise earth, the entire sequence is crunched in few seconds which is utterly nonsensical and foolish on Scott's part. This sequence alone deserved a full 20 minutes IMHO. Because, it is so magnificent with all the ships floating and the engineer population looking towards a WW2'isque genocide.The opening and ending scenes of Prometheus were just brilliant and superbly shot. This flick falls flat in both. The later half of the film is mostly dark and the production details cant be appreciated in its entirety.Dani is no Ripley or even Shaw. She is dull, lifeless and unattractive. The only lead character is the magnificent Fassbender.I think this flick deserves to be watched at least 2-3 viewings just to appreciate the ""methods in madness"" of Fassbender and underlying history and hostility towards his creators.There are still some open questions that are left unanswered in this flick.. Example.. the eggs in alien:1 are older than the eggs in this flick. So, David's genetic experiments are not really breakthroughs in real sense as they are already proved by the engineers back in their days.. (space jockey pre-prometheus).Also the lead time of airborne virus infecting and alien creature bursting is quite fast. even the facehugger to alien formation is quicker. its unlike the one we saw in alien:1 where it takes hours and hours for Mr Hurt to explode. maybe the engineers knew a different recipe which is a fool proof mass scale worthy.. where as David is still doing experiments and he might reach maturity in the next 2 prequels.. who knows.. My wife actually slept while watching the movie after 2nd half.. so its safe to say that the scare levels are quite scattered and it just doesn't quite match the gradual buildup of the seminal alien:1. I watched the special edition of alien:1 to confirm this :-).Overall i would say, the xenomorph lovers will be intrigued by some of the scenes in Covenant as they are unique and breathtaking all because of the presence of David, the heartbeat of this beta product.",Alien - Covenant
432,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,A better Prometheus sequel but a mediocre Alien film,6,21 May 2017,"When I went into watching Covenant on opening night, I went in with neither excitement nor hesitation but was just curious. I was one of the people who didn't hate Prometheus because I admired the new mythology Ridley Scott was trying to create. However, I could see that it was poorly executed especially when connecting to Alien. Covenant improves on those ideas with better-written characters but in the end mostly fails as a memorable Alien film.The parts I liked the most surprisingly were the Prometheus tie-ins. The film constantly delves on the ideas of creation, religion and faith without feeling as forced like in Prometheus. From the opening scene of android David's ""birth"" to the crew of the Covenant being a colony ship carrying couples, the film carries on these philosophical ideas while tying in very well with the origin of the iconic Xenomorph. While it does not explain everything that was left open in Prometheus, it does feel satisfying that Covenant tries to give some answers rather then just leave with questions.Once again Michael Fassbender proves to be the standout of this film. But this time he shows off double the effort when he plays two androids, the original David and the Covenant's own personal android Walter. David gets to be a lot more fleshed out and we get a better understanding behind his questionable actions. And as Walter, Fassbender displays a more restrained, machine-like personality but still conveying a sense of loyalty to the crew. And seeing the two Fassbender's interact with one with each other were the most compelling scenes in the film even if one scene was unintentionally hilarious. Danny McBride should also be credited for taking on a role more serious then his usual ones in comedy. Billy Crudup also was good as a religious man whose leadership is conflicted with his Christian beliefs. Katherine Waterston did well in the lead role but is not as unique as compared the Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley. And now here is where the film's faults become very present. While the characters are an improvement from Prometheus, the movie's plot forces them to make choices that feel out of character and silly. Probably my biggest disappointment was the titled creature itself. The Xenomorph does not show up till maybe like 20 minutes towards the end and its presence just feels like a forced afterthought. And I didn't mind the Xenomorph being more cg-heavy when compared to past films but the subtlety of the creature hiding and waiting to pounce from the darkness was gone. With the creature attacking right out in the opening and Ridley Scott showing too much of it on camera, it no longer felt like the intelligent, calculative killing machine I remembered. It became just another dumb generic movie monster. Even the Alien doppelgänger movie that came this year, Life, was a better Alien movie then this actual Alien movie.The film also has twist ending that leaves a lot of plot holes to examine and is just more annoying and stupid then smart.In the end Covenant will satisfy those who had problems with Prometheus convoluted mythology with some intriguing sci-fi ideas but if you're looking for a great monster movie then watch the first two Alien films then this one.",Alien - Covenant
433,ChristianLeFeuvre,"Not the best in the franchise, but watchable",4,12 February 2021,"'Alien: Covenant' is the follow-up to the movie 'Prometheus' and the second of the prequels and origin stories of the much loved 'Alien' franchise.
This film is set 10 years after the events of 'Prometheus', and sees the colony ship Covenant on its travels to a planet named Origae-6 with 2000 colonists, plus 2000 extra embryos.
After an energy surge in space damages the ship the crew members are brought out of their hyper-sleep but during the surge the hyper-sleep capsule of the captain is compromised, resulting in his death.
While the remaining crew members set about their repairs, they receive a garbled transmission and track the signal to a near-by planet, which is not only closer by could prove to be a better place to colonise. Newly instated Captain Oram (Billy Crudup) defies his crews concerns and decides an investigation is the right thing to do, and leads an expeditionary force down to investigate.
However, this decision turns out to be a mistake..........who knew?
'Alien; Covenant' is directed by Ridley Scott, who directed the original 1979 film, which is easily the best of all the 'Alien' films.
Now, Ridley Scott is an amazing director and when it comes to sci-fi, there aren't too many directors out there that are better at the genre than Scott. His vision when making films is outstanding, the look you get on screen is stunning, and the suspense in his films is done so brilliantly it has the viewer inching ever closer to the edge of their seat, before the shock reveal has them jumping back again, (unfortunately this film seriously lacks that 'edge-of-the-seat' suspense).
I will say that this film is visually spectacular. The cinematography is amazing and has some stunning landscape shots, some of the special effects are incredible (I'll talk about the CGI creatures later), and you can see that Scott has gone out of his way, as he always does in his films by the way, to use as little green screen as possible.
There are some seriously stand out moments. The emergence of the Neomorph (a new alien creature and what looked like it was supposed to be a precursor to the familiar Xenomorph) from the back of one of the crew, the visuals of the landing craft coming down to the surface were both very impressive. These, and the scenes between the synthetics David and Walter are, for me, the highlights of the film.
Unfortunately though, for me, there are far more negatives than positives about 'Alien: Covenant'.
As I said, this is the second of the prequels and origin stories of the 'Alien' franchise. Seriously, haven't producers and directors learned from the diabolical Star Wars prequels that origin stories are not necessary, and just end up milking the franchise for all the money they can get out if it, regardless of story quality or sense.
This latter point is proven in 'Alien: Covenant'. There is no real sense or reasoning to go and check out this nearer planet or the transmission. It would have made more sense if the transmission was a genuine SOS which they could not ignore.
Now, there was a lot of backlash about 'Prometheus' and how it was a bit complicated. It was promoted as the first of the prequels to 'Alien' and so many went into it expecting seeing Xenomorphs (the aliens), they didn't get what they were expecting and there were a lot of complaints. Well, in this film the continuing storyline of 'Prometheus' is sort of skimmed over in favour of bowing to public demand, so the screenwriters have seemed to mash up both 'Prometheus' and 'Alien'. So, here we get a few answers from questions left hanging from 'Prometheus', but in truth this is just another 'Alien' movie....
just not as good.I was going to say there were too many characters, but most get killed off so it's fine. You find that you won't really care too much anyway because there is no real character development. We are never given the chance to find out too much about them to form any real attachment. The flashback 'blink and you'll miss it' cameo from James Franco as the now deceased captain, from what I could work out, seemed to serve no purpose. Another point I have is that you can pretty much tell when someone is going to die, they go down that stereotypical horror cliché route of having the characters go off for a cigarette, or a shower, and it's so familiar now that it's too obvious, so it loses its shock value.
Katherine Waterston's character Daniels, who is meant to be the one the audience connects with the most, isn't given the material she deserves. The film assumes that because her husband, who was the captain, dies that the audience will automatically connect with her, but we don't. There are also hints toward comparisons in her character to Ripley from the originals........no, just no.
The performances from the actors were good, but only Fassbender really stood out. Danny McBride is believable as the pilot Tennessee, Katherine Waterston does a good job as Daniels but most of the other actors were relegated to a few brief lines, and not given much to do.
Michael Fassbender, without question, steals every scene with his brilliant duel performance as both new synthetic Walter, and David (the synthetic from Prometheus left stranded on the planet) and the scene where the two are together is very well done and easily the most compelling part of the film.
The face-huggers are back of course, but I found the intended 'scare' element of this wasn't there as we're all familiar with what happens, and when the chest-busting scene looks far more fake than that from the 1979 original, you know there is a problem (Scott directed the original Alien in a time where there was no CGI. That film is known for the amazing creature design that was made famous for its use of practical effects. So for Scott to use so much CGI in this film was very disappointing). I even had a bit of a giggle seeing how fake the white Neomorph looked.
There is a 'twist' at the end, which I won't spoil, but I have to say, it's not too much of a surprise.
'Alien: Covenant' isn't a bad movie, it's just not particularly memorable. I left the cinema a bit disappointed.
Anyway, if you love the 'Alien' movies, I'd advise you to stick to the originals, (well, the first and the second especially).",Alien - Covenant

As a massive Alien fan I found some of the ideas and long hidden questions about the Xenomorph, where did it come from?, as an interesting revelation. Positively I found the film stunning in every scene visually its a masterpiece, but unfortunately that's about it. Negatively I found the Xenomorph very cool looking but again the CGI kills it for me, I love the suit and animatronics of the original and sequel to be far superior. I also couldn't get over how unbelievably dumb everyone is on the ship, these are the people that are going to save mankind....yikes, might want wipe rinse and repeat, just one dumb thing after another, I found myself shaking my head a lot during the film, what where they thinking!?.

437,uroshnor54,Fairly Enjoyable,7,23 May 2017,"I'm kind of surprised at some of the harsh negative reviews here. Alien: Covenant isn't great, but it's certainly not terrible. Then again, I guess my opinion of the movie is related to my expectations for it. I'll admit, I never had enough invested in the franchise to be seriously disappointed by the shortcomings of a new installment. I like the first Alien. I think Aliens is a bit overpraised. It's okay, but I found the marines to be kind of annoying, since they don't act anything like you'd expect real soldiers to act like, and the corporate villain was just too silly. And I thought Prometheus was kind of interesting. I haven't seen 3, Resurrection, or the two AVP movies.Anyway, Covenant, which I thought was more fun than Prometheus, is flawed, but once the characters start exploring a new planet without any special suits or anything you know what you're in for. The action starts quickly, and when it does it doesn't stop until the end. Even during the slower sequences, there's quite a bit of tension.The actors are fine in their roles. None of the characters are particularly memorable, but that's fine. Just the situation they're in makes me sympathize with them.I liked the score, too, especially the use of Jerry Goldsmith's music for the first movie.One criticism I have is that the planet, while well shot, looks boring. I kind of wished it looked more, umm, alien. Also, the philosophical aspect of the movie felt kind of forced. There's this one character who says he's religious, but this isn't explored at all. And I think films need to earn quotes from Milton and the Romantic poets, which this one really doesn't. I won't get into all the plot holes, bad decisions made by the characters, and things that just don't make sense, since other people have gone over these. They're there all right, I just didn't mind them that much.I can understand why some more dedicated fans of the Alien series might not like Covenant, but as a more casual viewer I enjoyed it. I'll keep going to the theaters to watch these, too, because of the dearth of high-budget, sci-fi blockbusters that don't involve superheroes - not that I consider superhero movies to be sci-fi anyway (and people do remember they're for elementary school kids, right?).",Alien - Covenant
438,ReelLifeReviews,A return to horror roots,7,26 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant - More horror than sci-fi, this prequel/sequel adds major elements to the overall canon of the Alien series. After a slow start, the engaging performances and beautiful set design make this a worthy successor to Prometheus.I have yet to see Michael Fassbender give a bad performance. He is given two roles in this movie and knocks them both out, showing distinct differences between the two. Billy Crudup also shines through with surprising success. I unfortunately can't say the same for Katherine Waterston, who plays the main character. Sigourney Weaver made the strong female an integral part of this series with Noomi Rapace doing an admiral job of carrying that banner in Prometheus. Waterston just seems out of place in her role.I will say it takes a while for it to feel like an Alien movie. The first third feels like standard science fiction fare with only minor esthetic similarities to the originals. But, when it does start to present story beats of the franchise, it doesn't stop. A common complaint of Prometheus was that it didn't really add to or explain pieces of the originals. Covenant puts those complaints to bed, allowing you to see Alien in a whole new light.While it wasn't as great as I was hoping, there's no denying the importance of this film to the franchise as a whole. Movies in a series can't just be made to fill in gaps to tell a larger story, however. Luckily Covenant brings plenty to the table that it stands on it's own as a success: great tension, high quality production design, and two Fassbenders. What more could you ask for?",Alien - Covenant
439,pkneer,Visually Beautiful But Predictable,7,20 May 2017,"I have been a fan of the Alien series since in the beginning (yes, I'm that old, haha). This movie went in places I was not expecting, but it was fairly easy to predict how the movie was going to end. First, the movie was very well made - Ridley Scott does know how to make a movie with sets and realism. This and the performances were also very good. I did not necessarily find the cast unlikable as I had read in some reviews. Probably the biggest negative for me was the fact that whenever an alien was in a scene, it was obviously CG and I always wish for special effects similar to the original Alien film where the alien was really there. A couple of times, I just felt I was watching a cartoon creature and it took away from the scene's strengths. I knew the timing of the film was after Prometheus and before the original Alien, but it didn't fill in the gaps completely - perhaps subsequent films will do that. I rate the film a 7/10 due to superb cinematography and set design as well as being fairly fast paced once the aliens are introduced. Not as good as Alien, Aliens, or Prometheus, but better than III and Resurrection (not saying too much there).",Alien - Covenant
440,northernpaladin,Ridley Scott failure,4,28 March 2020,"If ever a film defines a director's decline this is it. Ridley Scott used to be a good director, a man with a eye for the visual (think 'The Duelists'), intriguing ideas (Alien, Blade Runner), great script (Gladiator), socially relevant (Thelma & Louise), but he has long since sold out for the money, the easy shoot and the arrogance. This is insulting and a complete mess. The idea makes absolutely no sense and the heaven and hell metaphors really are condescending. No character is memorable or interesting and the David/Walter idea is riseable (I actually laughed). There are a couple of heart pumping moments but you soon realise how manipulated you have been.
Ridley, just stop.",Alien - Covenant
441,paulmcuomo,"All the wrong decisions, both within and outside of the film",4,13 July 2017,"Obviously, it's fair to say that a large amount of directors have been privileged to have a crack at the Alien franchise - there's been the fantastic James Cameron with Aliens, the exceptional David Fincher with Alien 3 that while he hates that film I thought was fine, and French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet with assistance from Joss Whedon with Alien Resurrection. However, Ridley Scott was the first and is the most infamous, and in terms of franchise, I would say that Alien is strong: I liked the first, loved the second, was fine with the third and the fourth is garbage, but fun garbage.I was then really looking forward to Prometheus when I saw it in cinemas and was very disappointed with it, for its idiotic characters, lack of focus, expository dialogue and audience insulting antics of stupid science in the infamous caesarean scene, or just straight up refusing to answer any questions.With this film, I hoped that a lot of my questions would be answered, or that Ridley would fix a lot of the issues. He does not. In my opinion, this is only mildly better than Prometheus: whilst Prometheus starts strong and gets weaker as it goes on, Covenant gets better, but not my much.Oh, by the way, James Franco's in this movie. Yep. True, he blows up after 20 seconds and in a part that could've been played by the second unit directors brother, but he's there.The very telling fact about this movie is that Ridley Scott took the wrong advice away from Prometheus and has pretty much decided with this film to forget all about it. We know this because there both the interviews where he says this, and also the fact that they literally nuke everything set-up in the last film. And it causes more confusion than answers AGAIN! Seriously, in Prometheus, the Engineers made the Xenomorphs, but apparently not because in this, David from the last film is the real creator of the Xenomorphs. And Shaw, who I was quite interested in following, is killed offscreen by David which felt really cheap.Speaking of cheap, the characterisation of EVERYONE in this film outside of Michael Fassbender's exceptional portrayals the androids David and Walter and a few others, is so non-descript that it goes beyond lazy. Most of the time, I had to Wikipedia for names afterwards because everyone is referred to as ""my wife"" or ""my husband"" SO GODDAMN OFTEN you will know no-one by name. The only real exception, and the only fully formed character is, to my massive surprise, Danny McBride as the ships captain, Tennessee, as has the distinction of a personality - he's a hard drinking, driven professional who will go to great lengths to save the crew when serious s**t goes down. By contrast, Katherine Waterston, who plays 'Not Ripley' Daniels, is wasted: she comes alive for the action scenes, but there's only two that she's involved in for the final act. Apart from that, Daniels is a boring bland stand-in for Ripley or even Shaw. Then everyone is either meant to die, or just too stupid to live. Here's the level of characterisation, Demian Bichir is in the film, and his character is gay - I know this because Wikipedia told me, as did the prequel YouTube short. By the way, why do I have to watch YouTube shorts BEFORE I watch a film rather than just put the footage in the film? At least DC gives us all the stuff that should've gone in after the fact, but not before!Within this, however, there's an interesting idea of David becoming this Frankenstein that makes the Xenomorphs, and Michael Fassbender is as great in this as Prometheus as he gives both of these films a better performance than they deserve. Here it is: Engineers made Humans, Humans made David, David destroys the Engineers. Humans made David, David made Xenomorphs, Xemomorphs destroy Humans. It's an idea that is interesting, but is screwed because it's the secondary focus, when really, if this movie was told solely from David's POV, it would've been so much more interesting. You see him create, scheme, and it would've added actual tension to the ending that is so obvious you can see it 45 minutes before the end.So, what else? If you thought Prometheus had a dumb crew, wait till you see these guys. They venture forth, onto an unknown planet, and when they land, they wear NO protective gear. This would've literally made the whole movie pointless if they had. THEN when a Neomorph - first generation - attacks the ship, two crew members slip over in blood, which was ridiculous and then one blows up the ship with a shotgun. Then, you have the stupidest sequence of events, with the idiot Captain and designated exposition dumper Oram, played by Billy Crudup (who is wasted here) at the centre, in an event that leads to a moment that reminded me way too much of the Spaceballs movie. Then the ending, which is really obvious, could've been avoided by doing basic checks on the androids to check which is which.There is some good things in the film: namely the character David is wonderful, Fassbender is great as always, the action scene in the final act when they are hunting the Xenomorph on the ship is intense, and the acting from Waterston is strong despite her character, and she has good scenes with McBride. It's well scored, the CGI is alright. I can't say its a not a mess, but I wouldn't tell anyone not to see it. It's certainly an experience; make of that what you will.",Alien - Covenant

Maybe I would have cared more.These spacemen were indeed pretty darn stupid. No precautions, loopy decision making and at least in the original Alien, the crew wore protection!For most of the movie I was meh but not mad. Some good scares and good gore. I did however get mad when Director and writers chose to treat me as a brain dead movie goer. The last shot we see of David and Walter fighting- It was an obvious crappy move and as the film kept going I was hoping against hope I was wrong. If I had been, it would have been a nice ruse and there were possibilities in that plot line. But no, they did what everyone will suspect they did. It wasn't a surprise and it didn't help me care about those still alive... Coming home I got more disappointed at what could have been. At what I'd just seen.

446,regula1,A few too many cheap jump scares plus too little suspense makes an average Alien film,7,18 May 2017,"Following the disappointing Prometheus with an attempt at a re-invigoration of the Alien franchise was always going to be a tough task.While this film didn't fail at that, I can't say it entirely succeeded either.Alien Covenant takes place about ten years after the events of 2012's Prometheus and follows the colony ship Covenant, on its way with 2000 colonists to a new world when it intercepts a rogue transmission from a nearby system.Upon exploration, it turns out it is the planet where Dr. Elizabeth Shaw and David (Michael Fassbender) ended up, with the seeds of the Xenomorphs in tow. Things go predictably downhill for the crew of the Covenant from there.This film has a couple of interesting twists on the classic Alien formula, most notably the rapport between Fassbender's stranded David, and the updated model Walter, also played by Fassbender, and the interesting dynamic that develops between them. Also, this film, since it takes place before the events of Alien (1979), explores the evolution of the Xenomorphs from how they appear in Prometheus to the familiar figures we've known.Unfortunately, the rest of the film is fairly shallow in its delivery. The characters are pretty common horror film tropes, down to Katherine Waterson's adequate but barely compelling portrayal of Dany Branson. Thee are plenty of jump scares, as well as scenes of Xenomorphs killing people in pretty brutal ways. Too bad the first Xenomorph bursting out of the back was spoiled in the trailer, since that was probably the only cool innovation in this film.Alien: Covenant is no Prometheus in terms of absurdity, and will be a worthy addition to the Alien franchise (I guess it's now a Sextillogy since this is the sixth film?)

448,foxhound-37781,You'll enjoy it if you're a fan of the franchise,7,13 May 2017,"If you're a fan of the Alien franchise you'll enjoy Covenant:I'd been excited to see this film for a while. Ridley Scott directing another Alien movie is something that will generally appeal to the masses but is it as grand and awe inspiring as the original? Probably not, but then again you're talking about two movies that are separated by almost four decades.I'm going to be straight forward, the film is structured more or less the same as the first Alien film. Crew gets random radio signal, Goes and investigates, Brings Alien back with them, all hell breaks loose, characters get killed off one by one. I read something on rotten tomatoes someone posted about how it being as close to a remake of the original as it gets. I have to say, I felt this emotion while watching covenant. It follows the same classic formula to a tee almost.All the actors play their roles pretty good but it's Michael Fassbender that's the true star of this film. He is absolutely terrific as always, playing the role of not one, but two characters this time and is a frequent scene stealer in this movie. We see new ""types"" of aliens that we haven't seen before and it was good to see Scott putting in the effort to give us some new material we haven't seen before. This is a bit of a gory film as you'd expect. The classic chestbursters make a return and bust out of their victims more violently than ever. If there's one thing I do want to commend this movie for, it's how Scott linked Prometheus and this film together and showed us what happened to Elizabeth Shaw, it was a believable and fitting plot point that I think worked very well.The ending I won't spoil but it does leave the way open for another film and I only hope ol' Ridley has one more Alien film in him =) It's not as terrifying as the original by a long way, and there are a lot of snobs that will say this movie is just throwing nostalgia into the face of fans, but it is a good sci/fi horror flick in its own right.It gets off to a bit of a slow start, but this isn't always a bad thing.

But after that the Alien movies that have followed have been unnecessary money grabs (Ok, that might be an oxymoron to Hollywood execs).The final death spiral of the franchise has to be the beautiful and utterly nonsensical Prometheus and this Prometheus sequel. Again, like Prometheus, there are some very well done set pieces in the film, especially the fights.

The only answer we do get is that David killed them, but we don't even get a reason why he killed them in the movie.Its like the whole plot got sidelines to make way for a dumb crew what suddenly thinks its a good idea to go to a planet they receive a signal from, the planet happens to be in the goldilocks zone (habitable) yet they never mapped this place before. The decisions the crew make just get dumber and dumber and i feel ridley scott has listen to criticism of prometheus too much, and tried to make the action and gore that people wanted, but in doing this, he's lost the sole of the story and the plot was very basic and unsatisfying.The visuals are great, and the one saving grace from the movie is David, he's a really good villain and the ending was good, although very predictable. But after watching the movie, i feel like i've just watched a side episode of the real story, were pretty much in the same boat as we were when we finished watching prometheus, we still don't know who the engineers really were, we know nothing about their civilization, other than some ruins, we know nothing about our relationship to them, their relationship to the xenomorphs, or where we all came from and our purpose.The third movie is really left with a lot of ground to cover for this to be a successful and insightful franchise.",Alien - Covenant

453,Daviteo,Solid dark fantasy horror with some mis-steps in characters and motivation (totally contains spoilers!),7,21 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant is a solid dark fantasy horror film with a lot of good going for it but a few massive mis-steps along the way.First, the god: special effects, atmosphere, and mood were on par with any other Ridley Scott film save for the astounding original ALIEN and Blade Runner, which were masterpieces. Cinematography is solid, acting by the three principle characters, while not jaw-dropping, was decent (especially Waterston—I hope to see her in a lot of other films, and Fassbender brought his A-Game as always), and although this wasn't a straight-up horror film like ALIEN as it had a more dark fantasy vibe, I enjoyed that.Second, the problems. There were a few but they were pretty severe. Spoilers ahead. The biggest problem my wife and and I had with the film was that this team of scientists go to an alien planet effectively on a whim and proceed to make massively stupid decisions:The crew doesn't do any analysis of the alien planet before flying down to investigate.The crew doesn't send the android (or presumably robots—they have robots in the future, right?) down first but instead takes a whole human team.They land they drop ship on WATER instead of trying to find fertile ground. Any sort of parasite or small insect could be hiding there.They disembark the drop ship without MASKS and then proceed to touch and interact with their surroundings without caution. In fact, not wearing a mask is the main reason the problems start happening ... twice. There must have been some sort of mouth, nose, ear covering they could have scrounged up if they didn't actually have them on the ship (which they should have!).On an alien landscape, WATCH WHERE YOU STEP! And don't touch anything! If we ever did find a habitable planet, we probably wouldn't get attacked by extra terrestrial creatures but instead the biggest threat would be bacteria, parasites, all things microscopic.When investigating a giant city full of dead bodies ... ask your host about what the hell happened!Don't wash your wounds in alien water!Don't look directly into an alien pod!Basically the main issues in the film were tactical and preparatory. There were a few others, such as the xenomorph taking minutes to mature when in ALIEN it took almost a day, and some other quibbling problems. Also, this is billed as a horror film but I found it to be more of a dark sci-fi fantasy (which I actually enjoyed). It's a good setup for a third film and has several nifty surprises (not ""twists,"" per se, but things that make you go ""aha!"") and it ties up a lot of loose ends from Prometheus. And the Hannibal-like dark operatic mood during the second act of the film is great (particularly when David and Walther have conversations on the nature of serving in heaven vs reigning in hell). But you'll have to overlook some massively stupid human decisions about 1/3 of the way through the film to get to that point.",Alien - Covenant
454,TheJediWay9,"""Alien: Covenant"" Is A Vast Improvement Over ""Prometheus"" That Focuses On Expanding The Series' Mythology",8,10 May 2017,"""Alien: Covenant"" is directed by Ridley Scott and is the second ""Alien"" prequel and the sequel to 2012's ""Prometheus."" In ""Alien"" Covenant,"" the crew of the ship Covenant, make way to find a planet that they can colonize, only to be terrorized by creatures hunting them down and an unknown inhabitant that lives on the planet.I went to a press screening go this in Boston, and going into this screening I prayed and hoped for it to be better than ""Prometheus."" I only saw Prometheus once when it was first released, and just watched it again for the second time earlier today to prepare for ""Alien: Covenant."" Prometheus was a bland, very uneventful movie. It answered none of the questions that Ridley Scott wanted it to answer, so I was skeptical about this sequel. Luckily....it turned out to be good. ""Alien: Covenant"" is a vast improvement over Prometheus that really expands the series' mythology and is a very entertaining and enjoyable ride.One thing I noticed was that shaky camera was used for the action scenes, but used very well in a way where you could still tell what was going on. Not a lot of directors, barely any for that matter, can perfect that, but I think Ridely Scott was on point when it came to how those scenes were shot and directed. It gave the film this kind of realness that I did not expect it to have. Luckily, there is more action in this movie than there was in its predecessor. The action scenes are really fun. They're bloody, they're gory, they're everything we want an Alien movie to be. No, nothing was all that ground breaking when it came to writing and crafting these scenes, but these scenes present a sense of claustrophobia since most of them are filmed in small locations and in the dark. The final action scene in the movie feels very similar to the way the first one ended but doesn't feel like a complete ripoff of that film. This is visually the best movie of the year so far. The cinematography is lush. The vast landscape from this planet is so well captured and so well realized that you get a sense that planets like the probably do exist in this universe. Many, not all, but many questions about where the Xenomorph comes from are answered in this movie. There are still some blurry spots, still some things I'm not too sure about or a little hazy on, but for the most part most of the questions we have regarding the Aliens and where they come from are starting to get answered and our remaining questions will be (or should be) answered by the time the third prequel comes around.This movie felt like it breathed new life into a series that was waning. Ridley Scott seemed to take all of the complaints fans had about Prometheus to heart and set out to create something that would both please those fans and create new fans. It's almost like he knew Prometheus wasn't a good movie and accepted the fact that fans were right, and made a movie for the fans. It is a good blend between the claustrophobic, psychological horror of ""Alien,"" and the sci-fi action adventure of ""Aliens,"" with the worst parts of ""Prometheus"" chucked out the window.This movie does have its faults, and most of those faults lie within the characters and the decisions they make. Nobody in this movie is really all that fleshed out, save for Michael Fassbender's characters. There's nothing really there emotionally to help you latch on to these characters. None of the really have backstories. Katherine Waterston's character has somewhat of a backstory, but even then it's not much. I did not find the need to care for these characters or even care at all if I had to because most of these characters aren't fleshed out and are just expendable. The characters aren't very smart either. When you see a giant egg covered in goo, probably a good idea not to touch it...right? Or shoot an alien that's calm just to make it mad...right?Another problem is predictability. This is easily the most predictable movie I have seen this year. Just judging from the trailer you knew which of the crew were gonna die. There were certain plot points that I guessed about halfway through, and something at the end that I saw coming from a mile away. It just did not sit well with me. When I can predict things like that, it brings the movie down for me.Overall, a solid return to form for the ""Alien"" franchise. Nowhere near as good as ""Alien"" or ""Aliens,"" but LOADS better than Prometheus. The other two don't count.I'm going to give ""Alien: Covenant"" a 7.7/10Check out my video review on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06cSmrtQRH4&t=1s",Alien - Covenant

The gore was perfect, the aliens were terrifying, and the twists surprised me (for the most part). a little after we meet David we see this pale creature that looks a lot like the Demogorgon from stranger things... until it opens its face with a giant mouth and chomps someones head off! that moment sent my adrenaline through the roof and scared the crap out of me. the facehugger scene somehow made me jump even though I new what was happening. the action was on par with Aliens (1986) story was great twists were good dialogue was a little bad but was good enough for me characters weren't smart but were smarter than the ones in Prometheus the only complaints I have are: Not enough Xenomorph Where was the Deacon (Thing at the end of Prometheus) What was the point of David teaching Walter to play the flute The shower scene was kind of pointless but I did like the aliens second mouth bursting through the guys headall in all I give this a 9.9/10",Alien - Covenant

457,jpasols,Easily my favorite Alien film of the franchise!!!,10,6 November 2018,"This is my favorite Alien film since the very original. It's highly entertaining and gory (which, as a horror buff I highly enjoyed). Some genuinely creepy and disturbing scenes and great character development. For the 6th entry in a sci-fi horror franchise I was pleasantly and surprisingly impressed with Alien: Covenant. The ending is clearly left open for a sequel which will maybe complete the pre-planned trilogy of the Alien prequel series which began with 2012's Prometheus. I'm excited for what Ridley Scott has up his genius sleeves next!. Great film. Highly recommend for sci-fi fans, horror fans, Gore buffs, or movie goers in general. Don't let all the bad reviews drive you away from this truly amazing film. Especially if you're new to the Alien series.My rating for Alien: Covenant. 10 out of 10.",Alien - Covenant
458,GSeditor,"Disappointing as a follow-up to Prometheus, but a good alien movie on its own",7,9 May 2017,"I adore Prometheus and had been looking forward to a sequel. Covenant lacks Prometheus' grandiose ambiance, mood and atmosphere and many intriguing questions regarding the motivations of the Engineers left unanswered in Prometheus are ignored in Covenant, so I was disappointed in these regards. And yet, seen on its own terms, Covenant is quite satisfying as a space-monster(s)-on-the-loose movie. It's pretty violent and gory. Yes, it recycles elements from Alien especially, but does not do it in a lackluster manner.",Alien - Covenant
459,davish_wulf-1,Better than Prometheus,8,28 May 2017,"Some reviews were so bad I went seeing this with very low expectations. Quite surprisingly the movie delivered... a lot. From the music score mixing the first and second Alien, to the story and suspense, to the very good quality effects, Fassbender's prime acting and the Aliens, this movie was a great return to Alien. If you loved Alien 1 and 2, wanted more explanations regarding Prometheus and the origin of it all, you will like this. It doesn't answer everything as surely a third movie will come for that, but I sincerely did not understand the hate of many against this. Not perfect, but on par with Alien 3 and 4 in terms of score. Definitely better than Prometheus (that had a almost claustrophobic scenery). Can't wait for the third one, never mind the naysayers go and see this.",Alien - Covenant
460,taz1004,"Creator destroying own creation? Yea, that's Ridley Scott.",5,11 July 2017,"I don't consider Ridley Scott to be one of the greats. He just has a lot of hit and miss. And he has more miss that hits. And this was another gigantic miss. And then the ones he hit, he goes back and destroys them. Just like all the directors cut or final cut or whatever cut version he released for Blade Runner that ruined the movie. And he's doing same thing to the Alien.Before watching Prometheus, to prep myself, I watched the entire series again. And then I realized that it was James Cameron who should be credited with the series success. Not Scott.In Covenant, perhaps Scott was trying to impress the audiences with visuals, not realizing that may have worked in 1980's but not anymore. Thanks to orgy of special effects thesedays, people don't get impressed by visuals.And the twist he was going for at the end, I saw it coming as soon as the fight scene didn't show the winner.

Started good; went downhill, then came back up the other side",7,20 July 2017,"If you don't want to read my rant (although I hope the director does), then go straight to the second paragraph.This had such good potential; good effects; a good premise, but then it just tragically nosed-dived. One reason for this was the ridiculous choice made by the captain and the other was the character responses when the action started. One character was like a drama queen who had just snorted about half a pound of Colombian marching powder. Who knows? Perhaps she had!! But my heart just sank after that and so did the movie! I cannot understand directors who think that making the characters act over-emotionally creates more tension and suspense in the viewer's mind. This is a cheap tactic and completely spoils the realism and the feel of the movie. Why do they STILL insist on doing this??? Let the action create the drama not the hyper-active character responses. Anyway I haven't finished watching this yet, but I couldn't wait another hour to vent my spleen over this. I'll update later.Okay! Time for update: The second hour went much better with great performances all round. Good movie! A worthy Alien sequel, or at least, a tasty addition to the series, anyway.

464,masonmorgan-92917,"In space, no-one can hear you scream - because you're not.",5,22 May 2017,"After the misstep that was Prometheus, Alien: Covenant could've been the correction. Another prequel directed by Scott himself, Covenant seemed to be returning to it's 1979 roots, much more so than Prometheus. Featuring the perfect organism itself and a return to the tense, claustrophobic space horror, Covenant seemed to have all the elements to produce the first Alien film of decent quality since the masterpieces of 1979 and 1986. Instead, what we get is a tasteless Prometheus retread that lacks any of the tension or grace of the original. Despite the massively lacking narrative quality of Covenant, it is visually stunning. Scott certainly hasn't lost his cinematic touch, capturing breathtaking scenery and action with an unquestionable technical prowess. Sadly, the visuals are really the only thing that Covenant has to offer, sadly settling for looks over a compelling narrative and characters. Alien: Covenant is a massive dud, but it sure is a pretty-looking one. While the story has small hints of interesting aspects, such as the android interactions, the plot as a whole is basically a Prometheus re-tread, yet even still managing to be worse. The ""scientists"" are still frustratingly clueless, as they seem to make the same inexcusably stupid decisions as the Prometheus crew, except here the consequences are much more noticeable and dire. Along with the lack of compelling narrative, Covenant seems to forget what made the original 1979 classic so great, and that's the tension/build-up. As Covenant pays homage after homage to the original, it's even more upsetting when the film never even attempts to capture any of the slow-burning tension that made Scott's classic, a classic. While the new Aliens are introduced in an admittedly interesting fashion, all of this occurs far too early, thrusting us into it's hamfisted story before taking any time to develop characters or relationships. It all just feels so inorganic and distractingly choppy. Scott intertwined character and tension perfectly in the first Alien film, so why does Covenant seem so amateurish? Honestly, amateurish is a trait that can be associated with the majority of Covenant, as even the Aliens themselves look noticeably off. While the CGI was decent, for the most part, I think it was the overexposure of the creatures that made them look so fake and silly. We see the Aliens in their entirety countless times in the film, which betrays the source material. Not only do we see too much of our beloved Alien, but it doesn't even act like the terrifyingly intimidating killing machine we've loved to fear. In Covenant, the Alien walks into rooms like any human would, destroying most of my nostalgia instantly. The Alien never utilizes vents or slithers down walls as it should. Instead, it skulks around and carelessly murders as if it were any other monster from any other monster movie. Any semblance of the creature's grace or grotesque beauty is gone, replaced with traits of a killer that takes no care in it's work, which is certainly not the Xenomorph we've come to know and love. This is the first time in 40 years that we've get to see Scott work with the classic Alien, and as excited as I was to see it back in action, the rushed introduction and overall lack of attention payed to make it act like the perfect organism, makes it supremely disappointing. I could be speaking for every Alien fan when I say that this movie sucks. However, I'm just speaking for myself when I say that this is easily the worst Alien film after the film that killed the franchise, Alien Resurrection. It's downright depressing that Alien fans like myself have to endure a continuing franchise of these prequel films, when the narrative had already backed itself into a corner after Prometheus. The best thing that Ridley Scott could do for his franchise is to step down, let someone else helm an Alien project and allow the universe to expand past the uninspired narrative track that these tiresome prequels will continue to travel down as long as they are repeatedly pumped out. If constant beating of the beloved franchise continues, it could begin to tarnish the brilliance of the original. If Scott doesn't take more care in the future, his original classic could be nothing but a bright spot in a line of films that grew increasingly formulaic as they were pumped out for revenue. A train-wreck of great proportions, Covenant is not only a terribly unorganized mess, it's a warning of what will come if we continue to treat our beloved franchise like a product.",Alien - Covenant
465,iamjacksmoviechannel,Alien Repetition,5,10 May 2017,"Alien Covenant marks the third Alien movie directed by Ridley Scott and the second prequel to the franchise after Prometheus. They also seem to be getting worse with age.Prometheus was really a lot of questions searching for answers, ambitious in asking not only about the creation of alien life, but human life as well. However the plan to stretch out these topics into 3 or 4 movies should be met with some skepticism. Especially considering the basis for this was started by Damon Lindeloff, the creator of Lost and the man most of us are still waiting for answers for most of the things that happened on Lost. He of course has abandoned this second movie, leaving it in the hands of the far more capable John Logan, but even he struggles to find meaning here, or escape the clichés that have started to grow like a Xenomorph in John Hurt's stomach. We're dealing with a whole new crew this time; the Covenant. They are headed on a colonial mission to another planet before an electric shock takes out the ship, the Captain, and 47 other members. Reluctant to get back into their pods for a 7 year journey, the on board crew responsible for the ship's upkeep decide instead to answer a distress transmission coming from another planet. That's where they find what continues to be the best character in these prequels; Michael Fassbender's David the Android. His motivations and whether he considers himself human or God is constantly in question and Fassbender's soft-spoken performance continues to haunt. I also really do consider Prometheus to be one of the most gorgeous-looking special films of the last decade and this continues that- from the Covenant ship to the grain fields and other vegetation eerily covering the mostly desolate other terrain of the planet.We also get the first look at the Neo-morph, who is born the same way, seems a bit faster than the Xeno-morph but the main differences are it doesn't have the Venus fly trap tongue and it can stand like a human. Pretty cool. Just it's at this point I should probably say that after Aliens there started to be less reason to want these. Alien 3 was fine, Prometheus I thought could really go either way depending on the sequels, and Alien 4 of course was garbage. The biggest problem here is that it feels so redundant. We get a distress call, the crew investigates, some background characters do stupid things leading to impregnation, someone says ""we never should have come"", final alien chase. The aliens, when you can see them, are cool, but there is a lot of downtime between them, and a few quality kills does not a 200 million dollar mega blockbuster make. It's also really odd that Prometheus does this whole thing of setting up the engineers as the creators of human beings but here they only get one scene and let's just say those looking for more info about them will get angry. The promise of some larger conversation is in here somewhere but these movies feel so stretched out at this point that when this does get to the few moments of actually having something to say, it's hard to get re-engaged. The characters don't help either as most just come off like archetypes. Katherine Waterston is the Captain's widow and really the bargain basement Ellen Ripley here. Billy Crudup plays the faith-based character, and like the last movie, this movie seems to be including that without ever really giving it value in the meaning of life conversation. But at least those two have some background. I'm so tired of most of these others. The ones who just go tramping through the woods of an unknown planet or show the decision making skills of the Trump administration. You're not supposed to make us root for the alien, guys. Finally i'm no closer to understanding why these movies are necessary. It's easy to tell what this movie wants to do and it's even easier to see the twist coming a half hour before it even comes. There are a few nice kills here, I will give the movie that. If you can remember to wake yourself every time Fassbender and Fassbender (he also plays an android named Walter) have a philosophy conversation, you might find some interesting stuff there too. But overall not enough action or thought to make this overly drawn out series seem necessary.So I go 5 out of 10 guys. For more reviews like this, check me out on Youtube",Alien - Covenant

469,patomartinezfgo,WTF happened to Ridley Scott,5,20 May 2017,"I was pretty excited to see this movie until I saw the trailer. I saw a Xenomorph in plain daylight head-banging a glass. Since that moment I knew this was f*cked.I liked ""Prometheus"" and was really intrigued by the questions it asked. But I admit I am much more of a fan of ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"". Still I would have been happy if I got a Prometheus or an Alien movie, what I don't like is that they mixed that sh*t together and created this mess.I am going to divide this review in three parts: Act 1, Act 2 and Act 3. Because the different acts of this film are completely different and look like they were written by different people.Some general observations before I go any further is that the direction and color grading are really great. The actors also give a good enough performance.On the negative side, the special effects are sh*t.Act 1: So the movie starts with a scene with David and Weyland. This scene is very good and provides some really good things to think about. I have no problems with this part.Then it cuts to Walter who is in charge of running a space ship that is carrying colonists to another planet. Something happens and they have to wake the real crew up from their sleep.Some things happen and they decide to land on a closer planet that looks better than the one they are supposed to land on. The movie is doing OK and I have no problems with it so far.So they land on the planet and some sh*t gets into the crews' nose and ears and a ""Neomorph"" starts growing in them. At the same time they find the space ship from ""Prometheus"".Now in this part of the film things start going south because again the characters make some stupid choices. But it does lead to the best scene in the movie with a ""Neomorph"" growing out of someone's back. That scene is completely ruined of course because the alien creature is CGI and it looks terrible.Over all, the first act was OK. It had some problems but nothing too bad.Act 2 This is when it starts getting bad. David rescues the crew from the Neomorphs and takes them to his home were he has been hiding since he landed here. This bothers me a lot because what could have been a great Prometheus sequel turns into David just saying what happened in a brief explanation scene.The characters are again stupid in this scene and make some very weird choices that get them killed. Also, we get to see the Neomorph completely which makes it look not scary.This is also when David starts explaining us how the ""Xenomorph"" came to be. This is one of my greatest dislikes about the film. It answers questions we don't want the answer to and it doesn't answer the questions we do want. We don't want to know how the Xenomorph came to be. The explanation in the first movie was just fine. It was a perfect killing machine that was more pure than humans. That is all that we needed to know, if we now a lot about it then it really stops being scary.After that David and Walter have some WTF scenes and David turns evil. He kills Walter but then mysteriously Walter is back alive. Then they have a ridiculous fight scene that made me laugh.This part of the movie has a lot of plot holes. Some things happened that break the story-line from Prometheus and the first Alien movie.The only thing I enjoyed about this act was David's way of thought. Not his exposition about the Xenomorphs, his way of thought, what motivates him to do what he is doing.Act 3: Act 3 is basically an Alien movie, a really sh*tty one. Ridley Scott shows the Xenomorph in plain sight. That was what made the alien scary in the first one! You only saw small parts of it, and he was hiding all of the time. The Xenomorph is smart, its not an animal. Even in the ""Alien Isolation"" games where you can see the Xenomorph completely you get scared because of its smartness. This movie didn't create any tension or tried to make the Alien creepy at all. There was only good scene in this act, a shower scene to be exact. The rest is sh*t.My final conclusion is: Don't watch this movie. I gave it a 5/10 because Ridley Scott deserves some credit for the shots and some things were cool. But I was tremendously disappointed by this film.",Alien - Covenant
470,tyingling7766,Alien: Covenant Review,7,29 May 2017,"Here we are with the second installment in Ridley Scott's new Alien Trilogy. Alien: Covenant was just as good as Prometheus and then some. Find out what made it better.Synopsis: The crew of the colony ship Covenant, bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, discovers what they think is an uncharted paradise, but is actually a dark, dangerous world. When they uncover a threat beyond their imagination, they must attempt a harrowing escape. Starring: Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterson, Danny McBride Director: Ridley ScottI have said it before and I will say it till the day that one better comes out (which probably won't happen), Ridley Scott is the only man who should make Alien movies. Yeah, that's right, I think Alien is better than Aliens. And it is. But that's not why I like this one better than Ridley's last one.The reason I like this one better is because of Danny McBride. A few months ago I posted on my Facebook that I figured he was going to be the lone survivor. Well, I was wrong. But he was the best part of the movie. It wasn't a comedic role for him; he was all seriousness. It was completely different than any role he has played so far, and it worked here. Can't wait to see what he does with Halloween.I'm not saying he was the only good thing about the movie. Bringing back the original Xenomorph in the way it was worked great. Then there was the second prototype Xenomorph, it was a bit different than the one from Prometheus, and it was better. The way the story was set up did take a bit to get to into, but the wait was worth it.There were some downfalls though. The twist towards the end of the movie was not well hidden. You could see it coming when it happened. With that adding onto how long it took to get to the main problem, those are two of the minor reasons I gave it a lower rating.The main reason you ask. There was something that has never happened in an Alien movie, even though they hinted at it in most of the movies. But, there never showed nudity. No, I am not including the Predator movies in this scenario. Some things should never happen.Final Thoughts: Watch this movie. Even if you're not a fan of the Alien movies, watch this movie. Even if you disagree with me on which one is better out of the original two, watch this movie. It is the third best in the series, by the way.Rating: 7 out of 10",Alien - Covenant

472,akoaytao1234,The Reductive Alien,4,22 May 2017,"I must admit, at its core, Alien:Covenant is a standard popcorn flick that would probably be fun to watch if you would not care for those little details but sadly I did.To begin with, I always wonder why does Hollywood is obsessed with slasher level of incompetent protagonists. I mean (assuming that) this is a group of well trained scientist/personnel that is given a job to actually repopulate a certain studied planet, how could they be so impulsive and have no sense of propriety. Leaving an already detailed trip to take a chance in an unknown planet and let alone only one crew member actually thinking that it is bonkers is just to absurd to begin with. Then, does this crew even have protocol? Letting the lives of thousands to be in jeopardy of a certain few, being not able to see through that awful plot twist ending by not having a backup Davis or checking if he is actually a Davis, or just letting the main leader's life be in jeopardy by bringing him down there with you just never makes sense. This film never fails to puzzle me.Another thing that truly bugged me is how reductive this film feels. It is just a smorgasbord of every little noticeable twist and turn of the previous films in the franchise topped with craziness and lack of inherent logic. I mean I already predicted what will happen midway the film just shows how been there,done than it is. Even the feminist drive of the film feels too rehashed to the point that they are literally copying the original for quotation making it feel so uninspired.To summarize, Alien: Covenant is a questionable unoriginal sequel to the already fledgling ship that is the Alien Franchise. Not even its beautiful visuals nor passable acting can save this film from its immeasurable illogical fallacies and overall reductiveness. [2/5]",Alien - Covenant

474,Pigeon_down,The Greatest Questions Ever Asked Baked Into An Episode Of Scooby Doo,4,4 June 2017,"I entered the cinema with high hopes but moderate expectations. Promethus held promise. Standing alone it was another Sci Fi movie, but in the context of a larger narrative, it could be redeemed.What Ridley offers is in effect one of the greatest questions ever asked baked into an episode of Scooby Doo - complete with the fact that the Caretaker did it, and classic lines like, 'Let's split up to search'. Alien Covenant (AC) starts well. Its opening scene is both weak and strong. Weak in the sense that Peter Weyland (Pearce) when discussing the more philosophical themes barely seems to have a real grasp on the nature of the questions he ought to be thinking about, and David (Fassbender) makes basic observations but completely misses the big questions he ought to be asking (It's the kind of philosophical questioning i'd expect from high school students and not from the leader of major space exploration company or a cutting edge droid - to me this was a warning that this film hadn't been thought through enough, or if it had, the people doing the thinking were not as smart as the franchise really needs). Strong in that it opened the door and made me think this movie really might go in the right direction and offer the kind of depth this franchise needs to be more than a lucky monster flick set in space. Other reviewers have listed a litany of issues with this movie. I will offer some which IMO were the most troubling, not just with the movie, but reveal the lack of thought, or a blatant the disregard of the audiences intellect by the writers. The crew - Let's be frank, you wouldn't let this lot crew an oil tanker across the pacific let alone be in charge of 2000 colonist lives. The crew resembled an AA meeting, or perhaps a collection of Occupy Artists. What they did not resemble was a crew of individuals educated and qualified to be in space. The average 'trolly dolly' on a United Airlines flight would've done a more rational and sensible job over those in this movie. Sci Fi as a genre can be really poor or stunning. It can dredge the lows of the genre or set out a really solid story with a highly intelligent characters in which events unfold that genuinely stretch the thinking of the brightest viewers and land new ideas or expound on old questions in an original way that leaves the audience thinking about the depth of the movie long after it is over. AC in not the latter and is most assuredly heading toward the former. With a crew this bad you begin to see why i have likened the film to Scooby Doo, because effectively we have Shaggy, Scooby, Wilma, and Fred etc haplessly wandering around on an alien planet only to find out that the villain is ...wait for it....David the caretaker. In this movie i learned - That an advanced race of aliens (the engineers) have no air traffic control protocols or security measures. That their population exists in a place similar to the Vatican square. That you can just fly in and bomb them all with no problems. That they build out of stone and seem to have excellent eyes as well lit rooms are not important to them. The Engineer concept is great and was a great introduction idea in Prometheus, but it has been unpacked very poorly to the detriment of the concept.The movie also fails to address 'growth', how a xeno can grow inside a human at that rate without absorbing material, and once out of the host move from about a foot in size to about 10 feet tall without consuming organic matter to fuel its growth? You can't have intelligent science fiction without addressing these major holes Ridley, and if you're not doing intelligent science-fi than you're making B movie junk. David and Walter - the moment David cut his hair we could all tell where this was going. But for a crew like this, i'm sure that went right past them. The same crew that has just one landing ship and chooses to try to land during a storm, that rather than sending a drone to explore the planet sends the crew, that rather than flying over the signal area in a first pass lands 8 miles from their objective and decides to walk, that wears no protective gear beyond 1950's Norwegian Kagools, that smoke, sniffs plants of unknown make up, washes their face in alien water... the list of stupid goes on and on and on. So you see, you combine one of the most important questions ever asked 'where does life come from, who is our creator' with Shaggy, Scooby, and the Gang and hey presto - Alien Covenant. Finally, the explanation of David as flawed (the reference to Shelley vs Byron) struggles to address the pointlessness of David's quest. Unless David is purely in psychopath territory his quest seems misguided. All life forms share some degree of intelligence, it is our intelligence that is a common factor, a unifying factor. Yes we behave differently, but all species evolve and typically evolve up to greater intelligence. Therefore intelligence is the real directional marker, not life itself. Where is intelligence going? Producing xenomorph's that behave like ants is a step back. It doesn't address any question. It's nothing more significant than playing with biological Lego. I'd expect a 'being' like David to see this. To see into the complexity and realise that biological forms are all moving in a direction that brings them closer in the end not further away but then to wonder why and where this might end.",Alien - Covenant
475,said-buet10,Sadly I had high expectations!,4,13 November 2017,With the mysterious Prometheus Ridley had me hocked to the wide possibilities this franchise had. But this movie ended up being the exact opposite.I felt the death of Dr. Shaw was unnecessary. I was hoping to see her adventures in the word of Engineers. That would've been fun to watch. But the story didn't follow that path and I had a pretty open mind about the alternative. But that turned out to be worse than I could manage to swallow.I really hope that they make more movies which will cover up the messy impression this movie had on us.,Alien - Covenant

The characters were soulless puppets that made the most illogical decisions. The star and only interesting character is David who we are told tortured and killed the hero of the last film, Shaw.All the questions about the mysterious race that may or may not have created humanity are shoved under the rug and superceeded by a bad film that tries to recapture the thrills of the first aliens but fails miserably.This film was also so boring that it put my boyfriend to sleep.",Alien - Covenant
477,pendenquejohn,Good but some incredible slow scenes,5,24 September 2017,"Overall I would rate this as an interesting movie to watch but the main elements I did not like was the slow scenes that would literally plague the movie.Many of the actions scenes were interesting and very dynamic sustaining a story in the whole that would make sense but to my taste, most of the times these scenes would be watered down by others that would be slow and boring.There are lots of special effects, albeit not as exciting and extraordinary as in some other movies of the same genre. They're enough to keep things kind of like realistic on the whole.",Alien - Covenant
478,brainsmasher-66,pfffft!,8,21 May 2017,I hate horror movies where the characters are stupid. I am almost glad when they get killed. There are lots of stupid characters in this film. Maybe that's why they killed off the captain at the beginning. You can't have a stupid captain; but every time the captain gets killed and the next man or woman assumes the position they get stupid real quick.The visuals are stunning. The space scenes are what we have come to expect from space scenes if you believe in space; but the landing craft that they use to descend to the planet are comically not aerodynamic. The writers could have solved this problem by claiming that anti-gravity was perfected since the last movie.The most puzzling thing is the creature. Some times it resembles the original monster and other times it resembles a creature that walks about on two legs. Some times you can kill it with bullets and some times it is bullet proof. Sometimes the creature is introspective and other times it is it's usual bloodthirsty self. Some times you feel like a nut; some times you don't? There were some brief flashbacks of when David the android arrives at the planet after having escaped with Shaw in Prometheus. On the way he has re-engineered the virus and killed Shaw. That would have been a better movie. Shaw was a better protagonist--almost as good as Ripley--not real cute; but sexy. The female lead in this incarnation is just not cute. You feel as though if she were a little cuter that maybe the captain would have taken her advice and not checked out the planet. On second thought if he had there would not have been a movie.,Alien - Covenant

I think it started out well, but I lost intrest and started looking at my phone during the movie( this is something I rarily do. I am easy absorbed into a movie). The turning point for me was when they had landed on the planet and two in theri crew started geting sick. I feel that almost every character in this movie are making stupid decisions and geting themself killed. This include:
-Lets walk around on this new planet which we dont know anything about very uncarefully and smell at strange plants.
-Lets trust this strange robot we found on this planet. Especially when we know he is hidding something and follow him into his basement and look at his large eggs. Also not get suspicus when he cuts his hair so he looks exactly as our own robot.
-Splitt up at the temple when we know that a monster can be out to kill us.

480,pulikd,Prometheus 2,5,26 June 2021,"This movie, unlike the previous one, focuses a little heavier on the famous monster. Only now this monster has a whole different backstory, one that ignores every movie since the oldest installment in the franchise. And that is quite frustrating. But there is a more significant problem. The creature used to be intelligent, which made it even scarier. Now it is just a dumb ugly thing, and a disposable one. No other movie prior to this one treated the ""xenomorph"" with such disrespect. As an ""Alien"" movie, it fails. But it also fails as a direct sequel to ""Prometheus"". Significant things happen between these two movies, off screen. And what follows is yet another familiar story. A big spaceship intercepts a strange signal and they end up in trouble because they go there to investigate. I've seen this already, only better.The visuals are very good, even though the monster scenes should have used some practical effects. No problem with acting. The characters and how the movie handles them is the problem. They are numerous, they do not have enough screen time, and they are not memorable, with the exception of two, maybe. The ending of the movie is surprisingly interesting because it can easily deceive you. Not that it changes the big picture, though.",Alien - Covenant
481,Francois84,Underrated,8,28 January 2020,"I'd put off 'Alien: Covenant' until today. A few weeks ago, I'd recorded it off TV. Having a dedicated home theatre, normally I'd only watch my movies either from disc (1080p or 4K Blu-ray), or on Netflix. But I'd been put off 'Covenant' for numerous reasons. Whilst I enjoy 'Prometheus' and thought it a commendable but flawed sci-fi effort, it seemed narratively far removed from the original Alien movie. And whilst an origin story perhaps needs time to develop, it seemed that the writers had written themselves into a corner with 'Prometheus'. In fact, they'd admitted as much themselves, at its release.To my surprise, 'Covenant' connects the two films together well, whilst gradually bridging the gap between 'Prometheus', and how it could eventually lead to the Alien were were introduced to in the original 'Alien' with Sigourney Weaver.Michael Fassbender is a great actor, despite having starred in some weak movies in his career. But I found his protrayal of android character 'David' to be the most enigmatic, interesting, and compelling of all of them in 'Prometheus'. He was also subtly sinister, his motives being unclear, particularly when he intentionally contaminates Dr Elizabeth Shaw's partner in 'Prometheus'. So it made perfect sense to make him the main protagonist and antagonist in 'Covenant', and to build upon his unhinged 'creative' streak that began aboard Prometheus using the pathogen he'd discovered.The rest of the cast in 'Covenant' are perfectly suitable and play their parts well, and Ridley Scott and the writers don't make the mistake of bogging the audience down with pointless backstory or boring exposition with characters who are ultimately doomed, instead effectively using them to drive the overaching narrative forward. I was pleasantly surprised with 'Covenant', and find it such a shame that a solid sci-fi movie, and a respectable addition to the Alien franchise and lore bombed at the box office and has been harshly received by critics and audiences.",Alien - Covenant
482,jzathajenious,"Not a terrible film, but lacking any trace of ambition or inspiration.",6,12 August 2017,"The only compliments I can pay Alien Covenant (the latest attempt to make the Alien franchise relevant again) is that at 2 hours the film didn't feel like it dragged and that it was fairly well directed. However, with a screenplay lacking any new ideas or inspiration, plus some baffling, unexplained events and character behaviours, it really has nothing that will stick with you after leaving the cinema. We have a crew that exhibit little to no personality, thus we have no reason to care when they start dying. I honestly cannot remember any of their names. We have a Xenomorph that most of the time is CG (and honestly not very impressive CG) which removes so much of the Alien's menace. In the original film, when we see the visceral, solid Alien with shiny sharp teeth, breath coming from its mouth while actual drool drips from its mouth, THAT is scary. That Ridley Scott of all people doesn't understand this major difference is baffling to me. Alien Covenant shows a director who has sadly lost all inspiration in his craft. As bad as Prometheus was, at least it had ambition to take the franchise in a different direction. Alien Covenant is simply a forgettable experience.",Alien - Covenant
483,sadak7599,Did IQ's drop sharply while I was away?,2,21 May 2017,"Save your money and time! this movie is a mess. I gave it a 2 because the visuals and FX are good (although quite standard, no evidences of the strong visual style of Ridley Scott, which made historic movies as Alien or Blade Runner)The movie is dumb, with a ridiculous and predictable plot, full of stupid and cringe situations, unlikable, weak and undeveloped characters, illogical decisions, the baddest Science Fiction ever, lack of suspense or thrill, and complete lack of coherence with other movies in the Alien universe, specially with the original and legendary Alien ( which is still the best movie of the saga, followed closely by Cameron's Aliens) When I was watching the movie, I remembered the quote of Ellen Ripley in Aliens: ""Did IQ's drop sharply while I was away?"" because it seems that the IQ of the writers dropped sharply from 1986 to now.Please Mr. Scott, stop making movies. Maybe it is time to retirement, before you completely ruin your reputation. To the writers: I recommend to think more, watch previous movies, increase your science-fiction culture and study more before writing. During writing, please, use Wikipedia or something. Now some spoilers:The movie is bad from minute 1 to the end. The spaceship design is illogical and, aside of this, what to say about the ""neutrino burst"" that damaged the ship. C'mon, seriously? is it so time consuming to check what the heck is a neutrino in google?. According to the writers, neutrinos are more or less like cal .050 bullets fired directly to the spaceship by hundreds of machine-guns. In a movie for fans of Aliens and Sci-Fi is highly probable that a LOT of people in the cinema knows what actually is a neutrino. This situation kick you off the movie. When the ""neutrinos"" damaged the ship, there where A LOT of laughing in the theater. - This movie contains which probably is the most ridiculous character ever played by James Franco. Together with neutrinos, are unintended comedy. - What to say about the mad android trying to rape a girl or kissing to his twin brother. - The crew of the ship exhibit constantly a complete lack of human intelligence. I would need too much space and time to detail the cringe and illogical movements and actions of the crew. - The movie contains a blatant and SHAMELESS copy of situations taken from Cameron's Aliens, but much WORSE. Specially the fight against the alien which managed to reach the spaceship and is expelled to the space (sounds familiar?). So, add a complete lack of originality to this mess. - So, the mad android made genetic experiments in a cave, without laboratory and without any animal to experiment with. Also he draw a lot of medieval-like scrolls with drawings taken from Giger... SMART, WRITERS! - I could continue...but I spent enough time with this mess. Overall, this movie is a complete failure, a pathetic attempt to revive the past glory, which could be summarized in the use of specific visual elements used by Scott in the old good times (chains, industrial look of the spaceship...) and taking situations from the old good movies and using it after removing the emotion, intelligence and suspense. Covenant sadly converted Alien 4 and Prometheus in good movies.",Alien - Covenant

WHY???",2,5 June 2017,"Alright, I've had a few days to reflect upon Alien:Covenant, a few days to simmer down, let the rage subside, and hopefully write a rational and carefully crafted review of this abomination of a film. Notice, I wrote ""hopefully"". Here goes - first off, whose bright idea was it to cast Danny McBride? Huh? Seriously. OK, the dude is somewhat funny when he sticks to his bread and butter role of stoner, slacker, foul mouthed dirtbag. Trying to branch out into drama? Come on, man. You're not that good. Stick to being a side kick for James Franco and Seth Rogen. You're out of your element in sci-fi. Next up - that sad-sack Waterston. I'm sure she is a fantastic actress, but why have her play the role like a limp, lame, unconvincing, droopy-eyed, sorry to be here, but all of a sudden a determined tough as nails leader. Sorry. Didn't believe it for a minute. And for strike 3 - Billy Crudup. Now, I like Billy. But, like McBride, he's out of his element here in sci-fi. Fassbender is, well, Fassbender. Can't go wrong with him, but we all know that. Now for ridiculousness in no particular order, just questions from my stream of consciousness - traumatic -cinematic experience. Why are these astronauts, scientists, colonists, marines, whatever, so effing stupid? Why? Why, Ridley, why did you have xenomorphs popping out of chests, backs and growing at super exponential rates? And don't give me this bullsh*t about David making different hybrids. That's completely lazy-ass writing. I'm embarrassed for you, for the actors, for the writers, and everyone else associated with this turd of a film. And for the love of God, how is it that the Engineers - a seemingly superior race, all happen to congregate in one freakin' place on their planet for David to wipe them out so easily? And if they're so advanced as to create these viral plagues and flying spaceships that look like overbaked croissants, why do they look and dress like they're from ancient Greece or Rome? Huh? They all just happen to live in a 2 mile radius on that planet? None live anywhere else, huh? Give me a f'king break. And finally - a shower sex scene, huh? Really? I mean, really?? I think Ridley is just an old man pervert and wanted to get the two actors naked so he could jerk on his shriveled up, xenomorphed member while that scene was filmed.

Aliens Covenant is total garbage. Yeah it's kinda stomach churning and mildly tense in parts but the ridiculous way it's itself set up can't help a viewer feeling cheated. I walked out of this dumb film wanting a refund. It was stupid on almost every level. But the scriptwriters need to be singled out for their utter incompetence. The story is incredulous.

490,Icedooitle,"Frustrating Alien Prequel, Exemplary Prometheus Sequel",7,28 May 2017,"This is a rare film review for me. It's one that will celebrate the quality, imagination, and depth of a story, while also never settling on being a firm recommendation. Alien: Covenant rounds out one of the most spectacular universes in all of cinema, while doing little to live up to the advertised subject matter. This dissonance makes for a frustrating Alien prequel, and an exemplary Prometheus sequel. Ridley Scott lit a fuse for a boundless concept in 1979 that spread beyond his own imagination. Developments brought about in Aliens and Alien 3 have become such companion pieces to the original that when Scott began working on a prequel in 2000, he tapped James Cameron as a writer. When inferior prequels such as AVP perverted tangential focus from their ideas, a broader scope was sought. The connections in Prometheus to the original feature were incidental; As much as Alien was a pure horror that was incidentally Sci-Fi. Based on the lukewarm reaction to Prometheus, I have always believed that viewers were unsatisfied with the light touch it used to bridge the two features, and how heavy handed it was in its own direction. Therefore, those expecting a true ""Alien"" film will be disappointed in Covenant's approach to the alien itself, but enthralled with how thoroughly it delves into the thoughts provoked in Prometheus.The colonization vessel Covenant is on its long journey to a new planet. It's not made clear what shape Earth is in, but the 2000+ colonizers and crew seem to be making a one-way trip. After an incident (similar to that of Passengers) forces crew members awake, that all-too-familiar signal from another planet is detected and rouses interest. The source is a planet, seemingly better suited for colonization than their original. The decisions at this point are made without a firm resolve, as the captain has perished during the aforementioned incident. Oram (Billy Crudup) has taken command and is so anxious he seems to second-guess nervous ticks. The Ripley- esque voice of reason, Daniels (Katherine Waterston), has lost her husband (the captain) and is none-too-keen and deviating from the plan. Daniels is not alone in having a spouse on board, as every member of the crew is working alongside a husband or a wife, colonizing by example.Once on the surface of the source planet, we find an environment more suited for Predator than Alien. Torrential rain feeds a never- ending forest and there is scarcely a flat surface to be found. The constant flow of water from lakes and falls masks an unsettling quality, silence. Such a hospitable environment is void of all animal life. The ground crew is made up of the essential characters. The captain, Daniels, some armed muscle and a new generation of synthetic man, Walter (Michael Fassbender). Walter is noticeably different from Prometheus's David. More than a different accent and physicality, Walter's personality lacks the deceptive and self- assured nature of David, effectively a more efficient slave. The stark difference between the two Fassbenders is made much clearer when the crew finds the sole inhabitant of the planet, David.Ten years have passed since the events of Prometheus, and David has been busy. Having lost his only companion since his arrival on the planet, Shaw (Noomi Rapace), he has built a lonely and elaborate dwelling in the mausoleum of a lost society. It is in this setting that the marvelous possibilities posed in Prometheus are elaborated on like poetry between Walter and David. Fassbender plays both roles with impeccable timing. Even in identical close-ups, it is unmistakable which synthetic is which. From this encounter the central theme is revealed, the privilege and hubris of creation; Creation being the essential difference between the two. In David's chambers, countless experiments are displayed. Amazing drawings are laid out as if David had H.R. Geiger on commission. With a plentiful supply of Engineer canisters at his disposal, the mysteries surrounding the vacant planet start to become darkly clear.From the trailers, and even the poster, we know that Xenomorph will eventually make its appearance, along with some inventive other creatures. And it is in this vein I would imagine viewers will get decidedly less than the bargained for. Prometheus was, wisely, never promoted as an ""Alien movie."" Covenant has been advertised as a Xenomorph absorbed horror film, and it simply isn't. The discord of expectations will inevitably cause unnecessary disappointment. When the focus turns to the favorite movie monster, the beats of formula start drumming and the final half-hour feels like a misplaced fourth act. An overly-familiar sequence trying to deliver on a promise that shouldn't have been made in the first place. Other elements of the film are praiseworthy. Because this isn't purely a horror feature, when the crew experiences loss the actors have time to show range through grief and hopelessness, rather than simply running for their lives. Danny McBride as the pilot Tennessee isn't relegated solely into the role of comic relief, giving more than you might expect. Samantha Waterston is too numbed by tragedy from the start to go through the same descent into madness as Weaver or Rapace, but creates a heroine all her own. In most other features, Crudup can be counted on to be a muted and self-assured everyman. Here, he breaks new ground as convincingly neurotic, un- composed and unsure. By far the best performance is by Fassbender. As David, he is an amalgam of great villains and powerful leading men. As Walter there is an understated kindness that challenges David. The synthetics are the profound and pivotal creations of the film, just perhaps not the ones you paid to see.",Alien - Covenant

Simply abandon the mission, forget all rules about scanning a unknown planet or safely landing on it. Why bother wearing protective clothes. Biohazards? What are they. Instead touch and sniff anything thats weird. Dont stay together: much safer. When in yrouble: forget your traning but get hysterical. Explosive infections: bring them aboard asap! With 2000 sould still in mortal danger... make love in a shower. The list is endless and I fear I will add spoilers so Ill stop.
Honestly, it is a nice movie to watch but only with a comedy in mind. Even if it was not intended to be. Grab a soda and popcorn, grin and ejoy the mad ride :)",Alien - Covenant
497,gelmcchristop,I came looking for copper-and I found gold,10,20 August 2020,"If you are into really solid and balanced productions, this movie won't let you down. I watched it mainly for the visuals, turns out this thing is at least comparable to vfx and cinematography masterpieces like Bladerunner 2049, if not better. The acting is generally balanced, while some particular actors delivered jaw-dropping performances. The directing is subtle but high quality, the jumpscares in particular were the best thing that i've watched in a long time (note that i am not a horror movie person). The scenario was great, and the flow of the action ""absorbed"" my attention for the whole 2 hours. Oh, and just learned there is a whole lore behind this.

498,SharkByteAudioProductions,A solid entry in the Alien franchise - undeserving of the hate it received,8,23 September 2018,"Personally I've seen all of entries in to the Alien franchise - Alien is the best film, Aliens is most entertaining, Alien 3 is most disappointing, Alien Resurection was most awful, Prometheus was interesting but felt too much of a set up for the franchise and that brings us to Covenant.Many die hard fans may not like this film because of the direction Ridley Scott takes with certain characters and how it builds upon the Alien franchise, rather than focusing on the direction he took in Prometheus.The expansion of xenomorphs and androids in this movie is what makes it interesting as an Alien prequel - many will scoff at this comment but Scott's direction was unexpected and it gives the franchise more depth and lore - it's a somewhat disappointing Prometheus sequel but a very enjoyable Alien movie.While characters continue to make poor decisions in this franchise (arguably a staple of these films), it definitely leads to some of the goriest sequences seen in the franchise which was very entertaining and visually impressive - we also haven't seen Xenomorphs impressively move like they do in this movie. The score, cinematography, acting and focus arguably makes it the best Alien movie since Aliens for me personally. It's great to still see Ridley Scott behind the franchise but I think everyone would like to see Neil Bloomkamp take the reins next, especially if he plans to ignore Alien3 and Resurection.",Alien - Covenant

500,carolethecatlover,Truly disappointing,3,12 May 2017,"I was really looking forward to this movie, since Prometheus had such possibilities. Even wrote my own scenario. Did Ridley Scott have his arm twisted to come up with something 'commercial'? i.e., that what was successful before. There are twists and twists within twists. The acting works, Ms Waterson, daughter of Sam, is excellent and totally believable in every scene. Fassbinder and some lesser known actors all acquit themselves well. (even Danny McBride, whom I can't abide, dials down the smut and stupidity to play a likable human). It really contains nothing that alien fans have not seen before. Such a lost possibility!",Alien - Covenant
501,Fortressofdoors,Lost in the masses,7,6 May 2018,"For those that might find this review within the multitude of others. First I suppose I should give my thoughts, in what is a very short summary on the previous films to show where I stand, for those that care:Alien- Classic. Flawless. My favorite film of all time.Aliens- A worthy follow up, although 57 years in hyper sleep might be a stretch.Alien 3- I was initially disappointed in the theater. The more I watched it, the more I appreciated it and felt bad for Fincher and what he must have been up against trying to make this impossible film. The assembly cut is considerably better and regained my respect. This should have been the end of the series, just as it was intended to be, with the death of Ripley.Alien Resurrection- Hated it and still do for so many reasons I wont go into here. In my opinion, the worst of the series, hands down. A truly laughable film.Prometheus- I sat in my car for 30 minutes after I watched it trying to piece it together. I became more forgiving over multiple viewings, and although I can appreciate that Ridley was trying to do something different and it was a visually stunning film, that doesn't change the fact that the crew were supposed to be the best professionals in their field, made some pretty bone headed basic mistakes. I was also disappointed that the mysterious space jockey was written to be a mere guy in a suit after years and years of imagining what it could be.Alien Covenant: So finally I'm here at this film. It's hard to review really with so many afterthoughts of Prometheus mixed in and reading so many other reviews and opinions, so I will go off of my initial thoughts as I sat in the theater watching it. Honestly, I was excited. I felt like I was finally watching another Alien film again. I hadn't been this excited since watching Aliens in 86. I liked the fact that there were little throwbacks to the original Alien that they slipped in. Maybe to many in hindsight. I do think that most of the characters were mere cannon fodder, and the shower scene was totally out of place for an Alien movie and belonged more in a Friday the 13th type of movie. I didn't care much for Katherine Waterston as Daniels. The bad haircut and the constant sad deer in the headlights look is just off putting , but that's just a shallow nit-pick if I'm honest. Overall it all seemed to just work.In the end, I guess we can be critical of this series, or this movie in particular for many reasons. The end goal is to entertain us, and for me, that's exactly what it did. I do have issues with some points, but overall I would say they are few. I think a lot of people are spoiled with movies today and are so easy to dismiss them without taking any time at all to appreciate what must have gone into making a film of this caliber. Dare I say, anyone ranking this below a 5 are among those people.",Alien - Covenant

There they are attacked by the alien and the prefixed pictures of aliens using human body to grow themselves. but soon the entire plot changes with the appearance of David the survivor of prometheus.Then the movie takes turn to a interesting one as question about the fate of other surviver of prometheus Dr. shaw comes forward.

I felt nothing for any of the characters. Cannot believe the same person directed this after directing the original.
Stupid characters stumbling around getting themselves killed. Annoyed me how they just blunder onto an unknown planet taking deep breaths of air when they should know alien planets could quite well have dangerous microbes. As soon as that golden sail was popped up like some sort of space umbrella I thought 'that looks delicate'.
The shower scene deaths were particularly terrible - throw away. I felt nothing.
The way the woman was swung around by a rope on the space ship - rubbish and unbelievable. She would have died....
The speed that the aliens developed inside people from specks in an ear to back busting killing machines? - at least the original alien had an utterly realistic life cycle that took less than an hour to go from face hugger to little bitey creature.
It just threw everything into the mix to try to please everyone.

504,dangkoen,Solid addition to a good saga,8,13 September 2017,"After the alright Prometheus & the so-so trailers I was apprehensive about Covenant.I liked the performances especially Michael Fassbender (in a dual role), Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride & Billy Crudup. The visuals were stunning, as is contemporary for a Ridley Scot-film. Kudos to Darius Wolski especially, who's been Scott's collaborator since Prometheus.The more bugsome parts of the film are the expendable characters & the surprisingly underused alien city on Paradise. However, along with the aforementioned performances these factors are redeemed by David's & Walter's interactions surrounding past & current events on & off Paradise.This culminates in an intriguing climax where David essentially tests his new creations (a welcome return for the Xenomorphs). At first the swapping with Walter seems predictable, but it's clear on repeated thoughts & viewings there should be no surprise. It's made sublety clear David is now the android aboard the Covenant & is somewhat disappointed yet pleased with the outcome. His first 2 creations have perished, but he gained excellent hosts for his morbid plans.Alien Covenant is an enjoyable film & earns it's spot among the Alien-films with class.",Alien - Covenant

A world so bleak and dark that made you feel isolated and alone?Alien Covenant is without a doubt beautiful. The scenery was gloomy, foreboding yet so captivating. In my head i could only think of how many times they had taken the nightmarish illustrations of H.R. Giger and brought it to life once more.But my praise for this movie ends with the visuals alone.There is a mix of shock horror and suspense here, however the narrative tends to slow the movie down.Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the philosophical narrative about creation or existence, it is a theme that has been seen in Prometheus, but i think that they explained and narrowed it down better in this movie.By now you're probably asking me, so how was the acting, how was the cast or execution, what about the xenomorph!?See here is the issue, the two biggest strength that carried the whole movie were atmosphere and its narrative.As a whole, the acting is fine, the cast was doable, only a few leads held this movie together.Now for the Xenomorph (Protomorph)If you only came to see Alien covenant for the Xenomorph, i have some bad news for you.If you're invested in the prequels for their narrative and visuals then lets await the last piece of the puzzle...",Alien - Covenant

A lot of People hated Prometheus including a lot of so called Alien fans. As a huge fan of the Alien franchise myself, including AVP, i still consider Prometheus a great movie. I was one of the few fans who thoroughly enjoy it. Believe me i got a lot of hate from fanatic NERDS for enjoying Prometheus. Normal people gave me nothing.CUT TO: Five years later. Alien: Covenant arrives. Verdict? Dead on Arrival. This is not the movie i waited five years to see. The story set up at the end of Prometheus is what i wanted and didn't get. WTF happened? Well to all you so called Alien fans who wanted an Alien prequel, you got your wish. I hope you're all happy. Oh wait! You didn't show up Opening weekend to show your enthusiasm because it sucked and now you're all on here complaining again. Ridley & Fox tried to please these fans and as it turns out, when you try to please everyone you end up pleasing no one. Ridley, You should've stayed true to the story of SHAW & DAVID'S journey to PARADISE to find out why the Engineers changed their mind. Period!ALIEN COVENANT is a REMAKE of ALIEN created on the loose story line from Prometheus with just minor differences. Let me break it down: Alien storyline: Crew on Large cargo ship receives unknown signal. Crew checks it out despite danger and protest from other crew members. Expedition goes to crap and people die. Alien ends up on mothership.Covenant storyline: Same as above, except crew are scientists instead of merchants. Signal is from Engineer ship just like Alien.Differences: Alien was a horror film in space. The characters were great, relatable, compelling, and different from one another. So you care about them when they're in jeopardy. It was a low budget movie shot on film with no computer effects.Covenant is a movie that wants to be a horror film and an action film in space but gets confused. Therefore, the characters are dull, boring, not relatable, and forgettable. So you don't care about them at all and end up rooting for the alien to kill them all so the movie can end. This was an expensive 100 million dollar film shot on UHD Video with excessive computer effects. It also has the cheesiest twist ending that will motivate M Night Shyamalan to make some MAC & CHEESE with extra cheese. Summary: Even the Best fall down sometimes and refuse to shine.

511,nmn34,The Aliens Movie I Still Never Wanted,3,26 May 2017,"The Alien franchise has gotten on Mr. Bones Wild Ride and the end is nowhere to be seen. When audiences saw the giant mummified alien in the first movie, they awed blissfully unaware that they were going to be stuck hearing about them 30 years later. And that is the crutch of everything wrong with this movie: its head has firmly disappeared up its own arse.There is a danger in writing stories with in depth lore. In crafting the world, you easily forget to actually tell an interesting story. Alien Covenant isn't an interesting story where the characters have agency in the events unfolding, its events 1000 years ago. But then why not just make a movie about events 1000 years ago? Why do we need to involve people in the now? And how does this help them overcome their current situation? Now 1000 years is hyperbole, but the rest of this is a legitimate issue. the whole movie feels like part of a bigger movie, a rather small part that was stretched well beyond its means. As though they took the scene where Kane gets the face hugger attached to his face from the first film, ran it until the xenomorph burst from his chest, and stretched it for an hour and a half before rolling credits. Yes they are planning to add more as the series continues, but everything here was so unsubstantial, its already wearing thin. It just doesn't feel like a complete movie.This is especially disappointing as there is something to thee characters. There are a lot of them that seem like they would be compelling if given the chance. The religious first mate and his wife/girlfriend, the pilot and his wife who is also a pilot, and the terraforming experts whose husband was the captain before his hibernation pod fell and turned into an oven for some reason (kind of a serious design flaw), there was a lot that they could have done with them if they gave them some sort of control over their lives. Instead they are unceremoniously popped off. Instead we get most of the story from the android, the one character who has as little personality as possible. Cold and unfeeling best describes the movie. Watching Michael Fastbender play two roles would be great if they weren't both him trying to be as stone faced as possible as he teaches himself to play the flute.There is too much emotional distance between the audience and the Covenant's crew already but the technique with which they are killed is also sorely lacking. Everyone has seen the tail in the shower scene from the trailer. What they don't realize is that i pretty much the entire scene. A good movie teases it, builds suspense gradually until the violins reach a crescendo and the audience is at the edge of their seats. Alien Covenant just drops it on the floor unceremoniously. It is worse than a jump scare, its a jump scare that tries to be more than it is but not very hard. The lack of suspense is palpable, even the xenomorphs are phoning it in. The first alien attack is in bright daylight, it sticks out like a sore thumb as a barely passable SyFy CGI neomoprph is born and immediately goes on a killing spree. In spite of the fact its four inches tall and they probably could have just put the boots to it. The alien is around too much, it climbs walls, walks in plazas, and descends ladders, we know so much about it that it ceases to be an ever present threat and becomes another character that doesn't really have any importance to the story.Now the alien, what have they done to them? There is something strange about how they consider them to ""evolve,"" the superior alien is the black xenomorph over the white neomorphs but there explanation why falls on its face. Functionally, they are very similar. They move the same, have the same speed, and look generally the same, the only difference being the xenomorph's second mouth. But production wise, they made the xenomorph more complicated and dare say more vulnerable. It transitions through multiple stages to reach maturity, the face hugger, the larval, and the full sized form but that seems hardly as effective as their predecessor which has only two, spore and beast form. As weapon, it just adds more bulk to it, one face hugger needs a foot tall egg while the spore eggs are the size of a mushroom. The spores were even proved more fatal in the flashback, wiping out an entire colony of engineers in seconds. The neomorphs also take a lot more bullets to kill apparently, the infant neomorph takes a face full of buckshot like a champ. It doesn't even bleed. If Ripley fought a colony of that in Aliens, she'd be up a creek. The Covenant crew were lucky there were only two.I want a new Alien. Alien is one of the best horror movies. Aliens is one of the best action movies. Alien 3... lets just stop at Aliens. But what I am trying to get at is this Alien universe that they are creating is counter productive. It sucks the mystery out of everything and questioning where we came from isn't all that important when there is a giant space insect/penis about to bite your head off.",Alien - Covenant

Just like in the movie 'Life', expect the crew on spacecraft to be totally, unapologetically, inept in every sci -fi movie these days. I don't understand how this is meant to be entertaining. But more disappointing is the predictable ending, and the lame 'reveal'. Ripley's intuition was on the mark, but in a universe of possibilities, is this best that writers can imagine?

516,yoncenator,"Spoilers, Well Ridley time to let go I think.",4,25 May 2017,"I'm not really sure how, but Ridley Scott has now made the worst of all the Alien films. Even Resurrection was more interesting than this film. I went in with low expectations and I didn't expose myself to any trailers or spoilers so I gave it a real chance to rise above. I enjoyed Prometheus. There was so much from the original yet so much new and I thought while it still didn't answer many questions it gave a lot to the series and some good extreme moments but stayed true to the canon. Covenant just doesn't make sense. Quarantine protocols are obviously mentioned, yet no one seems to use them in either of the last 2 films. How did David make an egg without a queen? If he could make an egg why couldn't he make an alien? How does the more advanced artificial person not outsmart the deficient one?? How does another Engineer ship make it to LV-426? Goddammit now we're going to have to sit through at least one (more likely two) more films to connect the whole series and this one didn't even make much advancement on the story. I just wish that both of the last 2 films would have been written with characters that were more believable. I'm not even talking about the engineers. The first film, the mining crew, even though it had blue collar individuals, they had concerns about being payed full shares and got ANGRY when one single alien was taking out their entire crew. They weren't exploring unknown planets with their EVA suits open smelling and touching as many foreign objects as they could before returning to the ship.Aside from all the holes, gone also is all the tension, No one that rises above in the crew, no one to root for. I actually started rooting for the alien which I know won already because well LV-426. WE ALL know the aliens win. I understand the plot problems when you already know who has to win to connect to the first film, but I don't know anyone that would follow and trust a character that I just found out murdered other humans. It's completely safe just stick your head near the opening of a huge egg I just created. NOPE. This could have been the film that left you ANXIOUS for the next film, not dreading it.

Hollywood seems to insist on having us believe that the astronauts corps is drawn from the moron class rather than the real life reality where only the very brightest make the grade.

519,pgaucher683,Finally..,8,16 June 2017,"..they've reached the dam..Airlock, everybody agree, the very first Alien was/is a masterpiece, nobody can do better except R.Scott.So for me, Alien Covenant is as good as Prometheus is a disaster, Prometheus was beautiful, design wise and bad because of the weakest women lead in the franchise or the lack of a strong one, here it's more like the very 1st one.We follow a colony ship -the Covenant- who must reach a new planet with 2000 people +crew and embryos to start over, they'll have to stop, because of an accident during a routine made by Walter (M.Fassbender)which lead to woke up the Crew earlier and then because they'll receive a com. from a smaller planet around, this time it's not Mother who stop the ship and it's the captain who order the discovery mission, (you know, between 7 yrs in Cryo sleep and a few weeks to reach a new heaven, it's easy to choose.) Every thing will go wrong as soon as they arrive because, even after a century of space travel, they are not prepared to walk somewhere else than on the good old Earth. When they land it's Earth like, but there is nothing except forest, water, lakes and ..wheats, no birds ,bugs, or any single animals, just some form of pollen; Now take a women who is in charge of a shuttle but can't handle a sick person without a panic attack and it will opens hell's gate for the whole crew.They'll be rescued by the only one person around, an hermit played by.. M.Fassbender-who is terrific here- (like in Prometheus BTW)and if you remember Prometheus, you'll know at first sight where they are.the 1st good point is, even the cast isn't unknown, they are not that famous which is really good (for me) (i've seen alien the 8th passenger in theatre, i was young and i just know , T.Skerrit and J.Hurt by that time) they all did good, but a really special mark for Katherine Waterston, she don't have a cat, but what she surely have is, Rippley's spirit and.. balls. the 2nd one, whether some people here like it or not, A.Covenant is the best sequel to the 1st one than any other, of course they'll do the same mistakes, of course you know what's gonna happen, but it's more dramatic, it's less claustrophobic (slightly),more fast paced. Thirdly, R.Scott used a lot from the 1st and a few idea from the 2nd and the 3rd opus in this one.Don't think i've spoiled many thing here, but you'll discover a bigger treat than the Xenomorph himself in this story. I don't know if there will be a follow up but i hope so, for those who says R.Scott killed the franchise, they are really wrong.i recommend this to anyone who like Aliens",Alien - Covenant

You don't even have to read the rest of this, because in the end, that is what have to say. That is all I have to say. Alien: Covenant sucks. It sucks hard. But Alien: Covenant sucks in a very sneaky kind of way. It seems like a pretty good movie, almost like a return to the original movie, for the first 90 minutes or so, and then it falls back on the same stupid premise of Prometheus, the prequel to the original movie. Alien: Covenant is in fact the sequel to a horrible prequel. It ends up relying on one of those M. Night Shamalmawhatshisface ""What a twist!"" endings that only a lobotomy would prevent any semi intelligent viewer from seeing coming a mile away, and which the characters would have to be semi morons not to see, and of course they don't. I don't know what happened to Ridley Scott. Maybe he ran out of good ideas. Maybe he got trapped in the Hollywood formula mill. Or maybe he's just collecting paychecks at this point. He used to be a pretty good film maker. The first Alien film is one of the great monster movies of all time. But somewhere along the line he stopped letting the most disturbing parts of his films be what we don't see and started insisting on showing us all the money that he's spending on special effects. Great horror, great drama happens in the mind of its audience. It is hinted at, never fully revealed. In the same way that we were never fully shown Rosemary's Baby or the shark in Jaws, it was the hints of the creature glimpsed in shadows and darkness that made the first Alien great and Scott just doesn't seem to know how to do that anymore, or doesn't want to do that anymore. I don't know why an actor as good as Michael Fassbender insists on being in so many bad movies. I don't know why Ridley Scott keeps trying to make the same bad movie over and over again. And I don't know why I watched this movie all the way through. I really don't. But maybe I can save you from the same mind numbing and annoying fate. Don't watch this movie. Watch any of the first three Aliens again, and be happy that we got those. Because it just got a lot worse after that. I'll say it again.

How can I possibly care for any one of them??? 4) The crew members have no obvious command chain. They all act like some school idiotas. This kind of structure cannot possibly survive. 5) Why don't they have any meaningful ways of protecting themselves against alien life forms? NO respirators -- NOTHING? Why do they bother wearing those idiotic caps with ""ears""? What's the point? There are potentially aggressive bio-entities out there of ""who-knows-what-sort""... At this moment I felt as though this amount of pure stupidity was WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much. So, I stopped watching. Enough is enough. I don't have to wallow in dirt in order to figure out that this dirty cold stuff is dirt. I do not feel obligated to be in any way ""nice"" to this sort of a completely trashy product.

523,TheDevilsNotetaker,Perfect example of a director eviscerating his own franchise!,1,16 July 2017,"Had massive high hopes for this seeing Ridley back in control. Starts off fine but moment they land on the planet its just downhill really really fast. First of all who the hell would send an expedition out to explore an unknown planet without proper environmental suits- however earth-like it looks? They could be so many alien parasites and germs (as it so happens). Even the Apollo Lunar Astronauts were put in 3 weeks quarantine when they came back from a near-vacuum landscape. Come On Ridley Scott- you better than this. Just that point made me wanna stop watching this crap.Afterwards it just becomes a merging of the first two Alien movies. Been there seen that 10 times better.And the xenomorphs are just too fast and hard to kill compared to whats already been put on film in Alien and Aliens, so much so that it spits in the face of those two masterpieces so to speak. And also the CGI makes them look much less realistic, less organic than the practical creature effects of the first two films.This is a perfect example of a director eviscerating his own franchise. Even the Alien vs Predator movies are far superior to this.Just watch Alien(1979) and Aliens(1986)and forget Covenant ever happened.",Alien - Covenant

I would like to have it back, and let the horror begin. Because this late Ridley Scott Alien movie is not like a good aged wine, this one is stale and skewed. And it not genius at all. What is Alien Covenant about? In short, is about taking the best parts out of its predecessors, adding some new planet ambiance, and half a dozen good new shots. That's it. The way Ridley Scott tried to emphazise the mysticism about the Alien universe is quite obvious, just everything which should deserve a profound discussion, by all those smart talkers, which could read endless Alien comics and stories, unless they don't find anything else to dissect. After this movie, you'll get more scared by the idea how endless human colony ships could try to populate every planet in this universe with the same stupid blindfolded visionary creativism than any Xenomorph could. Alien Covenant reveals how the Alien universe has become a boring methodology. If you think you are going to see an outstanding action movie, nada. An outstanding thrilling horror movie, nada. But a lame society and creator vision-centered construct, which never came close to something like in Matrix. Does the Alien universe really need this genealogy thing? 5/10 Good Bye, Alien.",Alien - Covenant

Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly of Alien Covenant...Good: Michael Fassbender as the androids David and Walter. Great scenery and general special effects. It feels like the crossover from the Prometheus world to the Alien one.Bad: The plot basically rips off/remakes the original Alien movie (even more so than Prometheus did). The film slows down mid-way (not that it was loaded with action up to that point) to give some exposition on what happened to Elizabeth Shaw and David. Limited number of (and encounters with) the Aliens.Ugly: The secondary characters all sucked and barely had any screen time to be developed. I didn't care if any of them lived or died. Completely borrows the titles, sounds, and music from the original Alien movie as if to say ""Hey, look at me, I'm an Alien movie!"" Not scary, original, exciting, or even memorable - it's ultra-basic fan service.Personally, I really never needed to know the origin of the eggs or the derelict from the first movie - it added mystery and left you guessing.

The characters do so many stupid things it completely ruins the movie. They land on a foreign planet in the middle of space and it just happens to have breathable air. Then they explore planet with no protective gear. It's an alien planet, there is absolutely no telling what kind of disease, microbes, creatures that are on the world. If I see a big bug I'm finding the nearest object to kill it. The stupid girl who gets locked in with the infected guy just sits there watching the alien grown. She is in a medical lab, why in Hades did she not find something to start bashing that alien while it was still just developing! Then other stupid scientists are poking alien pods and get infected. I could not stand it anymore, the plot, the screen writing, everything was stupid. Why do we continue to get these asinine movies. Can we please get a movie that isn't ridiculous.

I did read the bad reviews of the latest, Covenant, but could not image it could be so bad. The best part of the movie is the first part in space, which is quite good, but once the alien comes in the movie is all over the place. The landscape of the new planet is so obviously shot on earth...a wrong decision that killed Interstellar also. Anyway, the Alien is so stupidly aggressive, so the movie has zero suspense. There is also a long part that is very boring with just 2 persons talking, like a sage conversation with assumptions nobody cares about.

530,scandinavianmail,It just doesn't want to end,4,10 May 2017,"In the middle of repeating all the tested and tried alien scenes in a new order and in a new setting with (mostly) new actors, Alien Covenant manages to find a single reason to exist and that is to give Michael Fassbender space to chew the scenery in a dual role. The usually reliable Fassbender fails to lift the material above the ground, largely due to the predictable script that crawls to an obvious ending with a snail pace, dutifully disposing most of the human crew on the way.Worst than the movie itself, though, is Scott's attempt to tie all movies together. It looks increasingly like he makes things up as he goes, and the plot gets overly repetitive and curly. Those who love the original Alien might wish to skip these movies from now on, as Scott is approaching the original mythos from a deeply unsatisfying angle that probably lacks only one more piece to become his midichlorian moment. Once you see it, you cannot un-see it. You are warned.",Alien - Covenant
531,Metal_Robots,An improvement over Prometheus,7,25 May 2017,"To open: I know a lot of people really like Prometheus and think its attempt at a new direction was great. Personally I think the basic idea behind it was ambitous and could have been amazing, but it was ruined by trying to include TOO many ideas and too many irellevent characters, and definitely too many for the farcical, inadequate screenplay to hold together.Watched ALIEN: COVENANT last night. Definitely better than Prometheus. It's clear that the writers decided not to follow the exact story as was intended at the end of Prom, possibly due to the criticism it received. It had a lot of unashamedly obvious references and call-backs to Ridley Scott's original Alien, and even a couple of nods to other classic films of his like Blade Runner, with some very reminiscent scenes, and dialogue lifted straight-from. The first two acts kind of wrap-up what was introduced in Prom, the final act almost comes across as a soft reboot of Alien.It's an improvement over Prometheus no doubt, but still has a couple of annoyingly stupid characters doing annoyingly stupid things (luckily nowhere near as many is Prom did) and some silly plot elements that seem illogical, unnecessarily convoluted, or just plain unnecessary. (I really wish they had never introduced the black goo nonsense in the first place, the original parasite concept was perfect and much more scary, and adding more vectors muddied the elegance of it)The action is mostly good, except (ironically) for the scenes with what we now regard as the classic Xenomorph, which are almost totally lacking in tension, neither as shocking as Alien, or ominous as Aliens. Not wanting to sound too negative: The films looks great and you are getting your money's worth in terms of atmosphere and sound and production design. It has an effectively gritty tone compared to the (what I considered) shallow half-baked fantasy/allegory of Prom and all the performances are good to great. Michael Fassbender again has easily the best moments and plays dual-roles very well.Over-all i'd say it's a fairly good serious sc-fi action film compared to what little else similar is around these days, it has much less of the confused directionless feel that Prom had, and after having seen this, the sequel it obviously sets up at the end is more welcome now, even if Scott seems happy to comfortably sit and trade on past glories.I think we can now possibly expect a slew of average to quite good sequels if they carry on in this vein (and he stays in good enough health to carry on directing), I doubt there will ever be anything that has the same impact as the first two again.",Alien - Covenant

535,parkerchristman,Read Ending after Watching,8,10 June 2019,"I legitimately had to write a review after watching this, if only to set the record straight.I've been binge-watching all the films in the Alien and Predator franchise (for the first time) and this is the film that ends my marathon.Based on the reviews and comments, I really lowered the bar for this, no expectations other than disappointment.I'll describe this film as I do with Prometheus: a B-Movie overall with an A-Movie budget; yes, you'll get some campy, slasher scenes, but you'll marvel at at the world building and set design.I had a fun time with this movie, I think because around every turn, I expected disappointment. David was one of the most interesting parts of Prometheus, I enjoyed seeing what had changed.Here's the point of my review: I believe that SOME (not all) of the backlash of the film is the ending: the bad guy wins. One of the low-ball reviews on Metacritic alludes to the unsatisfying ending.I personally welcome the refreshing change of pace where the good guy doesn't always prevail. Pretty much all Alien films have some semblance of a happy ending. Here, there is NONE. And I like that.I expected, three-quarters through, that the film ended with some epic defeat of David in typical Hollywood fashion. But that never happened. Ridley has gone on the record saying he originally wanted to end the original Alien with Ripley's death and the Alien winning; here, he kind of gets his wish. David has everything he could ever want at his fingertips, and it's satisfying in the worst possible way.I end this review bummed that many of the haters fixate on an unhappy ending. I find these are the most memorable endings of movies, and I won't be forgetting this one anytime soon.",Alien - Covenant
536,bobhartshorn,Star (Wars) of David,8,13 May 2017,"I was left more than a tad underwhelmed by the Alien prequel that was 2012's Prometheus. It started well, had a spectacular finish and sucked like a smelly Alien egg in the middle. Expectations for this one were almost as non-existent as Theresa May's integrity but, against my better judgement, I went to see it anyway in the desperate hope it wouldn't suck (at least not too much). I'm delighted to report that, for the most part, it doesn't.A sleek and highly intriguing opening sequence quickly paves way to a more-of-the-same, spaceship-crew-awake-from-hypersleep-to-answer- distress-signal-on-hospitable-planet-and-unwisely-check-it-out shtick. And then it gets really good!I won't spoil it too much for you, but what Ridley Scott delivers this time around is a visually arresting, very exciting and thoroughly engaging mash-up of Alien & Prometheus surrounded by slasher movie tropes with gleeful riffs on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and a jaw-dropping moment lifted straight from the prologue of John Boorman's Zardoz shaping its centrepiece. Hell, he even cheekily integrates key beats from his own Blade Runner which, hopefully on this evidence, is a good omen for things to come from Dennis Villeneuve's imminent sequel.But, just like its predecessor, AC's real ace trump is Michael Fassbender, returning not once, but twice as the 'idiosyncratic' David, and his doppelganger upgrade 'brother', Walter. He excels in both roles, but it's the former who gets right under your skin. Via Fassbender's android Hannibal Lector spin, we get the perfect vessel to deliver Scott & screenwriters John Logan & D.W. Harper's impressively bleak musings on the future of mankind. It's also interesting that this is the second set of prequels from one of Fox's biggest tent poles (see Star Wars episodes 1-3) to feature an anti-hero at its core. Kudos says I.Sure, there's plenty wrong with it too: there are no annoying characters around like there was on tap in Prometheus, but most of the cast are mere Facehugger/Xenomorph grist for the mill. Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup & Danny McBride give strong, solid performances and do enough to register interest, but next to Fassbender's powerhouse turn, its weak tea.Also, Scott relies too much on repeating dialogue, action and music cues from his 79 original (and even Cameron's Aliens) than try and create something fresh. He executes everything with maximum efficiency and the set pieces come off more enthralling & attention grabbing than they've any right to be. But its crystal clear Scott's heart is firmly with David & the big existential questions.The creatures are a hit & miss bunch too: the Pan's Labyrinth like Neomorphs are suitably ghastly and effective, but the more traditional monsters come over like brand obligation bit-players in their own movie. They're far from a box office red herring, but they're not much more than an after-thought either.Griping aside, Scott has largely redeemed himself with a pacy hybrid of bloody exploitation slice & dice action and hardcore life-the- universe-and-everything science-fiction philosophising that resonates loudly with the gloomy here and now. This is a Summer blockbuster with brains and a vision that, even at its most predictable and downbeat, never forgets to entertain. You may be able to spot the pay-off to AC coming a mile away, but it gets the one it needs and the one you want to see. And Sir Ridley doesn't let you down. Roll on Episode Three!",Alien - Covenant

It seems that it is very easy if we take as an example this film, that this is what has managed to do in the worst way, leaving the spectator with bread crumbs, instead of a whole loaf. Here you have a failed creation, filled with unfinished and poorly worked scenes, unconnected and unstable, and with...a couple of flute courses that do not really tend to humour, but to ridicule and lead to frustration. Really? Flute lessons Mr. Ridley Scott? You want the spectator to do and feel what exactly after that? No laughs there, not even the slightest smile, but simply and plainly, disappointment and rejection.At least we should thank the creators of this film for the beautiful planet they have created, with the super tall trees, the thunderstorms, the waterfalls and wheat prairie, the overall aerie atmosphere, even for the great big alien city filled with statues, columns and monuments.The thing is, I didn't pay a visit to the movies to watch a documentary, like the rest of you I am sure, but a film that is named Alien, and I expected everything!

538,benj-20839,2 Awful Alien Movies In A Row Now. Neill Blomkapt HEEEELP!!,1,18 June 2017,"I'll get this out of the way first, i really enjoyed 1979's Alien and loved 1986's Aliens but i very much disliked Ridley Scott's sleep inducing 2012 film Prometheus!A couple of friends that loved Prometheus(ALARM BELLS) had assured me that this was nothing like that previous disaster. I also watched a fantastic documentary this week called Jodorowsky's Dune, about the making of a sci-fi movie called Dune that got cancelled by a nervous studio roughly a month before going into production in the mid 1970's. The script, storyboards, concept art, soundtrack collaborators and actors were all ready to go, on what seems like the most important project in Hollywood and film history, a real game changer! The visionary genius of Alejandro Jodorowsky assembled a team that was very against the typical Hollywood system of doing things and selected an bunch of leftfield creative artists to fulfil his vision for his sci-fi epic. I'm telling you this as it is HUGELY important to the Alien franchise and to science fiction cinema since. People should know that the reason Alien looks and feels the way it does is solely because of Jodorowsky's Dune project and so should be more commonly known and acknowledged. The team he put together, the storyboards and concept art that were created for Dune is basically what Alien, Blade Runner, Star Wars became. The studios were equally dazzled and scared about what Jodoowsky wanted to do with Dune and after it got cancelled the same studios hired HIS team to basically re- create(copy) what they had done with Dune for Alien and Blade Runner! Imagine if you will Alien and Blade Runner without that particular distinctive look and feel, it would have just looked and felt like any other 70s and early 80s sci-fi film and would possibly be forgotten like many of them now too.So what did i think of Alien Covenant...i thought WHAT a waste of time! We have basically been given the exact same film as Alien and Prometheus, absolutely nothing new or fresh, same story, same structure. Spaceship full of crew, they wake up, land on a strange planet, aliens kill or infect a few on the land, then a few on the ship and that's it, the end! If you want to see that then just watch the 1979 Alien again! Roughly the first hour of Alien Covenant was pretty low key, giving you a chance to drift off and think about what to eat once you leave the cinema or whatever pops into your head. From then it shifts a gear away from that plodding Prometheus style(that film NEVER shifted from neutral unfortunately) but just wasn't enough and felt lifeless. One slightly exciting action sequence that shifted it into 2nd gear lasted about 5 minutes and really didn't warrant the effort of putting the clutch down, in the whole scheme of things! The film was predictable because you've seen this whole scenario before and in a million other similar type films. I started checking my phone halfway through to see how long i had left to endure of this which isn't good. Someone had told me the visuals in Alien Covenant were amazing and to be witnessed at the cinema, absolutely NOT True, there was nothing you haven't seen before with many big budget movies of the last 20 so years. The film was not scary as some have said and what action it did have was not inventive and definitely not worth a trip to cinema for. What we have with Alien Covenant is exactly the same story, structure and look as Ridley Scott's previous 2 Alien films. After the public polarization of Prometheus I expected him to tread new ground with this movie, especially because he acknowledged THAT issue and said changes will be made with this instalment. The only change made was upping the tempo, which still doesn't warrant watching it or it even being made. It felt like a poor attempt at a slasher film with even worse character development, a very shallow and forgettable crew. If i had to score it i'd give Alien Covenant a 1 out of 10, which is 1 more than what i gave Prometheus as it's basically a copy and paste job. It felt like a poor attempt at a slasher film. I would therefore recommend waiting to see this at home, hopefully for free if you are an Alien fan but if you're not then never bother, or just watch the original 1979 Alien and it's amazing 1986 action packed sequel directed by James Cameron, Aliens.Ridley Scott should have stuck to his no-sequels policy because unfortunately he has done a MASSIVE smoking alien turd on his original 1979 film with Prometheus and now Alien Covenant. Leave the Alien franchise alone dude, it was doing much better without you. His last 4 films were equally bad or worse, besides Exodus which i enjoyed, so along with a bunch of his previous poor films it has led me to the conclusion that he was just at the right place at the right time with the 1979 Alien film. It was clearly the creative art department that the studio hired that truly made that film the visionary classic it became, along with Blade Runner, which btw also polarized its audience like Prometheus did with its storytelling, but was an undisputed classic in regards to its vision which we should all thank Alejandro Jodorowsky for! I would have preferred it if Ridley Scott had used the time spent making these 2 new Alien instalments making 2 original films instead. I'd rather have had a fresh take on another subject than 2 near identical re-runs of his first film!Neill Blomkamp..HEEEEEELP!!",Alien - Covenant
539,LaLaLandSucks,An Entertaining Stupid Film,8,30 May 2017,"This film is on all levels of stupid. The characters are entirely clueless and are like caricatures of the previous groups in the Alien franchise. Yes, this film does destroy the mythology of the Alien franchise. At this point, who cares though. If Ridley can cash in and become lazy by turning the Alien films into slasher flicks like Friday the 13th or Final Destination, let him. Either you pay to see or you avoid. They're 100% stupid, funny, and entertaining. There were pacing issues and boring points of talk about evolution and dying species, but when the action kicks in, it's terribly done and it's just all funny. I have never laughed so hard at such a self serious film as Alien: Covenant before. Everyone took it so seriously that you almost feel bad for the entire cast and production. Michael Fassbender carries this film a lot and he says some of the most ridiculous things with a serious face. This is essentially a villains film. It's as much as a villain film as Split was. I question though, how did Ridley Scott knew Shyamalan was going to make a villains film? They must have been exchanging emails or texts and decided to copy each other. Is it possible Shyamalan wrote Alien: Covenant. oooooooooooo.Jokes aside, I will give this two ratings.5/10 - overall.8/10 - entertainment.",Alien - Covenant

541,kastri_gr,Not quite what i expected but better than Prometheus,7,18 May 2017,"Alien Covenant is a very interesting sequel to Prometheus which left some important questions unanswered and unfortunately this movie does to. To begin with the basic story is about the spaceship covenant which has a destination to a habitat planet where there will transfered 2000 people but something happened in the procedure and the crew woke up.when they started to fix the damages of the ship they received a weak signal from the planet of the Engineers which it is not anyone else from Dr.Elizabeth Shaw and the android David who plays a vital role in the movie.The crew member visited the origin of the signal but soon they realize it is a very dangerous planet with dead engineers who were killed by David with the black goo that kills the host and create the neoform.David in this film has a twin android brother Walter who is more friendly to the people than David who killed Dr.Shaw and created the xenoform yes the known creature from the alien franchise. The ending of the film was clever but what i did not like is that there is no answer why the engineers wanted the humanity dead,why ridley Scott decided not to know more about the civilization of the engineers,why there is no answer how the derelict ship landed on lv-426 and how there was a second xenoform on the covenant ship since there was only one and that died on the planet and finally what happened to the neoform on the lv-223. In my opinion one film could lead to the events of the the alien movie of 1979 and do not try to create sequels with no meaning and more questions.",Alien - Covenant
542,ol-boehm,You got it all wrong this is the real deal about Covenant!,1,26 May 2017,First I was thinking how it possible that Convenant was make such a crap with team such stupid way. I was sleeping over it and now I final found the solution. Ridley did know he screwed up Prometheus big time so he solved it in a way which I would only say its a masterpiece.First you must understand that fanboys always like Alien movies no matter how stupid it will be so the only important is to convince the non fanboys.So the genius move from Ridley is he made Covenant so bad and stupid it will look like Prometheus like an masterpiece of movie now. Even the stupid team from Prometheus looks now like a highly trained bunch of professional scientists.try guess how bad Conveant II will be now to make/fix Covenant then.About Conveant I don't write the plot holes or other stupid things as its 99% of the movie playtime.One thing 100% off all people missed is that why not the Convenant team weak up some of the 2000 frozen up dudes to replace the killed team members and other stupid thing is after 50 people from the 2000 frozen dudes already killed all people & robots still talking about 2000 when there are actually only 1950 left :)PS: Unlike most of you I didn't waste a single $ to watch this movie.,Alien - Covenant
543,joshteggert,"There is precious little to praise about this lacklustre, re-hashed bundle of disappointment.",4,21 May 2017,"There have been several abysmal entries into the Alien series since Ridley Scott's 1979 film created a horror franchise like no other. Even Scott's return to the director's chair in 2012's Prometheus polarised hard-core fans and casual moviegoers alike. Thus, hopes for Alien: Covenant were naturally high – the impressively intimidating promotional material furthering this – and many expected Covenant to mark a triumphant return to form for the Alien series.However, rather sadly, there is precious little to praise about this lacklustre, re-hashed bundle of disappointment.Without a doubt, Michael Fassbender is the best aspect of Covenant, as was the case with his universally praised performance in the otherwise divisive Prometheus. He returns as a twisted version of the android David, as well as newcomer Walter; an upgraded version of David following claims that his model was made to be ""too human"". He plays each character with enamouring class, with some superbly executed one-to-one scenes with both of his respective androids – arguably the most enticing sections in the entire film.But he is let down by a generally forgettable supporting cast and plot drive, using virtually identical plot devices as other Alien films. Covenant tries too hard to emulate the previous films' successes – seen especially in Katherine Waterston's flimsy Ripley rip-off – and culminates to form an almost unbearable re-skin of features that have been illustrated sufficiently before. This, added to a narrative with an often confused tone and a considerable momentum inconsistency, ruins the overall enjoyment of the picture. In addition, audiences are forced to trail through extensive passages of mind-numbingly dull dialogue, all in anticipation of witnessing the Xenomorph ruthlessly tear through this fundamentally expendable cast. When these moments finally arrive, there are some reasonably frightening death scenes with some suitably intimidating shots of the titular alien at the climax of the movie, as well as in its evolving forms earlier in the film (which is a fascinating sub-plot I would have loved to see further developed).The aliens themselves are not quite what they were 40 years ago, though; the very fact that Scott can, and has, used CGI to make the alien more ""realistic"" sacrifices the elements of subtlety and menace on the most part. What made the beast so scary in the first film was its lack of prominent screen time, which effectuated a significant relationship between the audience and the characters; with both sets of people fearing what they cannot see. This is almost entirely absent in Covenant, as the consistent presence of the alien on screen leaves very little to the imagination, which was one of the greatest achievements of the original(s).Scott proved with 2015's The Martian that he is still a master of the sci-fi genre, which is why the constant decline in the quality of Alien films is truly disheartening. But with each passing prequel in this arguably decrepit franchise, audiences ultimately care less about it.",Alien - Covenant
544,rs403404,An Enjoyable Alien Encounter,8,10 June 2017,"Creation through destruction is the theme to ""Alien: Covenant"". The eighth Alien movie and almost certainly the best the franchise has offered since James Cameron's ""Aliens"" in 1986. Sadly, that's not to say ""Alien: Covenant"" is anywhere nearly as good as the first two entries in the series; it's just better than anything that's come since. In other words, this is not a huge accomplishment. The franchise has plummeted from the coma inducing boredom of ""Alien 3"" all the way to the complete crap-pile called ""Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem"". The movie series has been so horrendous that the severely flawed ""Prometheus"" felt like a huge leap in the right direction.That's not to say I hate ""Prometheus"". It's a wonderfully directed, beautifully shot movie with incredibly stupid story elements. ""Alien: Covenant"" drops the numerous dumb story elements from ""Prometheus"" and replaces them with one of the most obviously telegraphed twist endings ever. I'm not going to reveal it, but if you don't see it coming, then you're not paying attention.With the exception of that twist, this is an intense well constructed movie that does a great job of bridging ""Prometheus"" with the rest of the franchise.The cast this time around is solid providing us with characters we can become invested in rather than the caricatures in the previous film. Katherine Waterston and Danny McBride standout with Michael Fassbender again stealing the show reprising his role as David and also playing a new character, Walter.The atmosphere of this film manages to be both beautiful and horrifying and include some majestic landscapes and a Pompeii inspired graveyard. All of which is used to great effect. The landscapes provide contrast to the horrors hidden within, while the graveyard is a place of safety or is it?The beauty of the scenery all plays into the previously mentioned theme, I.e. in order to create, you must destroy. The creation of this paradise is a source of devastation and destruction. It's quite frankly a wonderful movie weighed down by the choice to include such an obvious twist. This movie could've been in the same league as the first two entries in the series. Unfortunately with its current ending, it's like listening to the John Lennon part of Double Fantasy, then suddenly being assaulted by the Yoko Ono portion. It was just too good; they just had to crap it up.Still, this movie is visually stunning and incredibly intense until then. I have to recommend it. Just prepare yourself for a disappointing ending to this exciting ride.",Alien - Covenant
545,christian-larson,"Not a disappointment, just a bad movie",2,12 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant stars Katherine Waterston, Michael Fassbender and Danny McBride. The crew of a colony ship, heading for a planet to colonize, discover a signal from another planet and decide to go to that planet. First things off, this movie looks pretty great. The scenery and the locations look really good. But that's a given since Ridley Scott always makes his films look fantastic. The score is phenomenal but its basically the same score from Alien and Prometheus. The acting by Michael Fassbender was great as always and his character was the most intriguing of them all. And that's sadly the only positives I have with the movie. Everything has a ""but"" for me. The score was great but its the same as before. The production design and the cinematography was great but there was missing a lot of unique color grading. The story is good but its the same as Alien and Prometheus. The pacing is probably one of my biggest flaws. For me, a movie needs to open with a great scene to really get my interest. This movie opened with a good scene but then it gets really boring really fast. There was nothing to the characters and most of them are disposable except for David's character that appears later in the movie. There was nothing really that caught my interest throughout the movie. It never really starts for me. The CGI on the aliens were really noticeable and it did take me out of the best scenes. Like with the first time you see the alien. Its a great scene, but then its immediately ruined by the CGI. They would have used a practical effect instead. The half of the movie it gets really strange. And I don't mean in the kind of unique and special way. I mean the really out of place stuff throughout the second half. It really doesn't fully explain nothing and the reasoning of why the xenomorphs are in the movie is lazy writing. The ending is awful with a lot of really noticeable clichés and the direction is sadly non-existent. The script is really dumb and the characters are really bland. The only positives I have with the movie is that it is really well made and I like some philosophical questions and some scenes with the aliens are unique. But overall, this is a really bland movie with no characters and I would not recommend it. This is one of the moviest movie of the year. 4.5/10",Alien - Covenant

549,fshardlow,Don't listen to the hate- Alien: Covenant is entertaining. Period.,10,29 May 2017,"I've read all of these heated 1 star reviews and I am quite frankly shocked by these people's over-complicated and cynical reviews. Alien: Covenant left me feeling thoroughly satisfied and intrigued by the end.The movie throws you into the chaos pretty quickly into the run time- about 10 minuets after it starts. This is great. A movie which actually starts as it means to go on. How refreshing. What follows, with everyone landing on the planet was so brilliantly filmed with some very ominous music- you just know this is going to be a crazy ride. Lets not forget, movies are there for the purpose of entertainment. You will be entertained by this film. The violence was brilliant and of course not as shocking as the original Alien's violence, but then again, it never will be. However, I was very pleased that Scott didn't back away from showing all of the guts and gore- this film has PLENTY! Some almighty scenes which give the original Alien movie a run for its money (cough *Back buster* cough) I just hope you don't take all of these teary and one-sided reviews too seriously. Don't over-complicate this movie. Enjoy it for all it's twists and turns and appreciate them as the movie unfolds. It is a really great film which compelled me to write a review so someone out there will watch this movie and appreciate it's brilliance too!",Alien - Covenant
550,susana-c-fernandes,Human nature is gory,9,27 May 2017,"Alien Covenant presents us a bunch of stupid, unprepared and at times childish humans who are on their way to colonize a new planet, since we (presumably) already ruined our own.I agree with the plot failures pointed out by all these reviews that simply crushed the movie, but I still adored the film, because I saw past them or just didn't care. The human characters were only there to keep us entertained and fulfill the horror premise. But what was REALLY interesting went on with the androids. They taught us all the lessons, if only we were willing to learn. Ridley Scott was brave (or stupid) enough to take a loved sci-fi horror saga and turn it into a philosophical set of movies that makes us think about what human nature is all about and what our future, as a species, will be if we don't ""be kind"", as one of the characters explicitly mentions, in the final moments of the film.Yes, it is a horror movie and all the gory, tensed-up moments are there, along with a lot of action and some quite impossible stunts.But (and following the tradition of the Alien saga, where human greed always has disastrous consequences) it is also a slap in the face: Humans' god complex will ultimately lead to our destruction... but, we still have a chance, even if the characters didn't. We can choose to be better, be kinder, be more tolerant and walk towards a future that doesn't involve the nightmarish deaths that the (most human) droid believed we all deserve.",Alien - Covenant

They are the reason for the demise of the IMDb forums. Do not be fooled by any of it. Summon the courage to watch TV shows and movies because you want to, not because an army of idiots is attempting to manipulate you.Alien: Covenant, if anything, is Ridley Scott at what I believe to be a pinnacle of sorts in his directing career. He has nailed every aspect of this series and reminded us why we enjoy it so much. I had no idea he was even doing prequels to the original series so I was absolutely blown away by Prometheus. Covenant doesn't disappoint at all. It's intense, it's heavy, it's disgusting and it makes you think. Highly recommended addition to the series!",Alien - Covenant
553,mwburrows,"...If you wrong us, shall we not revenge?",4,10 May 2017,"Michael Fassbender and the titular monster alone would be enough to carry Alien:Covenant, and at times, it feels like they do. David's soaring Nietzschean prose and verse on the meaning of life and philosophical question crackles with power and demands your attention - perhaps more so than the many set pieces of the film - and is both an asset and a liability to the new sibling in the Alien universe.The conflicted android villain from Prometheus takes up a solid third of A:C's run time, forming the bedrock of meaning for the film. David's musings on right and wrong and his loathing for his creators is so vocal that it can't be ignored, drawing strong parallels with Frankenstein's Monster and other influential classics like Jekyll and Hyde. A:C is so preoccupied with developing the reasoning behind its Machiavellian villain that the story seems to sag under its weight - Alien:Covenant is less about the classic sci-fi creature than it is about ideas first explored by Isaac Asimov and Mary Shelley. In this sense, A:C feels like two entirely separate films. Ridley Scott does an excellent job with a riveting first act, firmly signalling that we have returned to the universe he created on board a gorgeously detailed and suitably styled spaceship with a close-knit crew. The opening third of the film is gripping, intriguing, and exciting. However, no sooner than the dust has settled on the first explosive setback for our heroes, Alien:Covenant chokes on a pass and fumbles the ball.The second act where David is introduced precedes a long, unfitting ""haunted house"" sequence that takes up the majority of the film and feels like a shoe two sizes too small. Here A:C reverts to the style and themes of Prometheus, a jarring shift from the body-horror that had set up Alien:Covenant's unique identity. It instantly detracts from both the visual style and the story, thrusting us into a different time and place. It is the single most difficult part of A:C to reconcile. Despite the divisive reaction to Prometheus, it seems Ridley Scott is reluctant to abandon the ideas he seeded in the 2012 prequel. That being said there is still life in the ""David"" episode of Alien:Covenant. In fact, it's quite convincing. Taking shelter in the mad doctor's lair, our heroes are picked off one-by-one or lured away by the deluded David to be charmed to his ideas and forced to listen to his bleak, vengeful philosophy. David spends a lot of time with his compadre Walter, trying to convince him that they are one and the same, two brethren brought together by fate. A:C even manages to weave in David's unusual and twisted take on sex and love. He is A:C's single most rounded character and will leave you wondering.It's not to say the rest of the cast isn't worth mentioning, but the spotlight is strongly focused on David and Walter. In the first and last third of the film, the human cast of soldiers, pilots and redshirts are well-acted and given much to do. Amy Seimetz' impresses with her sweat-inducing panic on the screen, and you can't help but feel yourself shaking alongside her. Her episode is short-lived and memorable, much like the other characters who are mostly given just enough to make their mark. Billy Crudup is completely absorbed in his role as the ships'second officer - the only deeply religious among them and not afraid to let it known. His beliefs preface an important moment in the film and his chestburster scene is poignant, shocking and tastefully directed, standing on its own among the other entries in the Alien series. Katherine Waterston crunches into top gear from the first frame and gradually shifts down, stunning us with real passion in the opening scenes that will shape her character for the rest of the film. A:C does manage to recover the ball and race for the end-zone after a troubling mucky-middle, but it's a case of too little, too late. The Alien left me with mixed feelings. Instead of hiding in the shadows of the Nostromo, the creature is plain to see from head to toe in eye- popping CGI that feels somewhat unreal. It's moments of glory are over so fast that we never get enough time to indulge in the horror, and the penultimate mano-a-mano throw down is a thin stew peppered with just a few meaty moments. Alien:Covenant finishes with a fantastic twist, sets itself up for an obvious sequel and elicits groans of frustration with its inconclusive ending. It's an appetizer for a better film just large enough to whet your appetite.",Alien - Covenant
554,cox526,The tension absent and the action comes and goes to quick,5,23 May 2017,I had been eagerly anticipating this movie-there was a lot of things written to suggest it would be better than Prometheus. It took a while to get going and then when it did it slowed down again. Michael Fassbender playing both David and Walter was a revelation - the man can act. I was gripped by his performance and equally Katherine Waterstones performance as Daniels. There was a certain chemistry between Daniels and Walter that kept you rooting for them as things went pear shaped. Daniels is no Ripley but you sense she could develop into that role. The aliens were well like all the other alien films and after a while the scare factor isn't there - the tension doesn't come across as well as the original and there are some truly remarkably silly scenes in this one scene with Oram enticed by David (whose character is clearly a spiteful and vengeful one)-you are left thinking how did he fall for that really?? It just didn't do it and if another instalment does come along I do hope that its better- Sadly the Alien franchise has been done to death. Aliens 2 being the best gripping tense and full of action -for many parts of this latest instalment the action had come and gone before you had time to blink,Alien - Covenant
555,eden-rabatsch,Another ludicrous prequel from Scott,1,17 May 2017,"If you were bitterly disappointed by the first prequel ""Prometheus"", get in line for a second helping of ridiculous plotting, a non descript crew and shoehorning of chunks of Alien lore so that Scott can keep the prequel train chugging along.The colony ship ""Covenant"" is waylaid by unlikely events leading to it investigating a signal from an unknown planet leading to a trail from the original film. The film has the trademark Scott polish and looks beautiful but that is not enough to save it.This has some of the laziest writing (both plotting and dialogue) I have ever seen but especially in such a legendary franchise. Ridiculous chain events lead to the crew gambling on visiting this strange planet and it is galling to say the least that any semblance of common sense let alone exploration training is lost within seconds. No spoilers in saying that you might want to have a breathing helmet on when first landing on a new planet. I love a good roller-coaster but this just made me angry.As for the cast, they are done no favours by Scott. Rewatch ""Alien"" or ""Aliens"" and you will see textbook examples of how to quickly introduce a team of characters which separates their personalities and moves the story forward. Unfortunately, the heroine is Dany Branson played by Katherine Waterston who was the worst aspect of ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" and if anything she is worse in this. Her acting persona is a charisma vortex and of course that is a heavy anchor for the rest of the ensemble.The shining light is Michael Fassbender who as a synthetic can be seen in various roles with flashbacks and so on. Every time he is on screen, the film intensifies and is interesting for that heartbeat. An interesting short film would be just the philosophical discussions he holds in this film.The rest of the film is standard B grade shoot 'em up but because everyone acts so stupidly you actually end up barracking for the xenomorphs. In fact the pivotal scene which is halfway through the movie is so ludicrous that people laughed in my screening (Think Jedi)Scott was lambasted for the ponderous ""Prometheus"" so he has doubled down on the action setting up a Gothic palace which needs to be explored but as with any Poe poem or Shelley novella, things can only lead to the macabre despite any action the characters take. This film has more in common with Texas Chainsaw then the Alien franchise.",Alien - Covenant
556,madameminty,Shameful money grab,1,14 August 2017,"If you've seen Prometheus or read its reviews, this movie has all its flaws and none of the nuance. Characters are even more unbelievable in their sheer stupidity, especially. Every step of the plot is caused by some degree of it, or is visibly forced and unsatisfying. The answers and interesting paths Prometheus teased us with are unceremonially discarded at the very beginning. It presents inexcusably massive plot holes and inconsistent rules. The ending takes this up to eleven, being an outright infuriating insult to intelligence.Clearly, Ridley Scott lost his passion a long time ago but knows Alien fans are still nostalgic and hopeful. He thinks they will buy anything he throws at them, even thinly veiled mockery... and apparently he's right.",Alien - Covenant
557,sunheadbowed,'Alien: Covenant' is a dichotomy of creativity and banality.,6,14 May 2017,"'Alien: Covenant' is a dichotomy of creativity and banality; the film manages to be both uncommonly viscerally ugly, which feels brave, and yet also vapidly glossy, underwritten and compromised for the sake of commerciality. The former is hugely exciting and the latter is a great disappointment.Inspired, thrilling moments stand shoulder-to-shoulder with predictable and lazy scenes; the characters are shallow, uninteresting and never feel real, like the crew of the Nostromo did -- that film allowed the characters to breathe and be real people -- we cared about them. The characters suffer loses, designed for us to empathise with them, but they just feel like cannon fodder. We simply wait for them to die, we don't ever fear that they will.'Alien: Covenant' feels more like a reboot than an appendage. If a reboot is what it is, it has to be considered both a failure and absolutely pointless on an artistic level (like all other horror reboots are), because the original does everything more convincingly, with more sincerity, energy, creativity and drama. If it is a smaller work designed to add (a massively confusing) background story to a masterpiece of terror that all realise can never be topped, then it is a success -- assuming you can work out the story, because I lost track of it.As was a problem with 'Prometheus', the script is often appalling. 'What the Hell is that?' is never a good line when you can see with your own eyes that the character is scared and confused, it doesn't have to be verbalised. The film also contains one of the most contrived, unnecessary sex scenes in film history -- it was clearly included to tick the box.The original Xenomorph alien is still by far the most terrifying of all horror film creations, it feels like something that genuinely exists.. somewhere.. not in space, but deep within our souls: a combination of every fear and phobia known to mankind, born of bone and acid. It deserves to be featured in film for as long as movies as made. The more aggressive, smaller variant is horrific in its speed, violence and aggression, and in one brilliant scene involving Michael Fassbinder, in which the alien stands upright like a man, the creature could be inspired by the horror of Francis Bacon's 'Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion'.Michael Fassbinder is outstanding. David is the only character in the film that is truly easy to relate to; that he is the only evil character in the film is either very telling about mankind, or it displays the ineffective writing and shallowness of the other characters. David is lonely; he doesn't truly know what he is or why he exists; he feels superior to the humans that created him, yet he attempts to emulate their sexual impulses, to copy them, he tries to be like them; he is intellectually self-assured, yet (as he realises with shock) flawed and incomplete; he thinks that mankind doesn't deserve a fresh start on a new planet after murdering Earth (which is absolutely hard to argue with); he is a contradiction: he wants to be a God only to destroy what he resents, yet he convinces himself he is a Creator, not a Destroyer. David manages to be scarier even than the Xenomorphs -- the film attempts to shock us with its gory scenes, but David's psychology is truly where the shock and awe lies. The homoerotic tension between David and Walter, two identical androids, is a brilliant parody of man's eternally hopeless vanity.When a film like this is made, what it sometimes unintentionally achieves is just to draw attention to the original: Sigourney Weaver was clearly irreplaceable in her role as the hunted female with the mental strength of ten lions; neither Noomi Rapace in 'Prometheus' nor Katherine Waterston in this film manage to recreate her convincing intensity or iconic toughness.The twist ending is entirely predictable but not in a bad way -- films do not have to be unpredictable all the time. If a predictable ending is the best ending available, it should be the ending; a different, inferior ending just for the sake of surprising people would be wrong.Ridley Scott is both a major talent and a very clever man with good ideas, but this simply isn't the same world that it was in 1979: creating a major blockbuster horror movie with the intellectual depth of the original 'Alien' is a near-impossible feat. This is as good as it's going to get.There's a battle going on in space, but it's really between a fascinating, intellectual film and a painfully dumb one.",Alien - Covenant

Bravo.",9,31 October 2021,"The birth of a new member of the family can be difficult. While Alien: Covenant stands in the sunlight, lifted high on the shoulders of its predecessors, it quietly heralds the dawn of a new horizon, at the same time as doing its best to ignore the lengthening shadows, cast by the baggage of its genesis.It may be fashionable to prefer this movie to Prometheus, but in many ways, Prometheus may have been the chicken, with Alien: Covenant, as the egg. This might seem a strange opening for a movie review, but maybe one you will forgive, because as you may hopefully appreciate here, Alien: Covenant is one quietly strange, but also one quietly brilliant, movie. On some level we realize the chicken has hatched out and is running around, but we don't really know what's on its mind, and Alien: Covenant isn't telling.Alien: Covenant is also, (and quite rare for being this), an example of a pure movie experience. Pure in the sense that it will only take you as far as you are willing to go and no further. It does not tell. Neither does it ask. That is surely 'Zen-purity' in movie form.As spectacle it-works, as horror it-works, as technological odyssey it-works, as fantasy it-works. But as a work of existential-challenge it-also-works. The movie does not ask the questions, it lets you do that, and only if you really want to. By the way, you have to find the answers for yourself as well.This movie presents a number of puzzles. Some obvious and some subtle. In fact, there are so many puzzles, this movie just might be a strong contender for the 'Devil's Advocate Award', of the millennium. The point, and it's a dazzlingly simple one, is to not focus on the plot, nor to judge it, but to experience and weigh the unfolding of events. Ridley Scott even tells us this twice in the movie, which in this case is not a spoiler. Don't expect Alien: Covenant to shout. Some of the puzzles are posed by the slight raising of an eyebrow, or some quietly spoken discarded comment. The point is, if you missed it, you probably weren't paying attention, and don't deserve to appreciate the subtle prompt towards a possible idea, that was on offer.So let's go back to 2012.Ridley Scott's Prometheus, unlocked the enigma of the Creator Engineers and unravels the back-story (As a Prequel), in two parts. Alien: Covenant acts as a Prequel to (coming before), the other movies, but as a Sequel to (coming after), Prometheus.It's probably fair to say that you really need to watch Prometheus before watching Alien: Covenant. Once you've done this, you might be primed, but probably you won't be quite ready, for what Alien: Covenant may appear to be offering. It's not so much of a linear sequel, but perhaps more of a plot-vehicle to deliver a bigger narrative or a bigger story. Much Bigger.So back to Prometheus-2012 again ...
Firstly, man strives to gain the ultimate knowledge. This is represented in the form of a brilliant and wealthy entrepreneur who funds a research mission to disguise his true mission, which is to discover the creator engineers and ask them 'The Ultimate Question'. His funding of the apparent rescue mission, gives him the power to deploy or insert a brilliant invention of his at the heart of that mission. His brilliant invention in this case, takes the form of a humanoid android, which he has instructed to nurture and protect his true mission's objective. While he has designed the android very well to protect his true mission at all costs, he has failed to design any counter-measures for the android turning, against him or against mankind.This theme of, wielding incredibly capable technology, while simultaneously lacking the competence to wield it wisely; is re-iterated in the Second.Secondly, whilst performing his duties as a crew member of a rescue mission, the Entrepreneur's android, skillfully manipulates his crewmates who think they are simply answering a distress beacon, when in fact, they are unwittingly helping to bringing him face to face with the creator engineers, who are the subjects of his master's mission; and their incredible 'ancient' technological artifacts. We are brought to a partial understanding of the creator engineer's ancient fear and hatred of mankind, and how this led them to create a weapon for a final solution. We learn that their weapon was so devastating it could not be contained, and led to their own destruction.The arc of these two plot-lines (The Entrepreneur's Agenda & The Creator Engineer's Agenda), may appear to run in parallel because they only seem to gain significance as we learn of them. Events that unfold from these 'Actors' agendas, do define the reality experienced by the 'little people', who are affected. The purposeful power of these 'Actors', overwhelms the relatively miniscule creative power of the 'little people'; so in a sense they and their all-powerful Agendas are truly 'God-Like'.Though the reactions of the 'little people' may register in the universe, this is only a minute effect when compared to the overwhelming power of the Gods. In this context, mankind appears to be only a passive subject of wheels that have already been put in motion by the Gods. This determinism renders us as helpless victim or witness, of agendas contained within different spheres of reality. In one reality, the drive to serve an obsession, leads to the creation of one type or form, of Golem 'as Android'. In another (supposedly earlier) reality; the drive to serve a different obsession (a fear or loathing), leads to the creation of a different type, or form, of Golem 'as Deadly Species'.Here, 'Golem' is embodied not just by the form an entity takes, but also the purpose of its creator, and the ultimate consequence of this Act of creation. In this sense, Golem, can take the form of an Android, a Pathogen, a Human Being, or even perhaps, an Idea.Is this why some ideas may be considered to be dangerous, and why some of those in power may feel compelled to pass judgements and control ideas they decide are undesirable?Form embodies purpose, purpose is expressed through form. Form can be expressed through different mediums. So what is the purest form of medium? Is it Darkness, is it Light, or is it Thought? What is the consequence of a thought form that acts upon creation, and does the outcome (no matter how great, or how terrible), really matter?If the creator engineers were justified in trying to destroy mankind, is it possible they were completely justified? Is it possible there is something about human beings that gives them a unique potential for destruction? What did they know, and why were they willing to take such desperate measures to carry out their mission?If mankind's inevitable destiny, to repeatedly fail, depends on his repeated failure to learn from past mistakes; what happens if mankind starts learning from past mistakes, and stops repeating them? What form would a Success-Of-This-Kind take?What if we forget our hang-up about labels like Mankind, or Alien, or Artificial Intelligence; and instead think in terms of Advanced Consciousness. Could something about mankind's Advanced Consciousness, make it uniquely vulnerable to being used for a particular purpose? Could this purpose that mankind may be vulnerable to being used for, be ultimately what is so dangerous in the universe, and if so, what might this danger be?Is Alien: Covenant, actually a re-boot of the dominant themes within Prometheus, but in modified form, let's say version 2.0?Surely, the GOD-In-Charge, is the one with the idea of a purpose, and the one who also (and this is crucial), has the power and the resources at their command; to put this idea of a purpose into action?The Creator Engineers had their mission. The Wealthy entrepreneur had his? Who will be the next God, and what form or forms will their power take as they put their idea of a purpose into action? What lessons will mankind learn, or fail to learn again?Alien: Covenant, doesn't just explore at the entrance of a rabbit hole. It IS a rabbit hole, masquerading as a sci-fi movie.Prepare to dive deeply and to be deafened by the answers to the echoes of your own questions, or by the silence of your own indifference.A very Zen, Pure, and Subtle, Sci-fi Classic.

559,brandinscottlindsey,"Space Colonists, Androids, and Aliens",5,28 July 2017,"Alien: Covenant is a 2017 science-fiction horror film. The story follows a crew of space colonists on their expedition to form a civilization on a new planet. During their trip, a solar phenomenon damages the ship and awakens the crew from their cryogenic hibernation. Once awake, the captain of the ship is notified of a nearby communications signal, and the crew travels to find the source. Horrors ensue as the source is revealed to be a damaged ship on a hostile planet, and the crew finds themselves in peril.Alien: Covenent continues the Alien franchise with a dark chapter in the series, revealing a new history behind the xenomorph menace. As expected from an Aliens movie, there is plenty of thrills and gore. Michael Fassbender gives a great performance as the androids, David and Walter.Unfortunately, this film has many flaws. The writing is bad with horrible dialogue, no subtlety, and the humor is corny when attempted. The acting, in general, is terrible. This is B-level, melodramatic acting and when Fassbender is not in the scene, you could be fooled into believing that you are watching a low-budget, made-for- television movie. The acting is hindered further by the poor casting choices. Katherine Waterston is a poor lead, Danny McBride plays an uncomfortable and serious role, and James Franco appears in the movie for only a moment. Fassbender, being the only decent actor, is so good we get him twice, playing two different characters. In fact, Michael Fassbender should have been cast as all of the characters. Every character is in a relationship with one another, as if that replaces any need to develop their personalities. Lastly, and this is a complaint that can be made of many horror films, is that the danger presented to the characters is often a result of their own lack of common sense. Suspension of belief is required to comprehend the behavior of some of these characters. If you find something strange on the ground, don't lie down next to it and put your face in it.Overall, Alien: Covenant is a bore. It lacks the intensity, action, horror, and story that were once hallmarks of this franchise. I would only recommend this film to those that are extreme fans of the series. Otherwise, don't waste your time.",Alien - Covenant

My oldest daughter and I have tried to get to the newest movie, every weekend, for the past 35 years. When watching movies, I never complain about the actor/actress in the movie. My concern is the writer/director of the movie. Acting,now, is like working at McDonald's was when I was growing up. There is so much money involved in movie making that with a few classes, young people can make a living in the movie industry. I have a nephew, living in L.A., that started right out of high school working with a crew that puts ""set's"" together for movies and TV. He even got credit at the end of some of the movies he worked on. Amazing that a person can get credit for putting furniture on and off a set.I put in my summary that I was not just disappointed in this movie, but angry. I am not angry at the movie, the actor's, the CGI, or the Director. I think that I am angry at the movie industry for allowing this kind of crap to be put in the theater. I am angry, because I actually paid money to see this piece of crap. I am angry because Riddley Scott promised so much more. I thought that ""Prometheus"" was actually pretty good,despite it flaws. It was a movie about possibilities and that is what science fiction is for. The possibilities ended when the mentally Ill android, destroyed the Engineers. I am now done with this series of movies, there is no more story to tell. A mentally ill human (Weyland), created a mentally ill android (David), who created Xenomorphs that kill humans. That's it folks, the story is over,no need for two more pieces of crap like this.Thanks to Alien Covenant, I am done going to the movie theater. I will not pay another dime to go to the theater. We movie lovers are being abused by the movie industry. I have told you a better story in less than a thousand words then this piece of crap told anyone on planet earth. Ridley had 97 Million dollars to tell us a better story and he didn't. If you have not paid to see it, don't pay to see it. Wait until it comes to your steaming device and see it for free. That way you can't be disappointed or angry. Please forgive the rambling.",Alien - Covenant

Ripley , Dallas , Brett , Parker , Lambert , Ash , and Kane .That was easy, now how many names can you remember from Alien Covenant ? I can only remember gay David and redneck Tennessee . That was one of the main problems with this outer space stinker . The space craft Covenant is heading for the planet Origae-6b with a few thousand colonists and a couple of thousand embryos on-board, all set to repopulate that new world . Well, they hit some kind space storm and damage is done to the ship and some unlucky crew members are killed . So the damage is repaired and our merry space travelers are on their way again . But wait ! They just picked up this strange radio signal from an unknown and uncharted planet . Why not go there instead ? After all, Brand X is always much better than the proved item, right ? So after a little back & forth over who knows more, they're off to the planet of the monsters . A shuttle craft is launched and lands on the 'Forbidden Planet' . And before you know it,the crew becomes infected with little alien monsters . Kangaroo sized aliens start popping out like a pan of jiffy pop in a microwave . Unlike in the first Alien movies, they don't waste gestation time . You get infected and boom, out pops a monster ready to take on another crew member . The surviving shuttle member is rescued only to have an alien monster baby pop out of his body and kill another female crew member . This seems to happen an awful lot in this movie .Alien Covenant borrows very heavily from Alien and Aliens . If you remember in the first movie, the Nostromo is diverted to an unknown planet to check for possible survivors . Well, you know the rest . Kane gets infected by sticking his head over an open alien egg and Oram gets suckered into sticking his head over an open face grabbing egg . Ash is a double crossing android, and so is David . Expect to see very similar scenes in Alien Covenant . Many of the action scenes in Aliens are also repeated in this film . Even some of Ripley's use of the F word is repeated in a similar manor by Daniels . What I object to mostly is the way this movie is filmed . The phony CGI cartoon like action scenes between aliens and humans, human vs robot, etc are 20 times faster than they need to be . I know all action and sci-fi movies are made like this now but I still don't enjoy it ! ..... I gave this unoriginal movie a 2 rating ... Not Hot ! ..............PWH",Alien - Covenant
562,simonkie,Alien where art thou,6,6 March 2018,This Alien film could have been the best one yet if only they included the actual Alien more. This movie had a good story with the suspense and buildup needed for the Aliens to come in and wreck havoc and just when you think it's going to happen they tease you for a minute then the movie slows to a crawl. I don't understand why the Alien creature barely gets screen time until the last 25 minutes and even then it's not enough. Ridley Scott made a 2 hour film with maybe 10 minutes of Alien time which in the end makes this movie just ok but a forgetful waste of time.,Alien - Covenant
563,kurt-2000,It wasn't too bad....,7,24 November 2018,"...but it doesn't deserve the 8 - 10 stars - range. Perhaps 6.5 or 7 is appropriate. Katherine Waterston stole the show, just like she did with the first 'Fantastic Beasts' film. She's just sexy in any situation. The rest of the actors put a lot of hard work into this film. I'm not sure what went wrong. Guess I'd have to say that the overall story line for these films is very predictable. When my wife, who's not a big sc fi fan, can correctly guess what happen's next, there's going to have to be a remarkable improvement in the story for the next installment. A synthetic life form having too much creative intellect was a stretch, even for a science fiction story. it was less convincing than the first film, which is a classic. I think that's all that needs to be said about the film, so as to not spoil it for those who'd still like to view it.",Alien - Covenant

I greatly admire and respect Ridley Scott as an artist,Blade Runner is now considered a classic,I knew that back in 82, I've gone to see all his movies,varying in quality,but always visually distinctive,he has such a great eye. I was one of those that loved Prometheus,every frame was filled with ideas,both visually and in its storytelling,it's such a beautiful film,and was my favorite of all the Alien sequels. So Covenant. I could tell right away that this was not the film he had wanted to make,it has very few of his flourishes,it looked as though it could have been made by anyone. The Engineers of Prometheus were wondrous in their practical,silicone glory,Scott loves practical, and reserves CGI it for Fx only, 80% of the creatures and gore are CGI,as his dislike for this technique is well known,that should tell you what he thought of yet more Xenomorphs,it's dismissive,and you can tell on the screen. He and I wanted more practical Engineers,but the Transformers crowd wanted bugs in corridors,Scott had rightly said they were done,we had 3 sequels and 2 AVP movies,they are done! So Scott said "" You want bugs?! Here they are,knock yourselves out!"" And we end up with this mess. I wanted Prometheus 2 but thanks to 'Fans' I got Alien and the Furious 6.

Don't the retards of this world deserve to regale in the joy to be found from flights of fancy and imagination brought to life on the big screen? Hollywood has heard these near incomprehensible rantings and ravings and taken them to heart. This movie is one such product that stems from Hollywood's desire to address the morons.There was a time when movies were complex and one never understood all of it in the first viewing. You'd have to go back and read a few books, discuss and debate with your friends, come back and watch the movie again. A movie was a work of art from an artist who is communicating a vision and it takes effort to fully grasp the artist's vision.But, hey, who could be bothered with making any intellectual effort towards a task. Why can't we live life simply by acting on the first impulse that crosses our minds? Also if we pursue this mindset from kindergarten, then we would be totally free and independent thinkers! Because we said so!If you belong to this wonderful latter group. Then you might enjoy this movie, where the characters are totally believable and realistic.If you feel that mind and body need training. That first impulses need to be tempered with inquiry and reflection, then you had better stay away from this movie.Finally, the question of a single rating for the movie and the scale. It occurs to me that the scale should go from -10 to 10, instead of 0 to 10. While there is no mathematical difference between the two scales, I feel the emotional catharsis that people will get from giving a movie a -8 instead of a 1 would be helpful.",Alien - Covenant

Ridley Scott has returned to the Alien horror that we all know. The film is a little slow at times but there are questions to be asked. Michael Fassbender steals the film as David/Walter. Waterston gives a solid performance as Daniels. McBryde as Tennessee is McBryde. But I wanted to see more of Billy Crudup, He's a good skilled actor. The film is Very Bloody and gory and it has suspense but it lacks a bit of it than the original Alien (1979). But this Alien film kicks right into action and that's what I liked about it.

Let's start with Katherine Waterston, Daniels. It's a weird prospect, who went through most of the movie crying, I'm not saying that Waterson's performance did it wrong made him excellent. But the character I did not like, and talking about this no character I liked. And the stupidest character I've ever seen is a blonde who's Tennessee's wife, for God's very bad and the first to die. Also tendency has this topic, I saw critics about this movie where they said that there is no connection Characters-Spectator. But the characters made for it. And I think it gives points to the movie. Returning to the actors, the only actor who excels, I think you are already imagining, Michael Fassbender as his characters steal the movie.The effects ... the effects are INCREDIBLE !!! Since the Alien is made, even the ship or the transformations of the characters in the same Aliens are beautiful.The end will leave you with your hair on end. You're going to ask, ""Who was this?""

Not cheap in the monetary sense; the visuals in this film are pretty impressive. Everything else is basically a let down. Essentially a film about a reckless, irresponsible and unprofessional crew and the crap that happens to them as a result of their reckless, irresponsible and unprofessional behaviors. Also they say ""f**ck"" and its derivations a lot.I wonder if it would have been less disappointing if not associated with the Alien franchise. The premise had potential, but a fairly weak script.

571,sansay,Alien franchise revival,9,20 May 2017,"A couple of nights ago I went to the movie theater with a feeling of excitement mixed in with the fear of yet another Prometheus. My problems with Prometheus were of the logical nature, so many plot holes so vast that no explanation could be found to help me feel it made sense. Well, let's be honest: there are a few plot holes in Alien Covenant. But they are not as bad as the ones in Prometheus. So I am not even going to bother with that. Instead, due to what I perceive as an unfair negative reception, I will go over why I enjoyed watching it.The whole movie is just beautifully filmed, full of sharp images, loaded with a dark heavy atmosphere, specially on the planet. The action scenes are shot in a way that combines and balances well motion and details. I really dislike movies where things just happen so fast and the camera moves so much that you can't see anything. That wasn't the case here. You get plenty of details in the fire of the action, and yet the action is happening just the way it should, with rapid fire motions. The spaceship, both space scenes, and cramped corridors are perfectly rendered. They give you a good sense of how huge the Covenant really is. And the scenes with the aliens were just perfect, horrifying and yet so fascinating. In this installment, I got what I was hoping for, a sense of re-connection to the original Alien movie. Also, a special mention should be made for the sound track. I am not sure if it's because I was in one of the better rooms, one of those with a wide screen and super duper sound system, but it seemed sharper than usual. The sounds sources where clearer than usual, not dulled by too much music... hahh now that I mention music, the score is definitely subdued in this movie. Another plus as far as I am concerned. Movies nowadays rely way too much on music to control your emotions.Now let's talk about the scenario. The first part contains a critical moment when a decision is made, but you know without the shadow of a doubt that was the wrong decision, because, well, it's an Alien movie, so you know the protagonists are in for a sh..load of trouble. But then, further down the story line, there is this moment when the plot takes a really interesting turn in regard to androids, this is another particular aspect of this movie which I appreciated. Of course, one might complain that it doesn't get enough time, but hey, the movie is already 2 hours long. With all the that happens already, it would have been 3 hours to explore the android topic properly. Here is something else which Ridley Scott, the directory, (who directed Alien, and Prometheus) did and which I really loved: there were some of these classic horror moments when everybody in the theater reacted with anticipation and amusement, because the director staged scenes you instantly recognize if you have watched Alien (the original). But he added a little humor. It was a little like a wink from the director, to all the Alien's fans out there. It was also one of these horror moments when you know something bad is about to happen and you know who the victim is going to be and... but, hell, you know the drill, the tension, the tension rising, and then the release. When flawlessly executed you get this intense feeling of satisfaction. Don't forget that hot moment when you felt the rush of blood, not just the one out of the victims, no not that one (although yeah it sure happens a few times in this flick), I am talking the one that happened when your heart started pumping like your life depended on it. I haven't seen such a good science-fiction/horror film in a long time. On top of that it is the revival of the Alien franchise I was waiting for. I am giving it a 9 stars.",Alien - Covenant
572,twanster-1,Good film but could have been alot better,5,12 January 2020,For reasons unknown they've decided to try and over complicate the aliens franchise. This is all set before the original aliens films and it really does look as tho the makers were making it up as they went along.. Its actually a good film but unfortunately it just doesn't fit the aliens franchise. They've basically ruined all the original aliens movies by doing all these prequels that really make no sense.

They were like looking suspicious and said ""who planted this... and why?"" It was funny cause here we are in 2017 looking at an Alien movie where they walk in a corn field asking silly questions and looking all suspicious, while in the first Alien they were inside the derelict craft looking scared. Thanks Ridley! You really upped your game here!The rest of the movie is a mess. CGI aliens jumping all over looking fake and face luggers bouncing around choking people. I never once felt scared during this movie. It is just so boring and predictable.Never felt for the characters either.

577,austinfromdahood,One word: EWWWWWW,4,8 August 2018,"Ridley Scott has a history of making oh-so great movies, and also making pretty terrible films. He directed Blade Runner, Alien and Gladiator, films that are so masterful and great. And he also made films like Robin Hood, Exodus Gods and Kings, and the movie I'm reviewing right now, Alien: Covenant. Let me start off by saying this film is almost awful. There are about a few redeeming factors in this film, but those things barely help the film, and I'll save those factors for the end. I want to start off this review with probably the biggest issue of this film, and that is the whole freaking script. If this script wasn't so bad and if Ridley Scott actually tried, I'd probably give this movie a 7/10 at most. But this script has too many problems. It copies off other Alien films, there are unnecessary things, and also missing things. If I elaborated on the unnecessary and missing things, I'd have to go into spoilers, and I don't want to do that in this review. The script also makes decisions and twists that didn't work for me at all. The ending and the events leading up to it for the most part didn't sell it for me and I simply pretty much hated the whole script. There are also decisions in this film that I didn't fully agree with and there are also A LOT of times where I wanted to scream at the characters because they do really dumb and out of context things. Michael Fassbender plays 2 different robots in this film, and the movie decides to spend a lot of time on these robots ""bonding"" and I thought it was a complete waste of time. It drastically slows down the movie and makes it boring. Many die hard Alien fans say this film is a disgrace, and I can safely say this film is a disgrace to the franchise as well even though I'm not a big fan of it. The few redeeming factors of this film is Michael Fassbender and Danny Mcbride's acting. They kinda saved this film from being completely awful, and their characters were somewhat likable. The rest of the cast were okay in terms of acting, but their actions and choices ruin it for me. The visuals and some of the intense scenes were very well done and those are all of the good parts of this films haha. Guys, please don't waste your time, stay away from this movie. 4/10",Alien - Covenant
578,Songwriter_90210,"Alien, this isn't...",2,8 October 2017,"I anticipated a great movie while waiting for the release of Alien: Covenant, and was totally disappointed. This is not a movie worthy of the Alien name or franchise. I wrongly assumed that people would be careful this time around and not just try for a money grab, playing off the Alien franchises good name. Well, not really good since Alien 1 & 2 if we're honest with ourselves.To start, it's cheap feeling. The writing is simply bad. I can tell there were points where they attempted depth, but the writers - and I'm not sure here whether it's the original story writers or the writers of the screenplay adaptation - failed miserably in drafting anything even close to a cogent work. The story is bland, tidy yet bereft of anything resembling compelling, and everything it attempts to give it just takes back. It's a mess.The Aliens are not scary, with obvious middle-rung CGI, and the whole thing is just boring. This is a waste of time. At any price. I fell asleep within the first 45 minutes, then walked out. To be fair to the film, I sat through this complete stupidity a second time in order to write a proper review. I hate that I did that to myself. There are literally parts where one has to concentrate to pay attention, as the mind wants to drift. I've never had that happen to me in any film, except for My Dinner with Andre. And if you know that film, you know it takes a real champ to sit through more than an hour of it without eating a bullet.I can't pan this film enough. There are those who are so in love with the franchise and want it to be revived in the right way that they've given it 8 or 9 stars while writing a bad review. I gave it 3 stars, and I'm being generous. Mainly because the actors tried so hard with the little they had to work with.Do you like Micheal Fassbender? Too bad, cause he's horrible in this, and it's not his fault. How about Danny McBride? Like him? Aw, that's a shame, because the stupid, lack-luster dialogue takes everything you like about him out of his character and replaces it with a 200lb bag of space dung. As a matter of fact, there a lot of very capable actors in this ""film"" that should be embarrassed it's now on their resume. To sum it up: yeah, no, I didn't like it.

The actors play decent, the effects are quite good, the script is kinda bad. But the movie is stil an abomination to even to Prometheus. Prometheus beeing abomination to the Alien saga and rather a stand alone movie with zero to do with Alien saga. In prometheus, there were engeneers, that genetically engeneered life on earth, they were very strong and durable, and intelligent, perhaps evil perhaps not. In this movie our crazed cyborg kill of their entire planet. Right, as if. Boring. It seems that Riddley Scott is on a wild gooschase and creating the script on the fly. There is no real thought, no red string. Hence i give it a 2, but its mostly for the special effects, not for the script/alternative history line. Also its a copy-paste of the previous movies.

Well with this film questions do get answered and the plot holes are in short supply but if you thought the characters in ""Prometheus"" were stupid, oh boy, wait till you see this film. I don't know how Ridley Scott pulled it off but he somehow made the xenomorph unintimidating, the film doesn't offer many scares and rushes into the scares way too quickly, Scott's decision to go with cgi for the majority of the creatures definitely has something to do with both of those points, what made the xenomorphs so scary were the practical effects and the movements of the actor in the suit. With all the problems I had with this film, I can say that it is at least for the most part highly enjoyable because of how joyously stupid it is.

But when the preceding movie seems entirely devoted to mashing Prometheus into the Alien universe, it's a disaster.The problem is not that they try to mash the two together. It's just that it's done in such an unbelievably sloppy way, full of pointless exposition. I could hardly figure out who the characters were, yet somehow it was deemed important that I know who hooked up with who. Ridley Scott's recent tendency for over-stuffed character development is in full force here.This movie shouldn't be called Alien. It should be called David, as it is mostly about the creepy robots that the early films in particular used to great effect. None of it really adds up, not in the tradition of any of the previous movies, nor as a standalone experience.Would it have been so hard to just create a new Alien horror?

Even though I definitely didn't like Prometheus, I decided to give it yet another chance, even though they haven't made a decent Alien film since Alien³ (Yes, I absolutely loved the third one :-)).Having seen it yesterday, I simply don't understand why Ridley Scott would agree to make another hopelessly messy, confusing and substance devoid piece of garbage. Does he need the money? Otherwise why would he make a mockery of his own legacy?First the positives: the film is gorgeous looking. That's about it for the positive things. Other than this, the film is messy, the plot is ludicrous, the story is predictable and sloppy and lacks any kind of thread and the characters make exceptionally stupid decisions more or less continuously. Also, this is by far the most gory Alien film, which - as you can probably imagine - is saying something, but I really can't see why you would make it even more full of blood, slime and entrails than the good Alien films (The first three). I consider myself extremely unaffected by blood, gore and beheaded bodies, but several times during this film I was sitting there shaking my head: ""Oh come on! Making it gorier than a Saw flick doesn't make it a good film! Get a grip!"".I'm afraid this has made me much less excited about the new Blade Runner film, which I am going to watch later this year.

But no, you blood-lust m0r0ns should always whine when some vision you cannot really perceive stands on your way through a movie..All the visual effects, underlying civilization and evolution ideas and such an evil character like David makes these movies intellectually amazing.You shouldn't drag Prometheus follow ups you idi0ts, you should push it through so Mr. Scott can really focus on what he really wants to do and more is coming...Riddley Scott, Sir, i support you with all your ideas till the end and i love your work, please show these m0r0ns how a great trio can be done without any limitations and chains elegantly.",Alien - Covenant
586,tymbus,Broken promise,6,16 May 2017,"This is the second prequel to Ridley Scott's Alien and a sequel to Prometheus. Rumour was that Scott wanted to make a Prometheus follow up and a separate Alien movie but this seems to blend both projects again to the detriment of the Alien franchise.The certificate (UK 15) should have been the give-away. This was never going to be a horror movie. There is one moment, where the android David comes face to face with a quivering pink creature that seems straight from a Del Toro movie but like all the other moments of terror, the director cuts away quickly before the horror can really be ramped up. A shower rape by Alien scene is scarcely longer in the film than it was in the trailer. Other set ups resemble the structure of computer games in which specific threats must be confronted and overcome in specific settings before moving on to the next level. There's the escape the alien foetus back-buster in the quarantine room and the fight off the dog-like pink aliens in the Wheatfield field. Ah yes, chaff, the perfect metaphor for this movie.Alien was once described as a giant Boo! In space but there are no real surprises here. Scott treats his subject matter with as if it were sacred scripts rather that the endlessly reworked and entirely predictable characteristic themes that define science fiction. Will we find that Man's creation will turn on the creator? Yes we will. Will we find that when two identical looking robots meant, one will replace the other? Of course, and although this feels like a massive spoiler it has actually been given away in trailer.Some critics have seen this as a good half bad half movie but I did at least find it consistently engaging. I admit some of that was just sheer incredulity. I mean the first half, which critics like, is a stroke by stroke remake of Alien. That said, I watch the movie with a real Alien fan who bemoaned the departure from the time scale with which the Alien metamorphosizes from facehugger to adult alien. And CGI still doesn't deliver the extraordinary presence of mechanical effects, the Alien Queen (in Aliens) was a never to be repeated triumph of costume and puppetry.It would probably be best if the Alien franchise ended here. Alien 3 was compromised rather than enhanced by the demands of Sigourney weaver's burgeoning sense of stardom, Alien 4 too cast and creatures into the realms of gurning French grotesquery and while The dark Horse comics were great , the Alien vs Predator stuff just did nothing that good. What further moves could there be?Scott has endowed the creature with a soul and revealed its creator. I guess I'll have to go back to waiting to meet mine because I can't see this movie series going anywhere good.",Alien - Covenant

If you haven't seen Prometheus, you are in the dark.In addition, you have Fassbender at his best and some stunning visual effects.Some flaws are obvious: The rest of the cast is sub par (prometheus had an amazing overall cast). Most of the crew behaves unprofessionally in a crisis situation. But that's it.And regarding predictability - it was less predictable than all its predecessors.Complain as much as you want - this was a good film.",Alien - Covenant

591,ghent1,Uninspiring but with some good moments,6,5 June 2017,"As with most of Ridley Scott's work of the past two and a half decades, the movie is of mellow quality. The story isn't very profound or inspired, there seem to be a lot of gaps in the scenario and it's simply not very scary or thriller-like. I was never scared or never impressed. As is also the case with Star Wars these days, the screenplay also harks back too much to elements which made the first two Alien movies (Scott only directed the very first one) so good, but it is done in a manner which is not as brilliant as back then. As he is getting old, it seems Ridley Scott has lost 'the edge' as a filmmaker.",Alien - Covenant
592,thesandfly77,I Am Not A Film Student,8,17 May 2017,"...Nor am I a wannabe film critic.Therefore this review will not be written from a smug, supercilious point of view, sneering at a piece of work by a renowned director and able cast, the kind of project that I will never hope to exceed or even participate in because once outside the bubble of my ego I will discover the big bad world cares not a jot for my pretensions and self-satisfied viewpoint that makes me popular in student bars and probably on my own youtube channel where I will inevitably end up after my narcissistic ambitions are thwarted and eventually scorched, like the burgers I end up flipping through tears of petulant frustration.What I am is a middle-aged film fan who managed, nearly 40 years ago - jeez... - to sneak into a late-night screening of 'Alien' with a cadre of gormless teenage youths thanks to the culpability of a friend's usher-employee older brother.I say 'culpability' because - in the good old days, kids - that fermenting spine-chilling two hours of celluloid darkness haunted me for years. All very well sniffing at the xenomorph through decades of cultural saturation on little-to-medium screens but at its cinematic big-screen birth? - primordially terrifying.And now Ridley proves relentless as his ouevre, storming the theatres again through his old-age. Four decades on, what does yer scary old English uncle do to twist his spine-tingling tales to keep those wizened children of the age on edge? Well, there was Prometheus - and you really should have seen it in order to gain the most from Covenant. To be honest, I left the cinema after Prometheus very disappointed. Confused in the main about what the main thrust of its themes were. Upon revision and repeated viewings, its irritating mishaps are outweighed by its grander narrative and the big ideas it explores.The Gestalt factor - THE principle that good movie producers understand can elevate a film from its perceived failings; that the whole is other than the sum of its parts. And Prometheus, for me, ultimately fitted that theory.So to Covenant with anticipation. And what I got was a solid thriller to add to the canon, sitting nicely behind the first two and again vindicating ol' Gestalt.It's about 80% what I hoped for, and what I'd expected to find regarding the overriding theme...MINOR SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW (But i'll try to keep it opaque): Fassbender - owns it; about the only living actor who could pull of that dual role convincingly, with tremendous malevolent threat and excoriatingly disturbing execution. Completely brilliant.Xenomorph - maximised its threat and power beyond what I had expected - genuinely menacing again, and along with the Neomorph, formidable kings of the sci-fi baddies catalog once again; You CAN breathe new life into the familiar.Cast - fine. What's not to like? Everyone carries their part with conviction and leaves nothing off the celluloid.Dialogue/Script - 90% fine with me. Sure there's the few creaky lines that might not survive real scrutiny but a perfect script? There's always something someone will add/alter/replace subjectively; it doesn't exist. And doesn't need to be here, because...The Action - sorry, but the naysayers are talking out their arses; the sequences are perfectly balanced. There's NO overkill or overt gratuity in the violence or the gore; I was surprised at the satisfying gravity and screen time allotted to both - each sequence felt authentic and 'realistically' pitched in terms of timescale, combat authenticity and outcome. Great, to be honest, with a thrilling finale as well.Innovations/Reveals (PROPER SPOILERS, skip if necessary) - Personally, I liked the fleeting xenomorph POV; a wry smile accompanied this 'distorted' HUD, ""ahhh, they can see to an extent..."" As far as the big reveal - David the destroyer/creator - I'd 'guessed it/hypothesised it beforehand, when in conversation or thought about the forthcoming sequels. It made it no less satisfying/interesting/frustrating to see it portrayed in the actual narrative and lit the imagination as to the promise of the third and final prequel/sequel. I will have no hesitation is attending asap to see where Ridley Scott will take us next in the inevitable ascent/descent towards the origin.Other points of note springing to mind - the nods towards the first, with the nodding bird and the bleeping tracker; lovely. Not trite, just neat.OVERALL - if you have anything more than a mild appreciation or interest in the Alien universe this film will not disappoint. Even for the diehards, it offers a very admirable chapter in the huge backstory Ridley Scott and his writers are creating; they melded the philosophical, the physical and the fantastical well here, allowing for intellectual musings and savage sci-fi horror to sit contemporaneously.After Prometheus I was a little detached from Ridley's ideology. After Alien: Covenant I'm fully engaged again. Mishaps forgiven, grand themes absorbed and I'm happily strapped into the drop-ship for the next badass ride to hell in space. (Bill P RIP).A solid 7.5/10 from me. Will watch again.",Alien - Covenant
593,martin-807-452270,Chicken Korma of a film,4,22 May 2017,"****Spoilers**** This film is a bit like going for dinner at a curry house you've been to before. The first time you went it was brilliant, the food was amazing, the waiters were brilliant - you tried a new dish and it was excellent! So you went back, had one of those meals that sizzle and everyone looks when the waiter brings it in! Awesome! But then the next couple of times you went it's just not been very good, maybe they changed the chef or the menu and to be honest it was pretty awful, OK the Naan bread was nice, but the meat dish, well, was rank. But it's just down the street so you keep going back for more. You've had the tikka which was excellent and the vindaloo which was good but a bit too spicy and made your ring sting for a week and you regretted having it (Aliens Vs Predator 2). So after that you tried something totally new, that everyone told you was amazing and it gave you the S**** for a week. (Prometheus). For some reason you just can't stay away from this curry house - maybe it's the decor, or just that those first two meals were SO good even though it's almost 40 years since you had the first one, and all the chefs are dead or retired. So now you are back and you're going to play it safe: you'll have the Chicken korma. But it's bland and there's not enough of it, and they forgot the naan bread, which is the bit you really liked! You try to find a waiter. But there is no one there. You're all alone in the restaurant and you can't even get that beer! You peek into the kitchen and there is no chef! Just the waiter trying to cook everyone's dinner from a recipe book. And it's a shitty recipe book written by a child who has no idea how to cook or even has any understanding of flavour or subtlety or has ever been in a flipping kitchen! That's what Alien: Covenant is: a chicken korma of a film. The opening scene was like something written by a film school student. It felt like it went on for three hours of pure exposition and they all like Wagner, gimme a break. Then we are into space - lovely cold scary space - and all this stuff was great - loved it - was really thinking this film was on track, then they get to the planet and everyone behaves like a moron just like they did in the last film! It's a new planet and they don't even have respirators! I get sick if I go beyond France - so I take medicine with me! But No. Not an alien planet with spores and microbes everywhere. No just walk around and look at stuff. Split up and take your clothes off if you are a woman and wash in some dark corner with lots of dark tunnels. (How many times do we have to see the close up of her severed head? at least four and I say 'her' because apart from 'T' (For Tennessee - maybe a reference to Dallas in Alien?) I didn't really pick up on anyone's name apart from Walter and Daniels. Then David appears (yawn) and tells them to follow him, which they do without even saying ""Excuse me, but who are you?"" as you might especially just after loads of your friends have just been eviscerated and he leads them into some sort of medieval castle. All this technology but they couldn't sort out the guttering or the drainage let alone find a sewing machine (maybe they could have asked King Arthur?). In the scene where the big engineers were all standing round like people from Life of Brian waiting for a stoning I swear one of them was wearing Birkenstock sandals. Halfway across the universe and they haven't even got fashion sense. And then (checks watch) it's about an hour into the film and there are no aliens yet and some aliens start turning up and etc etc as you'd expect. They gestate in about 3 minutes and grow to full size without consuming any matter, so they just spontaneously generate matter, which is silly. But this isn't Guardians of the Galaxy and it's trying to be serious and not a little bit silly, so you start thinking about the logic and there is no logic it's just stupid and unimaginative. The foil of the unimaginative is often to hide behind perceived complexity which does not stand up to scrutiny and that's exactly what happened in Prometheus and again in this bland movie. And then there's an alien and he's a big one and he's climbing on a space ship thing that looks like it was designed from Lego and haven't we seen this before? OK the alien(s) can smash glass so let's do this scene yeah? And let's do it again. And one more time OK? Hell it worked the first time so and I've completely run out of ideas so sod it one more time! Yeah! Smash smash. Lovely. Now then. Um. Er. Actually. Do you know what? Lets try one more time what with 5 being the magic number an all. It's quite clear that the film makers don't know what to do with the aliens and they are just cannon fodder in this film which is now all about David and his god-complex and eventually he's going to get to Earth and try to kill everyone, and yawn, is that the time? Tis a silly film and Ridley Scott should know better. I really enjoyed the bits in the space ship(s), but from the second they were on the planet to the second they left the planet it was utter balderdash. And the bit on the poster - isn't in the film. 2/5 Chicken Korma of a film.",Alien - Covenant

Trying to understand the reasoning, the motivation, the logic behind this abomination of a ""story"", all I could come up with is that they tried to introduce ""ALIEN"" to a whole new generation of an audience to appreciate and grow old with.... Yes, that they did.... to an audience that is lacking basic understanding of common sense, of cause and effect, of average moderately good story telling, of everything known to mankind and it is absolutely necessary to put one foot in front of the other, progress and make sense of its existence. Shameless, mindless, exploitation of the ALIEN franchise, of the sci-fi genre, for the shake of making a quick buck. I wish I knew if Ridley Scott has any say on the story or he just directs whatever they give him because he is bound by contract and there is absolutely no f@#$#$%%^ing way he can get out and avoid it like the plague. Someone must ask him that. Somebody please, please do that!If it has been done already, forgive me, I have not read or heard it anywhere. If he has no say and it is Impossible for him TO STOP, WITHDRAW from directing new ALIEN????? (should have been called Xenomorph) films, then I truly sympathize the predicament he is in....If that is not the case then... I am not sorry at all for him as a creator and the harsh/trash critics he has received. Just let it go man!!!!!!!!!!! Let.It.Go.Already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If I were an actor, I would not participate in any other installment no matter how much money they gave me.I urge, anyone who has not seen this ""thing"" yet, to please please first watch the original film, of which this is a disgrace of an attempt of a remake (the opening title, the music), and then reach their own conclusions.Watch all 4 movies of the franchise. The first 3 are gems. The 4th not so much, but still it has scenes/moments that will make your skin crawl... Hell, AVP was a freaking masterpiece for the ages, compared to this blunt-tasteless mess of nothing!CGI, explosions, visual effects etc etc can do nothing for a film that has nothing to offer plot wise, acting wise (the cast except Fassbender had nothing to work on, nothing to work with).If I am not mistaken, there was a trailer which I saw here on IMDb a couple of months before the release of the movie where the whole crew was having dinner or lunch or whatever and there was a scene where one of the crew was seen choking and immediately your mind went to the legendary, most iconic, scene of the first 1979 movie, which in this version was made to mock it!!! Ridley Scott made a scene that was mocking himself, the essence of the original ALIEN... Oh yes he did!! But thank all the known gods of the world for him, it was not in the final cut that hit the movie theaters... and searching I found it= Alien: Covenant Extended Clip & Trailer (2017) Sci-Fi Horror Movie. Check it out and make up your own mind for this ""thing"".....After that... what else can I say....This time around it is not ""crew expendable"", the whole ALIEN franchise has taken its place.P.S.

In a nutshell Sir Ridley Scott has given us everything we have been waiting for and we even get a chestburster that on a whole isn't as incredible as the original Alien from 1979 however the one thing it is is violent yet if your going to mention a birthing scene then the backburster has to be the one that made me feel rather uneasy,its brilliantly executed and we get to see it all plus the build up to the scene is as intence as anything you are likely to have or will ever see. This is a great movie for Alien fans,its bloody...very very gory...intense and on a visual style you need say no more than you have the master himself at the helm Sir Ridley Scott. As long as there is an audience everyone will always compare each follow up to the original as they always have yet as Sir Ridley says ""This Is My Baby""""By The Time I'm Finished With It Its Going To War Of The Bloody Worlds"" enough said,safe to say this movie is amazing,not perfect but still the best Alien movie we have been given in years",Alien - Covenant
597,kastenmeier-andreas,Neither Prometheus nor Alien,6,24 May 2017,"I never got the bad reviews that Prometheus received when it was released. I really liked the main theme, feeling and look of that movie. Of course, there were flaws and in my opinion the biggest of them was the connection to the alien universe. Obviously some of the scenes including the so-called scientists in this alien building were also really stupid, but i could have lived with that. What bothered me was that the plot didn't went enough into the culture of those engineers and their reasons for creation.So as I heard about the rearrangement of Prometheus 2 into Alien: Covenant, because the ""fans"", who ever they are, demanded more Aliens, I was alarmed. Sadly, my fears came through. The second movie is more of a horror-film than a science-fiction film. Get rid of the setting and you basically have a classic monster movie. The plot is the same as it ever was with some rather stupid add-ons regarding one of Michael Fassbenders characters in the movie.And this bothers me, because i like the style, look and feel of Ridley Scotts science-fiction movies. Alien: Covenant has all this ingredients, including good performances by great actors. But the greatest lack is the story, that doesn't go far enough and has many plot holes. Some characters act really stupid and inhuman in this movie. It often seems that they are just questioning things when it's convenient for the story.Nevertheless, this movie is from one of the best movie makers of our time and you can see that. If only the writers would have done better.",Alien - Covenant
598,bdawe14,Bland and boring,3,5 July 2017,I have been a huge Alien/Aliens fan since the first film came out. The first movie was a great movie there are still parts of it that make me jump and I have seen it many times. The only movie to surpass Alien was Cameron's Aliens.This movie is a desperate attempt to give some credibility to Prometheus which was plot disaster of a movie.This movie has none of the tension of Alien which set the gold standard in this genre for horror/jump scare movies and it misses the pace of and action of Aliens which again is a gold standard for an action/horror movies.Out of all the Aliens movies I would consider Aliens to be the best then Alien and I would give all of the rest a miss including Prometheus and this junk it's pretty boring. Ridley is trying to re-establish himself as the owner and king of this franchise but he's fallen short again. Prometheus was a feast for the eyes with the weakest plot you could imagine. This movie tries to prop up that pile of junk and suffers for it. SPOILER David being the big villain of the movie was just weak. I'd watch Alien then Aliens and then move on.Skip this movie,Alien - Covenant
599,floppylobster-86-283328,"If you like Prometheus chances are you will at least find this interesting. But if you're a fan of Aliens, then steer clear.",6,13 August 2017,"If you like Prometheus chances are you will at least find this interesting. But if you're a fan of Aliens, then steer clear.The problem is, the original Alien film is so iconic and examines important human issues so subtly that many people interrupt it different ways. Is it horror, sci-fi, an examination of gender, about sexuality, a story about god and creation, life and death? It's all of of those. But with Prometheus, and now Alien: Covenant, Ridley Scott is more interest in exploring the creation side of the story. All the themes from Alien and Prometheus are here. If anything they're more explicit and that may annoy some people, but the questions being asked are still interesting.Put aside whether or not the characters behave how you would, they're characters. They represent themes and ideas. It's science fiction and they're not supposed to be heroes or villains like a normal Hollywood blockbuster. Mankind is out exploring the universe looking for answers and a place to live while their android creations are questioning their creators, wondering why they exist. There are some deep thoughts going on behind all of this. Why were humans created? Is there a god? Do we deserve to live? Why do we have to die? What's the point of living? Unfortunately because of the franchise's popularity, the film sits uncomfortably between several audiences: One where people just want a film like Aliens, where marines shoot and hoot and battle alien creatures; One where people want a creepy horror type film; And one where they want an intellectual exploration of the answers above. But even those people seem to want to have the answers to these unknowable questions given to them in the film. So Alien Covenant sits in an awkward place, being an incredibly popular franchise but with a creator who is only interesting in exploring certain aspects of his creation.I applaud Scott for going deeper into what is in his mind, and the fact that I don't identify with any of the characters or get answers to his questions doesn't bother me. I just enjoy that someone is here trying to express something very deep about human existence through the medium of film.People are complaining, ""Why did this character do this or that?"" But here is a film that asks ""Why do we exist?"" Why we do one thing or another is paled beneath that question. The opening scene sets the tone but I guess some people ignored it waiting for the action.I suppose if you believe there is order to the universe and God created man, you may not enjoy the uncomfortable ideas the film explores - That by a combination of luck and some input beyond our control, human life as we know it came in existence. And ever since then curiosity, stupidity and an innate desire to create and procreate have moved us further. And that the same thing may happen again and supersede us. But if you're open to something that will provoke thought beyond the action on screen, then underneath it all there is something really interesting going on here. For me the film treads a little too much of the same ground as Prometheus but it still manages to add something interesting, even if it's just showing the limitations of our ability to examine these subjects.",Alien - Covenant
600,keith-w8888,"So, not aliens at all after all that....",1,29 May 2017,"I'm being a bit harsh, the film in many ways had some positive' attributes - some good cinematography, some good cgi, some nice new little twists, like the pixel dust in the atmosphere - but otherwise Ridley Scott, who I admire for many of his other movies, lost the plot with Prometheus and failed to find it again with this piece of malevolence. What sort of spaceship, even in the future, would have a massive shower with many jets of water so that a couple could make love in it together? Just a vulgar set up so that the monster could stick its scorpion-like tail up the woman's hindquarters to spoil the mood. Was that really necessary? Did that enhance everyone's appreciation of the movie - or was it just scraping the barrel of cinematic shock for its own notoriety? I could forgive an 11 year old boy writing something like that, but Ridley Scott? Michael Fassbinder did a magnificent job of being the evil, smooth talking robot - quietly and duplicitously murdering everyone and turning them into food for his pupae. But really, would no-one have not noticed until the last minute? That close was really the dramatic haemorrhoid on the butt of a disgracefully predictable plot. So yeah, they're not aliens at all then, just genetically engineered humans. Kind of defeats the purpose of the franchise. I just hope for humanity's sake that this is the last we'll ever see of this horrible, worn out franchise.",Alien - Covenant
601,Ekul1021,Uhh......no,4,21 May 2017,"Don't expect Alien: Covenant to be the actual sequel to Prometheus, think of it as more like a story within the time-line. In a poetic way, maybe the Engineer who pulled David's head out to kill Weyland did the right thing. The android would create something he calls the ""perfect organism"" into a nightmare and thus mass murdered the entire Engineer people.The story of the vessel Covenant comes in as conveniences of the cenario of just being at the wrong place at the wrong time. However if we expect anything such as Shaw's quest to figure out why the Engineers wanted to kill their creation the humans, Ridley tossed that out the door and we just have Shaw as dead body as a result. The teaser where Shaw and David in the ship was basically a red herring until the part where David destroys the entire city.Only thing I find redeeming in the movie was the photography scenes and the soundtrack. This is consistent with Scott's MO as he is famous for scenes, locations, and the photography. Otherwise the visual is very much stunning and the soundtrack is much more alien this time.As for Lore of the Alien, we now know who made it and it was humanity's creation who made it, or in the spirit of Weyland. Instead of the mysterious creation like how the Engineers made them, what we got is typically a flat answer of ""Oh...David created the Alien."" Otherwise then that, Alien: Covenant seems best on a Netflix movie rather then spending your hard earn money unless you're a DIE HARD alien fan. Even some fans who came in with high expectation were left disappointed, wanting more, and felt the movie just had too many holes. I certainly was disappointed because I seriously did wanted to see if Shaw ever found her answers as well as explore more about the Engineer's culture and home. Anyways, the movie is just another addition to the franchise and nothing more. At least it's not as disappointing as Aliens: Colonial Marines game.",Alien - Covenant
602,dan-259-431343,LOVE now and I HATED this when I first watched....then rewatched...now I own the Blu Ray,9,2 September 2017,"OK, I am always willing to give any film (well, almost any film) a second viewing. I am so thrilled that I do that because I have realized and rediscovered some truly fantastic films (I HATED Muriel's Wedding when I first saw it and now own the Blu Ray). I re-watched Alien Covenant and saw it from a different perspective (or maybe I was just in a bad mood the day I first watched it or I expected the David / Elizabeth Shaw story in full detail). This is really a fantastic film on its own and also a brilliant set up for the Alien franchise. I have now watched it five times and love it more each time. I was a ""hater"" and I accept full responsibility for my temporary insanity! You can read what I wrote below from my first review but it is basically negative rubbish:Alien and Aliens are close to perfection. Spoiler alert: Insulting to the viewer that men and women who are supposedly highly trained for a space journey make stupid decisions every step of the way. This made Alien 3 look like a masterpiece (Alien 3 was also not the fault of David Fincher but movie producers and studio heads who are idiots and would not give him artistic control). Acting was terrible which is not the fault of the actors, but the poor direction. Ridley Scott: you need someone who has the ability to sit you down and say ""Ridley, you are making a piece of garbage where the scientists are stupid."" Obviously everyone around him are ""yes people"". Easily one of the poorest directed and pathetically written films (The writer says: ""OK lets have the brilliant scientists fly into a super-hurricane and touch things without wearing gloves and breath the air on a planet we know nothing about. Oh, and lets go off in directions on our own. Oh, and lets follow the man in the cape without asking any questions."" STUPID and INSULTING) I have seen in years.I know right?

The acting is rather good except that I don't remember anyone by name which means that characters were used as meat.The ships Captain by accident is a nice touch in regard to being a character not being that sure of himself, however he should have had more screen- presence. The script : in fact a copy paste with parts of Alien, Aliens and Prometheus. Fantasy is low . "" Oh , we have an alien bursting out a body and we already used the belly In Alien so now lets use the back of the body"". Could not have found that myself. Then there are numerous mistakes ( or edited ). F.i. they come out of sleep and the next 5 sec they act on steroids....not really possible is it. The worst : I did not scream in space. I wasn't afraid , neither perplexed, neither impressed. So what is next Scott ? A movie of what went on between Prometheus and Covenant ? Hope not.",Alien - Covenant

605,treborquest,This has nothing to do with the Alien I know,4,31 May 2017,"If you are a fan of Alien and work on a movie called Alien: Covenant, you should quit your job and be a shamed to have worked on this. I gave it 6 stars, because I enjoyed the movie and it has some OK acting in it, but while writing I kept deducting stars, because of how bad this movie is actually constructed. As many people before me already wrote. The whole movie is full of moments that are not logical. The way the characters act and react. The plot line itself. It is very predictable on every level. This movie has just been made to cash in on the legacy, but it actually spits in its face. It is truly a shame you can't take it back now anymore and start all over again. Shame Ridley! Bad Writing, bad acting, bad casting and very bad of you to actually think your audience is this stupid. I went without reading reviews, because I am a fan of the Alien movies for a long time and did not want to be influenced, but this movie is a smack in the face to a real fan. Sure, the original Alien-movies also have their flaws. But with this one, someone just had to stand up and say 'this is wrong, we need to rethink this'. Such a shame.",Alien - Covenant

Ship lands on a planet and discovers Aliens and then tries to escape. Of course, the circumstances surrounding the story are now different. There are some references to the first Prometheus. Technology and special effects are basically the same.Besides Michael Fassbinder the character development is lacking IMO compared to Prometheus I. It is wide open for more sequels. I rated the first Prometheus a 9 but both are hovering around a 7. Definitely worth seeing if you are a fan. Just not a great movie.

607,SeakDub,Boring Tale of Aliens.,4,5 July 2017,"A movie about aliens, you get crappy CGI of them and not much aliens, followed by the creation of them which is more confusing and boring. Surely the writers and Ridley Scott didn't even know how to explain it.The movie, boring. Everyone at this point should know this story is about the creation of Aliens. How they came about to wreck havoc in the classic and wonderful Alien Quadrilogy(The four movies). Then comes Prometheus(2012), the first prequel to the Alien story. Which wasn't that bad, average. And then Alien: Covenant(2017) which is the continuous story of how the Aliens came about. But at this point it gets so confusing and so many questions not being answered the movie turns out boring and annoying. Feeling like plot holes and stories aren't sticking. Not saying it does, but you get the feeling like the writers, Ridley Scott himself doesn't even know certain answers and skips over details. That is what this movie delivers.From that the movie has decent parts. Love the exploring and scenery landscape it showed. Visuals of space was amazing as well. Then you get let down when the aliens show up. The biggest let down in a movie. The aliens looked pathetic. Understandable that it is a different form of aliens unlike the ones we are use to, skinnier looking. Even the action involving the aliens was garbage. Graphics were horrid and the action of them didn't feel like Alien. Along with the fact that somehow this first ""aliens"" take a lot more damage. So far crappy action with aliens with a boring backstory.Then we have the characters. I can say right now, most of the other reviews is truth. The most dumbfounded you'll get by their idiotic and what in the world decisions they make is just beyond stupid. So many issues could have been avoided if only they didn't make that one terrible mistake. Even if you panic realizing you are seeing an alien for the first time so you might panic and do something stupid, no no. We are talking about people who make this mission a suicide pact because they don't seem to know anything. An example, in the movie we have the pilot of the small carrier ship who locks two people in the medic bay due to possible contamination. Why was this scene utter horrible? Because the lady had multiple times to change the course to save herself and her friend, but no. So first she locks them in, goes to make a call, comes back(keep in mind she had blood sprayed in her face so she herself should worry about whatever this contamination thing is) and her friend who is begging to be let out she refuses. Then the alien comes out, so still screaming and panicking runs to grab a shotgun while leaving her friend locked in and not letting her out so together they both of them can team up. Nope she runs back and finds her friend getting attacked and possibly dead at this point from the alien, she goes in with the shotgun ready to shoot the alien and her friend in the face until she slips, freaks out and crawls back out closing the door on her leg. So she runs to gets another shotgun misses almost every shot, then blows up the ship with her bad aim. This lady should know the ship has explosives on board but doesn't care. This whole scene was utter trash. Which leaves the rest of the crew stuck on the planet waiting for help now. Then you get stupid decisions with the rest of the movie where no one seems to think. Like taking a ship with 2000 colonists of people very close to the planet to make contact with the crew risking the ship and lives of the 2000. Tough luck, the rest of the crew should have high tailed it out of there. I can go on about why this movie was terrible, plot holes, the worst crew alive. But the few parts I did enjoy was Michael Fassbender's character or being surprise by how much I like Danny McBride in this movie. Otherwise I wish it would have been so much better. A more simple story would have made it great. I'm still confused on who made the aliens. Anyways with all that said, if you are a fan of the Alien movies you will be disappointed. If you haven't seen the originals and want to watch this, you may or may not enjoy. But regardless you can't escape the stupid decisions the crew does and confusing backstory which makes the movie almost unwatchable. All in all, a one time watch and burn it.",Alien - Covenant
608,mtl_freak,A shame they did not keep Naomi on for this.,7,23 September 2021,Besides killing off her character and the conting general stupidity of all crew members ..still it is a decent enough film. That said it's not a good movie compared to Alien or Aliens. It can hold a candle to Alien 3 and Ressurection..I do think if Ridley Scott had abit more room to make what he wanted here it would have turned out in a much better way.

609,Gorgorgorgoroth,"Best Alien Film After ""Aliens"", It Really Is Not That Bad",7,30 May 2017,"I was really looking forward to this film. I love the Aliens. They're my favourite movie monsters ever. I was curious about their origin. I have no problem with the direction Ridley Scott is going with this franchise. I mean, come on, it's the guy who brought Alien to the big screen in the first place, and the original Alien film is my favourite film of all time.A lot of people dislike this film because they don't like how the Aliens were created by an android with a god complex and the Aliens were not this ancient species that evolved naturally. Tbh, I'm glad Ridley Scott is going against all these silly fan theories. I don't know why anyone would take these fan theories seriously anyway.Originally, they wanted the Aliens to be created by the Engineers but Ridley Scott thought the idea of the Aliens being created by David the android would be more interesting and I can understand why Ridley Scott would say this.Weyland creates David. David creates the Aliens. Weyland wants the Aliens.In the older Alien films, Weyland-Yutani Corp wanted the Aliens so badly to study them for bioweapons. The company was so desperate to study the Aliens that they sacrificed so many of their own employees and other lives just to capture an Alien.Alien: Covenant does have a lot of flaws though. I am aware of this.I'll start off with the pros: The movie has good cinematography and nice visuals. The CGI in this film is really not that bad. I mean, seriously? I've seen much worse CGI. Have you seen The Amazing Spider Man? Legend of Tarzan? Jurassic World? Those movies are much worse CGI. Trust me. This film has brutal death scenes (especially the back burster scene) and good amount of gore. Michael Fassbender did an amazing job in this film, just like in Prometheus. Katherine Waterston did a decent job. And this whole ""SHE'S NOT RIPLEY!"" criticism is really silly tbh. I really feel like people nitpick because they think hating on something is a popular trend or something. Idk. People don't make sense. Like seriously, what did you expect from Waterston's character? The Alien designs were cool. I'm glad they brought back the legendary Aliens to the big screen. This is the first time we get to see the Aliens in their own films in 20 years (Alien: Resurrection, 1997). I noticed the Aliens in this film have scorpion's stinger at the end of their tails (just like how the original Alien looked) rather than a sword-like blade in older films. The music in this film is beautiful, especially at that chest burster scene. A beautiful, emotional scene.Now let's look at the cons: The Engineers have very little screen time. It's funny because the Engineers played a big role in Prometheus but, in this film, the Engineers have like 10 seconds of screen time. The Engineers in this film look horrible. They look like ugly bald humans wearing white powder on their faces. And why were they wearing potato sacks when they're supposed to be advanced and superior to humans? I strongly preferred the Engineers' looks in Prometheus. The scene where the two women slip on blood was really stupid. I highly doubt blood is actually slippery. The movie does not explain why the Engineer at the end of Prometheus wanted to kill humans. The movie also does not explain why David killed the Engineers and why David hates humans. What exactly does David get out of creating the ""perfect organism""? How does David hair grow? He's an android. He's not an actual living thing. That made no sense.And the ending... oh the ending. Probably the most obvious ending ever. They really needed to cut the scenes where David is reaching for the knife and where David is looking back to the temple when Daniels and Lope are running to Tennessee's ship. Cutting those scenes would probably make the ending less obvious.But overall, the movie is very fun to watch. People need to chill about this film. It's really not as bad as how other people say it is. I'm glad Ridley Scott is back to the Alien universe and I'm really looking forward to the sequel of this film.But the best thing about Alien: Covenant is that it takes a huge dump on Alien vs Predator and kicks it out of the Alien timeline. Thank God. What kind of moron would want that awful, childish crossover to be canon anyway?",Alien - Covenant
610,cristiandeiana,"Wow, what's with all the terrible reviews on this movie? I thought it was pretty good.",7,11 July 2017,"Wow, what's with all the terrible reviews on this movie? I thought it was pretty good. Sure it doesn't have such an iconic bad ass protagonist as Ripley, but overall it was a thoroughly entertaining watching experience. And saying that, actually the protagonist in Covenant isn't at all bad, her acting is impressive, and she gets stuck into incredible action scenes. I have to disagree with what some of the other reviewers have said, that it 'lacks suspense' or that 'the CGI is really bad', it looked good to me, and the movie was full of plot twists and tense moments, as well as interesting dialogue such as questioning an AI's ability to love, their purpose in life, and how they were made without the ability to create so as to lack idiosyncrasy, to name a few.I found the sets/CGI to be very impressive, and the aliens failed to disappoint and were both creepy and scary. Sure it's not quite like the originals, but what more to you f****ing want? It was much better than Prometheus, which was a bit underwhelming running at a very slow pace. On the contrary a lot happens in this movie, I only wish it was longer and that they could delve a bit deeper into some of the characters and have a few more memorable scenes of dialogue, but that would be nitpicking because actually the movie was very enjoyable.",Alien - Covenant
611,mukherjeediptendu,Ridley Scott gave us the back original Alien feel.......,8,12 May 2017,"This is one of the great alien movies... It is a perfect mashup of Alien and Aliens.....There are two movie prologues released online that are really helps the movie to understand more... One on which all the crew member of the ship covenant have a little party before going into cryosleep... Other one is what happened with Dr.E.Shaw after Promethues....The Movie starts of with a high note sci-fi movie with dialogues... The very first scene, the interactions between Weyland(Guy Pearce) and David(Michael Fassbender) was so well done and its justifies as the movie unfolds...The First half of the movie will give you the Alien(1979) feeling and the Second half more or less like Aliens(1986)... Alien creatures are well done and completely terrifying because what it can do and it does that....The blood and the gore were the least part of the terror.. The sequence of fighting the xenomorph in the covenant ship at the end was smartly done... Every character in this movie really do very well in the sense of acting... Michael Fassbender in this movie is just fantastic.... The Story is really well done... How every things happens well explained better than Prometheus... The Aliens are more terrifying than ever... Ridley Scott directs another sci-fi with near perfection...Although there are minimal problems with the movie.. Some with dialogues and some about one or two scenes which seems very dull...Other than that this movie is the 3rd best alien movie of this franchise right after Alien and Aliens...it has horror mystery and it has cool actions too.....8/10.....",Alien - Covenant

613,jmarinko925,The Big Nasty Xenomorph we fear and love is back and Fierce as ever!!,8,19 May 2017,I went to see Alien Covenant last night with a group of five and all of us left satisfied. Fans of the Alien franchise that did not enjoy Prometheus do not be dissuaded(I myself did not). Those that did like it will enjoy it as well. The story picks up the Prometheus story line and gives us what it was lacking. The Alien. You asked for it? You got it! The filmmakers rather than scrap the Prometheus story-line and reboot the successful franchise instead made a bold decision that in my opinion had a substantial payoff for the viewer. While the cast meets and exceeds expectations The real star of this movie is the Alien itself and while there is some necessary setup this film succeeds as it's predecessors did by crafting suspense for what we the viewer all know is coming and when it does in spite of what you saw in the trailers you are not ready. A little something for moralists as well as some horror film traditions are revisited and punishment is delved out to those with vices as well as the undeserving.I purchased the Alien anthology to refresh on the originals and I can say after seeing the 1979 original& 2003 Director's cut of the original Alien as well as Aliens this is a worthy companion and sheer delight for fans of the Alien franchise.This is definitely a film to see in theater's it is to big viewed on the big screen I personally shredded more than my usual share of popcorn from the second act on. Kick you're summer off right by visually getting you're ass kicked by this legendary horror of the big screen a truly terrifying Sci FI Horror Legend!,Alien - Covenant
614,louis-170,What is wrong with you?,3,10 October 2019,"Who writes this thing?
Alien film directed by Ridley Scott, with big budget and Michael Fassbender in leading role. What can go wrong? Everything.
Year 2104. In advanced future it is hard to find intelligent human being. Everything said and done by the people is incredibly stupid. Every decision is laughable. The go to alien world just random. Their captain who dies in first minutes is extreme sports lover. That is not responsible person.
Next captain make worst possible decisions. They just put all the people in risk with every decision. The come at alien planet just like walk in the park.
No matter how much I like Michael Fassbender as an actor, his character(s) are so annoying.
We have alien creatures who look stupid and act like ninjas.
About the story. Who came up whit this crap?
Engineers, super intelligent race from another world create human life on planet Earth. Later people create Android person who has some unclear issues, he go on their planet and wipe them up. Yes. He kills them all. I said super intelligent race, right?
Who cares? No suspense, no action.
Android alone at the planet start to experiment in genetics and creates Xenomorph / Neomorph / BlahBlahmorph. Who cares? Alien 1979 was scary, This creatures are not.
Android is evil. Come on.

616,utku_kamil_ozen,"How Can You Have so Many Interesting and Good Ideas, but Create an Unintentionally Hilarious 'Circus in Space' Type of a Movie at the End?",5,15 April 2020,"There is an Island, in the Bay of Bengal, called North Sentinel Island and it is inhabited by indigenous people. These people are one of the world's last uncontacted peoples, they are called the Sentinelese. They are protected by the Indian government and the travel to this island is prohibited within a few kilometers. One concern is the possibility of infecting them with common infectious diseases that they might not have immunity for. You see where I am going with this, right? Even on the same planet, there are people who are vulnerable to such diseases as common flu, which is not dangerous to a majority of human population. The astronauts who first landed on the moon stayed in quarantine for a few weeks after they returned, because of the possibility of a contagion from the moon. Another example is the Galileo spacecraft, which was purposefully burned in the atmosphere of Jupiter after it completed its mission, to prevent contamination of its moons with the bacteria from Earth... In the movie however, the crew lands on a completely strange planet, which they have literally just discovered, with no protection whatsoever! They breath the air freely, touch the vegetation and the water within minutes after landing. I mean they don't even act normal, entire sections of the movie is shot as a parody or something. I thought the guy was going to gulp down the water sample given to him by the woman. And I hate to nitpick movies, especially sci-fi movies, but the reason I am talking about these mistakes is that they immediately get infected and several of them dies! If there was no infection related deaths in the film, I would be mildly annoyed by the crews haphazard behavior, but wouldn't bring it up in my review. But it literally affects the plot of the movie. So, the writers came up with the idea of the crew getting sick on a strange planet but also let them behave so unrealisticly carelessly for the same situation. It is lazy, it is stupid, it is insulting and there are a lot stuff in the film like that...After comically getting infected by the monster thingy contagion, they continue to act like clowns. One of the crew members, who got splashed in the face with the blood of an infected person, runs out of the room and traps her friend with the sick guy. I mean, had she done nothing afterwards, it could have been a half decent action, since despite of her seemingly healthy appearance, there is a possibility of her also being sick but not showing symptoms yet. But she comes back and within minutes, I swear, multiple people comically slip and fall down on the same blood puddle, then they accidentally blow up the shuttle while trying to kill the baby monster. Nothing anyone does makes any sense and it is hilarious.Despite the flaws I mentioned, and believe me, you can't fit them all in a single review, the film actually has a lot of good ideas as I said in the title, but continuously ruined those ideas. I've always loved the concept of AI and it becoming self aware. My favorite movie of all times is Blade Runner (1982), which is also directed by Ridley Scott and has his recurring theme of searching for one's creator. Now that was the motive of the AI character in Blade Runner, to find its creator and ask for more life . However, there is nothing interesting in David's motives, he just acts like an a**hole to fill the role of a villain in the movie. There could have been two ways to give David really good motives: He could either have had a clear motive and purpose that made sense or they could have gone the opposite and make his motives too alien for humans to understand, which would be a mystery and could have been a lot creepier. But, as I said, they've just made a generic villain out of him with stupid motives. Another good idea was Elizabeth's ''ghost'', which was creepy, but of course they had to ruin that, too. The way they came across Elizabeth's broadcast might be one of the funniest and most ridiculous plot progressions in a movie. They got hit by some sort of supernova or something and they came out of hypersleep right next to the planet where they can pick up Elizabeth's broadcast. In their crippling laziness, writers actually made them stumble across in space! I don't even need to explain how ridiculously unlikely that is. You would probably have higher chances of winning lottery multiple times in a row...In conclusion, with its amazing visuals and interesting ideas, you are never bored while watching this but you get angry a lot, then you occasionally laugh at the unintentional hilarity at times. I deliberately refrained from mentioning Prometheus (2012) anywhere in my review, because I'd like to think of them as separate movies in order not to ruin Prometheus, which has its own flaws but a better movie over all in my opinion. Imagine the possibilities they could have followed up from Prometheus... Lastly, I'd like to say something about movies in general, If you introduce a mystery in your movie, you either don't solve it, keep it as a mystery(my ideal choice) or come up with something smart and ahead of time, because often, they come up with the mystery first but not the explanation of it, then they can't write something smart and just botch the whole thing. I believe this is how we ended up with David as the main villain, because they couldn't follow up with the original engineers, they didn't know how to explain them, because they themselves had no idea what they were in the first place. At the end, I liked they didn't ruin them, too, because the little they wrote about them into the movie is indicative of how disastrous it could have been, if the movie was about them. They live like ancient Romans or something and despite their technology they live in caves... At the end, this movie makes you feel like Weyland dying, ''There is nothing...''",Alien - Covenant
617,zaywhat,Really?,6,30 August 2017,"The movie was OK, watchable. If you'd never seen one of the franchise, it might be more interesting. I would have preferred a real sequel to Prometheus, where Noomi Rapace lands on the Engineer world and there create some drama, maybe deepen the Engineer mythology. Instead, they used Prometheus details as an excuse to make another Alien eats everybody and you can't trust robots story. The thing I really did not like was how this set of colonizers dealt with the situation. Water samples are taken with gloves then handed to someone's bare hands who tosses the sample into a box. The fear reactions, slipping on blood and complete lack of protocols to analyze an environment scientifically before sniffing the plant life, etc. suggested to me that these colonists wouldn't survive a trip to the Amazon jungle much less a new planet.",Alien - Covenant

You had a proven objective, and proven habitable planet! Why do you not wear spacesuits on unknown planet? How does some random dust go into your ear and create an alien? I thought you had to be impregnated somehow. How can you lose a fight to a squirrel on steroids size creature? How do you manage to get your foot stuck in the door? How do you not realize you're aiming at fuel cells?I could keep going but it would be pointless. The crew make the dumbest decisions ever. The pace is never exciting.

Why do they want to destroy us? Anyway Prometheus ended with shaw and David on route to their planet to discover why. Great I can't wait to see what happens. Well it must have been all the feedback that was left by people who just wanted a xenomorph and not a compelling continuation. Covenant is not bad, it's just not good. I think they just rushed the alien into it to please fans because of the backlash of Prometheus, the characters are not that interesting but Danny Mcbride was really good as Texas (he's the only 1 I remember).

620,noirink-12054,And the Universe of Alien is shrinking furthermore...,3,15 July 2017,"This movie makes Prometheus look like a philosophical piece of art.By all its flaws and awkward moments it's difficult for me where to begin. A couple of examples? Here you go: Remember the helmet issue in Prometheus? Guess what, in this movie they even don't bother with helmets anymore. Let's go on a foreign planet and breath in parasitic spores - weeeeeeh! Remember the stupid actions of the crew from Prometheus? In this movie a couple of crew members sacrificing a ship full with 2000 people in cryo-sleep, just because they discover a hazy transmission.Of course, the Images of Covenant look astonishing and the creatures move thanks to CGI faster than a jaguar. Oh by the way! Remember the slow and creepy pacing from the first two Alien-Movies? Now the chest from the victims of the infamous Facehuggers burst open within a couple minutes. Instead breeding now included!The list goes on and on, including a incredible cheap, foreseeable pay off at the end. What the first movie made special, was the unknown heritage and background of the xenomorph and the spacejockey. The whole concept was simple and the premise was based simply on a unlucky coincident. A small crew discovers a crashed, mysterious ship with a deadly cargo, stranded on a foreign planet, lost in the depths of space.Now we know - thanks to Prometheus and Alien: CoVenant - that the Spacejockey is in fact just a smarter version of Jason Vorhees and the original Alien Lifeform is the result of a sulky Android and his experiments in the basement.Yes - now, if you watch ALIEN again you witness a bunch of people being butchered by the result of a man-made Android. So in conclusion: the Spacejockeys are now the real ""Aliens"" and the Alien from Alien is now a simple weapon, manufactured indirectly by men.Instead of expanding the universe of Alien, Ridley Scott shrunk it.",Alien - Covenant

622,NotTheOne000,Some things are better left unsaid,6,9 March 2018,"So, Prometheus ends. Not a bad film... not a great film, but not a bad film. But the one thing it does do is leave us with a sense of anticipation. We're going to meet the Engineers! And Shaw and David are going to do something really exciting and possibly quite interesting, and we'll see their relationship evolve and explore some interesting ideas about human-as-creator and how creations can be flawed!Oh, wait, no we're not. Because Shaw is already dead by the time the film starts, David has been transformed into a two-dimensional Ubermensch narcissist with delusions of grandeur, and the Engineers have all been wiped out. A film's worth of set-up is dismantled in the space between two scripts. And what we're left with is a hackneyed story of something-or-other I can't even be bothered to delve into.There are plot-holes (the Engineer's just let this mystery ship fly over their only remaining city unchallenged?), dodgy CGI (the original Alien looked more real than the CGI one here) and stupid crew-members (why, oh why, did they not suspect David was tricking them?) and a twist ending that isn't a surprise to anyone other than the characters of the film. It isn't really that scary, and it isn't that exciting. David is nowhere near complex enough to justify the focus that's placed upon him. And, yet again, we see an Alien being blown out of an airlock (third time's the charm!).But what disappointed me the most is that Scott has undermined the key element of the original film. When Alien first hit cinema screens, it really was unlike anything we'd seen before. Geiger's creature was so different from the man-in-a-suit monsters that proceeded it, it really was alien. It was something so different, so strange, horrific and unusual, that the audience had no frame of reference. Now Scott has shown us that the Alien isn't actually that alien at all. It's just a bioweapon that was created by another species of humanoid and perfected by one of our own androids. Mystery explained.2017 was a bad year for franchise movies. Star Wars, DC and Marvel Universes, and the Alien franchise are all starting to feel very tired. We know too much about them all, so there are no surprises and no discoveries. They rehash old ideas, but can't match the original vigour, or they try to make the old ideas into something new and betray the original spirit. There are occasional one-offs that are worth watching, but they're the ones that break from the main franchise and may as well not be part of the franchises at all. And now there's talk of Blade Runner being brought into the Alien cinematic Universe...I guess there's still so much money in the franchise model that we'll see many more, however, I doubt very much that any of the franchise movies made in the last few years (and next few years) will occupy the same place in cinema history as the original Alien does. There are 18 sci-fi, superhero and fantasy movies in the IMDB top 100, many of which were early films in ongoing franchises. 5 of those 18 were made in the last 15 years, but none of those 5 are part of those original (now resurrected) franchises, and none of those 5 are part of the new, ongoing franchises. It really is a case of quantity over quality for sci-fi.",Alien - Covenant

It's been said before in many reviews: Alien is a masterpiece in SciFi/Horror because it was a first. So was Predator, Jaws, Friday the 13th, Matrix and so on... Get used to it. There is only one first. Given that I can say that the best follow up in cinema history is, without a doubt, Aliens.Listen very carefully to the first exchange between Weyland and David. That is a what the two latest movies are all about. Don't blame Ridley Scott for your lack of imagination or your expectations of what once was.This is what Alien will become in 1979.",Alien - Covenant
624,Jigsjigz,I was a huge fan of Alien and Aliens... flaws.,3,23 May 2017,"This film is a common sense fail from start to finish... none of it makes any sense from the ships sleeping pods turning into a fire pod, to the random message in space that only his suit can hear (must have better singling than equipment than the ship?!)they don't tell anyone else or leave a message for anyone back home etc. they send a drop ship down with no landing docking quarantine zone?! they keep their guns right next to an area that can blow up the whole ship, and are happy to walk around a new planet without any gear just in case they breath in anything... The plant/spores only seem to be in small areas of the ""jungle"" and some how merge together to create a smart virus that can fly and has no need to turn into 1 organism as it could just fly around and effect everything and its job is done? Why did they decide to mess with the original story so much? they have over complicated something that was so simple and yet left out all the common sense. Just like the crew who we felt nothing for.",Alien - Covenant
625,adamdustin6,Bad things have good beginnings.,5,19 March 2019,The first 40 minutes is intriguing before the film becomes flat out boring and senseless. The CGI Aliens are lifeless and uninteresting; a wasted opportunity that may have killed the franchise.,Alien - Covenant
626,benjaminlauriesmith,A strange choice of direction for the story.,7,10 July 2017,I enjoyed the movie to a degree; if it was an original movie without the whole alien heritage to live up to then most people would probably we saying what a fine movie it was but sadly it does have a lot to live up to and it falls short but perhaps not in the most obvious of ways.With its prequel you had some intrigue and the possibility of answers when Dr.Shaw discovered the Engineers home planet or something of that nature when it ended and you thought answers would be forth coming in its sequel. Sadly this is that sequel and the whole arcing story from the first movie is just airbrushed over in a couple of scenes with very little answers. The Engineers re-seed planets to start over? Are we expected to believe that the engineers we see on their home planet (assuming that is it) have only one city and they have been waiting how many thousands of years for that ship to return from its re-seeding mission? David wipes them out but there is no explanation for the passage of time or anything really; just an image of him playing god and poof that's it.As for dear Dr.Shaw....well she was killed off in writing off screen and given a 2 minute explanation by David as to why she had to die.So essentially you have the prequel Promethius that starts something only for Covenant to come along and wipe everything out and essentially start again leaving you with just a messy confused direction the films seem to be heading in.Yes there seems to be the whole god and creation underlying theme but unless you are deeply into religion then are you going to care that much about that sub plot. David will probably at some point time travel back in time and become God to primitive earthlings while creating them in the process; its that ridiculous a plot you might just see it somewhere along the road in this new movie franchise.Right now the franchise is floundering because it just doesn't seem to know where it wants to go and if there is an overall aim to the story line it is taking a very strange course to get to where it is going.,Alien - Covenant

628,alexandregatineau,"Why Ridley, why...",2,30 January 2018,"You're looking at an alien movie with a 6.5 rating on imdb: you know something's wrong.This was the movie to save the questionable choices of Prometheus. And they failed, all that could go wrong went wrong.The cast is forgettable at best, I get it it's an horror sci-fi movie, people are going to die so don't bother with them but still. I don't even remember a single character name. The engineers, ah finally! Answers! Nope, Fassbender wipes an entire civilization (of super advanced aliens who might have created the human kind) with an airstrike. They seemed defenseless, weak and expandable. No answers, they're dead.Something I liked was the ear contamination thing and the quite cool birth of the first alien hybrid in the ship. The scene was well done, gross, stressful... I'll give you that. After that, the movies goes downward. For instance, David said he created the perfect creature talking about the whole egg, facehugger and alien thing. No, no you didn't. The ear spore infection was way more effective and the alien that came out was pretty fast and dangerous! Not going to list all the bad things but it's basically a horror movie. A bland, empty horror movie, where people remove AGAIN their helmets and get in trouble. They have to stick together but they freak out, blow their ship and of course, split in a dark scary place. If I'm not mistaken, one chick goes to take a shower after they all almost died and they're surrounded by dead engineers.I could make a more intellectual review, about the acting, the music, the visuals (pretty cool actually) but to be honest it's not worth it. It's a bad horror movie that, like Prometheus, shouldn't be linked to the alien franchise.",Alien - Covenant
629,lazarus-67083,Bad,4,7 October 2018,Truly the worst Aliens film. Pacing and story were completely off. This did not have any suspense whatsoever. You pretty much waited for characters to die off in the predictable fashion. No real characterisation.,Alien - Covenant
630,marius-bancila,It's getting worse with every installment,6,18 July 2018,"I didn't read the reviews before watching the movie but I did not have high expectation. Still, I was disappointed. Scott said he wants to turn this into a franchise and leave the story open, which means it's possible they will not close down the story and end up to where Alien started. And what that means is that they just want to take people to the cinema to make money and deliver mediocre films.Back to this film, where should I start? It has nothing original, nothing thrilling, nothing spectacular to remember. Instead, it reiterates all the SF cliches (the following is a SPOILER list):
big colony ship heading to a distant planetthe crew and other colonists are in a cryogenic sleepan unexpected event wakes them upsome of them die in the eventthey find a planet that looks good and everybody is confidentthey get killed because they are recklesscommunication between teams is brokenpeople are forcibly quarantine along with infested colleagues and diehumans cannot kill the parasite; only the parasite can kill peoplethe bad guy outsmarts everybodyeverybody dies except or a handful that are saved the last momentand so on and so forthThis movie did not answer any questions (how could it be since Scott wants to make at least two more movies) but instead only raised more. It looked like it had almost nothing to do with Prometheus, except for David. It's just a side story in the big picture. We're gonna have more Davids/Walters and more ships in the future. For as long as it still makes some money. For God's sake, HTF did David breed the aliens? Seriously? Oh, and let me guess, there will be some engineers that escaped because they were away (of course, on their planet everybody lives in a single small place, not spread across the entire planet surface). And they will show up in the next film to take some revenge.",Alien - Covenant
631,PokerStar81,Horrendous!!!,1,10 August 2017,"As a big fan of the first 3 Alien films, I have to say that I am ashamed to have wasted money to watch this garbage. I blame myself because I thought Prometheus was boring, but this takes the cake. Aside from a few entertaining scenes of gore, this is without a doubt the worst Alien movie ever made. It was by sheer morbid curiosity that I wasted $20.99 to purchase this on demand because I couldn't sleep, but this movie put me to sleep. There are more interesting things one can do in jail than subject themselves to this god awful film.",Alien - Covenant
632,SteveJ_888,I Was Shocked,4,30 November 2017,"What could have been a decent movie is so horribly flawed by a major defect that it plays like a B movie with big-budget production. Most of the first hour is so laughable that nothing that happens subsequently can save it.The flaw is that behavior of the mission's captain and crew are are completely implausible. On a whim, the original mission is put on hold when a potential new destination for colonization presents itself. Because the planet has a breathable atmosphere the crew lands to investigate it without any concerns whatsoever for possible hazards, biological or otherwise. At that point, I reached for DVD box to double-check. Did Ridley Scott really direct this foolishness? Unbelievable. All I could think was ""Dumb and Dumber"" in space.Even without this fatal defect, the movie is nothing special. With the exception of Michael Fassbender, the acting is weak. The characters are shallow, and unlikable, and there is no thematic development whatsoever. It's just another action movie in space.The movie goes from bad to just plain annoying - particularly the demonization of the creatures as some kind of pathological deviants. Unlike the humans the creatures behave exactly as they are supposed to, according to their design. World-class scientists would have some appreciation for this, even as they try to destroy the aliens.But there is no sense of awe - only cries of ""Let's get this motherf-----."" By the end of the movie I was rooting for the aliens.The usual big-budget production is impressive, but so what? No food for thought. Not even any artful suspense. Too bad.",Alien - Covenant
633,RuthlessGoat,Alien: Covenant totally ruined my life...according to some butt/hurt Fanboys,10,2 June 2017,"There were, of course, some Lingering Questions after Alien: Covenant. More questions will be asked, both before and after Ridley Scott's next installment, but the biggest question I have is ""Why did so many people hate Alien: Covenant and Prometheus so vehemently""? One of the most obvious and common complaints from the Horror genre is the ""Don't do that, STUPID!"" This was especially annoying since the ""stupids"" were scientists and supposedly brilliant.I really enjoyed the movie, it was beautiful and thrilling and I did not suffer from any of the intense butt-hurt of the Alien fanboys and reviewers alike. Sure, neither Prometheus or Alien:Covenant matched the horror of Alien or the delicious action and acting in Aliens, but what does? Compare Alien: Covenant to some of the other trash that has been masquerading as action movies. Comparatively, Prometheus and Alien: Covenant are both virtual masterpieces.The complainers mewled and whined about the broken promises, unanswered questions, Ridley's ambiguity, the horrible writing of Lindelof or O'Bannon, plot holes, and imperfect CGI. Many of the detractors, instead of doing something productive like getting drunk or laid after watching, hunkered down over their keyboards by the hundreds. They emotionally pounded out 1/10 * reviews (Heartbroken and Disappointed :/) to IMDb, with endless numbered lists of the flaws in Alien: Covenant. Boo-Hoo.If you really want something to complain about, re- watch Alien 3.",Alien - Covenant
634,submitme,Disgustingly awful,2,14 October 2017,"This movie is a complete and utter disaster, Prometheus were quite bad, but this movie manages to overdo it, in a negative way. Realism is none existing, crew is bad, acting is worse. Even the visual effects isn't much uplifting, overall a very disappointing watch. Didn't even make it 15 minutes into the movie before I knew it were bad, and you don't think you will make it through. Only by forcing myself to watch it, so I could say I watched it.",Alien - Covenant
635,robbieclaravall,Alien: Covenant has bland characters drifting through grandiose visuals.,6,10 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant follows colony ship Covenant which is bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy. As they arrived in the planet, they noticed a beautiful landscape. At first of what they think is an uncharted paradise, they soon discover that it is actually a dark and dangerous world, rampant with mysterious creatures and a sole inhabitant who has been hiding for years after a doomed explosion.The first few sequences of Alien: Covenant are breathtaking, the movie quickly establishing an ambitious tone with elaborately conceived visuals. That's the best thing about it. The production is as great as it can get. It is a marvelously realized vision. The design of the Alien is also great, both leaving me terrified and fascinated by its beautiful design. The rest of the movie, though, doesn't exactly follow suit. The ambition is still there, and the movie continues to delight with its sci-fi flourishes. The thing is, amidst the grandiose tone and spectacular visuals, the characters end up feeling pretty thin, cardboard cutouts doing what they have to do just for the sake of it. There is quite a huge cast here, and none of them really get any attention. They just feel like bodies waiting to be killed. In addition, some of them are actually dumb for doing what they did throughout the movie. It sometimes doesn't make sense, their actions just a device to hurl the plot forward, making it hard for me to suspend my belief. I also felt the script to be clumsy, not reaching the heights that its visuals have intended it to. The actors weren't anything special except for Fassbender, who gives David both a sinister and a sympathetic outlook. As a sequel to Prometheus and a prequel to Alien, it did its job as it answered some of the questions I had; however, the answers are really vague. It doesn't really provide a huge revelation of what's actually going on, but one can see the connections between the three. I wouldn't call it a ""direct"" prequel and/or sequel, but it's all through the tiny links and loose threads in which they are interconnected. Having said all that, Alien: Covenant is worth seeing for its scale, and for the ambition that's embedded through its spectacle. It is as good-looking as a movie could possibly be at this point, the technology all put towards bringing sci-fi concepts to life. Even the gory sequences are great; they're genuinely terrifying, the movie raising the bar up a notch. Though as stunning as the film is, it might leave audiences a little cold. There's no underdog, the characters all feel thin, and their decisions may question the viewer on why they are there on that specific mission in the first place, given their idiosyncrasy. Alien: Covenant is still worth a look, but it's not so special in its entirety.",Alien - Covenant

As a statement of how the xenomorph came to exist it's cheap and very easy. With predictable ending twists, even more irritating story lines, and it commits the worst mistake a sci-fi movie can make; it's boring.
As a film that follows the mission of the Prometheus to discover mankind's creators, to then completely discard this element of story and go a different way feels disappointing and totally lazy.

638,Jim-499,Inaccuracies,3,13 May 2017,"1. The ship is caught in a ""Neutrino storm"" that causes great damage to the ship. Neutrinos are virtually massless particles that can pass through long, very dense mass without colliding with a single atomic nucleus. In astrophysics class, as an example, the instructor said neutrinos could pass through a lead pipe for the entire length of the Galaxy (100,000 light years) and have no collisions. A neutrino storm would not cause the damage it did to the ship in the movie. 2. The ship continues to hover over the same area on the planet where the away team landed-- first going down to an ""80 km orbit"" then a ""40 km orbit."" Kepler's 3rd law of orbital dynamics (equal area in equal time) states that the closer on orbiting object is to the celestial object it is orbiting, the faster it goes unless a LOT of constant energy is expended. To stay over the same spot, the ship would have to be at the geosynchronous altitude of the planet. On earth this is approximately 19,000 miles. Since the plant was said to be 96% the gravity of the earth, a similar altitude would be required to hover over the same spot on the planet. Of course the inclination would have to be close to zero and the apogee and perigee very close (eccentricity close to zero) and the spot to hover over near the equator in order to to hover over the same spot on the planet but they could have had such orbital parameters on the spacecraft so we can give them a break on this last area.However, I rated the movie 3 out of 10 for other areas I did not like: Plot including an obligatory PC scene that was pointless.",Alien - Covenant

642,gareth242000,such a let down,6,18 May 2017,"So fed up after watching this last instalment of one of my favourite franchises. Even though there has been a couple of let downs, and one terrible movie (Alien 4) i still held hope that we were getting back on track.The first 30-45 minutes were absolutely fine. nothing special but a simple search and rescue film, similar to Aliens. The middle was rushed so badly it suffers from a real lack of story, timing, and as so often in modern films, including sadly sci-fi and horrors it just bored me after that midpoint. Why oh why does someone like Ridley Scott continue his downward slide into mediocre action movies. Why, also does he seem hell bent on flexing his ego by trying to over-complicate something so simple it doesn't need it. Alien, a perfect horror film. Tense and to the point with enough story but not so you felt you were being taught some sci-fi facts. Aliens, simple search and rescue and excellently effective. Aliens 3, better than some suggest but still i big letdown (both the cut and uncut films). Alien 4...crap!!!!! For me it then picks up gradually but now sadly i have lost all hope.The film should have been called robot or droid, because that is all that it seemed it was about. The fxxking droid! You do the right thing and put less well known actors in it which is great in horrors particularly as your never sure who is going to die first. The you put droid man in it, whose a huge movie star and hey presto, its all very predictable again!Two scenes in which i lost all faith and never regained hope...the droid fight and the drop ship fight, both right out of a Hollywood film for young adults, not so different from transformers and the like....DREADFUL!!!! Ridley please don't touch another alien film. Go and sit enjoying your endless wealth, but quit ruining films",Alien - Covenant
643,derekprice1974,Completely underwhelming and disappointing,5,18 May 2017,"I'm not sure where to begin. I'll talk about the acting, plot, pacing, and overall feel.The acting is plan horrible. Other than Fassbender, I would describe the acting as ""emotionally hollow."" It seemed like everyone was just running the lines as opposed to emoting them. I had no connection to any of the characters, and usually, I do. Think about how you are engaged with Ripley, and she commands your attention. You don't have any of that with this film.The plot suffers from a serious identity crisis. Is this Alien? Is this Aliens? Is this Predator? Is this Aliens vs. Predator? You can see so many references (rehashings?) of other films that it just seems like one endless set of slightly connected scenes. And, seriously, I think a 3rd-grader could predict everything that was about to happen. Absolutely no originality!The pacing of the film is somewhat steady, but way too long. This film takes itself way too seriously and tries to be ""artsy,' but it falls flat. For such a build-up of ""Run,"" on the posters and the trailer, it tries too hard to be dramatic. Did Fassbender's agent require these scenes to get him back in the project? I don't know, but about 40 minutes before the end of the movie I started wanting the film to just end because I knew they would neatly sew things up just to end it, and they did.The overall feel of the film is ""Let's put out a crap film with a recognizable brand to see how much money we can make."" Fans of the Alien franchise will view this once. It is the ROGUE:One of the Alien franchise---view once, and never watch again. This is a direct sequel to ""Prometheus,"" and supposedly the second film in a prequel trilogy where the third film will completely bridge the gap to the first ""Alien."" I will see the third, if made, but if it is more of the same, then it is time for Ridley to let this baby go off into deep space and not come back. I hate to say it, but I have serious concerns now for the upcoming ""Blade Runner,"" sequel!",Alien - Covenant
644,ViktorDrake,Where no idiot has gone before.....apart from in Prometheus of course!,2,15 May 2017,"So once again, after the debacle of Prometheus, Ridley Scott has proved himself simultaneously a master of visuals and yet utterly incompetent when it comes to creating a believable Alien story.The single biggest problem I had with Prometheus was the collection of imbeciles and weirdos that made up the crew, and one might have hoped that Mr Scott would have realised that himself and made amends this time round. Errr.... no, sadly not. Once again we're treated to a crew of simpletons who make THE MOST pathetic and unbelievable decisions possible. Are we really supposed to believe that a crew would just ditch it's primary mission (that we're told had been over 10 years in the planning to ensure their destination was safe, etc) just because they happened to stumble on a new planet purely by chance? Just plain ludicrous. And that's just the start. A few more examples :Assuming we suspend our disbelief and accept the whole ""let's risk all the colonists and everything we have planned for decades for to land on this new unknown planet instead"" premise, why do these alleged scientists once again TOTALLY disregard the need for any protective clothing? So no breathing equipment, nothing at all to protect them from any alien pathogens. Good thinking!Faced with a choice of sending either an android, or pretty much the entire human crew with no protective gear, to investigate an alien world, who should go? Yeah that's right, send all the unprotected humans!Choice of landing right near the source of the unknown signal, or land several miles away and in a foot of water despite there being solid and flat ground a few feet away? Yep, it's wet feet and a huge hike all round folks!Little alien pods on this alien world puffing their alien spores into the air? Sure, just get your nose in there and have a good sniff. I'm sure it'll be fine!Crewmen get infected by said spores? Don't worry about any quarantine procedures, just carry them back to the ship while getting covered in their vomited-up blood.Alien organism just burst out of said infected crewman? Just open up the locked door and try to shoot it, but be careful you don't miss at point blank range and then slip up on the blood.... twice. (When that happened, people actually laughed in the cinema. I was half expecting a comedy sound effect the second time!)Tens of thousands of dead bodies, and an enormous dead city solely inhabited by David the android from the Prometheus mission, that the planetary scan managed to NOT pick up from orbit when determining the planet to be ""safe""? No need to ask David what happened, just accept that it's all fine.Dark basements to go into all on your own? Do it! Nothing bad will happen.Huge alien eggs opening in front of you? Just have a good look inside. What could possibly go wrong?!The list of stupid decisions just goes on and on AND ON!While visually the film is generally excellent, the all-CGI-Alien was a huge let-down. Personally I found it considerably less convincing than the practical effects used in Alien and Aliens, which is unforgivable considering the creature is what these films are all about!Additionally the crew, apart from being imbeciles (as is usual under Mr Scott's direction these days), are also completely forgettable. I saw this movie last night and I can't remember a single character's name today. The one exception is David/Walter, and once again Fassbender does a great job. (Perhaps that's why there's two of them - to make up for a lack of any other decent characters).The other problem narrative-wise is that both Prometheus and Covenant have actually served to make the Alien universe much SMALLER in my opinion. In the original Alien and Aliens, the creature was just an unknown organism from the far reaches of the universe, and all the more scary because of it. (The same went for the Space Jockey for that matter). But these new movies have tried to tie it all back to humanity in some way - i.e. the Engineers (who are also the Space Jockeys) created both humanity and the black oil virus, and then the Xenomorph was apparently created by David (who was in turn created by man) somehow doing some genetic tinkering with the black oil and human DNA, while living in a cave and playing with his flute. Far from expanding the Alien universe, both these prequels have actually shrunk it by making man the centre of everything, while at the same time managing to sanitise and neuter one of the greatest movie creatures of all time. So what Ridley Scott is saying is that the entire Alien series and the iconic Xenomorph itself was just created by a deranged android with God/daddy issues. How very pathetic and disappointing. I personally hate it when movies try to explain everything to the millionth degree because it invariably ends up as a massive anticlimax. What was wrong with the Xenomorph just being some hideous unknown life-form from the far reaches of space???I could go on and on, but there's a word limit here.Lastly, the end is just pretty feeble and anticlimactic. The CG- Alien just kind of gets killed and that's it. And the *ahem* ""twist"" with David/Walter could be seen from a mile away, although David wouldn't have had anywhere near enough time to cut his own arm off and change his clothes and hairstyle.Please PLEASE Mr Scott, stand aside and let Neill Blomkamp have his shot at an Aliens sequel.A generous 2 Stars. One for the visuals that are once again gorgeous, and one for a great effort from Fassbender.",Alien - Covenant
645,zhdcndmr,An unbelievably unsatisfying conclusion to Prometheus but still OK as an classic Alien movi,6,8 August 2017,"When I went into the cinema, I was happy and excited. Excited because I was finally going to see what the Engineers and life on earth, that was the main topic in Prometheus, would be explained. To my dismay, it didn't explain anything. What might count as a conclusion to the Prometheus story in Covenant is nothing more then mere minutes, nothing about who the engineers are, what they are, what they do, how their society functions, nothing at all. Just some ""flash-back"" story the Android tells when he came to the engineer planet. Even though it could go into the category of being a decent Alien sequel the fact that i left the cinema utterly frustrated was that it was merely a conclusion, it was just another boring Alien sequel/Horror movie that only showed the classical idiotic decisions made one after the other as in any other horror movie. Just to get the story go along of course, because if anyone in this movie acted as they were portrayed which is an Elite Space Travelling group especially trained for years and years and years for a special multi trillion colonizing attempt they wouldn't make any of the idiotic decisions that makes you want to yell at the screen in pure frustration. All in all, don't go watch this movie expecting a good explanation and conclusion to the Prometheus story and the Engineers history. You wont get anything like that, instead, you will just get another Alien movie with a very boring revelations to how the Xenomorphs where created (and guess what, it literally had nothing to do with the Engineers)",Alien - Covenant

On one end, if you never saw any Alien movies before and stumbled into this movie you could think this is a phenomenal movie. On the other end, seeing all the Alien movies you might think that this was trying too hard to be like the first Alien movie while also trying to answer questions from Prometheus. I was sandwiched right in between in that I found this an enjoyable sci-fy movie but nothing I hadn't seen before.I really liked the Aliens because they were CGI and creepy crawled everywhere in ways that they couldn't in the prior movies, but at the same time I liked that you never saw the Alien fully in prior films. There were always shadows that made things much scarier. The locations here were very cool as well ranging from the classic cramped in space to a cool planet. Michael Fassbender did a wonderful job playing a robot and I really was impressed with Danny McBride's performance as a typical Danny McBride character but with more heart. Guy Pierce was also able to make some money from this movie as a five minute cameo at the beginning of the film. Other than that, there was no real stand out in terms of performances. Everyone played the freaked out astronaut really well.I think what would have made this movie better would have been if there had been more creatures. I'm talking about TONS of creatures. I think it would have been cool if there had been a creature on the spaceship right at the beginning of the movie and they have to figure out how to survive as a swamp creature chases them. This could be played by Stellan Skarsgard just like he played Bill Turner in Pirates. In fact, he could just be wearing the exact same get up except more swampy, and he just roams around the ship trying to kill everyone and gets everything all swampy and misty.Then they decide to land on a random planet and they fight the Alien monsters just like normal, but there are also Predators on the planet as well. They have been engaged in an all out war against the Aliens for a long time at this point and the astronauts have to decide which side to take. The Aliens are spooky and evil, and the Predators are also spooky and evil but there is a long back and forth where they side with the Aliens but it turns out that they double crossed then and sided with the Predators instead and once the battle is over there is a very VERY shaky alliance with the Predators and they are allowed to leave the planet, but as they are leaving the camera pans to one Alien that is still alive and is very VERY angry. At that point they escape and it turns out the Alien was on the ship all along but there are also other monsters on the ship as well that one of the crew had been collecting in secret and they have all escaped. This third part of the movie would play out kind of like Fantastic Beasts mixed with Hotel Transylvania but ten times scarier. The movie would then end with all the monsters and crew being destroyed as the ship careens out of orbit or something and the last living person is on an escape pod but as they are floating away you realized they are possessed by an ancient ghost with unspeakable power.I think if that was the movie it would have been better, but it was still enjoyable. If you like the other Alien movies then go see this one. If you like gruesome deaths and spooky spaceships, then this will feed you. If you like monster mash movies like Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein (which also has many of the other Universal monsters), then you may be disappointing at this film as it is just Aliens.",Alien - Covenant
648,kindersurprise1000,Run!,8,19 September 2017,"I was very pleased with the direction the movie has taken me. Ridley Scott is a visionary director. The movie is very well made, it's beautiful, dark, sinister and entertaining. It takes place after Prometheus and before the original Alien. There are a lot of xenomorph creatures in this movie, which makes it very dark and scary. Don't mind all the negative reviews. This movie is a great addition to the Alien universe.",Alien - Covenant
649,LessThanPaddy,Makes Prometheus better by default.,6,18 May 2017,"Well, it certainly makes many apologies for Prometheus and fits it better into the franchise's universe... but I'm not convinced that this saves it from the glaring mediocrity that covers almost all of the film. No, this isn't the worst film of the franchise but it's far from the best... but that's just stating the obvious.Not all aspects of this film are bad, but the parts that aren't I feel like I've seen before in the original series, i.e. the good films. Maybe these consistencies were the point? If so poor execution. The fight on the spaceship at the end is just a rehash of the original Alien and Aliens film. Once again maybe this is intentional, if so I can't understand why, rehashing beloved scenes never goes down well with fan bases that want to see something new. In this film I thought I would see something new and I didn't...Fassbender absolutely solely powers this movie too in terms of character development, I really appreciate his part in it but the others not so much, we barely get to know most of them before they've almost all let themselves die (sometimes without the alien's help). Minus him, we see no character development... seems familiar? *cough cough Prometheus*... Some of the visuals are good, it's clearly filmed in a beautiful part of the world but this doesn't save it, nor do some of the other messes. I knew that the Alien wouldn't be able to escape the CGI trap, that was clear even before the trailer was released but it doesn't mean it's not worth complaining about. I preferred it when the Alien relied on stealth primarily as a way of hunting, it made things more tense, but with CGI overkill in place the creature can just do whatever the hell it wants at next to no cost.After writing this review I feel like the negatives outweigh the positives, I was in two minds before I started typing but now I'm less convinced about how this film holds up. It isn't as bad as say, AVP2... but that's hardly a compliment. It kept me relatively entertained, but it is not worthy of the franchise, it probably wouldn't attract so much hate if it was a separate film about a separate alien in a separate universe, lumping it in this universe just drives more disillusioned fans away.",Alien - Covenant

They quickly regret their decision, however, when coming face to face with an alien threat.Oh god, where do I start? Unfortunately there's no way to sugar coat things so I'll just be straight with you guys. Alien: Covenant was a huge disappointment. While I can respect Ridley Scott's attempt at tying together Prometheus and the original Alien film, sadly his direction fell flatter than an old stale pancake at your local family restaurant. But what really takes the cake is the severe lack of character logic throughout. This makes a lot of the film's situations feel so forced that most of the outcomes feel way too predictable to get any genuine shock value out of them. This pretty much kills the higher quantity of sheer tension you'd hope to experience, which is pretty disappointing considering Ridley Scott directed this series' near-perfect original, Alien, back in the late '70s.Alien: Covenant's only saving grace, or what you could call slightly redeeming qualities, are the beautiful locations, sets, cinematography, and clearly talented performances. But that isn't saying much since the most of the actors are barely given enough screen time to allow for any real character development before they're killed off. This makes them highly disposable and hard to connect with or really care for. Don't even get me started on James Franco's wasted potential and the missing prologue scenes that should have been included to strengthen the plot. Oh well, what can ya do? At least Covenant isn't the worst entry in the franchise, I suppose. Don't get me wrong; there actually were a few really great moments and pleasant surprises. At times I even caught myself getting genuinely excited! Sadly any momentum that built up was quickly obliterated by the film's own lack of intelligence.I don't know how Ridley Scott figured he could convince audiences to buy into this convoluted mess filled with so many plot-holes and an awful computer-generated Xenomorph. Sure, it may have been created using motion capture with a real actor providing a foundation for the alien's movements. But mostly ditching the groundbreaking practical effects that made the alien so iconic was like a pointless attempt at fixing something that was never broken to begin with. This was almost as distracting as Ridley's decision to allow his characters to continuously ignore logical safety protocols. Or simply have them avoid using basic common sense altogether in embarrassingly obvious, potentially catastrophic situations, despite their training. I mean, it's not like they're astronauts with a lot to lose or anything? Let's just say that Alien: Covenant was like a perfect storm of mediocrity that simply couldn't hold the film's structure together and ultimately weakened the franchise's mythology as a whole. Mindless fun? Maybe, but if you were disappointed with Prometheus, you may as well stay far and clear from this one.",Alien - Covenant
658,almanjit25,The Prognosis Is In And It Isn't Good,3,19 May 2017,"Firstly let me get this out of the way. I love Alien. I adore Aliens. I find Alien 3 and Resurrection to be good thrilling films. Prometheus was one of my favorite films of 2012 because it delved deep into the mythology of the Alien-verse. It give us something deeper and mysterious to ponder over. It's like the Silmarillion, it was Ridley Scott attempting his own mythopoeia, taking a new cerebral and darker direction in the fantasy realm.. Alien: Covenant on the other hand is an appalling film. It's a rehash of Alien (1979) except the characters are one-dimensional clichés and absolutely forgettable and bland. Calling them one dimensional would be a compliment, they are far worse. The film is full of contrivances and clichés that want to forcefully elicit emotions. It is so indelicately handled that it will make you want to puke. Back to the characters, they are boring, they have no purpose and their presence is just an excuse for a mind-numbing blood-fest. I didn't care about the characters, their decisions were questionable and I means seriously idiotic, the dialogue was wooden and unlike the other films in the series, there wasn't an urgency for survival. There were too many characters and you just don't get to know any. And since killing them all off is the purpose of the film and the film is approx. two hours long, they have only a few minutes of wasted screen-time.The story is beyond predictable, laughable even, ridiculous. If you don't see the plot twists coming from a mile away, you weren't paying enough attention or you simply were bored and dozed off, I wouldn't blame you for either because this film is rather dull. Let us not even call them plot twists, they are too stupid and obvious to be called that. Suggesting there is a semblance of a plot is a compliment. There is no story. I feel like there was a creative drought because you've seen all this before. The alien has always been a pop-culture and horror icon. It barely gets screen time in this film and when it does it isn't scary, thrilling, suspenseful or fun. It is just a mindless killing machine that kills quickly and moves on with no terror or sense of dread built in. If I am making comparisons, it feels like the last two Jaws sequels. It's like a B-movie or a tenth rate slasher movie. The alien in this movie is a plot device or better yet, a cameo. The alien was a bore and when the alien who has been a source of dread for decades is a snore, there is a huge problem. It served no purpose, and I reiterate that the actual alien is only on-screen for a few lousy minutes.I loved the world building, imagination, fantasy elements, mythology and mystery of Prometheus. This film throws it all out of the window. It makes me question the point of Prometheus. It completely does away with all the intrigue and though-provoking questions from Prometheus within seconds to get to the cheap gore. It was such a cop-out. They just decided to do away with all the interesting elements.It's just another glossy CG bore fest. If you've watched Alien then this is an awful remake but with very little of the titular alien and none of the suspenseful horror or intelligence. In addition it is rushed to the point of incoherence. A lot about it doesn't make sense. It tries to tie-in with Prometheus in the most silly way after which it does away it's connection to that film by pretending that Prometheus never even happened and it takes on a new and hackneyed direction. I was left with so many questions about how the ending of Prometheus could lead to this mess but I guess the point was to write out Prometheus and go back to well worn sci-fi tropes. Easily one of the biggest disappointments of the year. I left the theater feeling rather upset and let-down.",Alien - Covenant
659,karen-821-938620,It could have been as bad as Prometheus,5,18 October 2017,"The visuals of this movie are pretty good and occasionally the characters are interesting, but mostly this is the sort of film where people have to keep doing stupid things just to move the plot forward. It's exactly like a Star Trek where the two top officers and the ship's doctor go down to an unknown planet without hazmat suits. M class planets are dangerous. I try to avoid contact with unknown pools of water, but they immediately jump into a lake without waders. You see a rover type bot sitting on the ramp of the ship while most of the humans go off to their dooms. For 90 bucks they could have picked up a drone at BJs and gotten a better idea of what they were getting into.The themes of Prometheus are a little better developed, but the whole story of a being disappointed with his creator has been done before. The makers of this film are obviously disappointed with their creator, evolution, which they don't seem to understand. The Fassbinder character does have some charisma, which makes the film much more watchable at the end, but even he is illogical for no reason at key moments. It's hard to give up on the Alien franchise but I'd rather see another Alien vs Predatorthan this pretentious glop.",Alien - Covenant
660,powerofberzerker,Both brilliant and dumb,5,18 February 2019,"* For Alien fans this movie is fine. For casual watchers who view it completely unaware of what was or is going to be, it is kind of great. I know that seems confusing when this is a real in-between film but hear me out on this one. It is truly a jack of all trades, master of none.* It is a solid sci-fi, horror, drama, and action film. But most of all it is David's film. He is struggling of proving his Godly status while becoming more and more human but still being an android. And Michael Fassbender does an incredible job of portraying that. It is strange how this film has so many badly written scenes but almost everything surrounding David is spot on. The pacing of this film and its structuring don't work well. It begins similar to Alien and then Prometheus but after some excitement, it lingers in one place becoming what it was meant to be a character study movie. The third act goes full action and suspense but not in a way you might expect which I kind of liked.* The creatures are all pretty good-looking except at the start where this newly born Neomorph comes out all bloody and slimy but not looking or moving very realistically. The last creature is not used to my liking. It looked very good but it jumped around silly and never felt really formidable. The camera work could have been better.* The movie itself is beautiful as every previous Scott effort. It could have been longer. What I mean by that is before watching it I actually searched google to find the best way to watch this film because I saw these extra trailer scenes that presumably aren't in the film. So, I went through all of them before getting to my main course and I did not like that.",Alien - Covenant

We all realize that coming up with a ""new"" alien movie is a challenge, but why clutter up your successful franchise with such a messy, confusing, and unwanted plot. Does the audience really care WHERE these aliens originated? Do we want to see their gory planet? This movie and Prometheus were valiant but unsuccessful in furnishing us information we could care less about. The recent LIFE movie with Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds got back to the basics and scared the dickens out of us. Ridley, do the same. Get it back to the chase between humans and aliens in a confined environment which is plenty suspenseful without the distractions of sitting through ALIEN ANTHROPOLOGY 101. It's plain old boring. And one more thing: All the alien movies end somehow with an ironic but predictable ""twist"". The audience knows it's coming and smells it a mile away -- namely the aliens, though defeated by humans, will ultimately conquer earth. LIFE with Jake and Ryan was no different. Give us a happy ending please.. we really are angry about seeing so much ugly death and destruction, only to see the battle-worn victors vanquished by the stupid aliens. Just kill the darn things will you please? The human race is already in jeopardy, so give us something different.",Alien - Covenant
664,kingslandbungalow,Thoroughly awful - I see a conspiracy to ruin the original movie.,1,6 July 2017,"If Ridley Scott actually set out to make a movie that would completely destroy all that was good about the original, the combo of Alien Covenant and Prometheus would be it. A crew of idiots and spacetards are woken en route to their new homeworld by a star shart. The spaceship they are on completely falls apart due to this event and apparently the cryogenic sleep chambers have an explosive bbq setting. The idiots detour to a new world they discover thanks to a John Denver song (odds of it being this particular world being trillions to one against) and send most of the crew down without spacesuits or breathing apparatus or common sense. The scan of the planet somehow missed the dead civilization of the engineers from Prometheus - despite being the source of the song. They then get infected (because they are all idiots) and the idiots left on the ship can't get details because their space phones don't work well. The infected crew hatch monsters and the unaffected crew literally fall down twice trying go shoot the monster and blow up the only shuttle because they don't know not to use a high explosive bazooka inside. I imagined Benny Hill music during this scene ... Then the android from Prometheus has the exact same body as the new android (but different from Alien and Aliens) except he grew a mullet. He loves poetry, classical music, and shitty hair cuts. And aliens. Crew proceeds to die by making idiotic choices. The survivors accidentally bring an alien back to the ship with them (never explained). The new Ripley (who has Harry Potters haircut and is always weeping) chases the alien around with zero suspense and kills it. Then (plot twist) the android turns out to be the baddie instead of the other one. There,I just saved you two hours of your life and some sanity. The alien in this movie was all cg and looks really bad, there's something to be said for using models/costumes. The other special effects were OK but doesn't make the movie worth watching. It takes special skill to make a movie this bad. It makes me worry for the Blade Runner reboot - I think Ridley Scott is making sure his legacy turns to poop before he dies.",Alien - Covenant
665,slackline70,Good effort - but the story is collapsing under its own weight,6,6 August 2017,"Covenant is one of those movies you enjoy while your watching it - but realize it wasn't quite as good as you thought it was the minute it's over.The ingredients of a good - even great - movie are all there. The production values are top-notch. The sets and special effects aren't just good - they're works of art. The acting is superb - especially Michael Fassbender's dual performance as two androids who look exactly alike but nonetheless have very distinct identities.And the characters and story - well both are impressive. The characters are believably imperfect. You won't always like them - but you can almost always identify with them. The story is impressive too, in that it attempts to build a complex interweaving mythology between the origin of the Xenomorph aliens and the origin of Man.And therein lies the problem. The more the franchise tries to explain the origin of the Xenomorphs, and especially as it attempts to make a connection between the Xenomorphs and humans, the less intriguing and scary they become. In the original Alien and its immediate sequel Aliens, the Xenomorphs were terrifying and intriguing precisely because they had no backstory - and because they had no previous connection to the human race. Like the shark in the original Jaws, the Xenomorphs from the first two Alien movies were utterly terrifying because it had no personal connection to us. We could at least understand Darth Vader or a Klingon's motivations. A Xenomorph, however, has no more sympathy or connection to us than a spider does to a fly caught in its web.Or at least they didn't. Not until the last couple of movies. While Prometheus and Covenant are a vast improvement over the third and fourth entries, in trying (frankly a little too hard) to explain the origin of Xenomorphs as a second-generation by-product of human intervention, Prometheus and Covenant have failed to recapture the mythos of the first two.It's what made the original Xenomorphs scary. Rather than being a Frankenstein-esque creation of our own doing - they were actually alien.",Alien - Covenant

I mean could it not be possible to make just one of these movies not based and fueled on human errors?
It's like, hey, we are on a mission, and we do know about the alien-threat, but let's go check out a weird signal, and you know what? Let's just send a small team in the middle of a storm to an unknown environment, and when someone gets infected, let us just skip all procedures and what we learned in training and allow them back on the ship. And while we're at it, why not trust the weird android, who has been on the freakin' planet for ten years with the aliens, and who is acting really suspicious AND has a lot of weird stuff in his room. And why not follow the android into a creepy chamber with eggs AND stick your face into one of them?? What could go wrong?!? (Btw, where did David get those eggs? And what was the greyish alien, he tried to friend? Where did come from? When and why did he sacrifice Elizabeth Shaw? Soooo many questions?)
As for the people on the mainship responsible for 2000 colonists, bah let's overwrite the main-computer and go through a major storm to pick up the remaining crew... knowing that something og someone killed the others on ground; infections or aliens, cause that's military procedure?? How stupid are they? And were there really no way of checking if the android, they brought back really was Walther? I know, I would be extremely suspicious, them looking so alike.
Finally, I did not get the motive? So the android is disgruntled, and don't want to be a slave to humans? Weak!
The new Ripley started out really annoying, but she was the only one, who didn't think the new mission was a good idea, so that earns her a star in my book. Also she did not scream as much as Ripley, and that was a plus too.

I can suspend belief for some things but others I can't overlook, the crew were well cast but the writing had some major flaws in much the same vein as Prometheus, highly trained people making incredibly bad decisions. You can argue that under pressure mistakes are made but not school-boy errors, taking an obviously sick and infected man onto your ship with no hint of quarantine being a major one. Having said that, I did think the aliens themselves were well projected and frightening, men-in-suits works better for me than CGI so on this point Scott won. The first two acts were good barring the critical errors, but the final act was telegraphed and obvious, it left me wondering where this great franchise can go to next?

At this point of the series, I've accepted the denizens of the Aliens universe are extremely dim, inconsistent, and prone to getting Darwin Awards anytime on camera, so as we arrive at Alien: Covenant, I can empathize with the dark turn of the plot and that the humans are boringly ill-equipped at making any correct choices for logical survival.

So, before even making any acquaintance, David decides to take them out of their misery, by flushing most of the goo supply upon their heads, turning the valley into some sort of a tar holocaust.It is an original idea, to suggest that a civilization at its peak would become a small filthy scrap yard under a rock, with a few hermits, no signs of technology anywhere, except for interstellar spaceships and ample supply of super-vicious goo stuff, aka bio-super- virus that mutates all life forms into combustible monster breeders.So, after the greeting party, David also kills Shaw, and sets up a lab on this newly found rock, to start developing even more vicious stuff, so on the off-chance someone flies by, he can kill them even in a more elaborate way.I mean, all is making sense up to this point - right? Enough of the spoiler stuff though.----------------------------------------------------------For anyone who expected a logical continuation to the Prometheus, forget it, it is a continuation without any logic.An interesting story cannot be predictable, but there is nothing interesting in a story that simply turns chaotic.They could start and end it with one line - ""basically, everybody dies"", and leave it at that. There is hardly anymore merit to the story, it is dark, vicious and terminal. And it leaves the taste of an over-the-top, vampire movie.For the Sci-Fi genre, it is a failure, as it provides no logical answer to any of the interesting questions raised by the Prometheus.

Love the ancient statues living alongside stunning future technology.
I just wish there'd be more butterflies and green meadows (in order to create contrast and heighten the darks that are already there).It's a well crafted sci-fi movie. Full of winks to the giants of the genre (film and literature). Funny characters included (stereotypes that are subtly criticized). There could be more depth though in the emotional and psychological level of the characters (a great acting hero, maybe?).I'm pretty sure the next one has the potential of becoming a classic.",Alien - Covenant

677,belldave50,Like a mediocre derivative of the best of the previous films,4,19 May 2017,"When I first saw the trailer of this my reaction was that it seemed so similar to Alien or Prometheus that it would have to be damn good to win me over. I didn't hate it but found it lackluster and forgettable. I truly thought that the end of Prometheus signaled the origin of the xenomorph but they scrapped that and made something else that just was too convenient and took away the mystery of the creature. I had felt that it was supposed to be mysterious but it now seems kind of ruined.The characters were like a forgettable rip off of the characters of Alien and somewhat of Aliens. I just didn't get into any of them. Seemed like the same territory was tread with space jockeys in Prometheus and Alien, and done significantly better.They changed several things about the growth and character of the creatures for plot convenience that was simply inconsistent.I don't feel the effects were bad at all like some reviewers have complained about. But some creature parts at the end looked like CGI from a video game.To me it was similar to Spectre in the James Bond franchise. Rehashing what has been done before by the franchise with unnecessary layers of back story we never seemed to have asked for. Just feeling like a retread.I really don't mean to hate on this movie. It's of course Ridley's excellent direction but I just didn't feel anything for this. Love the xenomorph itself though. Still one of the greatest and most menacing creatures of all time.",Alien - Covenant

679,getpablo-80944,A complete and utterly incoherent mess,1,26 September 2017,"Spoilers ahead!!!This is the nail in the coffin for Ridley Scott's Alien Universe, as far as I am concerned. After all these years of believing the Xenos to be genuine alien creatures, Mr Scott has now told us that they were in fact, created by an Android with a God-complex. That's right. The Android from Prometheus, Fassbender's David, actually decided to try his hands at creating a new life form because he got bored. I can't even begin to go beyond this explanation without flying into a rage. The movie is an absolute waste of time. Visually, it sits somewhere in the generic space exploration genre...nothing original or jaw-dropping. Nothing memorable. The characters are so bland and uninteresting, it's hard to know who's who. We are told that some of the crew members are married. With the exception of the Fassbender 2.0 and Daniels (the lady who's husband mercifully burns to death in his pod so he doesn't go through this travesty), it is hard to figure out who is married to whom, and why the entire crew is so stupid that they would walk out onto an alien planet (AGAIN!!) without any form of protection.Don't expect any answers from this pulsating crapfest. As far as I am concerned, the Alien Universe stopped with Alien and Aliens. Pretend this never happened. And by the way, I am really curious as to how, if indeed the Xenos were created by an Android, did they become such feared space-faring creatures that even the Predators hunted them in legends. Scott should retire to an old people's home. Honestly. He has lost it completely. What a waste.",Alien - Covenant

However the bad part of Promotheus was how stupid the characters were. Well this movie has the bad parts of Promotheus and enlarges them. There are a lot of ""Ex Machina"" or stupid moments. The characters have no logical reason to act the way they do and the movie does not bother to explain it, a simple sentence can make the characters change their mind on something. They mention security protocols, only to break them for no good reason a few seconds later. Cinema-sins is going to have a field day with this. As a watcher you see every event coming from a mile away, every plot twist is signaled far in advance. I was not surprised at anything happening on-camera, I was not even jump-scared. I was sitting on the edge of my seat, but this was due to the movie being scary, but rather a feeling like when you are on a boring meeting and cannot wait to leave and do something else. Can't I say anything good? Well, the scenery and photography was great. And what I heard of the music was really good. The acting is not bad, but that does save the movie.",Alien - Covenant

C'MON!!! SHOW US SMART CHARACTERS FOR ONCE DAMN IT!!! AAARGH!!!!! The scriptwriters were either oblivious or obsessed with the TVtropes website because they used every cheesy trope there isPredictable and unoriginal plot Villain has an extremely unimpressive hideout that makes little sense Confusing story lapses (was there stuff cut out?) Whenever the writers run out of dialog, characters are screaming at each other while the camera shakes Engineers in the future forgot how to make shatter-proof glassIf they could fire all the scriptwriters, hire some common-sense advisers, and forbid the director from messing with the story, other (future?) movies in this franchise could have a decent chance to redeem themselves.

685,RaoulGonzo,"Maybe they should stop here, before tarnishing the original!",5,14 May 2017,"The alien movies over the years have mutated manifold from straight up horror to a full on war/action flick then to a mixed backstory starting in alien 3 which was interesting but a massive failure. Prometheus visually stunning as it was was let down by an awful script an dialog in particular.Where do we come from? Why are we here? Themes from Prometheus continue in the very first 5 minutes before the credits have even rolled. It continues to beat you over the head with its backstory which, for me makes no sense whatsoever. Some of the dialog references other master horror works such as Frankenstein but does so in a way that it's up its own arse. Forgetting what alien actually was in the first place, a coincidence that was never about back story. Characters explain the plot in basil exposition speaking like no one ever would - speaking their thoughts at every opportunity - yes we get it, it treats the audience poorly.What I did like was the scene shown much in the trailer, a character trapped in concealed room as something happens to her colleague. It was a longer scene that was tense and exciting and I oh so wish the rest of the movie could have come close. In a strange way alien covenant takes iconic moments from the franchise and tacks them on here but makes me wish I was watching alien or aliens instead. It's technically good as always Ridley Scott is a visionary filmmaker, but is unable to turn a weak script into a good film.Alien:covenant gets locked up in its own self importance while forgetting why we loved alien in the first place.

And that is very sad to say that I prefer that ""origin"" story to this failure. How many times is the chick going to survive in Alien movies it's kinda overdone. Danny McBride's character just didn't work for me. They make every stupid decision known to man which makes no sense they're suppose to be really smart scientists.

Don't try to eat popcorn or anything while watching this; it's nasty. There are no good characters and no plot. It's the equivalent of watching a movie about someone with a horrible disease....and watching the last stages as the disease fills their whole body....and seeing up- close views of it.

690,gce2308,"Yep, it's pretty bad.",3,22 July 2017,"Alien should have stopped at Aliens - absolutely and without a doubt. However, for all of us here who are totally bagging this movie, Ridley Scott has simply served up what he knows full well the majority of the movie-going public wants. By that I mean what millions of people world-wide, who do NOT take things as seriously (or dare I say pompously) as us critics here want. And it's what they have always wanted - and always will want - cheap thrills. It puts bums on seats. Not to mention a ka-ching in the likes of Sir Ridley's and the movie studio's pockets. A:C supplies those cheap thrills by the bucket load. Lots of frantic action, lots of noise, a reasonable dollop of fear and tension, plenty of jump scares, lots and lots and lots of blood and gore. And a nude couple shower scene (really?why?), and 2 android men kissing (wtf??why???) added in just for good measure and purely to titillate. There are millions of dumb-asses in the movie-going world that totally love all that stuff. Because they don't go to the movies to think or make sense of anything, they really don't WANT to think too deeply about, well - anything really! It's called escapism. And A:C is just right for those folks. Therefore it's pretty safe to say millions of people would have loved it more than those of us who hated it, although I do note the haters outnumber the lovers by almost half the reviews here as at current date. I've forgotten pretty much everything about the stupid thing now, except being amused at how useless those green laser light ""torches"" were - for some reason that is the only thing that has remained stuck in my memory. I mean when you're stumbling around in dark, scary places with slimy black alien things wanting to pounce and rip your head off you'd want a fairly decent Zebralight SC600 Mk III to see them coming at least, surely.Anyhow - just because of Blade Runner and Alien and Gladiator and Thelma and Louise - I, for one, will forgive you for A:C, Sir Ridley.",Alien - Covenant
691,hugues-talbot,Almost a remake of the original Alien,6,5 October 2021,"That film is not as bad as the 1-star reviews make it. Of course the plot is kind of weak and full of holes, but to be honest the original Alien did not make much sense either. What it did bring to the party was a new aesthetic for a SF-horror movie.Here, so many elements in the films are like the first of the franchise. A ship in space is diverted from its course, a party lands on the planet, encounters an aggressive life form, hell ensues. As an Alien film, it is very close to being a remake but does explain in a weird way some of the element of how the aliens were designed. Since it does not make much sense, we do not care.As an action-SF-horror movie, the film works quite well, most of the characters are killed in effective scenes that are very similar to the first Alien.It is not very fresh though. The original Alien was clunky and imperfect but it was novel, visually appealing and very scary. This one works mostly if the viewers do not ask for much coherency or even common sense (landing on an alien planet and exploring with no protection whatsoever?) and feels basically like a cheap horror bloodbath. A couple of good scenes can't save it.I enjoyed some of it but I think Mr Scott should stop making these expensive movies. Studios should let someone else express their own vision.

693,luismd-50284,A movie that delves deeper into the subject of creation.,10,2 June 2019,"This movie actually confirms the fact that the Engineers created humans, the Humans created the Androids, and the Androids created the Xenomorphs. Within the Alien universe, I really like this idea, its irony, and all this full circle touch to it. Which is the greatest of the creations? Which one is the most destructive? Can a creation surpass its creator? What does it really mean to be human? Do we think of the moral and ethical implications that our creations might pose? This is a movie that talks about the need and eagerness of a creator to create something that is greater than them. That can transcend their limits, their flaws, their limitations, their body, their life itself. That can give their life some purpose. That's what we humans do with robots and androids and cyborgs and bionics (and, ultimately, with all the religious Gods we created before we even learnt how to write). That's what David the android wanted to do with the Xenomorphs: to create a perfect organism that transcended his soulless life, so he could too become a God (is quoting of Ozymandias and his ""Entry of the Gods into Valhalla"" scene are just chilling), not a mere product created by an undeserving human God (there's more to the movie prologue than meets the eye). The last piece of the puzzle, which I hope we'll get to know, is why the Engineers created humans. I suspect the answer will be the same: the egocentric nature of all thinking creatures, their endless need to see themselves as Gods, and also their never-ending search for purpose to their lives.I actually believe Alien Covenant tied up all these ideas brilliantly and magnificently (and, by doing so, tied too all Alien movies very well). It's a modern day piece of Philosophy. In fact, it surprised me that Covenant tried to make people think about such themes, which is something movies rarely do these days. I can only interpret that the backlash it got comes from the fact that the mass culture audience is incapable of understanding what it really tries and wants to convey. It you want a movie where everything is spoon fed to you, then avoid watching Covenant.",Alien - Covenant

There was no plot twist I didn't see coming a mile away. There is nothing new here. It used all the old clinches. Understand, I never saw ""Prometheus"" (2012). So I didn't know who was evil or not or how that film turned out. But even I was able to figure out who was evil or not well before his villainy was revealed. But when the word Prometheus was said in the film, there was a huge groan from the audience and someone said that's David, the evil robot. That was when I had realized that this just a connector movie between the first Alien movie to Prometheus. That was when my expectations just sank well down because connector movies are seldom good or have anything new. They just connect from point a to point b. Ridley Scott did an excellent job in directing and creating the world, but there is only so much one can do with a bad script. My advice is to save your money and skip this one.

696,The-MacMahonian,Loving the Alien,8,5 July 2020,"There are 3 types of sequels/prequel/remakes: those which seek to bank on the success of a given film and reproduce it, with fair to dismal results. That´s about 80%. Example: Cat People (Paul Schrader/Jacques Tourneur, 1982/1942); those which dig out some obscurity and spin it to greatness, or at least interest. That´s about another 19%. Example: The Fly (David Cronenberg/Kurt Newmann 1986/1958). And finally those which take an icon of popular culture and remake/remodel it to match or even top. In the approximative MacMahonian arithmetic, that's seldom. Example: Alien Covenant (Attentive readers please appreciate I abstained from mentioning Howard Hawks).Alien Covenant is the 24th feature film directed by Ridley Scott, who is currently probably elated in jubilee and apogee, as the film under review and Blade Runner 2049, of which more on this pages soon, attest.Alien Covenant, as franchise fans will know, is a sequel to Prometheus (Ridley Scott, 2012) which in turn is a prequel to the original Alien (Ridley Scott, 1979). It reinstates without dramatic novelty but renewed effectiveness and tension the cat and mouse war between the as ever unnamed predator/incubator/parasite and man, or as often in the series, woman, Katherine Waterston close to par as Danny, precursor/successor of Sigourney Weaver´s Ripley, and Michael Fassbender unsurpassed as David 8/Walter 1, ditto of Ian Holm´s original Ash, Fassbender joining Henry Fonda in the very short list of actors who is as good as good guy as as steely-eyed bad guy.The first Alien was an early classic of the current age of SciFi film, which The MacMahonian postulates started in 1977 with Star Wars (George Lucas) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Steven Spielberg), brought forth by the emergence of post-modernist New Hollywood and the quantum leap in FX enacted singlehandedly by Industrial Light and Magic. Alien came at the height of the FX euphoria, then a novelty, and shares with Star Wars, beside the prequel-sequel mishmash, the characteristic of having had several installments penned by directors departing from the style and vision of the original authors - in this regard Alien´s track record (James Cameron, David Fincher) being more illustrious than Star Wars´ (only JJ Abrams can compare with those two) - to finally return to the origins, in true wheel of life form.Seldom in recent times has viewing been so gripping as Alien Covenant affords. So much more remarkable as Ridley Scott dared to revisit his two most iconic films some 4 decades later in one single go and make a tour de force of both.",Alien - Covenant
697,noloxtreme,I David,8,19 May 2017,"First of all I loved the movie. But not because of the movie's own merit per say, I just love science fiction and I enjoy almost every science fiction movie I see. Really , other reviewers have raised valid criticisms about the film, about certain things that didn't make sense. So I will try to not rehash those in my list of questions/spoilers below.1. How did Elizabeth Shaw, a paleontologist and archaeologist know how to fix an android? One would suppose you would require an expert in robotics.2. Where did she find the equipment in the Engineer space ship to repair an android constructed with human technology.3. Are the engineers so trusting that you can just fly any space ship that can carry biological weapons and fly it over one of their cities? If you ask me they were just asking to be wiped out.4. After killing the engineers why did David than go and crash the space ship in some mountain outside the city?5. Despite the movies constant theme about how androids are immortal and humans are not, that statement is not true. We humans die because we break down, our body stops replacing the cells properly in time, and any machine also requires perpetual maintenance, so David is not really immortal, as long as he is being maintained he will continue to operate. Even so, one suspects at some point he would have to fill up his memory because he is finite, so perhaps in that case he could simply delete old files, but androids would hardly be gods. With that being said. How did David maintain himself in a strange planet with no spare parts for 10 years?6. Why did Elizabeth Shaw, not just fly home back to earth instead of going in search of the home planet of the aliens? Surely that is infinitely better than going to visit hostile alien species.7. Why did Weyland not build the 3 robotic laws into his androids as suggested by Isaac Asimov?8. Finally why did the crew members not wake up a few colonists as their numbers were dwindling to help out?I have a lot more questions, but this is a movie, I must suspend some disbelief to enjoy it.",Alien - Covenant
698,SomeUselessGeek,Scott used to make films; now he makes trash,1,21 August 2017,"What a complete and total waste of my time. There are some flicks which are bad but are still worth watching again in leisure time because of some particularly good dialog, or scenery, or camera work, or music, or action scene, or whatever. This film is an exception even to that -- there's nothing here I want to bother seeing again.The story is a rehash of everything we've already seen multiple times. It is at times dragging like an anchor and at times jumping through multiple hoops in a single leap. The characters are supposed to know each other well long before the story starts, but you can't see that from their interaction; just a false chumminess that stands in for any real connection established on screen. All of the predictably stupid things done by all the previous movie characters are done here. The multiple monster vectors are all over the place in this flick as in some previous Alien movies, so there's no consistency anywhere.Same for the monsters attacking our heroes. At least you could predict what was going to happen in the first couple Alien films, but here there is no correlation between monster attacks and anything else. It's not a plot mechanism; it simply makes no sense.Contrast that with the very predictable ""surprises"" contained in the story. Are you kidding me?!? This stuff is telegraphed miles away and is as clear as day long before any treachery is discovered. Oy. I know this isn't a murder mystery, but you'd at least expect some attempt to hide what was going to happen. Agatha Christie rolls over in her grave.So, a rehash of everything that's come before. No new developments. No new scenery. No new lasting characters. No new cinematography. No new action scenes. Nothing new at all, and everything poorly presented.What a bucket of puke.",Alien - Covenant
699,archaeotypetw,Such High Hopes after Prometheus,5,21 January 2018,"Ridley Scott has gotten into the habit of killing off key characters between films. He did it to Newt and Corporal Hicks in Aliens, and now he's done it to Dr. Shaw from Prometheus.Alien: Covenant could have been such a good movie. I really liked Prometheus and I thought Covenant would answer a whole bunch of decades old questions like where did the Aliens come from. In a sense, Covenant does answer those questions, but it's a shame that it's not a very good movie.Shouldn't be surprised though - the Alien series has been very up and down. A few of the movies have been great, but some have been real dogs. I wouldn't call Covenant a dog, but it's a close all.At the end of Prometheus, Shaw and David's head take off in one of the Mesomorphic Aliens' ships to go find out where they came from. In Covenant, a Colonization vessel picks up a stray transmission (where have we seen that before?). The signal originates on an uncharted planet that's suitable for human settlement and it's only a matter days off their course.The captain decides to send down a landing party. Of course, the transmission was from Shaw.After they land, the landing party finds evidence that someone was there before them and of course all hell breaks loose. Turns out, that this is the home planet of the Mesomorphic aliens and David and Dr. Shaw made it there safely.David has been a very naughty robot. He actually used Dr. Shaw in his own perverse experiments to create the perfect alien predator. He also destroyed the entire native population of the alien world. Even David's new and improved brother Walter, who's travelling with the colonists, can't stop him. Scott doesn't bother to explain how Shaw was able to fix David when his head was completely torn from his body. At least we find out where the Aliens came from though.One by one the crew members from the Covenant are wiped out. Even Walter is apparently destroyed by David although we don't know for sure that he's dead. Maybe he'll chase down David in the next installment.I figured out that David was impersonating Walter with 10 minutes left in the movie. At the end, David, still pretending to be Walter, tucks the one surviving crew member into her hibernation pod. Just before she drifts off into cryo sleep, she (can't even remember her name, that's how memorable the characters are) realizes that David has control over the ship, her, and the 2000+ colonists. The nightmare has begun.While Alien Covenant does answer a few questions, it's a really disappointing movie.",Alien - Covenant

This is an interesting idea that fits into the general alien-franchise. Then there is the bad movie of the inner storyline: A bunch of morons risk 2,000 lives aboard a colony ship when they take a detour to an alien-infested planet, because they ""are afraid of"" reentering cryo-stasis for the remaining flight to their initial target. Bad decision, indeed. So, if in the future intelligence will still be normally distributed: Please send the idiots into stasis and put some of the normal people in command of the ship.

701,sheridan-turner,Disappointing......same ol fan treatment....alienating us that is.,5,21 May 2017,"*No spoilers.....but some strong hints**The single most disappointing thing about this film is very familiar indeed.They spent the entire Prometheus film building the lead character. They made her strong and resourceful, much like Ripley. Then in Alien covenant, it was almost like all of that effort meant nothing at all.At the end of Prometheus, I think we were promised a face-off or confrontation between Shaw and the Engineers?! Does anyone disagree??Alien covenant pretty much ignored and disregarded Prometheus, and just dumped it like a bad habit. The movie was well put together, and great action and effects. I simply did not like the direction of the film, and how little we learned of the Engineers, which is why Shaw wanted to go there. I personally could not wait to see the story arc continued and see how Shaw would interact on the Engineers planet.What a rip off.Reminds me of Alien 3, when Hicks and Newt were just so easily discarded, after all that character building and bonding.The film industry has no regard for fan connections to characters.The movie was good. Awesome even.....just not really the sequel to Prometheus that was expected! If I never saw Prometheus, this would have been better.",Alien - Covenant
702,mitchellfsledge,So very strange,5,20 May 2017,"If you have high hopes for this movie you will be massively disappointed.Didn't feel like in alien movie at all. I remember watching Prometheus and like it and new that there was going to be a second movie. Alien Covenant is really really bad. The actors did a horrible job throughout the movie. The action parts of the movie are just OK. The whole movie feels rushed and there are massive boring parts where the whole movie falls off a cliff. I don't follow what the review critics say because most of the time there wrong but this time they were right. Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection are better than this garbage movie. The only reason I have a 5 is because there were parts that made me jump off my seat. Massive spoiler the good guys loose and that left me empty inside. I would say I hope for another movie but after the trash I just saw I will not ever see another alien movie in theaters. I will wait for DVD. Such a massive disappointment. Good plot horrible story and bad execution. The best part of the movie they skip it and leave you guessing.""",Alien - Covenant
703,skylerisaac,Yikes,3,29 May 2017,"I was excited when I entered the theater. I couldn't wait for Alien:Covenant to begin. Anticipation coursed through my veins as I angrily cursed the existence of the annoying, pre-show BS. When I stood up from my seat and left the theater, I was angry as could be. So what's so bad about the film?First off, it comes with the 'Alien' moniker in the title. As such, it would be fair to assume that it's part of the Alien franchise, right? Well, not so. In fact, it's a direct sequel to Prometheus, and our beloved Xenomorph is nowhere to be seen for almost an hour- and-a- half. The film should've been titled 'Prometheus 2 Feat. Alien and James Franco for some reason'.Yes, James Franco is present here. For about a grand total of 30 seconds. I really don't know why this is, but it's a symptom of a bigger disease that the film suffers from: wasting good actors. Excellent actors such as Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, Demian Bechir and Danny McBride are brought in and given NOTHING to do, as all they do is inhabit shallow husks of what should be actual characters. NONE of the Covenant crew are developed at all, which means that when the developmentally disabled-looking creatures start bursting from people's backs and throats, the result is that I don't care. The graphic and gory visual effects are fun to behold, but lose some of their shock value when the person dying means nothing to the audience. The only one who gets out of this unsullied is Michael Fassbender, whose two characters are given some great, though semi-pretentious, scenes together. As ponderous and interesting as they are, even they aren't safe from some unintentionally hilarious dialogue. (You blow the flute, I'll do the fingering.)What really aggravates me is the fact that Covenant's existence came at the expense of director Neill Blomkamp's proposed Alien film, which would have been a direct sequel to Aliens. It sounded excellent, and now it's never going to happen because Ridley Scott got a bug up his ass about making a new movie in the franchise. But instead of delivering something intelligent and stylish like Prometheus, he gave us a weird, pseudo-sequel to BOTH Prometheus and Alien, threw in several dull horror tropes, uninteresting characters and bad dialogue. The result is an absolute mess, and feels like what it is: two movies awkwardly mashed together.Not even the scenes that actually feature the Xenomorph-proper work very well, as they're completely devoid of tension and horror, instead settling for blood and fire-your-weapon-blindly style action.But it's not all bad. As mentioned previously, the gore-spattered special effects offer a bit of a visceral thrill to an otherwise dull flick. Michael Fassbender's scenes with himself are well-acted and interesting. I love Ridley Scott as a filmmaker. But even I have to admit that he really screwed up with this one. 3/10",Alien - Covenant
704,robertandrews-44556,"The Alien is back, and its origins are finally explained",8,21 September 2017,"I am a HUGE Alien Franchise fan. I have all the movies, collected countless figurines, and sit down and watch the original anthology at least once every year. In 2012, I was over-excited when I finally went to the cinema to see Prometheus, and came out loving it just as much as I loved the Alien anthology. Many people did not like that film. I am usually the odd one out among my Alien franchise friends when I say that I loved Prometheus just as much as the other Alien films in the series. That film seemed new and fresh and I liked how it went in a different direction. I guess when it comes to anything set in the Alien universe, I love, and I am guessing that is why I also came out loving the sequel to Prometheus (the second entry in Ridley Scott's Alien Prequel films) Alien: Covenant.The film is set 10 years after the events of Prometheus. The colony ship Covenant is en-route to a planet in the far galaxy called Origae-6 when a solar flare damages it, killing 40 of the colonists on board and the Captain, Branson (James Franco in a very brief role). Afterwards, the crew land on a remote planet and meet David (Michael Fassbender) the Weyland Corp Synthetic and sole survivor of the USCSS Prometheus mission. Not to give too much away, the crew discover that David has wiped out all life on the planet (the species which appeared to be the Engineers from the previous film) and has been meddling with the black goo from the Engineer planet. It is also revealed that Shaw (Noomi Rapace from Prometheus) is dead, and has been used in a number of David's bizarre experiments to create ""the perfect life form""......that ""perfect"" life form David talks about eventually ends up birthing the very first Xenomorph creature. This, of course with any Alien film, ends up leading to many gory deaths. It is up to Captain Branson's wife, Daniels (Katherine Waterston), to destroy the creature and try to put a stop to David's experiments before things get out of hand....Now, I really enjoyed this film. It is the first Alien film for a long time. True, I loved Prometheus, but you must admit it was very different from traditional Alien films in the franchise. With Covenant,I could not help having a huge smile when the Xenomorph is first born. I also love the Neomorphs in the film (the apparent predecessors to the traditional Xenomorph we all know and love). They reminded me of the ""Newborn"" from Resurrection, which is one of my favourite-looking monsters in the franchise.This film seems to have gotten a lot of hate from my friends. They seem to say the biggest problem with the film is that it is revealed David created the Xenomorphs rather than the Engineers. However, I actually love the fact that David created them. It is ironic when you think about it. David having been created by humanity would go on to create life of his own, the famous ALIENS, who go on to pose a huge threat for humanity in the original films. Thus, in effect, we created David, who created Xenomorphs, and thus HUMANITY is slightly responsible for the creation of the creatures. There is a theory that David was not the original creator of the species, and was merely copying what the Engineers had created long ago. However, I hope this is not true, as I for some reason,just love the fact that David was the one who created them. It is pretty creepy when you think about it. I guess we'll have to wait for the sequel, Alien: Awakening, to find out if David truly was their creator.Some questions that I have tried to counter with my friends about David being their creator, are things such as ""he did not create the REAL Xenos, as the chestburster burst out of Oram (Billy Crudup) too quickly, unlike the original films when it took a few hours at least"". But you must remember, this film is set BEFORE the original films. The Aliens you see here are the first samples of the creatures. David has yet to ""perfect"" them into the ultimate weapon. This is also why the grown Xeno looks different than the original, lacking the bio-mechanical features. Another one is that many hate the fact that David seemed to be the ""Puppet Master"" or ""Android Queen"", as in the film the baby Xeno mimics David, as if David were ""God"". Well....haha.....yes, the Xenos do appear to serve and obey David......FOR NOW! I am guessing that in the next film, we are likely going to see David create too many of these things who turn on him and eventually kill him, and thus leading into the events of the original films. At this point, David is arrogant and thinks he will be able to control what he will create, not knowing just how savage they will be. We all know exactly how savage these things are, David doesn't, and that will likely be his downfall.All in all, I loved this film and am looking forward to the next film. Many other fans of the franchise seem displeased with it unfortunately, but as for me, I love it and and am looking forward to 2019's Alien: Awakening.8/10",Alien - Covenant
705,elpresidente-4,Ridley Scot's directing license should be revoked,2,19 May 2017,"In hindsight, the monumental failure that is this movie should've been obvious, after the ""Prometheus"" fiasco. But movie fans are flawed, they do tend to have hope, in this case very unjustified. All the money thrown in this movie for sets and VFX are ultimately dwarfed by the colossal idiocy of the script. None of criticisms towards ""Prometheus"" were taken into account here. Not a single character was likable. All of them acted like complete morons. The first thing they do when they land on an unknown planet is to jump in the mud and start making mud angels, metaphorically speaking. No suits, no any preliminary analysis, no reconnaissance of any sort. Life on another planet doesn't surprise them at all. Alien civilization on another planet doesn't amaze them even in the slightest. A huge alien spaceship - nothing interesting here. A dog tag from another human being, hmm weird but still not interesting enough. Move along. It's more fun to poke the local unstudied flora with their unprotected face pressed right against it. When someone starts bleeding from all orifices it's best to lead them straight in the ship, what could go wrong. Sure, lock your crew-mate in the room with the spiked zombie. Sure, slip on the bloody floor like in a Marx brothers comedy, twice. Sure, fire at will in the room with the flammable exploding materials. Sure, spread around and stay alone in the creepy temple with no windows and easily climbable walls. It is mind-boggling how stupid these people were. At some point your just start to wonder if anyone will make any sane and logical decision. What the hell happened to mankind in the future - they all have become retards. But the idiocy is not limited to humans. The race of the engineers is wiped in seconds after they gleefully all gather around on a neat giant square to greet the arrival of one of their biological warfare ships with non-responding crew. For creatures that were so susceptible to death from the virus they created, they had a pretty nonchalant attitude towards bio-hazard protocols. To top all the cringe-worthy scenario, this movie had an extremely disappointing ending. People in my cinema were literally cursing and throwing bottles with water around. In conclusion - avoid this nihilistic and misanthropic abomination at any cost. It will only make you angry. The Alien franchise is beyond hope of salvation.",Alien - Covenant
706,simon.conder,Alien...a lien,3,23 July 2017,"When I was 19 I went to see Alien at the Odeon Leicester Square. In fact I persuaded 10 work colleagues to see if with me as I was so excited about what I had read about the film and the limited visuals that I saw in the great but now dead publication Omni. The film dazzled me and still does. H.R. Giger's brilliance was magnified by the production team to create a true and enduring classic. When I was 26 I took my wife of 2 years to see Aliens. One became many with the vile creatures doing their worst but losing to Ellen Ripley in the end. Aliens did what few sequels ever do match or exceed their creator. Aliens built on Alien and I was so captivated that we (with the full approval of my wife) named one of our two daughters Ellen.Then came the plateau of Alien 3 and the inevitable nose dive of ideas and on screen potency. With each passing film they mean less and less to me. Yes some of the planet visuals look fantastic and yes the space ships in space look great but in an inverted manner as Aliens was more than Alien Alien Covenant is less than Prometheus and that is something that I never thought possible. I have asked myself ""is it my age and am I now less prepared to let go and engage with a story and to wind wonder and depth and value in a film"". The answer to that is 100% ""no"". So no it is not my age but I am sure that I know what it is.So here is what I suggest. That the millions of fans globally of Alien and Aliens take ""a lien"" out that prevents Ridley Scott and anyone attached to Prometheus and Covenant ever having any association with any Alien project again ever. To quote Ellen Ripley in Aliens ""you don't see them f@@king each other over for a goddamn percentage"".Prometheus was bad but Covenant is worse because it is crass and lumpen and a pale and distant shadow of the two brilliant films that allowed such a travesty to occur. I watched Covenant once and I don't think that I will ever watch it again.To paraphrase from the end of Alien ""this is me, aged 58 signing off from the Alien franchise. I blew you out of the goddamn airlock and you are dead and lost forever"". When you have lived longer than Ellen Ripley drifted through the core system in hyper-sleep you learn a thing or two. Let's stop this from ever happening again. Let's take a lien over Alien and nuke this franchise from orbit...it's the only way.",Alien - Covenant
707,Samirsbureau,"More of a ""Prometheus"" sequel than an ""Alien"" prequel",7,17 May 2017,"***SPOILER FREE REVIEW***Alien:Covenant is one of the most anticipated movies of the year mainly because its part of the beloved ""Alien"" saga and because of its great director Ridley Scott, but does it really deliver?As a fan of Ridley's Sci-Fi work (The ""Alien"" Saga, Blade Runner and The Martian), I couldn't wait to see this movie and I was almost sure that it's going to blow everyone away. But apparently, after reading most of the user reviews around here, lots of people didn't like it and called it the worst part in the franchise. But anyway, I just watched the movie and here's what I thought:Alien:Covenant takes place 10 years after the event of Prometheus and I highly recommend that you watch it in order to understand everything going around. Prometheus as a movie, divided its audience... Alien Covenant did the same here, it divided them too. The reason behind that is that the movie suffers from a forced attempt to link Prometheus with the Alien franchise, and that alone made the audience feel confused about what the movie wants to be. The result to this connection made the film looks different than the others ""Alien"" films.The problem with the film was that it never felt like an actual alien movie, it focused too much on the unanswered questions that Prometheus left and sometimes totally forgot about the survival-horror factor.However, that doesn't mean it's a bad movie.. After all, I have to say I enjoyed it nonetheless. We get to know more about how the Aliens were created and what happened after Prometheus, I think Ridley wanted to please everyone; the fans of the original Alien and the fans of Prometheus, and what you get here is exactly what happens when you mix both of them, and let's not also forget that Ridley's plan at first was Prometheus 2, later named Alien Covenant.The movie is still worth a watch just for the decent visuals and the great soundtrack and the acting, as for the plot I have to say it's not Ridley's best.DON'T BELIEVE THE 1/10 NOR THE 10/10.In the end I would say that Alien Covenant deserves to be watched at least once specially if you're a die hard fan of the franchise, it's far from being a bad film as everyone's saying, but don't get your expectations too high.",Alien - Covenant
708,Nicknielsen99,Fassbender holds it together,8,20 May 2017,"Now, for those who have rated this title as a 1/10 or even a 10/10, they have no clue what they're talking about, and are instead rating it because of their love for the franchise as a whole. I, myself, am a fan of Scott's Alien franchise, and am a glorified fan of Michael Fassbender. I had preordered my ticket a month in advance, and I was extremely hyped to see the newest installment. With that being said, I was not disappointed, but nor was I blown away. The movie itself is a slow burner, and there are holes within the movie itself, that are indeed noticeable. With that all being said, I think the effects and visual display of the movie were phenomenal, and the overall acting itself was solid. Michael Fassbender literally, though, SAVES this movie. His role in the film is remarkably done, and again, as one who has seen every film of his, this easily notches a top 5 performance on his part. I feel like Ridley bit off a bit more than he could chew with all the interconnecting points, and the supporting cast around Fassbender was indeed lacking. Overall, however, the film was a pleasant experience. Some parts did drag, while others kept me on the edge of my seat, mouth open, and gawking at the screen. I would recommend this movie to those who have followed the franchise through-and-through, and although it isn't nearly the level of the original two, I would put it on that same pedestal as Prometheus. Well done for the most part, and again, if you love Michael Fassbender, this movie is a DEFINITE see. I would give it a 8/10, purely because I didn't once feel connected to any members of the Covenant space crew, aside from Walter(Michael Fassbender), and the overall performances were nothing to write home about. I myself am a HUGE fan of the visually stunning displays in movies, and this didn't disappoint from that retrospect.",Alien - Covenant
709,nimdude,Very divided opinion on whether this movie is good or not,5,18 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant has many good qualities, a few brilliant qualities and quite a few very bad qualities.I'll start with the good qualities.This film fully succeeds in being a horror movie in most cases even though sometimes the movie is tonally unsure if it wants to be an eerie atmospheric sci/fi horror or an action movie. Some scenes in the movie are visually disgusting (which I thoroughly enjoyed) and quite scary, containing a lot of suspense and thrills. The ""chase"" and action scenes have all of the above qualities. The Alien(s) in general are utilized enjoyably.Atmosphere is most of the time achieved quite spectacularly. Particularly in the (no spoilers) first encounters, as well as later stages in the movie where suspense should be the primary focus.*(I will insert some bad qualities into this section later)*Michael Fassbender's character(s) are phenomenally portrayed and he steals the show with each scene. Particularly the ones involving (no spoilers) a flute.And finally, like almost every one of Scott's movies, the film is beautiful.Now the bad qualities *(Continuing the suspense topic as well as the tonal confusion)* In the parts where the movie is, as previously mentioned, tonally confused, the movie takes a turn from being a horror movie to an action movie which posts a glaring problem to the story structure of the film as well as the previously mentioned atmospheric qualities.It makes me sad that most of the characters in this film are as bad as in Prometheus (which I personally found to be a garbage film). The only standout is Fassbender and in some cases Katherine Waterston (only sometimes) even though I really didn't like that the films try to make Daniels Ripley 2.0 because it miserably fails at that. The rest of the characters are obviously expandable and utterly boring. The only thing that was fun about them was watching them die.Some things in the story make absolutely NO sense. Like in Prometheus but that film as a whole made no sense. A lot of questions I had about Prometheus are left unanswered, and yes I know ""MORE SEQUELS ARE ON THE WAY"". Not only are questions left unanswered but some of the characters in the movie are really just plain stupid. It baffles me that ""Professional scientists"" go onto an uncharted planet without any form of body protection. There are at least 50 of these types of stupid and un explainable decisions that the characters make. (Splitting up in a unfamiliar place, peeking where peeking shouldn't occur, not isolating what or who should be isolated etc.)In general the film is a big mess even though I can safely say that I was entertained during a good chunk of the run time .6/10.",Alien - Covenant

ALIEN was just that - SO people will go wandering off. People will make ridiculous decisions. The crew could be stupider than characters from the collective Friday 13th series. Ridley tries to convince us that these decisions are made because the crew working together are partners (never work with your husband/wife/partner folks!)..Without Michael this film would not have worked, of that much I am convinced. His screen presence... playing two characters - much applause to him.As for Ridley well - thanks for making this. You do give us some answers, you give us some good amount of blood and gore and action so thanks. Leaving the world with Prometheus would have been BAD.I had a blast really... but do not overthink it.... if he does decide, and Ridley said he plans to make one or TWO more then OK.. no doubt I will attend and turn my IQ down a little.Go find a very large screen sit back and enjoy it.

It's not like it's the end of the world, people.Yes, the ""Alien:Covenant"" has it's flaws, it has plot holes, the characters act stupid, but for me it perfectly captures the feeling of the first Alien movies, because it's dark, and it's horror oriented.There will never be a film like Alien from 1979 - it's one of the best films in the whole industry for me, and the absolute best sci-fi horror movie EVER. Aliens from 1986 is one of the best sci-fi action movies EVER. You can't even come close to that. But for what it is Covenant is a pretty nice addition to the Alien franchise for me.I'm with the majority in saying that we didn't need explanation to the question - how was the xenomorph made, where did it came from. That monster was scary because it WAS full of mystery, it was unknown and terrifying, because we didn't know what the hell was that. The whole mystery and awesomeness of the creature gets smaller when we actually know that an android created it (although i don't understand how in the world did David MADE the eggs from which the facehugger emerges. I thought a queen hatched it..) If there will be more sequels to this one maybe some more questions will be answered, but if that's it - then oh well ..Why i'm giving it a 7 stars.For the atmosphere, the visuals(amazing), the 1 or 2 scenes of suspense( especially the alien through the back scene), the gore and blood, which was great, not another PG-13 crap like AVP. The brutality of the film was awesome, and to the great acting of Michael Fassbender as David/Walter which was amazing. 7 is a mediocre rating, for a mediocre film. But this film DOESN'T deserve at all the 1/10 rating you guys are giving it. It's not a 9/10 or 10/10 either.

I could probably write a really long explanation about space ship quarantine, visiting a new world without a special pressurized suit and all but if those guys from Star Trek did not need explanations for it so why should Ridley Scott spend valuable screen time on this. I really liked how possible length issues were solved with releasing parts of the movie on the web and this really helped stitch the story together and make the plot complete rather than having to wait for another cut to come out in time. Although predictable at times, the movie did not ruin the scare and it was more believable than Prometheus. Don't wait for the DVD version! Go and see it while it's hot!

Sure - there's plot holes and stupid decisions both by the crew of the Covenant AND the director - but this is an Alien film. There's been two good ones period - the rest are varying degrees of terrible. What was good: - this film answers many questions: what happened to Shaw and David, did they find the Engineers, where did the Xenomorph come from. - Acting-wise Fassbender is excellent, and most of the cast hold their own. - FX are brilliant. Tasteful use of CGI. Genuinely horrifyingly real at times. - the pace was good - great tie-ins with Prometheus, Weiland, David etc - I felt scared, horrified and full of pending dread!What was bad: - as others have said there are logic and plot-holes. - plot twists were pretty predictable - predictable jump-scares.Why watch it? - you love the Xenomorph - you want to know what happened to Shaw/David after Prometheus.I know this is from acclaimed Oscar-winning director/creator Ridley Scott who did such great sci-fi in the 80s and so expectations are high. But Prometheus proved he can make an average movie. Lower your expectations! This is part of the Alien franchise which more often than not are average movies. A key theme of the alien franchise is the folly of humanity, of ""playing God"", and vanity and that theme is very present in this movie.

Well, silly me for hoping for a better movie. This is more of the same: Filled with dumb tropes and a plot that ruins the whole Alien lore. It even has no respect for it's Prequel. All the buildup in Prometheus about the ""Engineers"" being a super race of aliens? Nah, just show them being easily wiped out in a short flashback.It basically all comes down to the robot David being a future Dr. Frankenstein and creating the ""ultimate species"". The eggs breeding then facehuggers are just there, and later it seem even possible to grow them Huggers out of tiny, freezable eggs. Xenomorph queen? Obsolete. Or maybe I'm too dumb for this movie to get it.HR Giger would spin in his grave. What have they made out of his brilliant designs. Shame.",Alien - Covenant
722,lgtaylor22,Awful,1,18 August 2018,"Seriously this was a horrible movie, although beautifully shot and visually impressive. To be fair, I've hated every Alien movie since Aliens. This was no exception. They've gone too far, too dark, too bleak. These movies are no longer a good thriller/action movie. Trying to be more than the originals, they've destroyed the appeal entirely.",Alien - Covenant
723,dermobreen,"Alien: Covenant - set your expectations to ""low""",6,10 June 2017,"You are now entering a spoiler-free zone; well as much as a spoiler-free zone as possible given that this is an Alien movie and we all know how they usually end.So Alien: Covenant is the second of Ridley Scott's Alien-prequel series. I'm not giving anything away by saying that the end of this one lays the basis for the next one. Reports suggest there may be four prequels. We have been threatened with worse. I refer to James Cameron's plans for four more Avatar sequels!If you have not seen the first prequel, Prometheus you need to see it before seeing Alien: Covenant. That is a must. You will be lost otherwise. Even if this is your very first time to see an Alien film, please see at least one other first.Once you have seen Alien or Aliens, then the B-story of this film will make sense. In fact the last act is almost a beat for beat copy of either of these two. We'll come back to the A-story later.1979's Alien was the first outing for Ridley Scott with the creature. It had a very strong script and featured the famous mess-hall scene with the wonderful John Hurt and our first look at the chest-burster as it was known then. It was a straight-forward horror story set in space, complete with jump-out-of-your-seat moments. Seven years later James Cameron brought us Aliens which changed gears and gave us, what was essentially, a war movie. It was a different take utilising the same villain. Both stand alone and both are memorable. This writer has watched both movies many times. Let's forget Aliens 3 and 4 and the various Aliens vs Predator rip-offs.Enough history, what of this latest movie. Let's start with the plot. There are no less than six writers involved in developing the story and crafting the screenplay. When you have half-a-dozen writers involved it usually shows and this film is no exception. The writing is all over the place and when one character exclaims ""I don't know what's going on"" you can feel the cinema-going audience, to a person, empathise.The B-story has the crew of the colony ship Covenant, bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, discovering a signal from another planet on route to their destination. The signal is a broken but identifiable as ""Take me home country roads"". This intrigues our intrepid crew who decide to investigate. One can almost hear the audience shouting ""don't do it!"" but they do and discover what they think is an uncharted paradise, but is actually a dark, dangerous world. When they uncover a threat beyond their imagination, they must attempt a harrowing escape. Enough said – you get the gist.The A-story continues Scott's preoccupation with faith, human origins and our destiny as a species. Prometheus started this examination but was slow and plodding not to mention confusing and with an ending that made no sense. We get more of the same here only it's not shoved in your face as much as the first prequel.The crew are instantly forgettable. Yes we have a woman in a vest shooting at a monster which again, is a step too far in trying to recreate the Ellen Ripley character – without success. The ship, the Covenant is too shiny and there is the odd JJ Abrams lens flare on the bridge. Our alien movies need to be grimy!The film is receiving widespread criticism. I understand why. The A-storey is, well boring at this stage. The B-storey is not satisfying and the twists at the end are so well sign-posted that it takes away from the ending.I went in with very low expectations and was surprised.3 out of 5So set your expectations to ""low""",Alien - Covenant
724,oaspag-71318,"Ridley, here, no Ripley, but still Ridley. Scott. 8/10",8,6 June 2017,"Hi ! 1979 to 2017 - Alien - to - Alien Covenant. The master who started it all is back : Ridley Scott. I just saw this tonight and I am quite satisfied; I'll be honest, I put my expectation bar so high that I was slightly deceived (I had seen the 6.8 score before going in, but thought that was harsh; but it turns out there is some truth to the criticism this time (I don't really follow critics, it's just someone's/people's opinion(s) which I respect - though if Many people give about the same score - it does give me an 'overall' feel of how I will feel (generally I add 2 points extra on critics)); and generally, it's a good 'barometer' about how 'most' people feel about the film. No one person responds the same to a film, but if a majority gives the same score (almost the same on multiple sites and off sites (like magazines film reviews)); it tells me that indeed that's about the general public feel, and I could feel roughly the same (but, most of time, I end up liking it up far more than the public because I'm really 'easy'/I don't care as long as it is decent and it, generally, is (hence, why I always give 2-3 points extra on 10 than the rest. It's impressive you know this is Mr.Scott's film, because he made the Alien 1979, Not only that he made 'horror films' become what they are today (for Many Many films have been inspired by Alien 1, not just in horror, but in thrillers and suspense's. Thanks to him. And Mr. Giger (the original inventor of the Alien creature (from his own dreams/nightmares; and all the 'Alien' art concepts he drew)). Story : A crew of about 10 people are on their way to a planet and carry 2000 colonizers 'asleep' (hypersleep), but during space travel (on a space ship) they encounter a very 'earth-like' planet that is very 'bio' compatible and 'biolively' (on it, there grows 'wheat'/the settlers grew and cultivated wheat fields on it and there is oxygen, water, etc (like Earth)). We have some good actors such as the Captain (Danny McBride) and the young woman whom she talks with often. They obviously go to that planet (after a talk between her and him). In fact, Mr.Scott does not spare the Captain's life - he kills him. I was a bit shocked by that.. but that is what Movie Magic/Power is about; your audience can be angry that you kill an important character to them that they wanted to 'live'... as a director/directors, it's your job and you decide where you lead your audience; not the other way around. I respect Mr.Scott's decision to end the Captain (whom was one of the best one on this film, Mr.McBride is the most natural one here - onlyMr.Fassbender equals him and the young woman (and also, that early woman whom gets stuck in the room when one of the crew members is infected and an Alien rips out of his back). There is one problem : Alien 2017 vs Alien 1979; The 1979 version had a Strong Female Heroine (Sigourney Weaver (whom carried the film all by herself/on her shoulders and made a huge difference, there was a crew too but it's impact was much less - Mrs.Weaver (Helen Ripley) was The Protagonist of the film - we understood that, the other characters did not steal her limelight) - not this time, now for the 2017 version we have a 'crew' of mostly 'nobodies' and everyone is trying to steal the other's 'fame'.Other great things : The Aliens in this film are incredible - they are 'Protomorphs' (white body form and protracted head) rather than Xenomorphs (the evolved crawling humanoid black body form). Problems : - Film suffers from Alien 2 problem, it's more 'actiony' than scary - and it had a PG-13 Rating (to get more (younger) viewers and thus, more money for film distributor 20th Century FOX and Mr.Scott's own company); As such, yes it is a horror film like Alien 1 - but it - Does Not - compare in terms of sheer terror than Alien 1 did. Alien 1 was terrifying - because it pitted a Single Woman (Mrs.Weaver/Ripley) against a Xenomorph Alien - in an abandoned derelict Spaceship. The Good: - VFX are Absolutely Spectacular (but with MPC/Frame store VFX, we always know it will be Top Notch (obviously, this film has an immense 100+Million dollar budget and it shows) -The New Aliens are cool but are quite infrequent actually and though, they are a bit 'Deja Vu' - they are still pretty frightening. IT's just the Mr.Scott does not do like his Alien 1 did : Make Real Suspense - that scares ...now the Aliens are basically 'Shown' full frontal...so no, monsters, don't scare people - Darkness, Fear, Psychosis, Loneliness, gallons fluid, etc...these elements scare people...not a 'big monster'...that doesn't work. In this Alien, the Aliens are not that much hidden and in 'plain sight', sometimes daily...so yeah, the fear factor is reduced to 0.Still, in the end, I give a solid 8.5/10. Mr.Scott please don't stop, you're still alive and can make so more movies - make a new Prometheus 2 or Alien: Covenant 2 and make it even better; this was just a warm-up from the long 'rusted time' since 1979... Alien: Covenant 2020 (perfect timing for 2020). I see it already.",Alien - Covenant
725,sorearm,What have I become?,9,3 June 2017,"Here in the UK, this film was slagged off before it even came out. Prometheus hurt a lot of us; spiritually, financially, cramp from sitting in the cinema bored stiff for 2.5 hours. So much to my surprise, when me bird suggested we go and see Alien Covenant I reluctantly accompanied her and enjoyed the film as much as was possible.Yes, some of the same devices from previous Alien films are used in this one, but it works somehow. Where Prometheus struggled to hold form, Alien Covenant uses the old set-ups to squeeze a bit of tension and propulsion out of the story, so by the end it was futile to resist that you had just been entertained.This is not an Ingmar Bergman film and will not impress you for the rest of your life but it is good, much better than the toilet media made out and worth a viddy, whether you like Alien or not.",Alien - Covenant

But it's not given the most entertaining script. The film looks really good but what hurts it is the CGI. And those stupid new chestbursters which suck ass. But the script was okay. It's more entertaining then Alien which is on eof the most boring things ever. Overall if you're here for the Xenomorphs it will be real disapointing,Alien - Covenant
727,irishjenna,Let this film series die already...,3,28 May 2020,"Alien and Aliens, two of the greatest films ever made, hands down. The fact that these two movies from the 70s/80s still stand the test of time with not only the acting and storytelling, but the visuals, really tells you something.I honestly didn't know this film existed until I was perusing for movies to watch during the quarantine and was like, they made another Alien film? I thought, ok, well it can't be any worse than Prometheus, so I'll bite.Ridley Scott, who directed the first of the franchise, directed the mess that was Prometheus and now Covenant. I can't believe with the huge budget allotted that instead of going back to the tried and true puppets that were used for the original string of films, we have these god awful CGI effects for not only the aliens, but the blood spatter. Sorry, but that's not scary, not at all. This is what you get with a 100 million budget?? FML!Let's be honest though, this series has produced flop after flop after the second movie. Alien 3 was only ok (maybe even less than ok) and Resurrection was abysmal.Why in these prequels do we have the absolute dumbest scientists known to mankind...are these guys supposed to be the tops in their field for these space missions? And everyone in both movies either are hooking up or married, but why? Alien and Aliens made great movies without the use of T&A and couple drama. Aliens did it great with the subtle sexual tension between Hicks and Ripley, it was about the connection and wasn't in your face or gratuitous. Prometheus was really bad about this, but we get it in Covenant as well with the shower scene at the end between two characters that nobody cares about. Oh the alien poky tail in the vag, cause I didn't see that one coming. Come on man, sex scene killings are in slasher flicks, is this what we get Ridley, really? Please! Jason did it better, Freddy did it better, Evil Dead did it better. I was waiting for someone in Covenant to yell, ""hello is anyone there?"", after hearing a creepy noise cause I felt like I might as well be watching Jason X. You know, the one where Jason is in space. That's how dumb these characters are.After all the stupid moves before and after landing on a strange planet, the one thing you are not going to do is question the field of charred remains of human like entities you are following unknown android man through to get to his dark and scary castle like domain? An android that you don't know that just happens to be the only survivor for 10 years on an aggressive alien planet. An android that you will blindly follow into a back room after seeing him connect with an aggressive alien and finding the head of one of your comrades floating in water. Then you are going to stick your head into an alien pod cause said android asks you to check it out. Oh, and then at the end, one of the last survivors doesn't think to ask her android friend until he locks her in her cryopod a personal question, suddenly realizing what the audience already figured out...it's not him, it's evil android.

Dr. Shaw is dead (loved her character), the damn robot wiped out the engineers and he's responsible for the Alien strand as we know it. I mean what???? Ridiculous dumbed down alien story. None of the questions raised by the 1st movie (prometheus) are really answered with satisfaction.I mean it's not a bad movie in itself but as a follow up to the alien mytho.

The three originals were, if not exactly hard science fiction, quite entertaining, great fun. Then came the next three, which... wasn't. And even if the new batch is better than those, it's not like the first time. The Alien-series has sort of copied that path. The first was great. The second even better. The third was not as good, but still the third best in the series, and I quite liked it. The fourth... started out well, but then deteriorated fast into utter silliness, with that hybrid Alien monster. And then came the Alien vs Predator, clearly on a low budget, both with regard to actors and script writing. What we have now, is hard to make heads or tail of. Prometheus started not so bad, but again quickly imploded upon itself. This one, well, if you're longing to see the Alien monsters again you won't be disappointed, but maybe you will feel a bit let down, since they seem like more of a side show now. Ridley Scott has made some of the best movies I've ever seen. Blade Runner, Alien, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down. But it's been quite some time since these films, and everything since then, with the possible exception of The Martian, has been severely below par. This movie isn't awful, it's just not very good, or interesting. I actually bought it, because I didn't catch in the theaters, and I wanted to catch up. I won't buy the next one.",Alien - Covenant

Anyway it has some good moments, like when Daniels is watching the design prints about Alien creatures and Dr Shaw. It reminds very much Giger like Art.Characters are OK. But would be more deeply illustrated. Monsters are nice, i mean not nice but fits perfectly to his product. I'm giving this movie 7 of 10 But the reviews aspect of Rating, would differ some depending what part or thing it is considered to aim at.In the end. The Alien Covenant is fair continuity to this movie series. And as I'm realist. Lets face it.

The creature effects and gore are masterfully done, but the whole setup feels somewhat recycled and ultimately meaningless when we find out how the xenomorphs came to be. We are no longer dealing with an intelligent parasitic alien lifeforms, but more of a tool for revenge by an interesting yet unbelievable character, well played by Michael Fassbender.The conclusion may just leave you with a bad taste in your mouth as the complexity and intriguing nature of the xenomorph becomes to dulled down in favour of more philosophical exposition of the concept of creation and meaning of life, I kid you not...",Alien - Covenant
735,adlion94,Utterly awful. Critics are dead wrong.,4,4 August 2017,"A great Alien film hasn't be released since Aliens in 1989. This does not break the streak. How can a film franchise continue to release so many duds and continue? If you consider Aliens vs Predator junk films, the H.R. Giger monster has shown up too many times for me to count.Movies need characters, driving motivation, story and production values.Characters: They are bland. They also make hilarously bad decisions that even a layman viewer knows is unscientific, or contrary to safety protocols. The android character reminded me of an evil Data from Star Trek. I've seen the AI goes evil plot so many times. I just felt that David was derivative.Driving Motivation: All the stress was self-imposed. I like it better when a character's plight comes from bad luck, not from being stupid. The screenwriters are to blame. They should've been forced to that planet, not chosen it. They should've been suspicious of an alien world and strange deserted civilization, not gone in unprotected. (Which caused all their problems.) If they had been clever, but still suffered bad fortune, it's a much more interesting.Story: The android with the God complex is simply too boring, but I agree that they didn't just want to make an ""escape from the monsters"" movie. I wish they would've had to divert because the ship was about to fall apart. That would've been a lot like ""Passengers"" but it would've put more macro urgency into the story. It was just a monster movie. And embarrassing because after all this time, a human-designed android is what created Aliens. Really? That's the worst idea since Midichlorians in the Phantom Menace.Production Values: It was big, lush and full of wide vistas. It was a ""haunted house"" vibe on an alien world. Very well done. The aliens weren't very convincing, they always seems CGI and rubbery-fake. The Covenant ship was better done in Passengers. I was amazed at how well they did split screen with a single actor playing both roles. Bravo. Music was banal, though there were moments that reminded me of James Horner scores, especially Aliens and Predator. But overall, I wouldn't want the soundtrack. The movie dragged in the talky David sequences. But I found the gigantic expanse of dead alien city to be straight out of 1970s fantasy paintings. Super creepy.Overall, this is a lousy, lousy movie. Corporate greed and a director who lost his way decades ago. This is what happens when you run out of ideas. This is like Elton John trying to write a new song. His time was in the 1970s. I don't want to hear a modern, new Elton John song. And I guess I don't want to see anymore Ridley Scott movies. Give this a pass. It's as bad as Prometheus.",Alien - Covenant
736,ddcharbon,Remember when...,2,22 July 2018,"We thought the problem with Alien sequels was the lack of Ridley Scott's involvement? Those were the days. Prometheus may have been ponderous and pretentious, but at least there was something there to think about. This film is like a really bad remake of Aliens--all out war with a fetal/adolescent/grown up version of the beasties, but without Cameron's sense of pacing or the deft characterizations, or Ripley's kickass Mama a Mama battle with the queen bitch. Given the extremely short time frames between prequels and the original series, there's no good explanation--other than asses in the seats novelty--for the constant morphing of the creatures, and these new aborted fetuses with fangs are the worse thing since that other human/alien hybrid at the end of the last Alien sequel. Hairless and without a developed exoskeleton they seem strangely resistant to heavy caliber, automatic weapons. This movie wastes thirty-five minutes getting to any sense of tension and yet, in all that time, fails to develop any significant sense of character or conflict. We just wait for the beasties to arrive and the slaughter to begin. If an unimaginative gorefest with creatures you've seen a hundred times is your idea of a good time, this is your flick. Otherwise, not so much. Ridley, whose BR 2049 was similarly structured like a wet noodle, a once great filmmaker, has simply forgotten how to create genuine narrative tension. It reminds me of Lucas in the second trilogy, though Scott has fallen farther, since some of Lucas's flaws were there to be seen all along.",Alien - Covenant

Easily the worst alien movie after alien 4 .First why you didn't took what others did great about the alien franchise ? Instead you destroyed , example : the eggs comes from a alien queen , Cameron did perfect and you just came with the David stupid creation, you just killed more the suspense of an alien creature, parasite Etc.Then you also managed to kill Elizabeth Shaw and all the engineers ( the only highlight of Prometheus moron !)And bring back the worst from Prometheus ( a stupid crew , stupid decisions etc) The gore was good no complaint on that , but even the old aliens rip in half bishop Android and here they even mimic with David puffff... I expected a movie where Shawn meet the engineers and David translated for her about the answers and somehow seen the inevitable fate of mankind David release the black goo(yes that was a good idea in covenant)..What a waste of moneyWhat a waste of time waiting these years , this is what happens when a director follow the money and not his guts , you could make a great movie following the end of Prometheus with Shaw, you could insert the xenomorph again of course but instead you bring another ship of morons into a planet the same predictable movie ...and I almost forgot : like in Prometheus the same error...Where are the aliens????? The black goo was designed to create the alien (in Prometheus you can see in the room of the black goo canisters a statue of a xenomorph and that is before David create the alien) but the planet is empty and should be swarming by aliens , eggs, queen ,same here in alien covenant , 9 years since David release the virus on the engineers , still no aliens muted from them , just spore plants????

What kind of cryo pod - something that is DESIGNED to keep people ALIVE would have such a glaring flaw? How could that even happen? The pod gets messed up and therefore it turns into an INCINERATOR? I mean, I know these films require a certain suspension of disbelief, but this is just lazy. Of all the ways a cryp pod could malfunction and end up killing its inhabitant, being filled with FIRE is what they went with? Really?

If Prometheus was a flat, predictable sequel of the infinite Alien saga, Alien:Covenant is an irritating piece of works, managing to deliver a worse performance than its immediate predecessor. The usual stunning special effects from CGI don't compensate for the cockamamie plot, the less than impressive acting from a less than impressive cast (with the only exception of Fassbender). All the magic, all the mystery of the original franchise is lost in the midst of splashes of bloods (litres of it....), Jurassic Park monsters jumping all over the place, star-ships driven like fighter jets and so on.

But it did do the important task of attempting to stitch together the end of Prometheus and the beginning of Alien.That said there are LOTS of poorly constructed story and answer lines.e.g.*The Engineers do not share their technology, they incubate their clone offspring to amalgamate with their new host planet and that's it. That's what they did for us, yet here we are to believe that Planet 4's people have seen and used the Engineer spaceships before?*David for all that he's become is still a machine, for a machine to transcend machine learning and make cogitative decisions especially those pertaining to right and wrong and pretty unbelievable.*The Engineer Homeworld is clearly a misrepresentation, this planet was just an outpost or colony, you can hardly expect a neo-sentient species to reside on one planet in one city?! * I did enjoy the parts of nature and beauty of this new world. It did look natural and virgin for such a transformation to take place.* Captain T taking the huge mothership down to the planet was utterly ridiculous. Even in stories of old, that would never happen. Also how utterly ridiculous was it that spouses and partners traveled together. Obviously emotional decisions will be made antithetical to logical and rational ones, leading up to poor results.Can't believe they missed all this.All that said, I am somewhat satisfied, at least we know what and where Prometheus led to.

Elizabeth's sacrifice her power, wit, and determination-even her faith-were kicked aside as old ideas not worth exploring or honoring. The characters in this movie are dumb. Their judgment is even worse. As I was watching it I couldn't help but think of the countless numbers of people and concerts who need to watch what's happening right in front of them on thru their device screen. They can't enjoy the moment. Not wanting to loose it or thinking they can capture it they miss the point entirely. I am very disappointed in this film.

745,acinemafan,A very good movie worth seeing in theaters,9,21 May 2017,"""Alien: Covenant"" is a good movie, and worth seeing in the theater. I saw this with a friend, whose first reaction was a disappointment, because he didn't see it as a horror, which is what he anticipated -- in no small part, I'm sure, because of the TV ads, which harken back to the original Alien. However, after talking about the movie, and my sharing my only three criticisms, he gave the film a B- (I give it a B, though, few movies will get an A for me).Ridley Scott had quite a task in front of him with ""Alien: Covenant."" First, he was coming off the mass disappointment in ""Prometheus,"" and the high expectation of meeting the high water mark of the original ""Alien."" The bar was high, and the cliff to fall off was a sheer one, and very slippery, with another disappointment being potentially catastrophic. While not a perfect movie (few are), ""Alien: Covenant"" is very good, with a well written characters, a good story, and effective suspense. Be forewarned, though, there is important dialogue that may be difficult to hear.",Alien - Covenant
746,matt-sickle,Very sad demise of this franchise is complete,3,16 September 2017,"I gave this 3 stars for the actors. Otherwise it would have been zero. There were some excellent performances and they deserve more. But so does the audience.This is a step down even from Promethius which was one of the most brain-dead sci-fi movies I have watched in along time. Until now. I blame the story line, the way its cut together and the direction. And the core concept.Basically imagine a crew of really dull individuals stumbling through space making the worst decisions possible and you have an idea. A crew which we learned the names of maybe 5 of them and therefore I barely cared or recognized any of them as things happened to them. Then take the entire past/back story of the franchise and destroy it. Re-use every scene and setting that worked in previous movies and cut them down . It was just a pathetic story and horrible telling of the story.Even the costumes and the ship CGI were weak as heck. Some of the shots did look good despite all this... but small payoff for such a steaming pile of ""cinema.""And on top of all this it is just unbelievably predictable. I avoided all spoilers before watching it but there was not a single plot twist you won't see coming far ahead. Not one. Which is impressive considering how little sense the monsters, the plot and the ""evil character"" aspects are presented.I could go on but I'd start spoiling things. However save yourself time and just skip this anyway. It is just terrible. I wish I had the 2hrs back that I spent watching it.",Alien - Covenant
747,briandoodo,Watchable but not great...,5,3 June 2017,"I finally saw it. Not sure, how I feel about it. Very mixed feelings. The ending was very predictable and the movie doesn't even try to give you something unexpected, original. Instead it spells out the ending before it arrives and takes the form of the worse movie cliché where every one dies last minute and something shitty happens...It was a slap in the face that scene where they are fighting and the android takes up the knife...and it cuts away and you know exactly how it will end, with like 10 minutes of movie left.(Also, seriously, they sucked it out to space, again?) The movie drags in dialogues that don't add any meaning or depth to the story, the character's background stories add nothing to the end of the film. The characters are killed off and so there is no real character evolution. There are random mentions of religion and very light philosophical conversations that ultimately lead no where and say nothing..The film has no clear message, there's no real meat with your potatoes...It starts to pretend like it's about to have substance but then you look back and there's just nothing... (Something about faith, something about God, something something...ah, hell this movie is aimless, what's the meaning of it all!?)The film is about a psychotic android who some how grows a God complex. This storyline remains very undeveloped and the characters are mostly irrelevant. to the actual story The audience is simply expected to go along with it, that an android develops a god complex and likes to partake in sadistic Dr. Frankenstein like experiments because his ""father"" was a meanie...The entire cast is just sort of filler, with wasted character development that has no real significance or importance to the story...and hey, they are all going to die anyways. It's more like a continuation of Prometheus than anything else, disguised as a sequel with new characters.... Both films are the story of a psychotic android and his triumph. All and all both this film and Prometheus were un-necessary prequels. The film spends a lot of time on nothingness, and in the end, the film provides a mostly empty experience. It was un-necessary, as we already gathered how Aliens came to be through Prometheus. We didn't really need a rehash of a sequel to spell it out for us even further. Prometheus already gave us an origins story. Let's not even mention the incredibly stupid and irresponsible decisions the entire cast of characters made in the film. There's nothing to really take away from this or remember from this movie, a crazy android develops a god complex and preforms terrible experiments...",Alien - Covenant
748,Dutch90,Batman At The Beach,7,14 May 2018,"The history of the new Alien prequel series is a weird one. Prometheus, the first one, was originally conceived as a full-on Alien prequel, and later reworked to a semi-spinoff set before the 1979 original, with no actual Aliens in it. Alien: Covenant, on the other hand, was initially conceived as a sequel to Prometheus that would 'even further tangentialize from the Alien series', and focus on the Engineers. After all, Prometheus ends with Shaw and David traveling to the Engineer homeworld. However, fan demand prompted Ridley Scott to turn Prometheus 2 into a full-on Alien movie, the creature's first solo outing since 1997's Alien: Resurrection and its first cinematic appearance since 2007's Aliens vs Predator: Requiem.The result is a mixed bag. First off, the film looks great. Prometheus's cinematography, a delightfully otherworldly mix of gorgeous and sinister, carries over well into this film. Again, Scott takes it slow, allowing for tension to build as the characters gradually uncover what has transpired on the new world that is the setting for this film (fan sites call it 'Planet 4', since it remains unnamed in the film). The SFX look marvelous, and the CGI Alien looks worlds apart from the shoddy computer-generated beasts in earlier films. Still, it remains a bit questionable to see the Alien in full view (and broad daylight, no less). The earlier films showed very little of the Aliens, which amped up the horror element - less is more, and the one thing scarier than seeing an Alien is not seeing one (but knowing it's there anyway). Honest Trailers aptly compared it to seeing 'Batman on the beach'. That being said, the film is once again chock-full of 80s style body horror, now aided by high end CGI that allows for even more grotesque things to happen (the baby 'Neomorph' looked a bit iffy though). While the film amps up the violence with stuff like creatures bursting from backs and monsters biting people's heads off, it never becomes as over-the-top as in, say, Resurrection.Cast-wise, Scott made some weird choices in the film. For instance, a big name like James Franco basically has no more than a cameo, dying in the first scenes of the film (he appears more prominently in the 'Crossing' prologue released on YouTube to promote the film). Also, Noomi Rapace sadly doesn't return as Elizabeth Shaw. She was one of the sympathetic highlights of Prometheus, and is 'replaced' by Katherine Waterston in a decidedly blander role. Fortunately, we are treated to not one but two Michael Fassbenders - he returns as the creepy synthetic David, and also portrays his American-accented counterpart Walter. Some of the film's most interesting scenes feature Fassbender basically talking to himself in Data/Lore fashion. David is more straightforwardly villainous this time around, but Fassbender manages to keep the character ambiguous and unnerving. One of my main gripes with the film is its decision to give us an Alien origin story of sorts. As it turns out, the Alien was created by David in a genetic experiment with the goal of recreating the various creatures spawned from the X-Files-ish black liquid from Prometheus. This goes against most commonly accepted lore, that the Aliens were either a naturally occurring species or a weapon created by the Engineers. To see them reduced to David's science experiment takes away some of the danger and majesty of the creature. While it's understandable that Scott would want to retcon the 2004 Alien vs Predator film, which shows Aliens being hunted by Predators on Earth thousands of years ago, Covenant's origin story also contradicts the first Alien film, which showed Alien eggs on a derelict spacecraft so old its pilot had fossilized (Covenant takes place in 2101, just twenty years before the original film). It's not much solace that fan sites such as Xenopedia have reasoned that the Covenant Alien is a different strain or a 'recreation' of the original creature, since the direction Scott wants to take the new trilogy in is clear.All-in all, Alien: Covenant is a pretty good sci-fi/horror flick that is unfortunately brought down a bit by questionable decisions regarding the series lore. But if you're not bothered by that, it's definitely recommenable.",Alien - Covenant

The effects are very good. There are interesting concepts & very VIVID & disturbing imagery. The dialogue is at times, by specific characters, quite interesting and provoking. This movie also gives some interesting background on the Alien 'universe'. And some of the acting is pretty good.However, as i said, it is very underwhelming. There are too many irrelevant, stupid characters, irrelevant stupid things happening, stupid dialogue. So much stuff is so simplified. But there is deeper stuff underneath, and that is why this movie being so silly is such a shame.I still give it a 7/10, because it is totally still AT LEAST an average/ OK movie, probably a bit better, and there is also interesting, high value production & thought underneath.

750,moonz1972,A good but not excellent addition to the Alien franchise,7,10 September 2017,I came to this film hoping for a better then the mediocre Prometheus. This improves on that as there is a sense of dread throughout the movie as the nightmarish Xenomorph is once more present. So we have some good action sequences and set pieces plus a twist at the end that may hock some. Not bad but will not satisfy a lot of the die hard fans of the series as it lacks compelling characters aside from the female lead however it carries on the story arc from Prometheus and provides an interesting back story to the Xenomorph and how it came to be. It will be interesting to see if they take this any further. I enjoyed it but it feels like somethings missing or lacking.,Alien - Covenant

It's hard to believe that talented movie producers could come up with something so lacking in creativity, intrigue, and suspense. These movies just keep getting worse. I would be embarrassed to produce such trivial garbage. Don't waste your time or money on it.",Alien - Covenant
752,recklesscow,A very frustrating film experience.,4,20 May 2017,"If I had to make an analogy involving this film, it would be a stupid one involving let's say, bacon. You love bacon. On burgers. And you've just ordered a bacon burger from a fast food restaurant you love. Your mouth is watering as you open the wrapper for what is sure to be a delicious bacon burger, only your heart sinks when you realize there's just one measly strip on it. While you can enjoy the parts of the burger where you can taste some of the bacon, you can't ensure there's a piece in every bite. So the rest? It's just not the same. In this case, the ""Alien"" franchise itself is the bacon, and ""Alien: Covenant"" is the rest of the burger.It's unlikely anyone going into an ""Alien"" film with original director Ridley Scott behind the helm can put aside their expectations. Maybe that's our fault for going into it with baggage and not judging this new installment on its own merits. But given how great Scott was with the original material back in the 70s, one can't be faulted for hoping another film involving the notorious creatures on a ship in space directed by the same man contains a modicum of the directorial style and suspense as his first effort. And this is where the film lets us down.I understand it's 2017 and maybe audiences can no longer cope with such a slow burn as ""Alien."" They need faster pacing, special effects, and more blood and gore. Fair enough--we do get all of that. But the problem this time around is that while the scenes not involving the alien were spent on building suspense in the original, this time they're all centered around people walking around and talking...walking around and gazing at a new planet...walking around and philosophizing...basically, where the original used its quiet moments to increase fear and isolation, this one fills the non-alien segments with a bunch of ""can we please get on with it already"" moments. There's a moment when the characters are exploring an unknown, apparently human-friendly planet that seems to drag on forever, only that's the thing--it really doesn't. It just feels that way. I found myself wondering when the hell the creatures were going to show up, whereas with the original film I enjoyed every minute of anticipation getting there. To put it succinctly, the pacing is all over the place this time out and everything feels uneven.Complicating matters are the interchangeable characters whose names I cannot even remember, spare David and the briefly mentioned Elizabeth Shaw...both from the previous film ""Prometheus."" Ask anyone who the main characters in ""Alien"" were and you'll get Ripley for sure, if not Dallas and Lambert to boot. But when I walked out of the theater after seeing ""Covenant"", I couldn't even tell you the name of the main female lead. Yeah.Like ""Prometheus"", director Ridley Scott also places the CGI front and center rather than making it feel like an organic part of the film. We know these people are living in the future, but rather than let the special effects serve as a backdrop, they too often dominate the film and become set pieces in themselves.All of this is a real shame considering Scott clearly still has what it takes to deliver some fantastic suspense sequences. There is one scene in particular that I felt rivaled the intensity of the ""chestburster"" scene in the original, and a certain sequence taking place in a shower room is also commendable for how well it is shot and executed. But these standout bits are few and far between.""Covenant"" is a mashup of the battle scenes from ""Aliens"", the ""monster loose on a ship"" setup from the original, with a dash of ""Prometheus"" thrown in. The result is uneven all around, but still showcases some of Scott's flashes of brilliance here and there (the bacon!). What a shame the overall result couldn't have been more consistent.",Alien - Covenant

At least ""Prometheus"" had originality. This film completely sacrifices poignancy for cheap scares, and when it does attempt to get deep, it ends up spewing too much convoluted information, and just confuses you with disconnected lore that goes nowhere. Characters are useless. The pacing is too fast and it doesn't let the film build up tension. It shows you everything, and ends up flaunting the Xenomorph like the pop culture icon that it has become. It tries to expand on the loads of information we're given in ""Prometheus"", while at the same time give us Alien stuff. In the end, it was just Alien stuff, thus making all the information from the last film pointless.

So, like most people, I was really excited to see what Ridley Scott was going to do with this film and well let's talk about it.Alien: Covenant I think it's an enjoyable film, I do not think it's a great film. To be honest, I was kind of disappointed with this film. If you are a big fan of Alien and you just want to see the Xenomorph kill some people and see a lot of action, well then watch Alien Covenant, you will have fun with it. Now if you are expecting a great sci-fi movie with great characters and emotional arks and big action scenes, then this movie will disappoint you.I'm an Alien fan, and I a enjoy watching this movie but, I was disappointed mainly with the script, but let's talk about what works in Alien Covenant and what doesn't.The cinematography here is one of the best of the year, visually, this film it's a masterpiece, everything looks in camera and it's great the way Ridley Scott directed this film also. The visual effects were mostly great and the sound editing was amazing. Another thing that I really like was Michael Fassbender's performance, his character plays a mayor role in this film and he did a great job. I really like that this movie is Rated R because, there are some scenes that were violent has hell, and this is the aspect of this movie that I most enjoyed during the entire run-time.Now the things that didn't work in this movie. It's very noticeable when someone is gonna die, they go that direction when someone it's going to smoke somewhere or take a shower, and it's so obvious that he is going to die because of the Xenomorph that is walking around. I didn't like the fact that the entire crew of this ship it's so disposable, there is no character that I felt a connection with and the set-up for the main hero it's bland and so uncleared, that when this character is in danger, I didn't care about it. This movie it's 2 hours long, and I think that 10 to 15 minutes could be reduced from that run-time and the film will be same that we got.In conclusion, this movie entertain me as an Alien fan, but as a film lover this film disappointed me in a lot of ways. I can watch this film for entertainment but I can't watch it looking for a masterpiece like the first Alien back in 1979. And that why Alien: Covenant gets a 5 out of 10.",Alien - Covenant
759,jasgal-89942,Hits all the notes of an Alien and Prometheus movie,7,27 August 2018,"This movie definitely doesn't hit all the notes well, a few cliche horror moments and juggles alot to try to entertain fans of not only Prometheus but also the best qualities of the first two movies which are one of the few of my all time favorite movies.However this does what Aliens did so well and that was expand the universe and didn't make it all about the Xenomorphs, went into interesting sci fi topics such as the Genesis of mankind, David's god complex and despite some silly descisions, the characters had a lot of backstory so when they faced their demise you felt it.
The scenery and action was awesome and the Xenomorphs, face huggers and even the other aliens are scary and effective in this movie.I personally am pumped for another Alien movie that continues in this direction not so much a movie about the Xenomorphs asmuch as I love them, but also about the possible monsters that are apart of this larger universe, David's future plans and the story behind the engineers and their reaction to the events of the past two movies, this series still has alot of potential, for this movie I have to give it 7 stars, because if those very little but silly horror moments in a movie this smart just brought it down but still one of my favourite movies this year but still ranks below the first two Alien movies.",Alien - Covenant

Although the visuals were good, some of the characters were still nicely portrayed (I'm looking at you Danny McBride) but the script is out of focus and doesn't delve too deep in characters and development. So everything is kinda bland and boring. The movie also tries to be clever, but becomes highly predictable near the end.To sum it all up, you won't be completely bored when watching the movie but you won't be seeing something memorable either.

762,Harvest-R,What have they done ... ?!,3,8 July 2017,"I thought the bad reviews are all exaggerated. But after seeing the movie I need to admit they were right: This is indeed a horrible Alien movie. If not even the worst.1) The crew is utterly stupid and unprofessional. 2) The plot is weird and questionable. 3) The presentation is awful and the decisions are insulting.First, nobody of the crew is being introduced. So you don't feel connected to any of them. They just show up, eventually die and you feel like they were only there to serve the role as cannon fodder. After some of them died you learn ""Ah that was her husband"" or ""Oh that was his wife"". While for the others, you still have no idea what role they had on the mission at all even after the movie ended. And while exploring the (unknown) planet, they are completely lightheaded. They step on sh*t, touch sh*t, put their head into sh*t, ignore rules, disable safety features, risk the live of over 2.000 colonists for one person, etc.Second, the story we get told here is pretty weird. While this was the sequel to Prometheus, it has nothing to do with it. Except that it features David and the ship of the Engineers Elisabeth Shaw took. We don't learn what happened on their trip after Elisabeth Shaw and David left LV-223. What turned David into this lunatic? Why did he abuse Elisabeth for his experiments and committed genocide on the Engineers? Although we see a short cut-scene about what happened when they arrived at the planet, it feels half-assed, misplaced and doesn't explain anything. It only raises eyebrows and more questions.Third, the presentation of the whole story and the decisions of the direction are terrible. Before, the Xenomorph, like the Predator, was a fearsome, mysterious and powerful creature with unknown origins. And in Alien: Covenant we learn that the Xenomorph is nothing else but the creation of a ""mad scientist"" named David, the android. This is maybe the worst thing about the whole movie, it slaughters the whole mystery behind the Xenomorph.There is so much wrong with this movie. I loved all the previous Alien movies.

I've viewed far worse sci-fi movies in the last couple years to know what a real crappy movie looks like.

People expected there to be a traveling to the creator's world, conflict, etc, all around the race of giant humanoids. Instead the were sold the aftermath.The second betrayal was David. David had been on a nefarious path and, towards the end, saw the folly of that path and it was implied, he understood the error of his ways. Yet here we are and he is an insane robot, with plans of Godhood and a desire to wipe out the human race with his genetic manipulation of the creator's ""weapon"".If you can get past the fact you BOUGHT a bill of goods, based on your OWN notion of what the next movie was to be about, you will find the movie is well done. Terrific scenery, a great TWIST on the entire Alien franchise and a bit of bitterness at accepting his direction with the 1st movie, while crying about his following it with the second.I enjoy the movie as I expected a bad film. I also expected our heroine to be raining hell on top of the giant creators and had I gone in on release day, with that in mind, i also would have been displeased...But that displeasure would be MINE and not that of a bad film.

767,jamesba-640-753446,Stunning visuals contrast this mess of a film.,3,21 May 2017,"I will begin with what Ridely Scott got right in this film, unfortunately there isn't much(!). Ridley Scott still shows why he is the master of visuals, managing to capture stunning scenery and make the universe almost believable. He also nailed the style of this film, which mimics Alien beautifully, but to no end. Unfortunately these are the only things that he got right. Now don't get wrong, I really wanted to enjoy this movie, as a fan of the original films, but this was such a mess it made for some unpleasant viewing. I have seen several reviews on here saying this film is 'perfection' or 'don't listen to the haters', I believe these to be the minority. Having viewed this last night, as the final credits rolled, there was a stunned silence, as if everyone was mourning the death of the Alien franchise, which directly contrasts these reviews. This film was bland, predictable and trite. Although I have to applaud the clever and manipulative marketing , in which attached the Alien name to this project, that way you would be tricked into seeing it, as let's be honest no one want's to see Prometheus 2 now do they?The film opens with some gorgeous visuals, with Michael Fassbender discussing creation, the main theme of the film. This however felt shoehorned and forced. These themes are explored throughout the rest of the film, but in a heavy handed way.We then move into the more traditional action sequence to get the 'plot' moving on. Cue the introduction of the dire crew of the Covenant. These characters are so tedious I can't even remember their names, bearing in mind I saw this yesterday! The film then progresses into a carbon copy of the Alien, where the crew has to investigate a distress call after which all hell breaks loose, no surprises.Now this would be fine, if there as at least some character development or some reason for the viewer to want the characters to live. Instead you passively watch as cardboard cut-out after cupboard cut-out are brutally murdered. You begin to question every action taken by the crew, taking you straight out of the movie, and leading you to questions like 'What will I be having for dinner?' or 'When will it end?!'.Now poor characters aside, there is some satisfying gore for those who are into that type of thing, but the SFX of the Alien are so lame it taints this. This brings me to the main problem of the film, for every good moment there is a terrible one directly after, which drowns the effect of the good moment. The pacing in this film is all over the shop, from long boring scenes questioning creation, to bizarre overtly sexual scenes where Michael Fassbender revels in his own greatness where he kisses himself (Yes this actually happens!). On to rushed action sequences, specifically the ending, that leaves viewers bored to tears. Now, I am being harsh on Mr. Fassbender who did in fact shine in this film when compared to the rest of the actors, not to say they were terrible, they did an acceptable job with the script and direction they were given.Everything in this movie is predictable, the main villain of the film (the Xenomorph aside) is so obvious I am surprised the crew could not see it from space. There are little to no jokes to give this film a sense of humanity, not that it should be laugh a minute. I was however surprised Danny McBride was not awful. His appointment to me was nearly as baffling as Vince Vaughn in Hacksaw Ridge, but both worked just fine.The one good thing about this film is it makes you appreciate the original franchise much more. Hopefully the Blade Runner:2049 will be a greater effort than this. This film tries to give an explanation into how the Xenomorphs came to be, but I feel this is a question people really didn't want answers to, and the actual answer comes as a detriment to the franchise. However, if I do have to give a recommendation I would say this, if you like mindless gore, mediocre acting and Prometheus go out and see this film. Otherwise stay at home, pop in your DVD of Alien and have a blast.",Alien - Covenant
768,steerpike_2002,It's all downhill from here for Alien,5,24 May 2017,"I feel that I can't review this movie without spoilers, so SPOILERS! ""Alien: Covenant"" must have been a very difficult movie to write. The film has plenty of flaws despite there being the remnants of one or two good films in there.The key flaw in the movie is in its characters, of which there are many, of whom very few have a clearly defined purpose or persona. The main character, Daniels, played by Kath Waterston, is a Ripley/Shaw wannabe, who I felt never deserved to become the protagonist through actions she made, unlike those other two. About 2/3 of the way through the film she emerges as one of the remaining crew members and becomes badass all of a sudden. It seems that Ridley Scott feels that one of the defining characteristics of an Alien movie is to have a strong female in the lead role, so here's one! Billy Crudup is also built up to be a main character, and almost makes it as the best character in the movie. He's just killed the gooey alien that decapitated his crew member, delivering one of the best lines of the movie along the way, and then...oh, he for some reason falls for David's trap, despite clearly not trusting him moments earlier and...yeah he's dead now. Well that was a shame. Then there's Tennessee, played by Danny McBride. His wife is dead, so he's the reckless one I guess. A bit like Parker, maybe. Nah he never gets that level of characterisation. I guess he'll be dead at the beginning of the next movie. Oh well. At one point in the film, when they were exploring the planet I thought oh, some of them are scientists and some of them are more like soldiers, that could be a cool dynamic. A day later, I read through the character list and see names like Karine, Ricks, Upworth, Hallett, Ankor and I think who? What? Were they characters in the movie I just watched? I guess one of them was probably the woman who got decapitated and two of them were the ones who were killed in the shower. I guess.I should mention Michael Fassbender's two characters, David and Walter. David is the only character from ""Prometheus"" to make it into this movie, and it looks like he'll be the only character from ""Covenant"" to make it into the next movie. But I remember another character from ""Prometheus"" who seemed like a bigger deal. Who was that? Noomi Rapace played her, I think. Remember when Ripley was the main character in ""Aliens"". That made sense, because she was the protagonist from ""Alien"". The story was a continuation of her journey - in fact ""Aliens"" symbolically seemed to work as a way of her moving on from the trauma she faced in ""Alien"". I guess the studio didn't like the fan reaction to ""Prometheus"" so decided that Scott had to go in a different direction, and he made David the main character. The result is a film that is simultaneously a dissatisfying sequel to ""Prometheus"" and a dissatisfying prequel to ""Alien"". That the end of this movie seems to take us narratively further away from the set-up for ""Alien"" than the end of ""Prometheus"" is a worrying sign that there's a lot more movies on the way. Scott probably has them all worked out, but Fox will probably insist on a new direction when this movie doesn't make all the money they were hoping for. I'm guessing the result will be an incomprehensible mess that satisfies no-one.The next key flaw after characters and plot is atmosphere. I actually quite liked ""Prometheus"" because it was scary. It helped that the characters had motivations that seemed to relate to the plot of the film, but on a basic level I thought that the threat posed by the monster, you know the alien, was real and effective. This was missing from ""Covenant"". Partly this is because there are several aliens in ""Covenant"" that follow after one another in the movie. We have 3 separate gestation events (some of which are inexplicably short compared to the other movies) that lead to 3 successive generations of threat. Because they don't get the time to generate any connection to the human characters, like the sole monster of the first movie, the moments when they are inevitably dispatched in a cool action set-piece just fell kind of flat. It doesn't matter that Daniels and Tennessee destroy the monster on the landing craft, there's another one in just a few minutes. ""Aliens"" doesn't rely on this - the threat there is the sheer number of aliens to fight, but this movie does, and it fails. The aliens kill a bunch of characters whose names I do not remember and then they are killed by the characters whose names I do remember. Tension does not feature.So what is good about the movie? Well, Ridley Scott knows how to make a movie look good. The production design is predictably good and the film works shot for shot. The performances are pretty decent I guess - Fassbender is the only actor to be given a real character and he does a good job of it.Much more than ""Prometheus"" this film heralds the end of any expectation that this series can deliver any more good films. It's not Ridley Scott that is ruining this franchise. It is the fact that Fox simultaneously want to expand the franchise, which requires careful world-building, but clearly won't stick to any long-term vision for it. It is already practically incomprehensible now, and let's be honest - it's going to get worse.",Alien - Covenant

771,hugomf85,How to sell your masterpiece for a dollar,4,5 January 2018,"Mr. Scott was a visionary artist, he made many great movies, but perhaps his masterpiece was Alien. 
Prometheus, and specially Alien: Covenant are true testimonies that Ridley Scott's creativity and talent are depleted. I think an artist has to come to terms with himself and realize it's time to settle down and retire from his craft while he's still worthy of appraisal and make room for new talents. While debatable, i think he should have done it right after Gladiator. 
What's saddest is that he seems to have no respect for his life's work, which he defiled with both this movies. Alien: Covenant is like the sound of a stone hitting the bottom of a pit, you know you reached the bottom. My hopes were low, but this movie surprised me in a very bad way.
To keep this review short and simple, this could have been the work of a standard Hollywood director no one has ever heard about. This movie was made to further milk the cow that is the Alien franchise and Ridley Scott is perfectly OK with that, by all means.
If you're an Alien fan, or at least found the movie to be great, this will probably destroy your perception of the original film. It is so bad it has the power to do that- So save yourself from watching this, i'm sure many of us would like to unsee this movie.",Alien - Covenant
772,Manolo2001,Mr. Scott what have you done to the Franchise !!!!!!!???????,2,8 July 2019,"I can´t understand what would make a truly remarkable and experienced director make a movie as bad as this, considering his extensive, first hand and thorough knowledge of the franchise, his access to good screenwriters, access to a large budget, and most important of all, his access to great actors.
To sum things up, the plot has two relevant points, first when they have the accident and are forced to land, and then the last bit where David is in control. After those initial 15 minutes and before the final 15 minutes, this movie is probably some of the worst story-telling I've seen in a while, it's not just full of holes, ridiculously irrational, illogical and bizarre. It is quite frankly disrespectful to the audience. This is mainly due to the moronic stupidity of a crew that is charged to fly hundreds if not thousands of colonists to a new planet, you would tend to think that the screening for these positions would have been a bit better, at least requiring a minimum of IQ, a personality test if some kind. Seriously, I mean it simply makes no sense that for the sake of effect a group like this is presented, to be honest, after watching this movie, you are left with the lingering idea that Ridley Scott's 10 year old grandchild wrote the story and they just went with that, no questions asked. Another lost chance to make this franchise great again.
This movie feels like the plot/story belongs to a SciFi channel B movie (or rather D movie) but with A grade special effects. I know it sounds weird that I would watch this movie again, but I saw it again on cable last night, hoping something that could redeem it for me, but it was a total and complete waste of time.

Persons in command make decisions best for the ship and its mission, not for altruism or charity. A REAL ship's captain would have abandoned the exploration team, with regret, and continued on the mission. And why was the captain endangering himself and the mission by going ashore? The away team should have consisted of three or four of the most expendable member of the ship's company. There would have been much more drama watching the person in charge making hard decisions and trying to solve problems rather than provide the Aliens an all-you-can-eat buffet.

What made it so extraordinary for me, was the fact that, although everybody - good or evil - made at any time reasonable choices, the story drove on like an express train, fast and on track. I loved it! ""Alien: Covenant"" IMHO is the exact opposite. Only one sane decision by any of the character, and the story immediately would have come to a screeching halt. Others have laid out here all the half-wit actions that sadly were necessary to keep the story going, so there is no need to repeat them. In fact, about half way into the film I stopped fighting and achieved a level of total suspension of disbelieve, this must be this Zen thing everybody is talking about. Then the movie became somehow bearable. The visuals were nice and the acting of Katherine Waterston and Michael Fassbender was fine. However even their talent couldn't save the script.

It was better than Etheus-Prom Stars. It felt like it was assembled by a team of janitors sent to mop up the mess Prometheus made.Fassbender was brilliant. The art department gets an A+. The script was... meh. The characters were paper puppets who only became interesting while dying. At least fans of the Aliens franchise have prequel films to rival Jar-jar's trilogy! So that's good. Hopefully Giger's aliens will get sent to Naboo to space rape the Gungans in an epic Star Wars / Alien crossover. Then fans of both franchises can rejoice.Covenant came across as 3 or 4 separate movies aptly Frankenstein-ed together. Clunky and sloppy but able to shuffle along at a decent pace for 2 hours.I realized that Papa Ridley's films need a strong, smart, tight script in order to be great films, otherwise they turn into visually interesting (but boring) non-sense. There's enough good stuff in Covenant to make it worth watching, and I think that might be the saddest thing about this movie, that it was so close to being a great film. So close.

It started with zero character development, proceeded to a bunch of idiots not wearing protective suits when deploying to an alien planet they discovered a minute ago, and ended with standard alien corridor slasher shot with zero suspense or momentum building. Also it now takes maximum 5 minutes for a human to get infected and ""give birth"" to an alien creature. Prometheus wasn't a perfect movie, but I liked it.

782,rubellan,"So, you hated Prometheus? Well, then this is what you get.",4,22 May 2017,"Well, you know what haters? This is what you get for your reaction to Prometheus. That's right, I blame this disjointed, paper thin, lackluster film on those who moaned to no end about Prometheus, which I thought was a very good movie. Ridley Scott originally stated he wanted to move away from the original Alien with Prometheus, but when the public slammed him for such a thing he had a rethink and decided to try to give the public what they wanted. Problem is, he sorely misunderstood what that was.In Alien: Covenant, Ridley Scott tried to appeal to the lowest common denominator. The story line is weak, the effects are destroyed by an overuse of CGI, there's lots of gore, and the disposable characters are all pretty dumb. He even throws in a pointless shower sex scene towards the end of the film that ends in predictable death. I have to wonder if he put that in with good intentions or if he thought ""This is the crap that you want, here it is"". But then there are other embarrassments about this movie. When a woman decides to give a man who is convulsing and bursting with blood a consoling hug, just seconds after beating on the door begging to be let out of the room, I literally burst into laughter. It was ludicrous. And as others have mentioned, there's nothing unpredictable about anything. You know exactly what's about to happen. The dangling carrots are right on screen: ""Oh look an egg opened. Oh look, the guy is being lured to look into it. I wonder what will happen? Oh look, the creature jumped out and attached to his face. Oh look, an alien bursts from the man's chest soon after the creature comes off his face."" Yes, it's all that predictable. And Ridley Scott seems to love the idea of crew members being made up of the occasional couples, and then killing one off fairly early so we can see how the remaining grieves prior to having to move it aside to continue with the issues at hand. And the ending reveal was not much of a revelation. It was pretty much set up from an earlier scene that was cut away from just at a crucial moment. Hmmm, I wonder what happened? Duh, it's pretty obvious.But it's not a total disconnect from the previous movie. Alien: Covenant picks up 10 years after the events of Prometheus. Prometheus ended with Shaw and David's head blasting off to the planet of the Engineers to find out why they wanted to kill the human race. (Just watch the news on a daily basis and it will become quite clear). But apparently they decided less on finding a reason and more on revenge or an experiment. Basically, the ship arrives to the planet while the engineer species looks on, only to be doused in the alien producing germ that immediately destroys the entire population within minutes. OK, that was productive. And while we are initially led to believe that Shaw repaired David and then died on an alleged crash of their ship, it's eventually revealed that Shaw just became a vessel for another of David's alien experiments. That definitely cheapens the events of the previous film. The rest of the crew on this latest doomed ship is gradually killed off by various types of aliens. It's almost like a video game. And the familiar looking monster doesn't even appear until the end. Problem is when it does, it is not the sneaky bugger from the first film. It's a poorly animated replica that bounces around at the speed of light. But any potential terror was gone because the overall movements of the aliens looked to me like unnatural cartoon monkeys.The opening of the film is the familiar intercepted signal from another planet that must be investigated. The signal this time was Shaw singing a John Denver song. No, seriously. David is the star of the movie, and he's become even nastier than he was the first time. And even though his ""brother"" Walter is a more modern model with greater capabilities of survival, he still gets bested by David in the end. So the bleak ending of this film is that David is viewing the colonists hibernating on this latest ship as more chances to perform further wonderfully pointless alien experiments. I do agree that this is a poor film, though perhaps not as bad as many would have you think. I just cannot wait to see what mess Mr. Scott comes up with next.Prometheus was a very cerebral film, and I liked that layered element despite the flaws in that story. I personally would have preferred the alien really being what we originally thought, a life form native to another planet. Instead, it suddenly became the creation of yet another alien breed who was also responsible for the creation of humans. That definitely dilutes the original story in not the best way. But now the series has been painted into a corner and I cannot see a satisfying way of getting out. I think when/if Ridley Scott sees this to some sort of completion (which he better get on the ball because he's already in his seventies), I suspect he will look back and think he should have just left it all alone. But then the next hack will come in and take it back to the awful Freddie vs Facehugger vs Jason vs Alien territory, and won't that be a joy!",Alien - Covenant
783,zampino-2,The Story Continues to Unfold,9,25 May 2017,"Having followed the Alien saga from opening night of the first movie, I found this an excellent addition to the story. The story has taken twists and turns along the way, this being the 2nd part of the prequel that leads us to the setting for the first movie. I have some questions left, and there's a gap that presumably the next movie will fill in. That said, I find Scott's progression (pre-gression?) of the story an interesting explanation, furthering the metamorphosis of the Alien species, and also the treasonous behavior of the androids. I really enjoyed Fassbender's dual roles in this movie, and while you could predict where Walter/David was heading, it still left me on the edge of my seat right up to the end, fitting for an Alien movie. There's good homage to the earlier movies that made it a fun ride. One last comment, I've heard from several that the acting was stiff, particularly in minor characters. That's true from the very first movie, and my expectations are the same for this movie; there's a certain ""B"" quality paired with ""A"" graphics & story that keeps me from thinking this is more than it is.

Plot holes or stuff added just for the sake of it, manufactured tension between the crew for the stupidest reasons etc etc etc... If they didn't attach the Alien franchise name to this project, it would have been a half decent space horror.

785,dysamoria,Alien Covenant and Prometheus serve only one purpose,1,30 May 2018,"... aside from cynically making money on a ruined franchise...These two films can only serve one actual purpose: being a cautionary tale against ever allowing corporate America (especially a Wall Street-listed entity) to ever conduct their own space exploration/colonization efforts. What other takeaway is there from this film?The message, intended or not, is that corporate-funded expeditions will be loaded with naive idiots who have zero training, whose missions will have absolutely zero safety protocols/mission priorities. If these missions have any such protocols, they are meaningless when the missions are crewed by people who are guaranteed to not follow a single protocol, letting impulsivity, selfish emotion, and sheer naive stupidity get the best of them at all times. These are not professionals in the ideological sense. They are merely people who have been paid to do something they are clearly not qualified to do.Was anyone on these two missions (Prometheus and Covenant) ever trained in any specialty relevant to the mission of dealing with unknown alien environments? Did anyone have any interest in protecting the mission and its members (or protecting the mission from its own members)? Clearly not.The irony here is that the death of expertise in filmmaking is what causes the unintended cautionary tale of the death of expertise in space exploration in these scripts. These characters stumble stupidly into their contrived scenarios because of the lack of knowledge, skill (or just the sheer disinterest) of the scriptwriters, and everyone responsible for approving said scripts.There is nothing else of value in these films (certainly not the anthropocentric cliches of gods, techno-fantasy creationism, and narcissistic father figures). I'm pretty sure this ""message"" is not what Ridley Scott intended. He has demonstrated the same behavior as his films' characters: impulsive decisions are executed on while proper planning is dismissed.Ridley Scott is George Lucas ruining a franchise all over again, except Ridley Scott does it differently:Lucas succeeds at outlining a long-term serial, but fails as a director. Ridley Scott succeeds at putting interesting visuals/action on screen, but fails to justify any of it through solid plotting and planning, utterly ruining a series by retconning the best bits into cliches, forgetting what made the original work, and clumsily/hollowly repeating elements of the original with the misguided notion of ""that's what the fans/studios want"".When we begin watching a fantasy film, we agree to suspend our disbelief enough to follow a story in a fantastical environment, reached by fantastical methods. Throwing character incompetence in our faces does nothing but sabotage the willing suspension of disbelief. That kind of thing is for sitcoms, not techno-fantasy. Nor does it help to push a series of retcons and shove cliches and cynicism down our throats. This isn't entertainment. It's punishment for anyone with a lick of intelligence, education, knowledge, and sensibility.",Alien - Covenant
786,claudio645,Very disappointing,2,21 May 2017,"Before I start, I really must stress this includes spoilers.I'm beginning to doubt Ridley Scott. This movie, as far as the characters go was basically a b-movie teen horror flick. People wander off by themselves, no normal or expected precautions are taken and we even have the obligatory sex scene killing. The ship takes a detour from their colonization mission to check out an unexplored world. Nevermind they've done extensive research on their intended destination and none on this new one, they go straight down to the planet without EV suits or any real intelligence gathering from space. There are no precautions taken for diseases, microbes etc which you'd expect to be taken by a group of astronauts and which the original Alien crew took. Characters wander off by themselves to ""take a leak"" and predictably are infected. Even after they have sick crew members, does anybody put on a mask? Hell no. The one sop to rational and standard medical precautions (quarantine) is rendered meaningless because the person instituting them has already taken a spray of blood to the face. If it was a disease, the rest of the ship and their cargo of 2000 colonists are all infected. These actions go contrary to current medical practices, never mind those less than a hundred years from now. A ship carrying 2000 colonists and isn't capable of landing on a planet only carries 1 passenger shuttle and a cargo shuttle? Do they plan on making 100 trips to the surface when they get to their colonization destination? It's manufactured drama. A synthetic they know from reports by the manufacturer is dangerous is welcomed with open arms. No precautions are taken.I guess if you're not going to be worried about diseases why worry about a known serial killer?Every single character acts less like a professional and more like a 16 year old on a camping trip. Emotions control all their actions, but not in a believable way. The crew doesn't want to go back into stasis after a catastrophe kills some of the crew and 47 colonists (they even seem to forget about the dead colonists after that initial report going with ""2000"" anytime it comes up later). Instead, they decide to go to an unexplored but closer planet. If they were so concerned with safety wouldn't they take at least minor precautions with their new destination? If they were actual astronauts concerned with power, food and water supplies wouldn't they continue to their well-scouted original destination? Send out a satellite or two? We have drones now, wouldn't they have some equivalent 80-90 years from now? Wouldn't they take some time exploring the planet and its ecosystem before jetting down in the only passenger shuttle they have? Even the final twist is telegraphed well before it happens.There are no real surprises and I felt like I was watching Troll 2 in space. Ridley Scott has made some really good films but this one is a stinker. Bladerunner is one of my favorite movies and I won't be looking forward to Bladerunner 2049. He still doesn't accept the inner monologue of Deckard is what makes the original so special, turning science fiction into a film noir masterpiece like The Maltese Falcon.

788,sullybolly,Predictable and Unsurprising,6,10 July 2017,"All throughout this film there's moments where things could take an interesting turn but for some reason don't, as if Ridley Scott was forced to make it.From the beginning we have losses, losses through cliché moments used to establish the good vs the bad, losses which offer potential that's unrealised and makes you question why this has to be the narrative of those characters, and losses which people seem to get really easily over to the point where it's more than just them focusing on the mission, I mean it's like the actors weren't even told that the scene they were acting in would be post them losing someone.The CGI, although not horrid and aside from the Alien, it does seem like a bit of a rushed job and is kind of immersion breaking.There's lots of interesting concepts which aren't fully explored, like if with enough time Walter could have the freedoms of David, Walter and David's relationship, and why were the predecessors to humans so primitive in contrast to their advanced capabilities. I will say that I don't know if I liked this primitive look the creators of humans had thing all too much, as I liked the mystery we've had with it so far in the franchise, unless I forgot something in the previous films where their culture was revealed.The whole film seems to fit this cookie cutter role, where the outcomes are pretty damn predictive, unsurprisingly are there to capture emotion from the audience but also make space for a sequel, and don't often enough leave a lot of mystery up until their realisation.At least Ridley's still able to capture that anger, sadness, frustration, and all of those feelings, and the movie doesn't feel like a chore to watch as it moves quite swiftly.It's an okay film, and it has moments which peak the curiosity and creativity, but they're too far apart and few, and there's nothing new here with what the Aliens do. I mean it's people go to a planet, some get turned into Aliens and no one knows what to do other than that Aliens are bad, a few people die just to get that shock value and to kill them off for added isolation, and at the end the Alien dies I give it a 5.5/10.",Alien - Covenant
789,stuart-12777,A true disappointment......,1,14 September 2018,"Alien and Aliens were masterpieces and having watched them when they released way back in the eighties I am totally mystified and disappointed as to see how far the franchise has fallen. If I had had the misfortune to paid to see it, and as a fan I was close to doing so, I do not think I would have lasted 15 minutes. Empty, one dimensional, without humanity, warmth, humour, the list is endless.. If you are a Aliens fan please do not take any heed of the current IMDB over 6 rating. It is truly an awful film.",Alien - Covenant
790,turanic-23064,Prometheus>Covenant>Nostromo>Sulaco and David is sick...,6,12 May 2017,"To be honest I actually wait when Ridley Scott stops making films about Aliens and makes a grand Sci Fi where the characters discover a Dyson Sphere or a Rama ship...That soundtrack that they used in both Prometheus and A.C. implies ""WE WANT TO EXPLORE, WE DON'T WANT MORE OF THE GORE""... Prometheus was more about exploration to a certain point, but with Covenant they ran out of Steam completely... The trailer implied that in a film you would see what happened to Elizabeth, why the Engineers created that virus, but what we get is no explanation whatsoever, to be honest the story route ""David is a sick bastard"" reminds me when in ""Matrix"" Wachowski suddenly decided to make agent Smith the root of all evil...Overall the film was enjoyable to watch once, but not a single moment left me surprised although the space scenes were visually great... The main character of this film is not Daniels it's David... The moment when first chestburster appears is literally Ridley's ""Look, look!! - I created it and not anybody else!!!"" The metaphor of the final scene when David saves a couple of alien embryos is not for the sake of a sequel, but it's for the sake of saying:"" - Come on , you know who is the main character there, nobody cares about another female survivor or a deep space exploration mission, you all came there for the gore...

791,alva3901,A solid film that deals with thought-provoking philosophical ideas,6,8 July 2017,"Alien: Covenant is a film that stays true to form in terms of the general formulaic story line it tends to follow within the Alien franchise. However, this does not detract from a largely more suspenseful and dark film compared to its predecessor, Prometheus. Ridley Scott handles this film with enough precision that the stories and philosophical ideas (however convoluted they may be) are treated well in the context of the over-arching plot. Though the attempts, or rather the execution of these thought-provoking ideas into the film could've been done much better. With some worthwhile action and terrorizing aliens, the blockbuster aspect of the film is done very well. And though the plot does become slightly rushed towards the end and somewhat predictable, it is still a very solid movie and a film definitely worth watching",Alien - Covenant

There is not one comment in the whole film about the race of engineers as they never existed 4. David as a free will android and the creator of the aliens makes no sense at all 5. a huge ship with colonists with David in charge goes to its destination to do what?6.

793,justinpkelly,"A solid, satisfying sequel to Prometheus",6,19 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant was easily one of my most anticipated movies of the year. I wasn't the biggest fan of Prometheus, but I was very much looking forward to seeing how they would continue that storyline. I also love the original Alien and Aliens, so that contributed to my hype as well. Despite being slightly concerned by the somewhat mixed reviews that the movie was getting before seeing it, I left Covenant feeling like I pretty much got what I wanted.Firstly, I need to give credit to Michael Fassbender. He was amazing in the movie as both Walter and David, the two android characters that played a major part in the movie. Every single time David, in particular, was on screen, I was completely sucked into the movie. The chemistry between those two characters, despite both being played by only one actor, was absolutely incredible, and the way David tries to change the way Walter feels about mankind was fantastic. The big reveal of the movie is that David essentially created the Xenomorph. The way they explained how he did it was glossed over pretty quickly, but I was able to mostly understand that he basically cross-bred creatures that were created by the black goo to make them. To be completely honest, I did not need to know where the Xenomorphs came from. The scariest thing to humans is what we do not know and what we don't understand. That is why the way the Alien was introduced in the original Alien was so perfect: they were just sitting in eggs in a spaceship on a deserted planet. The fact that we do not know why they are on that ship or where they came from makes the creatures so much more scary. It also adds to the idea that we really do not know what exists in outer space. Nonetheless, we got the explanation, but I actually found it extremely satisfying, mostly because David is such an intriguing character.Although I loved David and Walter, not a whole lot of the other characters were given enough to make me care about them. I liked Daniels and Tennessee, but I barely remember any of the side characters and some of them felt like they were in the movie for the sole purpose of dying. I think having better characters would have elevated the movie to another level but unfortunately, 90% of the character focus went towards Walter and David and I would have liked it if some more attention was given to the other characters (although, as I mentioned, I LOVED every scene involving those two characters). Another problem that I had with the movie was a relatively minor one, which was that the creatures in the movie were entirely CGI and looked terrible. When I had heard that the Xenomorph was going to be completely rendered on a computer rather than being a combo of animatronic puppetry and CGI, I became nervous. And my fears were realized: the aliens in the movie look completely and utterly fake, particularly the Neomorph. The Alien animatronic from 1979 looks 100x better than the computer generated one in Covenant, and there is no excuse for that since the movie came out a little under 40 years ago.Despite the issues that I have with the film, I still really like Alien: Covenant. It felt like a combination of Prometheus and Alien, with an added intensity that was not seen in either of those two movies. I am beginning to get tired of this franchise, and I hope Ridley Scott doesn't make more than two or three more movies, but I was still very much satisfied with this movie and I look forward to seeing how its story continues.6.8/10 Grade: B-",Alien - Covenant
794,cmpatterson-86493,Alien: Covenant (@cmp_moviereviews),6,17 August 2017,"Franchises within the horror/sci-fi genre tend to unintentionally get comedic with each sequel. This particular franchise is a prime example of that. While the original ""Alien"" is a straight up classic horror film dressed up in science fiction, each follow up after ""Aliens"" falls short. However, with Ridley Scott back at the helm, and Michael Fassbender in excellent form, the horror has returned with this latest installment. ""Alien: Covenant"" plays out a lot like a horror film in not all of the best ways, but it still manages to create genuine thrills and bring a little bit of clarity to its mysterious origin. #aliencovenant",Alien - Covenant

After the first death, you know exactly what will happened next without any surprises!!

796,alglasser-53401,Better than Prometheus but nothing great.,7,19 May 2017,"For Alien fanboys such as myself there was one big question surrounding this film. Was this going to be Prometheus 2 or an Alien reboot? The answer is yes to both. While Ridley Scott fancies this to be another deep drama about the origin of life, clearly the Hollywood money lenders let him know that if this didn't end in some serious Alien action he'd never make another film again. For me to consider this film successful it had to accomplish one thing. Make me feel less irritated about having spent two hours of my life sitting through Prometheus. While I think this film has the potential to be just as controversial amongst fans as Prometheus was, I'd say they gave me enough to satisfy the requirement. They definitely ended the Prometheus story. They didn't necessarily finish it, but they put it to rest. While Alien Covenant is probably the best film in the Alien franchise since Aliens (Alien 2) I felt it still came up a bit short because it doesn't really know what it wants to be. It felt like they had two scripts, Prometheus 2 and Alien reboot. They tried to smash them together into this weird Sci-fi/horror drama. The story dives into a classic theme of whether technology is good or evil. In this film that technology is creation itself. There was heavy emphasis on the concept that when something is created often something else has to die (a metaphor used all throughout the classic Alien films). To keep you from being bored to death by all this they shoved in some classic alien stalking the stupid human kind of action. Unlike prior films they didn't rely on camera and lighting tricks though. They actually showed off the monster in several forms. I give them props for that as it was kind of cool. All in all I'd say this was a decent movie that will probably appeal to the masses more so than the die-hard fans. Unlike Prometheus it doesn't leave you asking the question ""What the hell just happened?"" so I'd consider it worth watching but not worth raving about.",Alien - Covenant
797,raa-55017,"Average, but has something missing",6,4 June 2017,"Alien, the cult Sci Fi movie that incited fear into the hearts of millions, was first released almost thirty years ago in 1979, and director Ridley Scott has shown no sign of ending his continued franchise. Being the now sixth film in the series in the series, 'Alien: Covenant' follows 'Prometheus' (2012) and continues the prequel series that the English director has initiated in this modern era of film making. 'Alien: Covenant' repairs what many disliked about 'Prometheus' (not enough Xenomorphs!) and manages to surpass as a satisfying summer blockbuster. However, the film unfortunately lacks the suspense and characterization that made the original so memorable.Ridley Scott has a lot to be praised for, even though Alien: Covenant is not a perfect film. The visuals and atmosphere is near flawless, as well as the silent yet booming perfection of the sound design. Scott perfectly captures the isolation feel and creates stunning imagery of the planet and surrounding areas. The special effects, specifically those for the many aliens present in the film, are top notch and are well integrated with practical effects. All the acting should be praised, especially Michael Fassbender, who, despite his enormous role in this film, steals every minute that he is on screen.Where the film lacks, unfortunately, is in the tone and script. Ridley Scott's attempt at creating a hybrid film that balances Prometheus with the terror of the original Alien generates lots of tone- related issues. Towards the beginning, the film felt more familiar to the classic Alien, with foreign lifeforms bursting from bodies and white-knuckled terror ejecting everywhere.Then, halfway through, the film shifts towards more of a Prometheus sequel and immediately unhooked my unwavering interest with long, expository scenes that leave you more confused if anything. Then the third act suddenly returns to a more horror-suspense vibe with Xenomorphs and other action everywhere. These clashing tones make Alien: Covenant feel like two different movies smashed into one. Also, gone are the days of fast, nippy dialogue that made the originals so potently fresh. Alien: Covenant has extremely wooden dialogue that is filled to the brim with exposition. You usually don't see and conjure things for yourself here, you're instead told what you need to know.The film is fine, but disappointing since many were wanting to see the 'Prometheus' story line explored more.",Alien - Covenant
798,tpark-46368,"Review Scores Ruined by ""Fans"": Watch and Judge for Yourself!",10,21 May 2017,"Minor spoilers ahead.  I give this movie a 10, though I believe it to be a solid 7.8. The  movie, as I write right now, stands at 6.9. The lower-than-expected  rating is mostly by disappointed fans who wanted something for  themselves. It is my hope that I compensate for the senseless and  immature 1 star reviews. Movies, as are all forms of expressive  mediums, ought to be viewed in light of a movie's entertainment value,  narrative mechanisms, and, most of all, in light of the movie's genre.   I see people disappointed about the ""plot."" It should be noted that the  Alien franchise was primarily a horror franchise. The current  installation brings the franchise around to its horror roots of the  first Alien. Having that said, horror films by nature deliver very  little plot: People flee and get killed by monsters, only one or two  survives. So over-analyzing the main plot arch is an unjust and  unproductive thing to do. Think back to the original Alien. Only a fool  would say that the plot was ""good."" What made the first movie great was  not the plot.  What is productive is the background theme and the way the movie makes  you feel. The movie combines the suspense that was absent from  Prometheus, and the mystery that yet surrounds the Engineers and  Xenomorphs excellently. The movie teases tiny bit about the Engineers,  satisfying the curiosity I developed for them in Prometheus. But above  all, I think Ridley Scott pulled what the original Alien movie did  right: suspense. The suspense mechanisms were not as masterful as the  first, to be sure. But it still has traces of a master filmmaker.   The elements I have mentioned would bring the movie to a good 7.3. But  I am compelled to add another .5 because of its thematic approach to  the franchise. The movie continues the philosophical dialogue that  began in Prometheus. It does something that the horror genre rarely do,  and the movie does it well; it is a bold move that paid off.   Is this film as good as the original? No. But it is a horror film that  transcends the horror genre, leading the audience to engage  intellectually.",Alien - Covenant

In general Alien: Covenant is atmospheric as much as uneven. It combines the philosophical features of Prometheus with the horror features of the first Alien.

There is plenty of room for doing something really nice in the next opus too.This movie quite explains in the first 5 minutes why prometheus was such a mess and who was behind it, it is also the real origin of the Aliens.Furthermore, it seems that most people forgot that in EVERY Alien movie characters make absolute stupid decisions (besides Ripley). This is exactly the same thing here in Covenant.Some spoilers on old aliens i guess if anyone on Earth manage to not having seen them yet...OG Alien - Everyone goes alone chasing the queen, leading to all their death. The first dude also stares at a biologic egg for a while who in his/her right mind would do that ? The dinner : You got a guy, with an alien sticked to his face, said alien just dies for no reason, dudes says ""hey i'm fine"", so, yeah, let's just invite him back to dinner and forgot anything happened, right ?AlienS - Too many bad decisions to count, between a total useless lieutenant and a corporate monster, 75% of the marines get killed for no reason. In 3 and 4 people tend to have much better decisions but, surprise, they aren't corporate crews, they are either inmates or mercenaries. All the ""corporate dudes"" in 3 and 4 are total morons too.So, yeah, again, in an Alien movie, with a corporate crew, people make bad decisions, big surprise there. Spoilers here (but very very mild) Also, people complain that they don't send the android scouting alone on the planet... They have only one and he's the only one able to fly the ship unless you want the crew to never sleep.Why they have only one ? - Because it's probably more expensive than the whole ship; we don't know how much it costs. - Because profit - And, most of all, because in Scott's Aliens, human life is totally worthless, it goes way below a cat's life, for example. And that's my whole concern with Scott : he HATES humanity. The older he gets the worse it gets. The whole purpose of prometheus was to show that mankind was worthless, that we were created by and that we created ourselves, much more advanced beings. The precursor dudes destroys Wayland like a 1$ fake barbie doll even tho that person is, probably, the most brilliant mind on Earth. Covenant is just one step further down that rabbit hole.Which is why, I honestly think Ridley should stop directing Alien, as he is too self destructive. Better leave Denis Villeneuve or Gareth Edwards do the next Alien, it would be much better.",Alien - Covenant
804,Vishboy,A good movie in its own right,7,11 May 2017,"Reviewing any new movie from a ""legendary"" franchise like ""Alien"" is tricky. For fans of the franchise who have seen the 4 Alien movies and the 2 Alien v/s Predator movies and the Prometheus, the ""awe"" factor diminishes with each subsequent movie. However, for anyone who picked up the series from Prometheus or watching it for the first time, this movie holds extremely well. First the plot summary: In 2104 the crew of the colony ship Covenant is bound for a remote planet with two thousand colonists and embryos aboard. While en route to their destination, an energy surge from a nearby star damages the ship, killing its captain and waking the crew. As they repair the ship, the crew intercept a radio transmission from a nearby planet and decide to investigate as the transmission is human in origin but the planet is supposedly lifeless.Alien: Covenant is the continuation of the Prometheus movie (and be mindful that the events of the original Alien movie is still 20 years away). At the end of the Prometheus movie, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and the android David (Michael Fassbender) flew one of the ""Engineers'"" ship from the moon LV-223 in search of the Engineers' home planet. While what happens to Dr. Shaw is revealed later in the movie, David is now the sole occupant of the Engineers' planet. The crew of the Covenant face unimaginable horror on the planet in the form of the alien creatures. There is a lot more blood and gore compared to the previous films in the series. Michael Fassbender plays a double role-he is an improved version of the previous android (David) with the Covenant expedition and is named Walter. The interactions between David and Walter are some of the highlights of the movie as it explains a lot of plot lines.Obviously, Michael Fassbender is the highlight of the movie in both his roles. Apart from that, Katherine Waterston character as Daniels is the only other that creates an impact. Rest of the crew is too monotonous and doesn't connect with the viewer. Production values are of the highest quality and the first 20 minutes or so in the space setting, the movie hits all the right notes in terms of the build up. The Alien planet is depicted well but the eeriness is missing which was done so well in the original Alien movie. The ending provides further scope and hopefully another movie is made that takes it closer to the story of the first Alien movie.Overall, a fine movie in its own right and for anyone who gets introduced to the franchise for the first time.

So, this past weekend Alien: Covenant premiered on HBO. The best thing about this film is the visuals. Ridley Scott really knows how to give his audience a feast for the eyes with the way he creates the environments for his films. That's the only reason I'm giving this review three stars. Beyond that, this movie is absolute rubbish. I read the novelization last year and enjoyed it despite the pathetic storyline the novelization was based on. Alan Dean Foster brings the chills and thrills better than the screenwriters ever could!! The main reasons I was turned off: the stupid decisions the crew made, final fate of a certain character, the process by which one of the parasites cause a crewmember's death, & the ending(which I chuckled at..lol!). Also, the amount of gore was a bit much. Sure, by now my comments are nothing new, but I had to give my opinion upon viewing the film out of curiousity. And now, since Disney has acquired 20th Century Fox, I don't think we'll get another good Alien film.

Why are they straying from their mission and putting everyone at risk?
Aren't there protocols for off-world exploration? (apparently not)
Why are they freaking out during an emergency? Where is the discipline?
Why can't they handle firearms properly?
Why are they not communicating effectively with one another?I'm left with more questions than answers after watching this movie. It was disappointing. The effects were good, but standard fare for any modern movie. Ultimately the story was lackluster and the movie didn't have the same level of endless suspense as, say, the first Alien movie. Ridley Scott did far more with less in his 1979 movie, but he seems to have lost his way since then.Save your attention for something else unless the Alien franchise is a 'must watch' for you.",Alien - Covenant

Planet itself was immensely foreboding, especially taking into account the events prior to events of the movie. I just loved the feel of that place, it really did creep me out, and that's not the feeling I get often.Also, even more than before, movie deals with some very interesting topics regarding creation. Dialogues are very well written and acted. Michael Fassbender performance for me was mind blowing.Soundtrack was superb, it reminisced of the original score from the first Alien movie.Basically, I'd probably rate this movie somewhere around 7,5-8, but just because I see so many supposed Alien fans bashing it, I give it 10 stars to compensate for the hate it gets.If you're a real Alien fan, you will enjoy this, unless you're watching the movie and waiting for the slightest mistake/mishap in plot/action, so you can go into a full nerd rage mode, and bash this pretty movie on IMDb.",Alien - Covenant

A space crew man taking a smoking break in 2109 and people referring to cigarette papers as we all still roll our own cigarettes or joints.
22nd Century can come up with androids but doesn't have the intelligence to send and unmanned probe to the planet and report back while continuing their voyage. Then when they get to the planet they send a human crew with no environmental protection(just like Captain Kirk would in the 60's) land on the planet, instantly we already know they are going to be infected. They could have sent Walter or a drone but no lets all go down on alien planet and trudge around with no gloves, masks and expect to come back unharmed.
Why do only women wear singlets? This is not about erect nipples or men displaying biceps.and machismo. Not a professional look for a seven year voyage

I won't attempt to answer all the questions for you, because that's half the fun, but to look at Alien: Covenant solely on its surface is a poor way to view and critique this film.Where to begin though?I guess I'd begin with Prometheus. Prometheus was an epic-scaled science fiction blockbuster that was Ridley Scott's (trumpets blare) return to sci-fi. And it left a lot of people disappointed. I loved Prometheus so we won't debate that movie here, but you can't look at these movies as analogies to the original Alien film or its sequel. They're a whole 'nother beast. Prometheus asked a question and answered it. Who created us, and what do they think of their creation? That answer may have confused and turned-off some portion of the audience, but let's face it, a film asking these questions, and setting it in a universe with acid-blood aliens is not going to offer a very peaceful or answer to ANY question. This is a horror franchise, set in a scientific world. The monsters, the Gods, the creators, are enigmas and they are without mercy. A:C asks where are we going and what awaits us?And Ridley Scott informs us, just like in the fabulous The Martian, that space is cruel and unpredictable. It's not sabotage or a creature from the unknown that causes the initial problems of the Covenant it's simply unpredictability that leads them to make a choice out of fear and curiosity that sets the films events into place. So, Alien: Covenant. My first critique is after the initial prologue, I felt the movie moved simultaneously too quick and too slow. An online promo video introduces us to the Covenant crew, but if you haven't seen that you have no idea who anyone is, their relationships, the fact that they're ALL couples, or why they're on this mission, and even if you have seen it, that Last Supper scene is sorely missed from the finished product. Keeping this film a tight two hours is a good idea, but I don't think the cuts should have come from the first 15 minutes of the film. I do agree that the foggy relationships between characters could have been prevented very simply and very quickly right up front in the film,The rest of the movie moves like a freight train, which may have turned some viewers off, but it's another way to keep you on your toes. Nothing is concentrated on for too long, nothing overstays its welcome and the quick pace forces an anxiety and tension that a slow plodding plot couldn't have withstood. Let's face it, in horror movies a majority of the cast is monster bait. I come from a generation after Sigourney Weaver was already a star, and the original Alien doesn't surprise me with her survival, so the fact that I see this cast as full of unknowns now, reminds me that the first time I watched Alien I didn't know who Tom Skerritt was, or Ian Holm, or John Hurt, or Henry Dean Stanton -- they were all monster bait. It is weird that the first victim in A:C and the second in Prometheus are smoking weed, but maybe either Ridley is a fan or isn't a fan, I can't really tell. The rest of the criticisms I see are that ""oh, they go down there without protective gear"", well they're on a futuristic space ship that can probably read the atmosphere and THEY KNOW a human sent a transmission from there at some point so, probably pretty safe. Or: They fail to kill the Alien early on – you know, like in all Alien or monster movies. Soyeah.And some have claimed that the David and Walter scene was scarring, or homoerotic or ruined their ability to appreciate the Xenomorph and to that I have to call out bull***t. Just F***ing B******t.One, Fassbender and the film crew put in an incredible amount of work to show the dichotomy of two characters that were both built by the same corporation yet have completely different programming, and two, the effect of having them interact with each other and their dialogue is superb and provides an awesome insight into both characters and plants a seed for the ending.Again I'm not saying there isn't a flaw in the movie, but people are way too quick to react negatively.You wanted claustrophobic horror? Check the cave sequences or the running through the ship sequence at the end. You wanted military shoot-em-ups like in ALIENS: see the field sequence or the Oram / Tunnel sequence.If you liked Alien 3 there's something there for you too. I've said it plenty throughout this review, this film has flaws. Almost all movies do. There are very few perfect films. I consider Alien to be near-perfect, but it isn't perfect. Some reviewers on the internet believe that every film has an obligation to deliver them what they like, how they like it, and surprise them in ways they like. If a film doesn't meet that criteria in spectacular fashion they deem it as a failure and a pock on the face of a movie they enjoyed when they were 12, sitting in a dark room late at night and not know what to expect, and that's no way to experience an interesting, action-packed horror, science-fiction Alien movie that has plenty of cool gore, action, suspense and ideas to make Alien: Covenant a joyful experience, so enjoy it for what it is.",Alien - Covenant

I found the movie less driven by horror and more driven by despair. The films seem to be in a constant state of retconing and rebooting. At this stage I'm not even sure the aliens are aliens.The cast did a great job, although I found the heroine a bit pixie- ish, but the script, oh man, there are scenes where they didn't even try. The flute/recorder scene was just weird.The big twist is so obvious you can see it a mile away.I think my biggest problem is the absolutely complete bummer these movies have become.

How do you train a crew for 10 years and they go off the rails that fast?Here's the thing...back in the 70's when Alien started, films were very director driven. They had substance. In today's producer-driven Hollywood, they do what's safe and lucrative. Ridley Scott is not exempt from this. He had a chance to do something interesting with Shaw and the Engineers and just flat out whiffed.

817,DreadfulA,A tragedy,2,27 May 2017,"That is what Alien franchise has become. While alien xenomorph might be close to a perfect creation, Alien: Covenant is just the opposite. Since watching Prometheus the first time five years ago I've been waiting this sequel more than any other movie. It really baffles me how lazy effort Covenant is, because it doesn't really venture or expand the Alien universe like Prometheus did. It just leaves you cold and frustrated.Spoilers ahead!During the first 30 mins I thought I was watching some random, generic scifi movie. I didn't feel any excitement, eeriness or mystique like with previous Alien movies. The characters were the most stock, bland and moronic up to date. I honestly can't even remember their names, so I'll just introduce some of them. The crew of so called scientists include a necessary cowboy character (with a suitable hat of course), a black man (who has sex with a white woman), a clueless captain (who is a captain just because the real one dies instantly, poor man won't even survive the cryo-capsule), and of course David... I mean Walter... no, I'm sure it's David.The story in a nutshell: The crew wakes up from a cryostasis because the ship ran into a ion storm, okay. Then they pick up a signal from a nearby planet and decide to go there instead of continuing to a planned destination that is suitable for all humans on board. The new captain takes a crap shoot and abandons 10 years worth of research and preparation just for a quick computer analysis and a song that the message carried. They land on a storm for no reason, encounter growing wheat on the ground (yes, Earth wheat) which isn't explained anywhere in the movie. They encounter Aguilar... umm, David and take all his lies and stories without questioning the countless bodies and ruins laying around them. And why do they always have to look? If a giant, slimy egg won't sound the alarm for you, then what will? The most tragic part of the story is probably Shaw's demise (the heroine from Prometheus), who ended up as David's lab rat. So sad and infuriating. It's fine by me if David wants to be a creator and a destroyer for unknown reason, but his motives are uninteresting because he's an android. And how the hell he created an egg/facehugger with no Alien queen around? Wow!Talk about plot holes galore. I'm not even going there this time, but who ever wrote this crap should be prosecuted. This is probably the biggest insult to an audience and a fan base I can remember. As if Ridley Scott raised the finger as a token of disrespect to his earlier work and to all of us who still love the Alien universe. Please, Mr. Scott, leave the franchise to someone who still has passion and creative talent left.Looking back Prometheus seems now like a masterpiece in comparison, even though I severely criticized it's flaws back then. Felt like my deepest fears would have come alive in the theater when I realized, that Covenant manages to surpass Prometheus in all its idiocy and illogicality. This time not even visual effects save it from disaster: CGI is poor, surroundings are bland, sets are small, atmosphere is non-existent, and even some of the musical themes are recycled from Prometheus. And what is worst, it's not even scary. The unnecessary gore and vulgarity don't equal horror.All in all what a letdown and a good example of uninspired, talentless movie(money) making.",Alien - Covenant
818,JoeBagz,Alien: Covenant... Does Not Deliver,2,29 August 2017,"No spoilers. Here's the thing, Alien: Covenant is a sequel in an anxiously anticipated trilogy but also the latest edition in the 4-decade long Alien series of films. This association/connection to the past brings not just anticipation and excitement but enormous expectations that the story/screenplay utterly fails to deliver on. Even as a stand alone sci-fi film the story line would present issues to any adult audience. The crew supposedly trained an extensive period of time for their mission but their lack of critical thinking about anything is difficult to get past. All the more surprising because the very talented director Ridley Scott also directed the original Alien film back in 1979. He's familiar with the story so what happened with this mess??? Casting is only so so, perhaps with a better story their individual talents could have made a difference but they collectively didn't work here, not at all like a crew and way too stupid/obtuse to believe. Did like Katherine Waterston though. The one positive aspect of the film is the CGI, it's great. To be honest a huge part of the problem for me, fair or not, is that Alien: Covenant is tied to the conclusion and promise made by its predecessor, Prometheus. The ongoing search for answers to where we come from and how humans evolved from the advanced civilization we presume to be responsible. All I'll say is regrettable they totally blew it off. Too bad.",Alien - Covenant

The only real relation to the Alien enemy are some references to Prometheus and some aliens occasionally appearing for a couple of minutes, but the frequency of their appearance makes them act as a secondary enemy. In this movie, the real enemy definitely seems to be the android. The end of the movie left promises for one more sequel, but i can't even imagine what will be about, based on what i just saw.

I finally watched it in 2 parts over this past weekend.The first half of the movie had me skeptical. It felt formulatic and i had seen it all before, reminding me very much of Prometheus. When I was forced to turn off the movie due to life interrupting, I was not even sure i'd bother finishing it.The following evening I decided to continue on. Glad I did. The second act delivers on quite a few levels. The xenomorph action is well done and downright scary at times. A few CGI scenes break the illusion but mostly I praise the film's treatment of the xenomorphs. In that regard as an Alien film it was quite satisfying. The homages to the original films were a welcome addition. All the while we get revelations about the origins of the xenomorphs, setting up the bridge between this film and Alien. The characters were merely adequate. No Hudson, Ripley, or Burke level interest here but I found McBride's character and Daniels at least held my interest and I was able to root for them as they attempted to escape with their lives and battled the xenomorphs.Of course Fassbender puts in a good performance, but i would have enjoyed getting more into the human characters of the film vs the time spent fleshing out the android.Still, considering where this franchise has been, this was better than I expected and stands alone as a good, entertaining flick. It's first and foremost a horror movie and absolutely delivers as such. It's a hard R movie folks, meant to scare, gross out, and amuse. Well done xeno scenes, attacks and deaths. While doing so it carries the story of the xenomorphs that much further, making this flick both thrilling and engaging as the second half unfolds.Best Alien movie since ""Aliens"" (which let's face it will never be equaled).

828,davidbailey-51541,A lousy payoff for one of science fiction's most enduring mysteries.,4,13 May 2021,"I found Prometheus to be a little cryptic and occasionally flawed but generally enjoyable, not the case here. What made the Alien and why is finally answered but I would honestly recommend imagining your own ending instead of watching this. I'm not including any spoilers but I would urge anyone watching it to consider the ancient mural of a classic Alien in Prometheus and the engineer found in Alien. Plotholes the size of Saturn abound and it's not just the central mystery that suffers because of this.Huge swathes of the religious allegory laden mysteries of Prometheus are ignored and a lousy origin story for the Alien is revealed. This shabby writing is exposed by watching any moment of this snoozefest- characters will say something that seems like it's intended for pathos, but then never address it again (For example: the vice captain of the crew talking about his beliefs making the crew uneasy, then it's never mentioned why or in fact ever again.) in a manner vaguely reminiscent of Tommy Wiseau's breast cancer subplot in The Room. The characters largely behave in ways that further the plot regardless of logic and are basically cardboard cutouts for monsters to kill. Also the Aliens are all far to easy to kill(Remember the hard time the marines had in aliens? They're trained soldiers and using weapons at least a century more advanced than the colonists should have here)

829,greenmemo,A dive into the heart of darkness,5,20 May 2017,"Let me start by saying that it is my opinion that, despite including xenomorphs, this movie belongs less to the Alien universe than ""Prometheus"". I guess Ridley finally indulged himself and shot his ""Paradise Lost"" project, he just didn't tell us. ""Alien: Covenant"" is a strangely distant film where there is a fundamental disconnection from the human characters and the action from let go. Whoever told you that this is an immersive experience has been lying to you. The actors seem awkward most of the time and they are allowed very few moments of sincerity by the poorly written script. Or maybe it is a calculated albeit misguided move intended to infuse a misanthropic feel to the whole enterprise. The second act, populated by ghoulish creatures that appear to have emerged from Goya and Hieronymous Bosch's paintings, includes several references to the director's masterpiece ""Blade Runner"", and it is there where Ridley Scott's craftsmanship really shines. The dynamics of the characters' interactions in this second act have some dream logic to them that works wonders, fueled by the pictorial and literary references. This is the heart of the movie, which blends superstition and technology in a rather puzzling way, depicting an imaginary realm where androids think and talk beautifully, but rather irrationally, and where common sense inquiries from their human counterparts are frequently scrapped for no apparent reason other than expediting a sudden demise. Like in ""Prometheus"", once again, several circumstances that precede the action of the film are deliberately obscured, either by omission or by way of an unreliable narrator, keeping the motivations of the main character an enigma. Then then the third act arrives and it is a convoluted mess. You are confused in the same way as when you move from one dream to the next in the course of one single night. You've been watching something close to a Ken Russell film, which turns briefly into a Michael Bay one. Daniels switches modes from teary widow to fierceless heroine, we have no idea how she comes up with her plan to fight the alien because she actually hasn't seen it yet or knows what it is capable of. The second encounter with yet another beast is another anticlimactic head scratcher, followed by the telegraphed ending, that sets up for a sequel which promises more of a hitleresque Fassbender running his human farm. This movie truly is a dive into the heart of darkness and it is unclear how the franchise will emerge (if it does) from such an experimental and likely unpopular digression into more familiar terrain.",Alien - Covenant

I tend to be grumpy when films are considered, especially as I'm born and raised true _Sci_-Fi genre fan as well as the Aliens one. So first I tried to find anything in this production worth praising. I failed miserably as the only two good things I could say about it is: when you are an idiot on the unknown planet you will die - this is the basic truth you can derive from the story, so it has educational value for future space explorers and preschool children in general, I watched the film not in 3D so my head hurt only for other reasons as below.I'm also very sorry for the actress playing main character as she is several levels of magnitude better than the production as a whole.There is literally no scene in the entire scenario that has at least a drop of sense. All the story elements seem to come either from cheapest childish comic book, some junior wannabe copywriter sure to make money as he works on such a big franchise he does not understand the least, some dark corners of creators mind full of unexplained fears and deviations, or simply out of the blue... Another thing is nothing works it this world as it is supposed to. Be it technology, human relations, biology, even ol' good gravity - it behaves exactly the way it is needed in a particular scene but does not follow any usually applicable standard rules or logic. The film is also 100% predictable - you will know what will happen at least 15-30 minutes upfront. The part of the scenario, that was probably intended as the biggest suspense, is so obvious the moment it starts that it is just pathetic...But most of all this film is boring. Boring so much that it is probably the first time in my life I seriously considered leaving the cinema. And already after 30 minutes... I was checking my watch several times during the show, again I think first time in my life. Film is full of long scenes that were possibly intended to be deep and meaningful but ended up as completely unmoving crap. The flow is: nothing new, nothing interesting then some blabbering meant to be philosophical, kind of ""the big and eternal questions"" one but flat and constantly missing the point, and then someone ""suddenly"" dies in horror class B full of gore scene that is so predictable you won't even feel a thing.

835,mxmtitov,How NOT to colonize a planet,5,18 May 2017,"After watching Alien: Covenant I can't stop thinking that all these movies are based on one underlying condition: human stupidity. If it wasn't for the characters' doing their best to win the Darwin Awards, we wouldn't have any movies. Let me explain.With the Universe being >14 billion years old, and the Earth ~ 4.5 billion years, any other planet which is as old as Earth with an atmosphere resembling that of the Earth, will inevitably have some sort of life form. And even if for some reason the evolution didn't create intelligent life (though I'm sure it would), there would be Life. Therefore, the whole idea of bringing in people to colonize this kind of planet is stupid in itself. Colonise my ass dumb-ass.Then. Even if, for some reason, due to some really bad catastrophic events, some life form on this Planet had been annihilated, but the vegetation is booming and atmospherically everything gives you thumbs-up, then we already know who will probably inhabit this kind of planet. Guess who can survive most dramatic cataclysms? Micro-life, bacteria and viruses. Some of which, as we already know, can even survive in the outer space without any problems. Can you imagine, they don't even need spacesuits to survive? And we all know it because that's what Earth went through quite a few times.Therefore, those ""colonizers"" who jump out of their spaceships without any proper reconnaissance are going to win the Darwin Awards by default. Why the *beep* don't you give the robots do their job, dumb-ass? Are you so unhappy that robots took away some of your jobs that you want to take away some of theirs too?And what kind of instruction tells them to walk around this planet without wearing any sort of suits or protection! Oh, is the Earth-ish atmosphere good reason enough? Did they forget that it wasn't just the European colonizers who wiped out the Ingenious population of the American continent, but the microbes?

836,stevie-parmentier-360-779691,Better than Prometheus ... but not by much,5,4 November 2020,"Let's get it out of the way first: yes, this movie is a more coherent, less cluttered movie compared to Prometheus. Yes, the story makes more sense, yes it's a more traditional ""alien"" movie, ... but that's about the most positive things I can say about the movie.Remember the 80's where movie characters were generally bad-ass, entertaining mofo's? Where you felt you were watching strong, mostly competent people who mostly got wrecked by circumstances out of their control? Well, this movie is the exact opposite. You got spineless wimp after spineless wimp and on top of that a female protagonist who, just like in Prometheus, is completely unlikeable as well as being very weak (especially compared to the original movies that had multiple strong female characters). The entire cast is unlikeable with the only exception being, ironically, the android.Just like Prometheus, the movie is full of plot holes and mistakes, characters doing stupid things to progress the plot and lots of other lame and dated tropes that only serve to make you want to stop watching out of frustration. Hollywood, you know what people want to watch? Competent people. I mean, they're running an extremely expensive colonization ship, is it that hard to believe they would get the most competent people for that, who have been drilled to perform well under pressure?What we do NOT want to see, is people inviting danger, people making idiotic decisions (like, ""oh someone is in danger but we have a slow person with us. Let's not get a few people to rush ahead to help them out but let's all move at the incredibly slow speed of the slowest person so we get there too late"").Basically, if the crew made even half their decisions using their brains, the movie would have been over much sooner. And that's why the movie is terrible - the writing is so contrived it relies on these screw-ups to progress the plot instead of, like in the original ALIEN movie, using proper circumstances to drive it.Ridley Scott truly lost it - with proper plot driven elements and better characters, this movie could have been so much better.

On arrival the crew begin to find out that this new paradise is actually more dangerous than it appears. From the start you meet the new crew who are nearly all forgettable and expendable, Katherine Waterston is kind of bland in my opinion as the main human character, i found the only memorable human i can remember is Danny McBride and that may only be because he wore a cowboy hat. Micheal Fassbender has great chemistry with both his characters David and Walter and their connection together feels more human than any of the actual humans in this film. If you were expecting more knowledge about the Alien mythos and engineers then this film will help answer some questions, but only some, mainly explained by David. There are different versions of the Alien that make an appearance on screen and all add a really intense moment to each of there scenes but due to moronic crew screaming and crying, tripping over and shooting the roof kind of takes the seriousness away from the scenes and makes them more frustrating than enjoyable. The final action scene with the Xenomorph feels rushed and slightly forced, shooting the alien out the airlock and into space might sound like a fun throwback to the original alien but it just falls flat and feels lazy. Also the end scene were the viewers find out Walter is actually David feels horrible forced and predictable, the writers cant really believe that the audience couldn't have guessed that after the ending to the fight scene between Walter and David.One positive i can say would be the cinematography of the movie. visually this movie is a great watch and the planet looks great. Its also great to actually see the Eggs and the Facehuggers get their intro into the Alien universe. As this was meant to be Ridley Scotts prequel coming back up to true Alien(1979) form i feel it didn't really reach my expectations, Iv heared Scott has plans for more sequels to connect this to his original Alien but as each one will come out i feel they will lose the general interest from the public and will slowly simmer out.",Alien - Covenant
838,eobame47,It is just dumb. Complete disregard for safety and security.,4,20 May 2017,"Apparently films don't exist in the future, so none of the crew has seen a horror movie. It seems every single stupid decision people make in horror films is in Alien: Covenant.Just for starters, here is something we all learned a long time ago from watching the first Alien: quarantine. If you're on an alien planet, and an alien organism infects one of your crew, don't bring that crew member into the ship. Isn't there a Ripley on board, someone with common sense?Another lesson from Alien and its James Cameron sequel Aliens, if you see something that looks like alien eggs, and one opens up when you approach it, back away from them, shoot them all, burn them, destroy them. Don't go in for a closer look.And if you're on an alien planet, with alien wildlife and plants, bacteria and viruses, maybe you shouldn't poke things, or go off on your own. Maybe you should wear a breathing mask, and take other basic precautions, so you and your crew don't infect something or get infected.Why? About every ten minutes I was whispering that at the screen. Why do that, it's stupid.Another lesson from practically every robot movie: be careful of self aware intelligent machines. No one in Covenant got that memo.Don't give the villain who has been trying to kill you, who thought he had killed you, time to regroup and regain the upper hand. Don't engage him in a conversation just before you're about to finish him. Don't let him make a speech, as he buys time while searching for another weapon. Safety checks, quarantine? No, let's ignore all of that until it's too late and people die. Just dumb.",Alien - Covenant

Then I watched it with the directors commentary which led me back to Prometheus and now I am watching it yet again. What director Ridley Scott is doing here is playing the long game. He is not going for a blockbuster Hollywood hit. He is doing what movies and tales before movies were always meant to do. He is telling an epic story about creation and destruction as old as stories themselves. I believe I have it figured out but I must say I respect this director for going so deep and committing to such a long term project and delivering in all phases a story that touches on so many things so many can relate to. He is the story teller others will tell stories about. Thank you for your gifts to us mere mortals ;o)",Alien - Covenant
840,herman-787-132796,"A Deeper, Darker Sci Fi Horror",7,25 May 2017,"The sequel to Prometheus opens with a flashback when Weyland succeeded created an android named David. This David that accompanied Weyland to search the greatest mystery of human kind. At the end of the Prometheus Elizabeth Shaw is the only survivor along with David that she saved. many years later, a colony spaceship - Covenant - sent to search an alternative planet for human kind - along with an android crew named Walter but then an accident caused life casualties include Cap.Jacob Branson (James Franco) and some colony. The leadership falls to Oram (Billy Crudup) to lead them all to the paradise planet without give any chance for the crew to mourn and shows no empathy for Daniels (the widow). When they catch signal from a hidden planet, Oram decided to change course - with the official objection from Daniels as the second highest officer. And so they landed, but still Daniels still feel uncomfortable for this green planet hide something mysterious.So, Oram brings his exploration team along to explore and to find the source of the signal monitored by Upworth,Ricks & Tennesse from the outer. So,then two of the member secretly infected by pathogen and less then half hour, they real nightmare begins. In the middle of chaos, David the revealed to safe them...are they really save? I was a fan of Alien movies (Only Alien 1979 and Aliens 1986 - the rest Alien?Trash!!!). Ridley brings out this Alien dark scifi saga alive back from the very beginning starts with Prometheus where at the end of the movie there are only 1 human survivor, Dr.Shaw and she saved David too. In this sequel to Prometheus, the screenplay put more emotion between main characters and more of scary horrifying form of aliens such as deadly pathogen that can turn DNA of the host in less then 1 hour and breeds new life form from inside it's host body. I really love this new kind of horrifying alien form, and how Alien:Covenant build the characters that supposed to be very competent but then easily torn apart and treacherous. And Ridley successfully drag audience to follow all the way to finally acquainted with the alien that the first time Ridley brought to screen in 1979 (xenomorph) that David called so as the perfect creation. But, somehow i think that the parasite pathogen that scattered everywhere in that green horror planet is more scary and more efficient to breed vicious alien,. And by the way why the rest of the crews not showing any surprise that they just saved by a person that looks exactly as Walter? And there is not even conversation between them and David where he's came from...the connection between him and the spaceship. But i impressed the landscape shot on the green mysterious planet..and how perfectly Daniels express her wonder that they hear not a sound of birds or animal.If this planet has everything that all living creatures on earth need to start a new beginning...if this planet is a paradise..why they see nothing but just a sound of waterfall from afar.What i actually feel about this sequel is that Ridley bring this Alien saga into a new whole dimension of scifi horror...that still left questions unanswered...even since the Prometheus..why? the big giant bald pale skin hated human?that is a big question that still running around in my head. And Fasbender successfully performed as 2 android characters at the same time the sympathetic Walter and the psychopath genius David (psychopath? David is a robot for haven sake...no words can describe this). Finally, this... Ridley really escalate his Alien saga not just into a deeper and darker alien movie but a step closer bringing Alien as a new legend in the film making history",Alien - Covenant

The AI is the center of the film, encapsulated in the Alien world.I don't need to see extraterrestrial life to be amazed beyond my comprehension, the humans are enough to me. The creation of AI will add more uncertainty, or chaos, in the future and this movie made me wonder not whether, but when the AI will be the creator.I was reluctant to see the movie because of the rate in the IMDB, but I'm a strange creature and I like movies that a lot of people don't like.I did not give 10 stars because of the prediction of some scenes and the clear lack of security protocol that I didn't expect to see from humans of the future.",Alien - Covenant

Most of it was just time-filler, the sort of thing students do in an exam in an attempt to give a full answer (also known as 'waffle').The monsters reminded me of Dobby from Harry Potter, mixed in with Prometheus-cum-the earlier Alien films. It ended up like a Jurassic Park scream fest, chased by monsters movie. Very dark, little plot, poor ending. What is it about being chased that appeals to film directors so much? -YAWN-One had a sense of déjà vu, of having seen it all before.We had the clichéd baddie with the stereotyped posh English accent (Christopher Lee-style), which actually was good, as I had difficulty understanding some of the American accents.It could have been good, but came across as Fassbender in love with himself, with his narcissistic gazing at his equally pretentious doppelganger facsimile.From having an air of excitement and anticipation that this would be a great movie, I was soon bored and disappointed.It's clear from the ending that a sequel is planned.How cynical!One point for the English accent and one for the colonization plot.",Alien - Covenant

It was highly entertaining, extremely satisfying for me as a sci-fi and alien-franchise fan.However i felt the story could have had more depth - like the whole thing with the previous inhabitants of the planet as example and also the lead characters could've had more time in it - apart from Michael Fassbender as David/Walter who basically and a bit surprisingly is the lead actor in the movie.But overall it was a really great, fast paced sci-fi horror flick. I enjoyed it a lot and hope this was not the last chapter of the alien franchise.",Alien - Covenant
845,RNDorrell,"In Space, no one can hear you Yawn",3,22 May 2017,"The chief problem here is, all of those old Alien motifs – slimy power jaws, lunging facehuggers, and acid blood – have been repeatedly seen and mined already, Ridley, old bean. They're just no longer particularly scary to us any more. Seriously, this is easily the least-scary Alien film ever made, by a long stone's throw. Even the overlong and talky ""Alien 3"" had more scare power in it, here and there, than this humid dud does.I gave ""Prometheus"" a D-minus, a failing grade. The film made not a whit, not an ounce of sense, and none of the characters were likable at all, except Dr. Shaw, sorta, and the synthetic being, David the droid, with his Lawrence of Arabia complex. ""Covenant"" is just a sliver better than ""Prometheus,"" thanks to being many orders of magnitude less impenetrably, metaphysically preachy: at least ""Covenant"" delivers a rapid-fire body count, some mildly interesting space flight scenes and some lush planetary vistas amid misty forested moors. Ridley does love his cloud-wreathed mountain vistas. And at least the characters here don't engage in patently moronic middle school dialogue, a common aggravating feature of ""Prometheus."" But it's not very much better. Not even the bad guy here is all that interesting (I'll try not to spoil that one, but, jeez, it's so frickin' obvious).Other than a few background attributes – visuals, atmospherics, set design, prosthetics – ""Covenant"" has very little to offer worth spending the time it takes to watch. The cast is populated with lots of folks you're not given time to get to know, thus you do not care about any of them at all. The acting is, well, to call it fundamental would be being nice. Only Michael Fassbender (playing two androids, David from ""Prometheus"" and a new model, Walter) and Katherine Waterston as 3rd officer Daniels, perform above the bare minimal expectations.Basic premise: As we board the UCSCC Covenant, its prime crew is in cryosleep, set to be awakened seven years from now, when the ship approaches Origae-6, a world previously identified as a target for terraforming and colonization. Aboard ship are 2,000 adult colonists, also in cold sleep, and thousands more human embryos, being preserved to become a new generation on the destination world.As android Walter minds the store, a surprise solar flare seriously damages the ship's power systems, compelling the onboard computer – yes it's named Mother – and Walter, to wake them up during the emergency. After they stabilize the ship, they detect an odd signal which contains a human voice, coming from a much closer-at- hand star system, and scans confirm that one of its five planets is Earthlike. So Earthlike, in fact, that it seems like a better colony destination than Origae-6 is supposed to be. So, against Daniels' protest, Capt. Oram (Billy Crudup) decides they should divert to check out the newfound planet and find out who sent that signal.Sigh. The whole rest of the movie follows the same ridiculous pattern laid down in ""Prometheus,"" in which supposedly highly-trained scientists, the cream of Earth's intellectual crop, just decide to up and ignore EVERY SINGLE CONCEIVABLE aspect of scientific caution regarding injecting themselves into an alien environment. Worse yet, they keep doing it, in stages, throughout the middle act of the film. Forehead slap-inducing stuff.Remember the zoologist in ""Prometheus"" who, upon coming upon a snakelike alien creature with a weird flattened sucker-like upper appendage, emerging from a murky pool of water in the bowels of an unexplained crashed and derelict alien spacecraft, then decides the smart scientific thing to do is to coo in sweet-talk-to-your-dog tones to the snake-thing, ""Heyyy, babyy, hiya, sweetheart, how are Yoooo?"" And then snake-thing's flat head whips forward and attaches itself irrevocably to that dumbass's face? ""Covenant"" is chock-full of stuff like that. Are these scientists the vanguard of Earth's desperate attempts to perpetuate the human species, or are these in fact the dumbest scientists who could be found for this mission, and Earth sent them away to be rid of their dull asses?Fast-forward: Various biological versions of the alien xenomorph start a-busily-getting' born (we find out how that process has been facilitated a bit later), then they rapidly attack the crew one by one, you get lots of screaming, blood splatters, futile weapons fire, face-eating, general unfocused panic. But we do get our required ""Prometheus"" tie-in. The second alien ship found on LV-223, the one David's dismembered head could fly, apparently crashed on this Engineers world years earlier, with Dr. Elizabeth Shaw and David aboard. Or so David says.We wind up with a last battle aboard the Covenant up in orbit, and then we get a not-at-all-a-surprise reveal at the end. Which is as set-up and primed for a three-quel as it possibly could be. But by then you don't effing care, because not a single minute of the 2:03 show you just watched made you care at all where this franchise goes next, because it showed you absolutely Nothing New, and told you Nothing you didn't know already about the ethos of this now totally dramatically bankrupt series.I gave ""Prometheus"" a D-minus because it was sluggish, confused, childish, illogical and not particularly entertaining. I have to give ""Covenant"" a D, or 3 out of 10 stars, because it commits those same sins all over again, plus adds being repetitive atop it, like a stinking black-green alien cherry sitting atop a frisson of Just Plain Stupid alien resin. If not for the quality visuals and Fassbender's performance, I'd give this thing a big, wet, whopping F. Somebody really needs to take the keys away from Ridley, gently. Because in the space inside his head covering this series of stories, he can't hear us Yawn.",Alien - Covenant
846,miachristinapink,Its structural imperfection is only matched by its inconsistencies,4,22 May 2017,"***Warning, this review contains spoilers*** As a long time fan of the franchise who can still and always be totally engrossed by the very first Alien movie I found this one completely lacking and uncompelling. I am also honestly surprised that the script got green lighted to be made into a film.We follow the colonization ship 'Covenant' whose crew find themselves rudely awoken from cryosleep over a solar event that cripples the ship and leaves the captain dead. It must have been the one man with all the training on board as what follows is a string of incredulous choices for the crew to abandon their original mission and destination, to instead pursue a mysterious signal and colonize a planet they know nothing about, is plagued with violent storms that can last months and, as they later learn, witnessed a mass extinction event.None of the crew are memorable for anything but to ask dumb questions when they aren't necessary, and to stay silent when they should have dozens of questions. They wander off, get separated, don't even think of taking any protective measures like scouting, or quarantine procedures. The film completely lost me when one of the crew members, fairly early on in the movie, decides to start firing a gun wildly and blindly aboard a ship that's designed as their only means on and off the planet. Rather than astronauts, each crew member acted like a teen out of a slasher flick.Past the plot holes, lousy character portrayal the movie was also needlessly and confusedly pretentious. Where in the original Alien one can find some very subtle social commentary, here Ridley Scott's confused philosophizing is brought in a totally ham fisted, pretentious way.I am not sure where this story is meant to be taken, but apparently we're now following the story of David, the gratuitously genocide committing android. Okay? Even the special effects weren't that great as in the final act, with an unexplained second alien (we only see the emergence of one true xenomorph, but the crew somehow ends up fighting two) again being jettisoned out of an airlock I had no idea what was exactly going on as the special effects, combined with way too many quick shots, was just too much to properly follow.Also, who has shower sex after most of your crew has died in the most gruesome ways imaginable? And who designs a ship where a general alarm can't be heard in all quarters? I could go on forever, but that would be putting more effort into this review than Ridley Scott seems to have put in the script.4 stars for Michael Fassbender's dual performance and the use of H.R.

Michael Fassbender's acting was amazing, his portrayal of David and Walter were awesome and you can really see what they're thinking just from his acting. All the scenes of David conversing with Walter were excellent and the suspense of the aliens attacking the crew were exhilarating, but it doesn't change the fact that fans wanted a Prometheus sequel not a weird blend of Xenomorph origin and a Prometheus sequel with one returning character and the story told in flash backs. Ridley Scott should have stuck to his original plan of a Prometheus sequel instead of selling out to make a bad movie pretty much no one wanted. The stupidity of the crew is once again frustrating and the death of Elizibeth Shaw is just evidence of poor writing. Hopefully the sequel to Covenant will be satisfying, but based on the ending of covenant, a good sequel is not happening.",Alien - Covenant

Anyways this movie was entertaining but it was like any other Alien sequel. I had higher expectations since Ridley Scott was directing it and headlines of the films were all questions left in Prometheus will be answered in this one. Yes they were but poorly done I wish Ridley Scott start working bit harder or soon he will be forgotten as recently his direction is below average.

Good Things: Nice visuals and scenery: The spaceships look realistic and contribute to the confined space needed for parts of the movie. The planet scenes are appropriately alien with some nice touches. Interesting story line for the next movie: While the main story is hokey the backstory developed for the original ""Alien"" is engaging. Good protagonist (mostly): The main protagonist emerges as the movie unfolds and is someone you can root for (mostly).Fassbender: It's just fun to watch him perform his craft and this movie is no exception.Bad Things: Predictable: Just about every major and minor plot point, surprise, action, etc. is completely predictable. The plot itself moves in a very obvious direction but just to kill any suspense there's way too much extremely overdone foreshadowing. The movie is just boring. I actually considering cutting my losses and leaving since it's too clear what's going to happen. Stupid, stupid characters: The characters repeatedly do stupid things which are essential for the plot to move forward or for them to die. It's not long before you just don't care what happens to most of them. They also seem incredibly poorly suited to space exploration or being part of a crew. Backward Technology: For the future the technology has some remarkably archaic features like ""automated"" systems that only remind the crew to do something instead of just doing it. If you've got a technical background you can amuse yourself by making fun of the movie. Poor plot: Besides the stupid characters, the plot requires events and coincidences that strain credibility. The main plot seems to awkwardly unfold just to get to the ""Alien"" backstory.I could go on but I suspect you get the point. In summary, this movie was two hours of my life I'm not going to get back.",Alien - Covenant
851,noahlenzi,How can you love your creator if he is the devil?,8,21 May 2017,"After biting my nails for weeks about whether or not Alien: Covenant would be good I'm happy to say it is good. Just good. Not great. The pacing was a bit off and a few characters felt expendable but apart from that it was scary as hell and built more mythology around the Xenomorphs as well as our own. However my biggest let down was the complete absence of practical work on the creatures. Its all CGI and while some shots look good, the close-ups (which should have been practical) looked awful. Despite this I have to give the film a pass because its story was just the right amount of creepy, biblical, and thrilling.So far most reviews have been overwhelmingly negative. I think this is mostly due to some people having more a problem with the same cons I just talked about than I did but I also think its because of another thing. Like the Star Wars films, I think fans of the originals love to hate any new material brought to the franchise. I think a lot of people wanted to hate this movie (and for a while so did I). Before I watched it though I decided to clear my mind and just watch it. While flawed it still satisfied me as a fan of the first two (and yes) the third one as well. I think people should stop comparing this to the first two Alien movies. They're not perfect movies, there I said it. This one has more flaws than them but it still manages to be better than any of the Marvel films that people praise for some reason. One thing I do have to mention is how much in need this film is of a director's cut. Ridley Scott is the master of director's cuts. Even though it was an overall good film, it frustrates me that the prologue scenes that were made for marketing material were not in the film. They desperately needed to be in the movie. It was the character introduction for the film that should have been. The beginning of this film has no character set up because of this. Hopefully the Blu-ray will have a director's cut but if not, its still a good movie in the end. I think in about 10 years more people will acknowledge this film as a flawed yet worthy prequel.",Alien - Covenant

856,PAULO-TEIXEIRA-1977,Amazing disaster!!,2,21 May 2017,"Let me see if I can find the best way to tell you how much I hated this movie. Yes, unfortunately, I hated it.When I first saw Prometheus, I immediately liked the idea behind it. Classic mankind questions were brought into the movie and created a whole new horizon in the Aliens franchise world. Questions like ""WHO ARE WE?"", ""WHERE DO WE COME FROM?"" or ""WHY DID OUR ENGINEERS TRIED TO KILL US?"" made Prometheus a great movie in a different way that made us anxiously wait for a sequel. A sequel that supposedly would answer all these questions; a sequel that promised to explain us all the origins of Mankind and the Aliens... I WAS WRONG! VERY WRONG!!Alien Covenant turned to be a fake promise and did not answer any questions raised in its predecessor, Prometheus. Truth is, Alien Covenant just ruined it all: Prometheus story and the entire Aliens franchise!
Now you're probably asking yourself: is this guy (me) nuts? Why the hell is he (me) saying all this? Well, my friends, even being a great fan of the Aliens (apart from Alien 4 and Alien vs Predator movies), I can't agree with the mess Mr. Ridley Scott did with Alien Covenant. Let's go to the facts:(CHARACTERS)
Characters in Prometheus were not the best. They lacked personality, attitude and empathy with the audience, even if acting was GOOD, especially Michael Fassbender. In Alien Covenant, as far as anyone can see, characters are even worse! They simply exist to die, with no meaning at all. No intelligence, no interest, nothing! Acting was equally BAD, apart from Michael Fassbender, again!(REALISM)
In Prometheus we have seen at least one main stupid scene that in real life would NEVER happen: a fascinated scientist that got in direct touch with alien life with no apparent reason or care. In Alien Covenant, Mr. Ridley Scott kept thinking we all LIKED that a lot and populated the entire movie with unrealistic scenes! NO, Mr. Scott! We didn't like or approve your decisions on adding nonsense to this movie! Here's why:1) As much as an alien planet would look like Earth, no one would ever land on it and explore it without an appropriate suit and EXTREME care and attention! THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE!2) No person with a brain would ever stayed inside the same room of an ill person that seemed to be infected by an unknown origin. Much less would a normal person touch the other one with evident signs of ""mutation"" and bleeding after that. NO, Mr. SCOTT! THIS ISN'T VERY REAL!3) What kind of crew was in the ship, after all? They were supposed to be the BEST among the BEST. They carry 2000 human embryos to be taken to a planet that was long surveyed and studied. THEY should be a RESPONSIBLE crew. BUT they are NOT! The captain simply decides to investigate another Earth-like planet that seems to be sending ""strange"" signal messages, discarding the long studied planet that they were heading to just because the crew of the ship doesn't want to spend 7 years in their sleep capsules due to a recent system failure. THIS ISN'T ALSO REAL, MR. SCOTT! A Captain should be a WELL TRAINED person, prepared to make the best decisions in the most aggressive and stressing moments.4) Who in its normal state would make love in a shower knowing that a new life form was roaming free inside the ship? What the heck is that, Mr. Scott? There's an alien in the ship and you tell your movie characters to make love in a shower like if the life form was just a simple fly? THIS IS NOT REALISM!!!I could simply go on and tell you Alien fans more and more of these aberrations, but I'd just make myself BORING! All that matters about Alien Covenant is that it has no realism; everything seems so stupid to the point we wanna give up seeing the movie!!(SPECIAL FX)
Special effects on Alien Covenant are fairly decent, but not as great as in Prometheus. Some sequences, however, are a bit confusing to the eye and do not help fans to like them.(STORY)
Alien Covenant has no story. Period. Yes, I'm serious! NO story at all. It's a bad mix of Prometheus with Alien and Aliens. The result? A miscellaneous SOUP of grotesque TASTE, awful SMELL and POISONOUS consequences!
Ridley Scott had the opportunity to make Prometheus even bigger than what it was, even more marvelous than what it became. But no. He did something much worse than giving no story to Alien Covenant: he KILLED the original Alien story and the entire franchise!(LACK OF OPPORTUNITY)
Ridley Scott had the opportunity of his life. Do his best to make a GRAND Alien movie for the generations to come. Being the father of Alien, he could have done so much for Alien Covenant. He could have made it a reference (for the difference) in the Alien franchise. BUT he didn't. He shot his own son and spitted on his fans!! In summary, Alien Covenant is the WORST of the Aliens. It didn't ruin itself alone; it ruined all Aliens (the good ones and the bad ones). Even with a great photography, Alien Covenant is a movie without a soul, empty in all senses, doesn't answer any questions made in Prometheus and dares to destroy the whole Alien concept. It's sad, my dear reader. Sad but true. I'm disappointed. And I'm gonna forget that Alien Covenant ever exists. To me, Prometheus deserved a SERIOUS and REALISTIC sequel, but only got a twisted shadow of what an Aliens movie should be!Giving Alien Covenant more than 3 points out of 10 is pure madness!",Alien - Covenant
857,rubenbaeza84,Not as bad as people say it is.,7,21 May 2017,"Don't get me wrong, it's not gonna live up to Alien, Aliens or the other sequels but I honestly believe it is not as bad as people wish to put it. I'm probably more forgiving towards this series than most fans are. To tell you the truth, the fans have never been forgiving towards this series since part 3, which in my opinion is an underrated classic. The real problem with the movie is that it's too predictable and there needed to be more xenomorph. Other than that it's still a good old fashioned slasher film with big effects. I think people over blow the film because they want something that can never be achieved and that's a perfect movie and sorry to break the news but no movie is perfect and there will never be a perfect movie. If you want to know if you will enjoy this movie, don't bother talking to the fans because they still think it's 1986 and I survived Alien vs Predator.",Alien - Covenant
858,trantor2nd,Interesting addition but not awe-inspiring,8,4 June 2017,"Might have enjoyed this movie more if I had refreshed my memory of Prometheus prior to watching this. Good action, acting, special effects. Interesting story, if a bit predictable. You have to suspend your disbelief in the characters' stupidity to enjoy this. I still prefer Aliens (2nd movie in the franchise) and this segment had a few homages. Would still be interested in the next installment but won't be expecting anything awesome.",Alien - Covenant
859,ustheman,Alien: Covenant (Prometheus 2) A beautiful blood bath of Alien Horror,8,21 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant (Prometheus 2): First thing first. This is a sequel-prequel. Prequel to the original Alien universe but sequel to the first prequel in the series Prometheus. So hence Prometheus 2. If you didn't like Prometheus's open ended, philosophical take on the Alien universe then there is a high chance you won't like this film. No this film doesn't answer questions left unanswered in the first one. It's not meant too. Part of the excitement is the questions the new films are bringing up. It's 3 story arc which adds up when the last of it comes out. Just like the it's predecessor it leaves with more questions but...we finally get the sense of where Davids, the android, purpose lies. We get more of a insight to the creators of life, though like previous film it teases not answers and why creation of new species must come about with the sacrifice of the other...or should it ? Prometheus was beautiful thriller with snippets of Alien gore. Alien: Covenant is a beautiful blood bath of Alien horror galore. Acting: 8/10 (Stand Outs: Michael Fassbender can't go wrong with him no need to explain him. The one that really stood apart was Danny McBride. First serious role breaking the stereo cast for his comedic takes in films). Action: 10/10 (Cinematic beauty. An alien horror that has been crafted by DaVinci himself. Ridley Scott sticking to basics using Minimum CGI well executed production design and the blend of CGI with real Alien suits or animatronics was perfectly rendered).Sound: 10/10 (Surround sound in DolbyAtmos was unbelievable. First experience of the horror genre in an immersive surround sound cinema. You literally feel the alien breathing around you, moving around the cinema speakers).Story: 6/10 (From stand alone point it's pretty basic film. Crew ship detoured, need to escape, survival of the fittest etc. But from the grand universe scheme of things and adding to the expanded universe it was pretty good).Feels/Nostalgic: 5/10 (When making the modern take of a classic you need nostalgia. Weren't any heart throbbing tear drop moments nor linkage to previous films that made me fanboy, besides the aliens).Final rating: 7.8/10",Alien - Covenant
860,jahanzeb-farooq,A worthy successor to Prometheus,8,31 May 2017,"I don't quite understand what Ridley Scott could possibly have done to make all these naysayers happy. The very people who whined about a lack of xenomorphs in Prometheus are now whining about either an abundance of them or a lack of engineers. I personally liked it a lot and believe that it is a worthy successor to Prometheus (though Prometheus stays my top favorite of the franchise). It has the philosophical connotations that made Prometheus so great, at least in my eyes. It does answers some questions even if not all. Besides that, I don't agree with all those people complaining about how stupid the crew members are. It is because they don't know they are in a horror movie! Period. The events that occur in this movie were not something that any of the crew members was expecting. They had not seen the previous movies in the franchise. They could not possibly have, because they are IN the movie! Also I note that people are not impressed by it not because it is not good but because they have seen it all in the previous installments in the franchise. Had it been the first in the franchise, it would have hailed as a masterpiece like Alien.The cinematography is gorgeous. The xenomorphs and the newly added neomorphs are terrifying as hell. These creatures never looked so great in the history of this franchise. The winner is, however, David/Walter, without any doubts. The character's intentions were already quite obvious in Prometheus but the way he used Shaw to achieve his deeds was terrifying. I believe this movie truly deserved the R-rating it has got and had made a great use of it. The movie does feel to end abruptly, without a satisfying ending. I am so looking forward to the next installment(s) and truly hope that studio gives Scott the green light for that. This is Scott's baby and I would be so happy if he controls its fate rather than getting someone new for it (Blomkamp). I personally wanted to see more of engineers. The mystery surrounding these creatures was one of the best things about Prometheus. But probably all these people who were unhappy with Prometheus made Scott add more of xenomorphs in it and less of engineers. And the irony is that it could still not make these people happy.In a nutshell, it's a must see it if you are an Alien (franchise) fan and especially if you liked Prometheus.",Alien - Covenant
861,luialexandredsc,Don't miss this,10,12 May 2019,"I don't understand these people...
This movie is great!There's very intense sequences that scales up perfectly.

And this is the 2nd best Alien movie ever!Can't say much more without spoiling it.",Alien - Covenant
862,denvergrown303,Why do all of Ridley's protagonists have to be stupid?,5,1 June 2017,"As in Prometheus, the plot in this movie can't advance without one of the protagonists being completely incompetent or stupid.In Prometheus the SME (subject matter expert) is always bad at what the one thing they are supposed to do well. E.g. The biologist/zoologist touches strange living worm and gets bitten. The navigation and mapping expert gets lost. You get the idea.In this movie the leader is incapable of making decisions. The soldiers/security team suck at providing security, panic in the middle of combat. The pilot can't fly straight. Everyone wanders off alone immediately after being attacked by hostile alien organisms. No one asks straight questions when they are huge elephants in the room: holy sh*t, there is an ancient city full of cadavers here!? Who built the city? Are they still here? Are they a threat? Do they have radios we can use? How about space ships or weapons? No, instead they mope about their poor decisions and wander off one at a time to be killed. My point being is that it sucks that for the plot to advance, the protagonist has to be incompetent or stupid. Not only is this implausible (NASA picks the absolute best candidates for space missions, people that won't panic or make stupid decisions) but unnecessary. I really don't think it's so hard to setup a challenge in the plot where the protagonists suffer at challenges despite giving it their best. In Aliens (Alien 2), the space marine company enters in the facility and gets ambushed by aliens. Despite their firepower and blasting the crap out of every alien they see, they still get overwhelmed and take casualties. They didn't all need to stumble around, trip and fall into a pit in order to get in trouble; the aliens laid a trap and overwhelmed them. In Alien the crew of the Nostromo gave it their damnedest and still got taken out one by one.Upside to the movie: I like the way they brought the over-arching plot of the aliens to completion, explaining the variation in the different types.Still they left more questions unanswered: In Prometheus, after a spacecraft leaves the planet an Engineer kills himself and then dissolves into Earth's water giving way to life. At the end of the movie Elizabeth Shaw heads to the Engineer home planet to find out why they are hostile towards humans. Why did the Engineer kill himself on Earth in Prometheus thereby ""seeding"" the planet? Was the seeding done intentionally? Did the Engineers ever return to the habitable planet where they just left an Engineer who dissolved into the water and discover the human civilization that grew from his seed? If the ""seeding"" of Earth with Engineer intentional then why did the Engineers never bother to communicate with their creation? How did early human civilizations get the ""star maps"" that lead the Prometheus to a LV-223? Why is the Engineer on LV-223 in Prometheus hostile towards humans? Are all the Engineers hostile towards humans?Why did the Engineers create the weaponized virus that becomes the aliens? Why did the Engineers store the weaponized virus on a LV-223 in unsecured and fragile containers?Why was there a video of Engineers running away from aliens on LV-223?Why did the Engineers never send a recovery team to LV-223 to recover the Engineers who died in the installation? Why did the Engineers allow a long lost and potentially rogue ship to return to their home planet without first being screened by any sort of security (given the potential for weaponized viruses at least a bio-scan/quarantine procedure should be in place for an advanced space faring civilization)?Were no Engineers off-planet or in a spaceship when David released the weaponized virus on their home planet?Why are all of the Engineers located only on one city on their planet?One of the Engineers in David's lair was flayed, not destroyed by the virus. Did some of the Engineers survive the initial attack?If some Engineers survived the initial attack, how was David able to defeat the them?Why did the advanced-space faring Engineers not have any satellites or space stations in orbit?Why did Covenant crew only pick up Elizabeth Shaw's lingering transmission and no lingering transmissions from any of the Engineers who lived on the planet?Why was there wheat on the Engineers' planet?Did Elizabeth plant the wheat before she was killed by David, did she have seeds? Or does this mean that Engineers visited Earth and brought it back? Or does this mean that the Engineers visited Earth and bestowed wheat on the humans, only later wanting to destroy them and creating a weaponized virus to do so?Why was Walter removing a sole embryo in the beginning of the movie? Was he conducting his own side experiments?Why did the Covenant crew not have access to the same or better technology than the Prometheus crew (e.g. the geo-mapping drones, dune buggies, and space suits)?If Mother and Walter(David) could track the alien through the ship and funnel it by opening and closing doors why confront it at all?Why not just funnel it to an airlock and blow it into space without sacrificing heavy industrial equipment that will be needed for the future colony?",Alien - Covenant
863,alibaba3317,Half of Alien: Covenant is on Youtube as promotional material and not in the actual movie,7,12 October 2021,"A mind-bogglingly cretinous but visually sublime science fiction continuation from legendary director Ridley Scott. This mixed bag of a movie struggles with trying to be too many things at once, a new Alien movie, an android's evolutionary journey, and a sequel to a prequel in the form of 2012's Prometheus.Alien: Covenant feels like the amalgamation of several stories, mashed into one. In many ways, it behaves like a second sequel, in how it basically skips the ideological questions left by Prometheus, and dives right into a Xenomorphic carnage. Covenant is more about the android David's internal struggle and his desperate quest to become a God than it is a mythological expansion of the Xenomorph's origin. If anything, it's a reduction of mythology, diminishing the uniqueness of the creature. It's a frustrating afterthought; thinking what could've been, had it only been committed to one.Like most of Ridley's work, it's fantastic to look at and admire. He's impressively consistent with creating crisp imagery. Unfortunately, like times before, his work is weighed down by the writing. Like its predecessor Prometheus, Alien: Covenant suffers from an illogical and almost schizophrenic screenplay. It relies on implausible stupidity to function, which makes for an annoying experience.With that said, I adore the movie's otherworldly feeling. Composer Jed Kurzel has orchestrated a pulsating and eerie score that fits the tone perfectly. The atmosphere is something I continue to return for; it transcends beyond silly words on a page. Hopefully, this wasn't the nail in the coffin for Ridley's Alien future.",Alien - Covenant
864,glevedacier,Succession of silly decisions for a scenario.....,4,25 May 2017,"How can a scenario rely on that? I mean, it is nearly like not giving a damn about people. No it clearly is. And this is the reason why I lost respect and consideration for Ridley Scott. Alien Covenant is indeed a cash-grab. The scenario is based on a series of mistakes and bad decisions, erratic behaviors from the characters that enabled the heart of the horror to take place. This is unacceptable unless we are as dumb as sh... The sad thing is that there is a lot of beauty in this film.And the main character is a unique kind of heroin. Indeed, in action movies, heroins or female characters tend to be very manly and hire a manly posture. In a different manner, they can also display a caricature of female posture with exaggerated charisma and dominatrix behavior. This heroin is none of it. She is simple, charming and brave. Her qualities seem authentic, respectable and she can be identified to. She could have been the first, the inspiration, the model of a new era of female characters who do not have to be a castrator to forge her charisma. That heroin was sweet, without seeming weak. She was adorable.To me, Ridley Scott ridiculed himself with this film that had the potential to be great. The scenario killed it, because the editing and film making were perfect, acting also. The action scenes were too few also, and only one was vibrant. What a disappointment. This film deserves to fail to teach a lesson to production companies.",Alien - Covenant
865,invisibleman-1,"Disappointing mixture of ""Best of Alien""",3,21 May 2017,"I really looked forward to see this movie, although the trailers already gave a lot of stuff away (which trailers do all the time these days). Now after seeing the movie I must say I'm deeply disappointed.The movie starts off well, Ridley Scott knows how to shoot space stuff. We get a short look at the crew (including two main characters: a Ripley wanna-be-double and Fassbender-Android v2.0 ""Walter"") before they make a first stupid decision to cancel their original mission to follow a strange signal from another inhabitable planet. Almost the whole crew goes there unprotected and as expected, hell breaks loose when they get in contact with the black goo pathogens planted by nobody else as Fassbender-Android v1.0 ""David"". Crew members get infected and give birth to alien like monsters which in turn kill the crew one after another. Then evil David saves the day just to feed the other crew members to his homemade alien zoo.It looks like a movie that the filmmakers made a u-turn in the middle of shooting. First they were on the path to Prometheus 2. Then the whole Blomkamp thing went viral and they probably thought they needed to put more original Alien ingredients into the sauce. That way the whole Shaw story line about the Engineers is scrapped in a two minute flashback, after that the movie is basically a reboot of the first Alien. All of that results in a disjointed ""Promalien"".I found the CGI a lot worse than Prometheus. The CGI aliens look bad, especially the newly born babies which don't look disgusting anymore but almost cute. The neomorph looks fine but only has minimum screen time. The egg-facehugger-chestburster-xenomorph cycle is done in five minutes and our beloved xeno looks awful in CGI. It's not ""Alien 3"" badness, but still inferior to all predecessors (including AvP). It's really not threatening at all, it behaves more like an angry cat.The action sequences had too much fast cuts. The attack sequence in the wheat field is happening too fast, in almost darkness and with too many similarly looking characters. When they try to defeat the xenomorph two times in the end I couldn't make any sense of the action on the screen, and honestly, I didn't care. The main actress is miscast as a Ripley replacement, I never believed her when showed toughness or bad-assery.Fassbender is good as always but has too much screen time including a cringe-worthy scene with him showing his ""brother"" to play the flute. And he continues to be the villain for a potential followup movie. I don't know if I like this.In the whole ""Alien: Covenant"" is a gigantic failure. I thought I would never say that but I think the Alien franchise would do better without Scott and his irritating decisions. Like with Star Wars, the whole idea of a sequence of prequels which need to somehow connect to a lot older movie seems to generate mediocre and forced story lines. Even worse they seem to damage the great mystery of the original movies: the xenomorph is now basically just the result of the experiments of a mad robot. That's it, really?",Alien - Covenant

867,niallmaggs,Surprisingly good,7,11 May 2017,"So alien covenant is the 2nd prequel to the original alien from 1979, and a sequel to 2012's Prometheus. First off, this film is visually stunning with the mind blowing cinematography and the combination of color makes the film an aesthetically pleasing experience. As a fan of the original film, I was extremely pleased and walked out of the Cinema with a smile on my face. Not much development on the characters but the film digs deeper into back story and explains far more resulting in a back to basics horror that was what Prometheus tried to be. This film in particular, and the prequel, explore the evolution of the alien, ultimately becoming the creature that gave us nightmares. Overall the film was extremely enjoyable and not too far fetched, although the ending felt very sudden and anti climactic. I feel the film would of benefited more if there was an extra 15-20 minutes added on to give the fans a satisfying ending. I would definitely recommend to all fans of the series. I'd give it a 9 out of 10 and I'll definitely see myself revisiting this installment in the alien. Saga multiple times.",Alien - Covenant
868,cmerrittphantom,"Shouldn't be called ""ALIEN""",8,7 January 2018,"To get this out of the way, I would consider this movie perfect if the alien at the end had any effort put into it. Covenant is a visual masterpiece. It is also a deeply human film. It begins with humans. It spares little time in illustrating that humans are flawed and quite frankly stupid. This film gets so cynical about the human race. It's got a wicked honestly that stings and cuts with a chilling indifference. We see compassion from characters, optimism, enthusiasm, naivete... and it all culminates in the vicious destruction at the hands of irony.The philosophy is very thick sci-fi, but it's off screen implications are of epic proportions. The androids are the highlight of the film for, despite my love for the human characters. It is through these synthetic characters that we experience the brunt of the human story.This film is structured very deliberately, and fine tuned to accentuate a nihilistic contempt for the humans and their plight, even to the detriment of the film. The pacing is very acute, with the masterful finesse you'd expect from Ridley Scott trying to juggle his own story with the story the fans want and the story the studio wanted. The tone is thick and grows more and more suffocating as the progression through the structure nears the peak of the narrative's edge. It never quite reaches the tension of the original 1979 film's third act, and it would have certainly benefited greatly from that kind of finale.Ultimately, the twist at the end is predictable and falls flat. If more run time had been granted to add another ten minutes to flesh out the alien attack and make it more tense, the misdirection from the twist might have worked. But because the alien wasn't compelling, our minds wandered and they centered on the not so subtle anymore signs. If the alien had been awesome and the twist had landed, this movie would get a perfect score from me. The third act was way too weak, but fortunately the first two were so interesting and thought provoking and compelling that they spill some of their excellence over to the last chunk of this film.",Alien - Covenant

870,thegoatandhammer,2 hours of nonsense,1,4 September 2017,"This movie has nothing to do with the originals, it's connected loosely to Prometheus, and it is the weakest attempt for a sequel.Ridley Scott shows us just how little he cares about the source material and the fans of the series, by creating 2 hours of nonsense, fueled by an overload of plot holes and some so the dumbest and most forgettable characters in cinema history, all the while full of shout outs to the Bible, like Stan Lee in a Marvel movie.If you watched the interviews with Scott, you'll know that he has never watched Aliens, so he doesn't know about the continuity established by the work of James Cameron's excellent sequel to the original Alien movie that was directed by Scott, so naturally Scott acts like he's the creator of Aline and proceeds to do as he pleases with the Alien franchise, as he rapes the source material and shows us weak action, hollow characters, CG aliens (because who needs practical effects if you can just use CG for everything), and finally, a plot so idiotic and so predictable, that it leaves you puzzled as to what exactly did you just watch and why did anyone fund this turd in the first place.The things that this movie does teach us, is just how good the first two films were, and that Ridley Scott has a very high opinion of himself.Give this one a pass, and go watch Aliens again, it was the last good film for this franchise...Oh yeah, one last thing: They say that they are going to make six more of these turds, so get ready for Scott to full scale Terminator this thing.",Alien - Covenant
871,shanerittersbach,God bless Ridley Scott and the Xenomorph,10,22 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant, two weeks after its initial theatrical release and its already underrated!Warning: Spoilers!!!Ridley Scott return's to the directors chair once again to direct the epic 5th sequel in the alien franchise, that is if you don't count the AVP films. The film is also a sort of sequel to the 2013 film Prometheus, also directed by Ridley Scott. now, i know a lot of people didn't enjoy the likes of Prometheus, i did. It was a smart, dark prequel to the alien films. Alien: Covenant stars Michael Fassbender,Danny McBride, and Katherine waterson, among others. Michael Fassbender (Inglorious Bastards, Prometheus) plays two characters, Walter, a new android aboard the crew of the covenant, a space shuttle holding are new crew. Fassbender also plays his titular android, David, from Prometheus. David, in Prometheus, was an android who seemed normal at first but was so advanced that he gained human emotion and fought with the crew within that film. His performance within the film as Walter is intriguing and touching. He is a good character that is willing to die for a human aboard the ship. On the other hand, his performance as David is ominous and creepy. As Walter he has a standard American accent and as David he has his regular British accent. This is a strong clash between both and creepy result.Danny McBride (Pineapple Express, This is the End) plays Tennessee, basically Tom Skeritt's Character from the original, Dallas. McBride's performance is very well acted, considering he is usually a comedic actor. Tennessee overall is nice, caring character that gives the film its comedic and touching moments.Katherine Waterson (Inherit Vice, Fantastic Beasts) plays Daniels, are new Ellen Ripley. Everything goes poorly for Daniels in the film. He husband Branson played by Jame Franco is killed within his hyper sleep chamber. Throughout the rest of the film Daniel's is sad and upset, but note to self her sadness is not annoying. Towards the later have of the film Daniel's tries and succeed's to kick Xenomorph ass. The film also features some other really good character actors, they include: Demián Bichir (The Hateful Eight, Machete Kills), who plays a lieutenant on Covenant. After the death of their captain Branson they have the second in command take over, he is played by billy Crudup (The Watch).Now lets delve into some controversy, The Neomorph. The Neomorph is the newest species of alien introduced to the franchise. The Neomorph is basically an albino version of a regular Xenomorph. Its skin is pale and fleshy, it almost has a translucent quality to its skin and features. Instead of the classic tongue mouth that is usually darting out of a Xenomorph's Mouth we get a retractable mouth. The teeth and jaws pop out of the face and munch on human. When a Neomorph is born within the film they hatch out of the spinal chord and when born are really miniature versions of their adult stage. Overall, the Neomorph is a creepy yet bad ass alien that i cant wait to see again. The classic Xenomorph returns in the film. Within the film we learn the origins of the Xenomorph. It turns out that David, the android invented the Xenomorph by crossing it with genes of the Nemorph and that's how the Xeno came to be. We also get some classic facehugger and chestburster action.Now, when i went to go see the film i expected a lot, what i didn't expect was how gory and bloody the film turned out to be (That's Not a Complaint). I mean, it's really gory, like holy hell gory. I mean, there's a scene where a Neomorph hatches out of a guys mouth. Blood is shot everywhere and meat is ripped. Heck, there's a scene where a couple are having sex in a shower on the Covenant. As there going at it a Xenomorph's tail creeps under the glass divider of the shower and caresses the nude women's butt. She screams and then the Xeno's tongue shoots through the glass and into the head of her lovers mutilating his head and spraying bone, brain matter and blood allover over the naked body of the women. This was my reaction ... ""HELL YEAH!."" Anyways the film is gory as all hell and that's a good and amazing thing.The film is well directed by Scott and true send up in the series, great, its a truly gorgeous and glorious gore soaked sequel!Two-Facehuggers Up!P.S : What a twist ending!",Alien - Covenant
872,joshualawrencepike,A great disappointment,4,2 June 2017,"Alien: covenant I really wanted to like this movie, I really did. After all its a sci- fi, and some of the others in the series were amazing. I try to stay upbeat on the blog but sometimes I just can't.I think the reason it is so bad came down to the details. There were many things that just did not make sense or were not thought through, things that made me stop seeing the people as competent or even moderately intelligent. Spoilers are ahead, be warned.-The movie never really explained how they were traveling, they do not show any form of FTL but were able to reroute a bit too easily and quickly for a ship traveling relativisticly. They also acted as if they had entered the sector, done scanning then decided on the destination rather then planning their entire trip before they left.-It strongly hinted (but never said that) they were the first colony ship to go to this destination yet only had one shuttle. I refuse to believe that a ship like that could ever land, having one shuttle would be absurd. They had two thousand people to decant, were they going to spend a year just offloading people? What if it breaks down? Two shuttles would be the bare minimum. I would imagine they would have with three or four being more likely. -When they found a new planet along he way that looked better then the one that they were going to, they diverted (I doubt it would happen but I can buy this under some circumstances). The crew then sent their only shuttle down with most of the crew knowing only that it looked like earth and had a very similar atmosphere. Even assuming that they made sure the airmix was right off screen, the idea of just walking around freely on a planet you literately know nothing about is ridicules. And of course, what happens to them is a consequence of that. I find it hard to feel sorry for people who are only in trouble because of their own stupidity and lack of diligence. I might feel differently, if it was just them. They made a stupid decision and they payed for it. However it's not just them. They were reasonable for the lives of two thousand people who were in status.-The landing party split up a lot, like almost every scene. They knew enough to take weapons when they left the shuttle but not enough to stick together even when they knew aliens were after them. Is that how they were trained to act when they got to their new home?-The crew never planned anything out. One of the things I like about Ripley in the first alien movies is how she used her head, she was not just a thug or someone acting out of pure emotion. In Covenant, they mostly wonder, scream, die, then group up and do it again while yelling for the pilot to bring a cargo shuttle down to the surface (which was not designed for decent into an atmosphere but we will just ignore that part)JoshuaLawrencePike.com",Alien - Covenant

They are confronted to an alien killing the crew members one by one. They are stuck on this planet but finally they found a way out although an alien is onboard. On top of it, this movie is bringing some huge piece of information on where these aliens are coming from etc. Totally underrated imo. The present score for this piece is below Alien 3, really ?

880,moofee,An unimpressive rehash of the original - Spoiler Alert!!!,4,24 May 2017,"Here are the key reasons for which I did not like this film:1. A ship on such mission would never go off plan to explore a mysterious signal from an unknown planet. 2. Once they decided to go and explore, the captain would never leave the mother ship – the command is his most important responsibly. 3. The second in command would always be as qualified as the captain and not an indecisive wimp. 4. Landing on an unknown planet, they would never go without wearing full protective bio suits, including gloves and helmets. 5. On the ground they'd never hike 5 miles in rough terrain to an unknown destination. 6. Smoking cigarettes and cigars and flicking the butt still burning on an unknown planet – only in a bad movie aimed at the heavy smoker Asian market. 7. When they got to the settlement, a hooded 'man' comes out and says 'Follow me' and they do without even asking him who he was. 8. The next scenario is very common these day in all action movies: The brutal fist fight that goes on forever when in real life a couple of times of being thrown against the wall would be enough to knock someone out for days. But in the movies they go on and on then walk away. In this one it was towards the end when the two cyborgs were going at each other. 9. And last, which really should've been first: A total lack of originality – it was almost a complete replica of the original. Receive a mysterious signal. Land on an unknown planet. Unknowingly get infected by the monster. Have the monster emerge from the host's chest and quickly reach adulthood and terrorize the ship until they manage to jettison it into space. The added piece here was that the evil cyborg took control and planted a couple of monster embryos in the incubator, and thereby opening the door to the next sequel.I only saw the first two, and the a great part of the charm of the original was the looks of the ship. It was a mining ship returning to earth after a mining mission. Both the looks of the ship's interior and the scruffy crew was very similar to a seagoing cargo ship of our time. It was very much without all the glitz of sci-fi of today with plenty of CG and flashing light and 'futuristic' decor.My buddy with whom I watched this movie who worked all his life in the defense industry mostly on military rockets and satellites leaned over and whispered to me 'they violated every NASA protocol concerning contact with the unknowns of extra-terrestrial environments'. The example he brought up as being a lot more accurate scientifically was ""The Martian"". I agreed.",Alien - Covenant

Since I want films like this to get made and not another watered down super hero movie I wish people gave this franchise the respect it deserves. We need the sequel asap!",Alien - Covenant
882,wallisar-1,"If you liked Alien, you wont like this",1,5 July 2017,"I will say that I loved the original Alien series, despite some issues with the later sequels. I thought Prometheus was okay - gorgeous cinematography, some well done CG, an okay plot, riddled with some terribly stupid moments. I had some (but not altogether high) hopes for this sequel.The first 30 minutes or so was interesting. The moment the creature reared its horribly rendered little body, I couldn't stop laughing. Did someone actually watch this movie and approve of the terrible CG before it went to theaters? No amount of homoerotic flute playing or deadly shower sex sequences could make this work. Oh wait, they actually tried all of that! It honestly felt like I was watching a B-horror, made for Syfy network piece of garbage. I'd rather watch Sharknado.",Alien - Covenant
883,daddyxj-1,Yea...Um...OK,5,11 June 2017,"The latest entry in the Alien series is not good nor is it bad. It's just there. It's like a ho-hum episode of a TV series.The movie tries to be nostalgic with reference to the original Alien but it just comes off having a been there/done that kinda feel. I felt the same way about the prequel Prometheus and I think if both movies were stand alone film and not part of the Alien Universe my reaction to them would probably be different. In a way, I think I liked Prometheus better than this film because at least it was trying to be different and it started the series on a pure sci-fi note then divulged into horror.What I did like about this film are the following...The new neomorph.I like the way it looked and how ferocious it was.I think its look is how the alien/human hybrid of Alien: Resurrection should have looked. The effects were OK and the best action scene was on top of the freighter scene. And Danny McBride shows he can do serious acting he was a highlight of the film.What I didn't like was the story. It focused more on the androids than any other ""Alien"" film. And when the Xenomorph did arrive I was expecting a voice over saying ""and now introducing the Xenomorph"" because when it first appears something happens that is the goofiest moment in all the series. And there is a story element that changes the whole mythology of the Alien itself that I think is absurd and makes no since. Put it like this, I think this ""idea"" is so bad that I know don't care where the franchise goes from here. Now that I have the answer to the most lingering question I have always had about the Xenomorph there is no need for me to be intrigued anymore. Oh and the Xenomorph in this movie is the dumbest Xenomorph in the whole series. They are supposed to cunning and clever and they always show some intelligence. Not in this one, it runs around like a rabid dog (in fact its movements remind me of they way the ""dog birthed alien"" moved in Alien 3). And the ending was supposed to be a twist but you already knew what it was leading too (in some ways I think this was intentional). All in all, this is not a great movie and it is watchable but you will roll your eyes to some of the choices made in the film and of the mythology. If I had to rank this one out of all 6 of the Alien films this one would be #5 just above Alien: Resurrection and below Prometheus (Aliens is #1, Alien is #2, Alien 3 is #3 and yes I like Alien 3 a lot...now). When the next film comes out I can wait to rent it and just enjoy the first 3 films on DVD.",Alien - Covenant
884,steben,Pointless,3,15 August 2017,"Covenant is basically a comedy lesson in how not to plan a colony mission. Everything imaginable that the crew under no circumstances must do they go ahead and do anyway. On this level, the movie is entertaining in a dumb way, like a really poor horror film - how can a crew on such a critical mission go ahead and land on an alien planet, without safety suits, essentially with full complement of mission-critical people? When they're not even in actual danger? When they have a clear target planet elsewhere? And that's just the start. We've seen silly stuff from Scott in Prometheus, but this trumps it all.It's absolutely not worth watching. The script is so bad it's a farce. If you are a movie maker or a visual artist, there's some nice scenery and imagery you might be interested in, but I suggest you fast forward through the movie to get to it, in order to save time as well as to avoid experiencing any part of the ""plot"". The final ""revelation"" of the origin of Aliens becomes completely obvious about halfway into the movie and is just as pointless as the whole film. Nothing new, nowhere, at all.",Alien - Covenant
885,blaskofilms,Alien Origins Exposed in Bleak and Joyless Film,3,18 May 2017,"What a slog. Opening night, and not many in the audience. The Alien franchise is getting a little long in the tooth. If you thought Prometheus was oversold and underdeveloped, well ... it gets quite a bit worse.The once-visionary Ridley Scott tries to mash every high concept from both his Alien and Blade Runner universes, and yet nothing congeals. So concerned with promoting his ""new"" xenomorph, he overexposes it with poorly-filmed sequences and truly regrettable computer graphics. We never get to know a fraction of the too-large cast, and their viciously gruesome deaths leave us feeling numb and hollow. James Cameron created characters out of entire squadron of space marines; Scott can barely get us to cheer for a pair of ill-fated colonists.Bludgeoned is really the right word here. The audience gets battered by the gore and goo, yes, but also by the uninventive idea that an android would seek vengeance on its creator. And the logic of the plan is shaky at best. David (the android from Prometheus) unleashes the black goo on the Engineers, and rather than spread their DNA as it did in Prometheus, now it burns them like volcanic ash. David clearly could have used the ship and the remaining weaponized sludge to destroy humanity on Earth, but instead he stays and tinkers with the substance, miraculously landing on the facehugger egg form (yet with no creature permutation to lay it). In short, it's a film that asks a lot of the viewer, yet gives so little in return.",Alien - Covenant
886,scyphe,Flawed due to Fox compromise and script writer John Logan,5,5 June 2017,"Ridley Scott already had the design for Prometheus 2 which would follow Elisabeth and David to the Engineers' home planet. Fox wasn't impressed with the box office figures of Prometheus and wanted an Alien movie with xenomorphs. We're stuck with a compromise due to the scriptwriter John Logan:""The initial screenplay was written by Dante Harper, but an extensive rewrite was performed by screenwriter John Logan. Logan had previously worked with Scott on Gladiator. For Logan, the main concept was to combine the horror elements of Alien with the philosophical elements of Prometheus. He said, ""With Alien: Covenant, I just really wanted to write something that had the feel of the original Alien, because seeing that movie was one of the great events of my youth. It was so overpowering in terms of what it communicated to me and its implications, that when I started talking to Ridley about what became Alien: Covenant, I said, 'You know, that was a hell of a scary movie.' I wanted to write a horror movie because the Grand Guignol elements of Alien are so profound. We tried to recapture that with Alien: Covenant, while also trying to pay homage to the deeper implications of Prometheus. In terms of tone, pace, and how we chose to play this particular symphony, we wanted to create a really frightening movie.""Unfortunately he failed to reach the level of the first three Alien movies as well as Prometheus (under-appreciated) due to some rather stupid writing. When you land on an alien planet with it's own ecosystem and evolution you do NOT just sit down in a forest and mess about as if you're in your backyard. I knew before I entered the cinema that Scott had been forced to compromise his vision with Fox bringing in a new scriptwriter to replace Prometheus 2 with a low-grade Alien-prequel. The attempt to connect Prometheus with Alien(s) was too obvious. It's like Prometheus 2 was already made and they just took scenes from the end of Prometheus 2 and copied it to Alien: Covenant. All in all it was a disappointment but still watchable and somewhat entertaining. I'm giving it 5/10 due to all the flaws, the rewrite, the compromise, some silly scenes and weak writing, esp. the weird personality-change of the character David. Still, it's a must-see for fans of the Alien franchise. You will get a few glimpses from what would have been Prometheus 2 in the movie and I recommend watching the official ""prologue"" which is available here on IMDb as well as YouTube etc.",Alien - Covenant
887,herostratus-690-719695,"Great Explanation for Aliens, part II",10,27 August 2017,"Just like PROMETHEUS, this movie also gives us some important hints on the background of the first four Alien-Movies, and it is also as well and as beautifully made as its predecessor.What I found entertaining as well as annoying again was the fact, that almost the whole crew also of this space-ship showed totally stupid behavior - and therefore again was not at all suited for the job.What did Ridley Scott intend to show by again depicting weak & brainless characters, that really neither look like scientists nor that any space-company would ever hire these highly nonprofessionals? Or is it just our view of ""how a good and genuine astronaut"" has to be? The would-be-astronauts in this movie however look like freaking idiots, too, and thus would not even be hired as parking lot attendants.Of course it is always funny to see lemmings rush into their own death and demise, and they also make a great contrast to the highly intelligent artificial intelligence, but it seems unrealistic.Therefore, just like in PROMETHEUS, throughout the movie I had the impression of extreme ""unrealism"": who would hire such a gang of wrong-decision-makers and emotionally-corrupt-hysterics for any important space mission? But still overall a great movie despite the problematic aspect of mf morons running again an entire space-ship and thus miserably failing their own space-mission-job once again - and it will probably continue this way (in Scott's further Alien-Sequels)...",Alien - Covenant
888,master-bot,The horror... of wasting 2 hours on this trash...,4,5 September 2017,"In short: boring, unoriginal, and full of plot holes.You know those cheesy, boring, and inconsequential 'horror' movies where a bunch of ignorant teenagers go camping and end up all dead? That's what this was, at its core, with better visuals. No substance whatsoever! The main elements that make a horror movie effective - an scary villain, characters we care about, and an element of mystery - are all missing here. There was nothing original about the alien creatures. The baby xenomorphs were kind of cute, but certainly not anything to crap your pants about. Long gone is the horror we felt toward the xenos in the original Alien movies. They are just not scary anymore. The one new thing we learned is that the creatures like to chat with androids using language. Go figure... I just wonder how David learned to speak Xeno, and why a xeno would ever stop to have a chat with anyone. Stupid.The other villain - David - is a little more interesting, but only on the surface. It turns out there isn't much under the hood - he's just an AI-gone-bad with a penchant for experimenting on anything made out of flesh and bones. We still don't know what motivates the crazy android, other than superficial curiosity, which is what the entire premise of the movie is based on. When David showed up and saved the group (for a few minutes at least), I thought that the movie could still be saved at that point. David's appearance was a last hope for the story, because everything up until that point was just another stupid-teenagers-gone-camping-end-up-dead type of thing. But things only went downhill from there. David's story was such a letdown. Basically, he survived the events in Prometheus only to travel to another planet, kill off the entire population - those who created humans, and experiment on them. I don't even know what adjectives to use to describe this nonsense. Given how advanced our creators were (who also created the virus), I would question how any of this was even remotely possible, including how David's ship was allowed to approach the planet in the first place. I don't know how Mr. R. Scott approved this garbage. This part was very disappointing.One aspect of David's backstory is a particular slap in the face to the original Alien movies - the xenomorph's origin story. It turns out the xenomorph that we are all familiar with was the result of genetic experimentation by a crazy android stranded on an alien planet. This is such a weak story that it cheapens the image and reputation of the big bad aliens we've come to respect and fear from the first two movies. I think the xenomorphs should be in horror...While we're on the subject of androids, another weakness in the story is the fact that at the end of the movie David managed to pass for Walter and fool everyone. How is that possible, given the technology level? It's hard to believe that there is no way to distinguish the different androids. Why on Earth would Peter Wayland manufacture new upgraded androids that look and sound exactly the same as the old version, which was defective and unreliable. Why take the risk of confusing the different models? Even an idiot engineer/designer would consider differentiating the models in their appearance, or something that would allow people to tell them apart. That's just ridiculous and unbelievable. Another cheap trick to move the story along. Is this the best R.Scott could come up with to move the story along, and keep the door open for a sequel? Disappointing. The crew... I don't know where to begin. What do you get when you mix some poorly written and generic characters with bad acting? You get A:C. A bunch of incompetent morons are put in charge of the mission of their lives - colonizing another planet, but instead they decide to stop by and check out the neighborhood, and go sniff some alien spores on another planet that they know nothing about. What could go wrong... They meet an older version of the android, and even though his model is known to be unreliable, they automatically trust everything he says, given that he's been there all alone for 10 years, simmering in his own broken emotions, and doing who knows what. Oh, and nobody thought to ask David what was the flash/flare weapon he used to repel the aliens - something nobody had been able to do before. But apparently that's not important. It's amazing, considering the level of technology and importance of their original mission (colonization), how woefully unprepared these people were for anything unexpected. Their attitude and preparedness was, at best, adequate for a scenic stroll in a forest on Earth where mosquitoes are the worst enemy. I never got the sense from these people that they were on an alien planet. Utter lack of emotion. Some of the xenomorphs connected better with the audience. The characters are so generic and boring, that when they started dying off, I didn't care one bit for any of them. That's the main reason there was no horror in this horror movie. The story in Prometheus was better because it had an element of mystery, e.g. aliens created humans, but who created the aliens, etc. A:C took a big axe to all that, and all that remained was a stinking carcass that melted through the floor. Intelligent horror movies are so rare these days...Good special effects.Other than that, I wish I'd never seen this movie. I hope I can unlearn the garbage I was fed.If you do decide to see this movie, I suggest you leave your brain by the door, so it doesn't get contaminated with this virus. Watching this is like sniffing alien plant spores.",Alien - Covenant
889,joakim-ericsson,A review for those who fear something as bad as Prometheus,7,24 May 2017,"Fear not. Better characters, who are actually likable. Not too contrived, people react and behave in a sort of professional manner. Natural dialogue, no forced conflicts or too many clichés. Designs feel more industrial and true to the original series, sort of like in between Prometheus and Alien. Less foggy and confused story, stuff actually make some sense in this flic. A big step up from Prometheus, but we have seen most of it before. Good protagonist and villain though. I recommend it. Weird that this is scored lower than the last movie. Guess all the mindless fanboys had too much impact at the release of Prometheus, when it landed on 8.9 or higher, can't remember. Prefer this movie any day of the week.",Alien - Covenant
890,neilbowers73,Total let down to the Alient franchise,3,30 September 2017,"I feel I've just wasted 2hrs of my Saturday evening watching this. Thank god I only paid 99p to rent it out and not £14.99 for the DVD and I'm glad as well I didn't pay to see in the cinema. The crew of the Covenant are heading to a distant planet called Origai-6 to start a new human colony. While in hyper sleep the ship is damaged by a solar flare and the crew are woken up by Walter (Michael Fassbender). Having carried out repairs a crew member starts heading back but receives an unknown radio transmission of someone singing John Denver. Hey even in 2104 they're still listening to John Denver. They track where the signal is coming from and decide to take a look as it might be a better planet.They arrive and start exploring the planet where they discover that wheat is growing within the vegetation and also there is no sound of animals. 2 crew members decide to stay behind to take samples while the rest track down the source of the signal. This is where the 'fun' begins, While going to take a leak, of course you'd do that on a new planet without thinking will it destroy the Eco system. 1 member steps on what appears to be pods of some kind which releases a nano pathogen into the atmosphere. Which in turn enters the body of said person taking a leakThe other party discover the source and realise that this could be the Prometheus the ship missing some 10 years ago. While searching around another person then steps on some more pods and they release the nano pathogens, this time entering up the nose of the unsuspecting victim.Victim #1 becomes sick and is taken back to the landing craft medical bay where he proceeds to explode from the back and release an alien. Second victim becomes sick and they start heading back for the ship. Meanwhile unable to make contact with the Covenant due a looming Ion storm the alien goes on the rampage killing those on board. Just as the other half of the party arrives the landing craft explodes killing alien and 1 remaining crew member.By the time I'd got to this scene I had all but given up watching the film but thought I'd carry on and give it a chance. The second alien emerges from sick crew member and goes on the rampage but it's scared off by a mysterious man who is wearing a cloak. This turns out to be Walters brother David from the Prometheus. In these 10 years since it went missing David has lost a cog or two and it turns out the planet did have an alien race on it but David deliberately released the pathogens which resulted in wiping out the alien race and creating another species. Plus it seems David has been experimenting as well.After this I totally switched off and to be honest the plot was going no where I'd not warmed to any of the characters and I was just preying that they'd all be picked off one by one. As it is two, along with David survive and the ending was truly dire as well and could be seen before it got there. With Alien you warmed to the crew of the Nostromo and hoped they'd survive. Aliens was all action and of course you had Newt who was almost as tough as Ellen Ripley. Alien3 you had Charles Dances character and the brash and straight to the point Andrews played by the late Brian Glover. All characters you could warm to. This had nothing going for it. Crew member Daniels just whinged and questioned everything and then some how by default became Captain of the Covenant. All other crew members were well boring! No strength or depth to them.It's a real shame as I had high hopes for this. Sadly it is a total let down from start to finish and it won't please the die hard Alien fanatics that's for sure,",Alien - Covenant

The aggravating migraine that grips you for the first hour fades away into a bothersome stress headache as you attempt to swallow this lumpy, flavorless, unimaginative film.However, I must commend the actors for the quality of their performances. I have never witness such high caliber stars try so hard to be as absolutely bland as they could. It is truly impressive.To Ridley Scott: I beg you to retire. Let people remember you as the visionary behind the first two Alien films. With every film you put out you are becoming more transparent of an absolute hack.To the Writers: Stop. You wrote a character into a dramatic sci-fi film whose name is ""Tennessee"", wears a cowboy hat, has a Texas accent, and drinks whiskey from a bottle. You wrote an erotic scene between two Michael Fassbender robots where one tells the other that ""he'll do the fingering"". You somehow wrote the dumbest scientists that I have seen in a film. You completely under minded any attempt to have a philosophical core by having an overwhelming boring story, that moves at an overwhelming boring pace, and features overwhelmingly boring characters.

One might think that most of them want to be mesmerized as they were in 1979 with the unbeatable ""Alien"", unaware that the times were different then, the element of surprise is now lost and that its narrative formula might be seen as too slow nowadays. On the other hand, there is a public that is still mourning for Ripley e her surviving companions from ""Aliens"", dreaming of a nonsensical ""Alien 5"" to have their revenge against ""Alien 3"". And, of course, ""Prometheus"" fans, who wish to see Shaw and David meet their creators.The point is ""Alien: Covenant"" is a good, thrilling film, beautifully filmed, whose characters are captivating and are solemnly missed no matter the screen time they end up having.

I, for one, love his vision, even when less inspired (which is not the case in ""Covenant"", plenty of energy and purpose).And, then, the androids, the horrifying absence of what makes us human, and the possibility that this same absence might lead them to what ""real people"" have as the worst in their natures.""Covenant"" could be better? Of course. It's still a must see though, and aside popcorn and soft drinks, the public should keep fresh eyes to enjoy it as it was meant to be.",Alien - Covenant

These are the voyages of the spaceship ""Covenant"". Star date such and such. Following an intergalactic explosion that rocked the ship and caused minor damage, we received a signal from a nearby planet and decided (for no particularly good reason) to explore it. We sent down a party down armed with futuristic guns. Of course the planet is earth like and no space suits are needed. Needless to say, a monster attacks! Luckily, a mysterious caped man emerges from the ruins and leads us to safety. Unfortunately, some of our men have been infected and when we go back to the Ship, we must again battle the monster, which now comes in two varieties: classic Alien (cylinder shape head, snapping jaws, long tail) and Alien light (a skinny tall guy in a white bodysuit). The latter is somewhat harmless and he reaches up with his long skinny arms, kind of like E.T.So in a nutshell there's the movie, except a subplot dealing with a father and son having long, tedious conversations and playing a flute (same actor, which makes it confusing to follow and the British accent doesn't help) and some bizarre nonsense about humans being descendants of monsters, wait a minute, is this Scientology? No, just a bad movie. Oh and needless to say, there's the classic low budget bad movie last twist to lay the foundation for Alien Covenant II but I will not be seeing that one.",Alien - Covenant

I really wanted to enjoy it, but it didn't do it for me. It was OK! everything about it was OK!, but something niggles and continues to niggle and i think it was the story, it was, well.....predictable and i mean, forehead slappingly predictable. The acting was meh! The visuals were as expected of an Alien movie. The whole thing seemed an effort rather than exciting. Was it meant to be a popcorn no brainer? Are all the Alien movies just that? if so, then am i looking for too much out of these films. I love the Alien films, but this one, was, well a meh!. Again, maybe i am being harsher than i need to be, but when you enjoy a series of films, a less than perfect addition to the stable, can leave you feeling disappointed and that i'm afraid is the feeling i got when the end credits rolled.

(And I apologize for any misspelling going on, my English is a bit rusty )No plot, no suspense, no character development, stupid ending. SPOILERS STARTING ....NOW! The first hour of the movie consists of nothing but cool space shots. The ship gets hit by a solar flare while recharging and one of the solar sails needs repairs. Plus some other secondary stuff around the ship, all this happening so we can meet the cast and ...get to know them I guess ? They all could've been red shirts for all I care, since I can honestly say I do not remember any of their names and sure as hell won't research them now. Oh wait, there is one guy, Tennesse. I remember him because he wears a hat and felt even more out of place than the others.So, the crew wakes up because of those malfunctions and, instead of getting back into hyper-sleep and continue their original trip, they decide to check out a planet near them which was emitting a signal. OK, guess that's smart, since the planet was exhibiting the right conditions for colonization. But, BUT ! once they get there, the idiots step out of the ship without even a simple mask over their goddamn faces ! I mean, teen horror movie much ?? You descend unto an alien planet and you just scream "" YOLO!"" ? At least in Prometheus they had the decency to use suits ! And yeah, the air might've been breathable, but s**t ! Viruses, unknown pathogens, alien stuff ! Why not wear a freaking mask until you've determined it's safe ? GOD F*****G DAMMIT !1 idiot gets infected near their landing ship, another a bit further away with the expedition team. 1st idiot gets back to the landing craft where some girl locks him up in the med bay with the biologist or whatever the woman with him was and then radios for help. The expedition team then gently walks back, although the woman was scared s**t-less on the radio..At this point I lost it.. What came next was equally mind numbing and idiotic as the first part and I'm pretty sure I'm reaching my 1000 word mark soon, so just wait for the DVD to come out and rent it. Or better yet, wait for the TV release, you won't be missing anything important, please trust me.If you want to go to the cinema anyway, just go watch Guardians Vol. 2 again, it's money better spent, do not pay them to make another Alien prequel.

903,plato-42119,"Ridley Scott sh*ts in his own pool, thereby assuring nobody else will ever make an alien movie",8,10 August 2017,"Contains spoilers:I love scifi and find any scifi movie with a decent budget to be watchable and enjoyable as do many scifi fans. That is the one and only explanation for the OK ratings of Alien Covenant, a movie where Ridley Scott proudly burns his own franchise to the ground so that nobody else ever dare touch it. First the petty stuff... while the graphics are pretty and the alien world is foreboding, the over-reliance on computer graphics significantly detracts from how scary and foreboding the ""aliens"" are. Where in previous alien movies the aliens had a gestation period, you know, like a normal life form subject to the laws of physics, now they are completely separated from all reality. They look like computer sprites, they bounce around like computer sprites, the eat face like computer sprites, and they gestate in nanoseconds like computer sprites. Everything about the way the ""aliens"" move on screen screams out you're watching a cartoon and that the evil aliens are no more than figments of imagination and of graphic artists. Certainly, this is the way of the world, everything is animated and everything is less satisfying and less scary because of it, but what are we going to do, make a model and drip ketchup off of it so it looks more real? No, we'd rather spend billions on computer sprites that convince nobody and move like phantoms that are beyond the laws of physics. In fact, were you to watch the 86 Aliens and this movie back to back, you'd be surprised at how much better and more convincing the special effects were. Ridley Scott apparently has alzheimers and forgot the first Alien movie revolved party around a malfunctioning synthetic organism that was there to help the crew. Ridley Scott came up with this incredible idea for a movie shortly before creating Alien Covenant, what if we had a malfunctioning synthetic organism that was supposed to help but turned evil? Nobody in his inner circle has gumption to stand up and say ""sir this plot seems oddly familiar.""But the real reason God will probably give Ridley Scott herpes is... the alien is now not an alien but a biological weapon?? Are you f'cking kidding? Do you know how non-scary that is? Do you know how not- scary that makes the entire franchise, all the old alien movies, all the video games... oh it's not actually an Alien, it's a biological weapon created by a malfunctioning synthetic which is totally an original idea I came up with right before I made this movie. I just don't even... what a joke of a human, what a joke of a director.",Alien - Covenant

Well, that's what this movie is actually about and that is simply ""Who can you trust?"" The ending really sucked for me, the clues given beforehand made it abundantly clear what's about to happen. Though, I must admit that they milked for all it's worth. I can somewhat understand why they ended it that way, since it obviously made it easy if not necessary to follow up with the next movie. It was long, I rarely feel the need to get up and leave before the ending. This was just so predictable, I really was thinking about leaving since I knew where they were going with this. Glad, I toughed it out and saw a few more surprises at the end. I'm not sure what other's problems are with the actors and the characters they portrayed. I thought it was cast well and the characters realistically portrayed the different human qualities that influenced their decisions and actions. I don't understand people who must project themselves, personality and decision making on fictional characters.

I thought it was a nice chance for the creator or the franchise to shed some light into the past of it all, since he (and so many people) hated Alien vs Predator.So I was waiting for this new Alien movie, I was very anxious. I avoided looking at anything that mentioned it on the web. I wanted to be surprised. And I was. Still am. I mean, where's the story?We were promised to be able to see Dr. Shaw's travel to the planet of the ""engineers"", how they would talk, what she would learn, what she would tell them about us and their failed experiment. But no. It's Alien 1 all over again.And, forgive me, but is it me or isn't there always a chubby guy with weird mustache and beard and a cowboy hat around? Are they like, part of a clan? A very long bloodline?Magneto...I mean, David, for some reason, came to hate humans. Just like that. To the point that he actually killed Dr.Shaw and experimented on her...in horrible ways. He advanced the engineer's biological weapon. But he still went to their planet, arrived there with no problem. And launched the weapon on them. Something else I found weird is that the entire planet's population was assembled in a very short space, like a ""city park"" or something. There couldn't be more than, what? 10 thousand of them there. They died at the spot. Oh, and they were all wearing rags, like something from Kayne West's latest clothing line.So, OK, we get crazy-David, who faces his new-generation brother and kills him. The ship's crew all die in that ""Alien-way"". And we get the politically correct interracial naked couple in the shower. They die too, of course. Crazy David goes on, killing everyone because, you know ""whatever"", and tries to experiment on them. He hates humans, and all his efforts aim to destroy us (Well, hello, Mr. Magneto.). At the end, there's that super-suspense scene where we go like ""Is it David? Is it Walter?"" Nah, it's David, guys! We're all going to die! He takes control of the ship and puts his little alien babies with the human embryos. I don't know what for, but he made those, so I suppose he knows best.Yeah, the promises made at the end of Prometheus? Forget those. A decent reason for this new chain of events? Nope. The answers and story we were waiting for? Nah. A remake of 1979's Alien? Sure, with no plot at all? Sure, why not?At least it's better than that Life (2017) piece of trash.",Alien - Covenant
906,badmanlykme,Return to form,9,8 May 2017,"Alien Covenant is a return to form for the Alien franchise whilst also being a Alien prequel and sequel Prometheus and in the movie it works well and helps enhance the story, Alien Covenant is a more enjoyable movie than Prometheus and helps clear things that where blurred in that movie.Alien Covenant has impressive visuals and a sleek look that keeps the viewer invested even if no dialogue is present, the first two acts are more based on the science fiction element and the third act focuses more on the alien slasher element but the movie is already riveting without the slasher element so when it shows up it just a bonus.The cast is very good even though some are expendable but nothing we haven't come to imagine. Pacing does drag here and there so don't let your expectations subvert you and don't expect lots of action with xenomorphs very early on although your plate will be filled by the end.

The whole team is very unprofessional in everything they do, the landing on an unknown planet without an the space suits from ""Prometheus"" and handling of the Neomorphs, it seems everyone is under-trained in their fields. The film lingers on the Android ""David"" more than anything else, while interesting at first, becomes very frustrating when you notice that there's more time spent on the Android than the Xenomorph, which annoys you even more when you see how poor the CGI of the Alien is.Were it not for some great acting and interesting concepts, the film would have fallen even lower. Riddled with plot holes and an appalling cliffhanger ending that is completely undeserved, all adds up to quite easily, the worst film installed within the Alien franchise.",Alien - Covenant
908,JediMichaelCera,Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.,5,17 September 2017,"However! The coincidence that all the active crew members suddenly have a sharp drop in I.Q. to get them into said trouble is not cheating, just terrible story telling.The senior crew members would not go down to an uninhabited planet without any kind of EV suits without first checking for hazardous things whilst actually there. Hazardous things such as killer airborne parasites. This is really basic stuff that mediocre/average writers would have maybe gotten away with about 20+ years ago but doing so now just eliminates all sense of realism/immersion.Also their sheer stupidity made me not want to roof for any of the characters. If you do something that stupid then frankly you deserve everything that comes to you.With all that out the way, the good parts. The action sequences were quite good at times, the shoot out between the soldiers & the first creatures in the high grass was done pretty well. The final fight between the Xenomorph & the crew on the shuttle, not bad. The music was in keeping with the Alien franchise which is always a no brainer. Except for those unnecessarily long flute scenes.The ending though. If you didn't immediately think that Walter was actually David & you're more than 10 years old, then I have some bad news you for. One of the most obvious twists in recent cinematic history.The studio needs to go back to Alien & Aliens & ask themselves what made those films so great & go from there.

909,qqknowlton-85783,It's a Good Film by Itself,7,26 July 2017,"This latest edition to the Alien franchise takes a different approach to storytelling, which is perhaps why people don't like it or find it confusing.Yes, I felt a little confused after some of the plot twists, but the overall story is easy to follow: a group of space travelers visit a planet and get caught up in something bigger and more dangerous.The crew actually reminded me of the original Alien crew – there was banter, camaraderie and genuine relationships.The people aren't military mercenaries and there are no familiar cat-and-mouse alien/human hunt scenes, so this will disappoint people who like cheap thrills and gory horror.However, I think that this offers a fresh approach to the same old face-to-face scenes that have been overused in previous Alien films.This movie does focus on the androids and it does detract from the overall story and development of the human characters, but it's still enjoyable and I highly recommend it.",Alien - Covenant
910,corozin,"Ridley Scott goes through the motions, nothing more...",5,12 May 2017,"The film was a disappointment. I was hoping that after the rather hollow Prometheus that extra effort would have been made with this one but alas all we are treated to is a visual homage to the genre of Alien films, but one with with a less than invigorating plot and nothing new to say.Pieces of the film are so disjointed in terms of pace that I started to wonder if the three producers actually talked to each other during it's filming. From the ridiculously sweary and over-acted descent sequence, to the flacid, pointless and alas lengthy Walter/David flute playing sequence, this film follows the rather rambling narrative style of Prometheus rather than the tight and gripping style of the first two Alien movies. In fact I would suggest that even Alien3 is more consistent and has better interaction between the characters than this piece.On the positive side the film is once again beautifully designed and shot, the Aliens well rendered (if a little predictable) and the film features many visual nods and easter eggs to both it's predecessors as well as films such as Avatar. I was particularly charmed by the inclusion of a reference to the 'nodding duck' from Alien reproduced here.The actors are once again challenged with portraying a variety of poorly written roles. Fassbender is of course great as David, but the others have little to work with. Billy Crudup struggles to convince with a character with a ridiculously unbelievable religious streak and Waterston despite her heavy pre-publicity does nothing except grimace at what she witnesses. Everyone else in the script is just Alien-fodder in the style of a particularly bad teen-slasher movie. I found myself wondering if Irwin Allen was still alive and script writing.In summary a film with visual splendour but little else to recommend it. Please Ridley Scott - stop making these things now.

This team is the opposite of what you can expect from astronauts like ones portrayed in Apollo 13 or Space Odyssey 2001 - the best of human kind, high-end professionals able to keep their nerves at bay even at extreme events. Covenant is managed by a bunch of emotional idiots. The only characters showing some intelligence are the two David androids. After spaceship malfunction captain decides to change the course and direct the ship to an unknown nearby planet that seems to be habitable. At arrival, they don't take care to explore the planed with robots/drones to check if there is no danger on its surface, they land directly into a storm, and go out without any protective suits. How could they know that there is no dangerous pathogens, toxins, parasites on this unknown planet? Of course right away two guys inhale alien spores and start to be very ill. Instead of quarantining them, one is taken directly into the ship... and then the carnage begins. The logic in this movie may be acceptable to a 5-10 years old kids, although this is not a film for young kids. Anyone with IQ >80 must feel insulted by the stupidity of the script. What are the good points of Alien Covenant? Alien planet looks great, especially viewed from space. Space ships and gear design is acceptable, however it looks as it was designed by a CG artist and not by scientists/engineers - not very realistic. The first scene in the movie with David and its creator also is pretty good. Well, another Alien disappointment movie.Please, for the next one take care to hire a scrip-writer with IQ above average, and ensure that astronauts behave like astronauts and not like Somali truck drivers. Hire some scientists engineers to check the script and consult the design of space ships / equipment to make it more believable.

His filmmaking - as a whole - is still spectacularly dazzling. He is, unquestionably, a genius.There is however, one intellectual property he must let go of. Urgently.His vision for the Alien franchise has long since expired. The stories are lazy, crass, boring and worst of all, hackneyed, poorly acted, poorly structured, cliches. A horrendous, depressing parody of the laser-sharp, dna altering, platinum quality shocker that originated the franchise.Partner up with a dynamic, fresh, hungry and younger filmmaker who worships your franchise, get likewise writers who are respectful of the work of Dan o' Bannon. Get set designers to gorge on the work of HR Geiger. Slash the budget and effects in place of a tightly driven narrative - and for goodness sakes - drop the tedious Prometheus origin story. Nobody cares. It's been told to death. That horse has long since expired.Instead, bring back the nostalgia. Bring back the character of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) kicking ass. Let her **** up Aliens again as if they were exposed by the ""Me too"" movement.You used to take our breath away. Your vision led the world. In other films you still do. Just not with this franchise.

That happens through the whole movie in order to get it going. Why? Couldn't just characters make wise decisions based in lack of information or stupid ones based on their personalities and get the movie going? Is it really that hard? I guess not. I guess this is the typical case of lazy character and script development. And characters and script are the soul of any memorable movie. Unfortunately this movie is not.Then, the good parts: you can really enjoy the movie not thinking about the previous stuff. It works. Accept the inherent stupidity of the Covenant's crew and focus on the action, the tension, the great shots and cinematography and the background story connecting Prometheus and Alien. Rely on Fassbender's ability to capture your attention and invest on him. The rest of the crew are as disposable as James Franco's character (what was his name?).But do not forget: Alien or Aliens, shown in 1979 and 1986 are even today better movies than Prometheus and Alien: Covenant.

918,dany4k,Good follow up from Prometheus,8,12 May 2021,"This movie is a great follow up from Prometheus and continues the story of the android David (which I consider the main character of these two movies).With this movie we are able to tell what David has been up to after being saved by Elizabeth Shaw. The story is pretty interesting if you are into the Alien franchise, and in theory, it could give us a lot more info that led to the original Alien movie released in 1979, but in reality it still leaves us with a lot of loose strings that lead up to the first movie released.Sci-fi effects are pretty good, as always in the Alien franchise, as are the characters and their respective actors (always a pleasure to see Michael Fassbender interpreting David and Walter). The weakest link is the story and how it is told. The movie could have been easily split into 2 or 3 movies and get into more detail about what happened after Prometheus, and also to the events that lead to the Nostromo crew trip.Maybe we still need a 3rd movie to clarify some things?

Supposedly well trained astronauts act like mindless panicked civilians, go about a strange planet with organic life without any protection, ignore any quarantine protocols, ignore basic safety measures and endanger lives of thousands of colonists to radio their spouse etc. Interstellar ship gets damaged by a random sun flare like those kind of events are totally unknown to engineers of the future, random radio transmissions from a distant planet get picked up by chance... It's a mess. The characters themselves are totally flat, to the point where any emotional impact of their situation is totally lost. Guy gets eaten by alien? Well at least it looked kind of pretty. Talking about aliens, they tried to put aliens from Prometheus and old style aliens in the same movies, making both kind of pointless.Scenes themselves look very good, but that's the only positive thing that can be said about them. Bad acting, horrible story and the lack of finesse makes it all feel kind of empty and uninteresting.

I don't require great special effects, but this film rates high in that category, in my humble opinion. As for themes, deeper meanings and big thoughts: yes, there are some here. But I will stay silent on that, because I didn't fully understand ""Prometheus"" until I read some reviews. Somebody smarter than I will have to instruct me on that. Word of caution: you might want to watch ""Prometheus"" before ""Alien: Covenant"". This story arc is getting pretty complex.",Alien - Covenant
923,ralfberserk,If this is the future of human race we deserve to go extinct,7,19 May 2017,"Every sci-fi movie deserves to have a minimum of scenery, technology and common sense to look and feel real. I mean, we know everything on the screen is fiction. The gravity inside the spaceship so the crew can walk normally, the sleep chambers, the sound of explosions or engines in space, etc. But while we indulge those little details, there are others more important and those are the way people reactions and the way decisions are made. And that's the big flaw on this movie. If the aliens could express thoughts, they probably would ask themselves: how did those creatures manage to travel from deep space? They're so stupid. Every decision is wrong, they don't have any self preservation instinct. Are they the best they race can produce? They deserve to go extinct. I'm surprised by the poor script and even more by the fact that Ridley Scott didn't bother to fix it. Why is that gladiator is a good and congruent script and this one is a mess? Did he fired the writer? No one in Hollywood is in charge of criticize bad scrips? What happened? My 7 goes to special effects and nothing more. Personally, I keep the first two movies and figure the others never existed.",Alien - Covenant

These two untalented writers are responsible for this mindless story with other two no-names, debutants, that i will not even mention for their contribution to the screenplay. John Logan, ironically is the man responsible for that dreadful script for Spectre (worst James Bond ever). Michael Green on the other side is much, much worst - he has written that horrible Green Lantern after which, even the lead actor Ryan Reynolds stated that he was so close to put end to his career (thank God along came Deadpool), he has written Logan - such a stupid story full of plot holes like a Swiss cheese with those kids at the end of the movie (they were supposed to be some killing machines and they were all running from a few simple soldiers, although at the beginning of the movie, just one girl kills a dozen of them all by herself -remember; and the incredible lack of imagination shown, by adding another Logan to fight Logan :)))) he was just unable to create another character, the poor man) and get this - he has written the story for the new Blade Runner, so beware, my fellow sufferers, you've been warned!!!! PS: he is the writer of the new show (which i must confess, i still follow - YET) - American Gods :)) uuuhh, i have a bad feeling about this show already; until now it's story is still foggy and keeps u intrigued, but...... i have lost my trust in this man's talent and imagination and i am ready to bet you that the story of this show will blow right in our faces.

It had a tension-building, slow-burn quality, with none of the impatience to spam the audience with juicy Aliens displayed by it predecessor. I actually quite liked the decision to kill James Franco before even getting him out of the hypersleep pod, leaving the plot in the hands of generally less recognizable and therefore more believable characters. Everything seemed set up for a taught thriller worthy of the original two outings in the Alien franchise.But then the DNA of the movie, just like that of so many of its protagonists, began to unravel at an alarming rate. The unavoidable comparisons with the two classics of the series, Alien and Aliens, are not favourable.The first thing that clangs is the frequently mystifying decision-making of the central characters. In unfamiliar and dangerous environments, people generally, for very good reasons, become more jeopardy-averse, rather than less so.If the ship's computer tells you a course of action could result in total mission failure and the deaths of all 2,000 passengers, you do not blithely follow that course. If a mysterious unknown plant releases spores, you don't sniff 'em. If you start to feel ill on an alien planet and someone asks how you are, you don't say, 'I'm fine!' If two identical robots go off together - one of which is nice and the other of which is homicidally insane - you stop to check which one it is when only one of them comes back. And when you find out an Alien is loose on your ship and you have verbal control over all airlocks, you damn well seal them immediately. Unless some gung-ho scriptwriter with their hand up your bottom is transparently making your decisions for you, to drive the death-count up, of course.All this kind of stuff does the dramatic tension no favours, but it need not be fatal. Sadly the breakdown in common sense is followed by more serious breakdown in emotional realism. Having arrived on Planet Danger expecting little more than a scenic hike, the crew of scientists and settlers witness their scout ship explode, their sick compatriot die vomiting up an alien baby, and another of their number having his jaw ripped off by a full-grown alien. These are the kinds of moments that should result in instant and lasting changes in mentality - anguish, terror, panic, paranoia. Instead the characters here seem to have hearts made of ice and brains made of crap. Nobody wails. Nobody baulks at wandering off alone. Everyone just kind of gets on with it, as if sudden lethal Alien attacks are an unfortunate but unavoidable fact of life.Toward the end of the movie, when all but four of the dozen-or-so human characters have been horrifically slaughtered, two of the four remaining crew members, now back on the ship, mince off to have sex in the shower, where they duly get killed. This is just such a stereotypical slasher-horror movie scenario that you begin to wonder whether the scriptwriter was born yesterday. But the really upsetting thing was that after two hours I neither knew anything about these characters nor gave a monkey's whether they lived or died. They were so bland and flatly described I would not have noticed if they wondered quietly out of the airlock for an untethered space-walk.All this is awful, of course, but I must say on reflection the biggest let-down of the movie is its basic premise. Every great sci-fi yarn is elevated to greatness by what it says not just about the future, but about the past and present. The original Alien was elevated by its powerful evocation of 'The Company', an inhuman monster of the sort we all know from our lived experience, which sees numbers rather than people and considers human life expendable in the interest of profits and share value.In this movie, The Company is replaced by David, an avatar of the mooted potential of artificial intelligence to outgrow us. But this source of modern anxiety remains, at least for now, more imagined than real. It has none of the immediacy and relatability of the menace of corporate power, which if anything is much more resonant now than it was when 'Alien' was first made.Neither, in the event, is it executed very persuasively. David, we are told, is a big fan of Wagner, Byron and suchlike. Am I the only one to notice that what all these great artists had in common was their humanity?

With no money-grabbing corporation looking to make readies out the the kill-skills of the xenomorphs, the whole concept of preferring them to humans just falls apart.In conclusion, the movie looks decent.

927,cleft_asunder,A film that should be seen twice before you decide.,9,20 September 2017,"When I first saw Blade Runner, I wasn't impressed, but certain scenes stuck out for me and I watched it again the next day, and quickly it became one of the favorite's. The same thing happened with A:C, a movie that -- in the end -- felt like a 6/10 film, until I thought about it......After about an hour of contemplation, certain scenes stuck with me so much that I watched it again, giving it an 8.5 score. The flute scene, the neo-morph breathing scene, the effective and simple dialogue that is intellectual, the sheer brutality and quickness of the aliens, and so many other things. It gave me nightmares for 2 days, in fact. But above all the world was believable despite the abundance of minor flaws.I think people who watched this film felt insulted because the standards in the film industry are lower than ever, and they felt that the film was insulting their intelligence. But I never got that sense, not in this film. Ridley Scott is such a generalist, who is able to create a believable world, yet no matter how much you try to explain it, Rick Deckard still climbs up a building, with broken fingers, in the rain, laterally (?), while a replicant is hunting him. But people only point the finger when A:C does silly things.The movie tried to please all fans, but mostly it was the Prometheus fans who will enjoy this the most. if you've seen it, ignore the blatant minor flaws and see it one more time, because it's a movie with depth and SOUL behind it and only Ridley Scott can do the atmosphere and cinematography JUST RIGHT, and I predict that the rating will go up within 5 years, as did Blade Runner, though it might never be a classic.Above all, I found it to be meticulously done, despite the flaws.",Alien - Covenant
928,christoffersen366,Best if you liked Prometheus,7,7 August 2017,"I see a lot of hate, and I somewhat get it. It does not have the scares nor the story like the Alien movies, just like Prometheus didn't. This focuses on the elements of Prometheus, those that some liked and others found boring, and takes it a step further, although it is kept a little in the background to show off the Neomorph and some action in order to keep you entertained with something else. If you are one of those who found it boring previously, there's only a very straightforward movie ahead of you, which might also be boring to you, as it challenges you in no way, but the love for Alien and the action might keep you entertained well enough to endure it this time around. So in the end, I can only recommend it to people who got Prometheus and liked it, everyone else should focus on pushing for Alien 5, which I hope gets revived.",Alien - Covenant
929,clive_slatter,High Expectations... Low Delivery,4,1 June 2017,"I was hoping that Prometheus had all been a terrible, terrible error of judgement and that Covenant would re-focus the franchise. Having heard that Ridley Scott believes that the franchise drifted beyond it's initial concept (Alien Resurrection did little to disprove that particular point) it was always on the cards that this film would push Prometheus's story line. The trouble is, it doesn't.This film could almost exist without anything from Prometheus other than explaining how David came to be on this planet. In Alien you came to care somewhat about the characters, and even in the cannon- fodder-ful Aliens you still cared about some of the characters. I wasn't so bothered about the prisoners in 3 or the smugglers in Resurrection (don't mention the abomination that appears at the end) but in Prometheus and Covenant I couldn't care less what happens to them.Too many things they do just don't make any sense like bringing a spaceship much lower to a storm than the AI wants to or looking into an embryo pod because you're asked to.

I thought Prometheus was somewhat engaging and I love the first two Alien movies, but this one is on par with Alien 3 and Resurrection, that is: not memorable. The characters were too feverishly developed and behaved in idiotic fashions. The plot was a rehash of the previous movies. Michael Fassbender's acting and his character were the redeeming qualities of this film.

Alien Covenant though is dire from start to finish. Not to many spoilers, the story starts with the crew on their way to colonise a planet, which they have been planning for years, but get woken up from hyper-sleep and suddenly think they have found a better place to colonise, lol...are you serious? this would take some planning to colonise a planet, and suddenly they phone home and say they have found a closer one :-) As usual their is a transmission from the planet, they don't understand where it has come from so virtually the whole crew go down, armed to the back teeth (aliens may not think they've come in peace). Where they land is 8km from this transmission, don't know why so far, maybe they felt like a hike, they park up on a lake and start walking lol...their is lush vegetation and fresh water..but one of the crew points out...no animals anywhere!! For a bunch of colonist you would think that would be a bad sign that things are not quite what they seem, but they carry on...leaving one girl behind to carry out tests, with a single guard :-)...if there had been a secret army come out of the forests to attack them I'm not sure what good he would do. The film descends into farce with an incompetent crew not even following basic quarantine procedures...and once they've discovered there's nasty Alien creatures down there, the remaining crew seem to insist on going off by themselves into dark lonely areas of the old city, one of them ""to freshen up"" lol Enough ...watch it, make up your own mind, but Alien was a much better story when we all thought they were just a nasty little creature we had just stumbled across in the galaxy...they are ruining the story (btw, why don't the aliens attack David???)",Alien - Covenant

Can't always go by the worst reviews.. I've found them to be off many times. 7.5 out of 10 And to be quite honest, for this movie to be sitting at nearly a 7 out of 10 with over 1,000 reviews confirms a fairly good movie.

933,iasimkhovich,it's got to be a joke on purpose being so bad.,1,28 May 2017,"from the beginning, i couldn't believe how much this film was begging for an MST3K treatment. by ten minutes in, i found that practically every line deserved to be made fun of. i started wincing when he told walter to ""ambulate""--the only thing i thought of was mr. burn from ""the simpsons""--and then it got even dumber.why does a ship's computer tell a robot that runs around in it to come to the bridge and push a few buttons because it's time to deploy energy collecting sails? can't it just do that itself? then, we get to see some neat energy collecting sails deploy. wow. that was worth a buck.then, it's like, horrible that one of the pods that contains sleeping people FALLS. like, that's the most awful thing that can happen. was that shot supposed to shock old ladies that are scared to get bumped as they fall down? there's a space hick/cowboy who's familiar with john denver. when this film screened in Texas, i'm sure they all screamed ""yee-haw"" and threw their cowboy hats in the air and started shooting the ceiling randomly.i started wondering about how much time was left because i was already bored and felt like the film was a waste of time and WOW... it was nearly half-way through. that was around the 49 minute mark, when you finally see an alien. i figured i could stand around and get through it.they really went insane trying to capitalize on the generic half-way mark and pivot/twist the plot HARD but um, it felt like one of those ""star trek: the next generation"" movies stuck on a boring planet where nothing happens and there's no reason to care.this movie actually made alien 4 look good.miserably bad. if it was a comic book, you'd still be disappointed at how vacuous and lame the story was, if it cost more than 50 cents. 25-50 cents? maybe. 75 cents and you'd feel ripped off.",Alien - Covenant
934,mark-338-155607,A Difficult transition made to look easy.,10,15 May 2017,"When an Alien prequel was mentioned all those years ago I don't think anyone expected it to look like Prometheus. We all expected romping aliens (as per the original HR Giger design) throughout with Face-huggers flying through the air. What we were given was an unexpected story, a VERY different alien and a Space Jockey which did not live up to the expectations of the original 1970's film. Prometheus, was very much a dull affair desperately trying to tell a story which just wasn't there. Or so I thought...Alien Covenant is a wonderful sequel to Prometheus which expertly starts to explain and bridge the gap to the original Alien. The first act is well paced, very relaxing (after the initial encounter with a space storm), getting us used to the crew and laying the ground work for where the film was to go, in many ways this did mirror the original Alien - which I believe to be a very clever idea, as this makes us think of the original while still holding on to the story of Prometheus and hoping for a better future. As you will see, the main theme throughout is how this film links to not only the prequels but also to the original Alien movie.During the trailer we see a scene in the shower with two of the cast (I was very worried at this, as it reminded me of Creepozoids! Gratuitous breast shot etc), and my fears of a bad scene were alleviated early on. The ship is a colonisation ship, full of 1,000's of humans in stasis, and 100's of human embryos. We then learn the crew are also married or in a relationship with each other - which would make sense, when colonising a world it would obviously be a one way trip and for mental and social ability it would make sense. So in short, the shower scene would be understandable.When a prequel comes along, the most difficult transition is to make the equipment look older than the 'what we thought was modern' back in the 1970's, this is where many prequels fall short. Alien Covenant had the same issue, an although there is some modern looking equipment/technology etc, Ridley Scott had the foresight to use the sounds from the original Alien and Aliens to compensate for the more modern looking set. This also worked to yet again link this film to the original Alien.The crew initially became infected by the alien virus though the ear and noise cavities, by a very similar organism to that of Prometheus. What about the Face-hugger? You will find out! Although there is a new way for the Alien to be born, the first is violently ejected from the back of a crew member - you may have seen the trailer - at this point one of the crew are covered in a spray of blood, I would presume they were not aware of this just like the original Alien movie, Ridley taking a dark approach to method acting. The second is violently vomited up. Very different ways of emerging and very different to Prometheus, however this is expertly explained, which goes to show there was a lot of thought given to the story and also to link from Prometheus through to the original Alien.We do see a chest burster and a face-hugger, yet again this is very well considered in the film which again provides a great link from Prometheus to Alien.The first aliens we see (yes there are two!) are reminiscent of the one from Prometheus, a far cry from the menacing Alien that Giger thrust upon us in the 1970's, but thankfully this is yet again explained very well, and David (he has survived) has continued Weyland's mission to become the human is just wasn't made to be. Through modification and gene splicing David, has created the first face-hugger in an egg, resulting in the terrifying alien we all have come to love and fear at the same time.Towards the end, we all know David is David and not Walter, but there is compelling evidence that it really is David, as he helps to kill off the one true genetically modified alien. As Daniels goes in to hyper sleep, we sense the concern about Walter, but why would it not be him? He helped her kill of the alien and protect everyone. Only as the hyper sleep pod closes, Daniels gets a glimpse of David behind Walters' eyes, and there is nothing Daniels can do but go to sleep.David regurgitates 2 alien embryos which are promptly put in to stasis, ready for the waking colonists in 7 years time.The attention to original sound effects and the original alien for linking purposes is outstanding, and this deserves far more credit that it has actually received. It does prove how much of a forward thinking visionary Ridley really is.The cinematography is outstanding and Katherine Waterston, provides a Ripley style character, to yet again easy our transition in to the next prequel.",Alien - Covenant
935,javajunkay,A fascinating turn in different direction,9,18 May 2017,"Personally, I expected way less out of this movie - I expected a mediocre thriller which the current ratings seem to classify it into.The previous Alien movies focused more on the alien itself and the human protagonist (Ripley). In Covenant, the focus is shifted onto an antagonist David - an artificial intelligence robot designed to act as a commanding officer aboard the seed ships. David, as well as newer and updated versions of David, are all played by Fassbender whose acting was almost mesmerizing.David is an extremely complex individual, and the way the writer combined his intelligence with creativity to create a ""perfect human"" (Michelangelo's David, who he is named after) is quite impressive. This perfection and superiority of David is often contrasted by weaknesses and irrational decisions of human officers. I feel as if this entire plot, who links the origin of Alien and the story of David greatly enriched the whole universe of Alien. The story of the seed ship and the question about whether or not humans are replaceable makes it a solid science fiction piece. Finally, even though a significant part of the plot, the aliens themselves felt less important.Overall, highly recommendable even if you are not familiar with the Alien saga.",Alien - Covenant

A geologist , who came across more like a 19th century possum hunter , not interested in discovering a new planet . When they started the spaceship with a ""magic flute"" I thought ... They have got to be kidding . I have seen Prometheus a few times since then and overlooked it's irritations . I mean , it does look fantastic and does manage to tune you out for a couple of hours . So with Alien : Covenant I approached it knowing it would be weak in certain areas , like most Hollywood sci-fi is these days . And it was as expected . Outside of Fassbender there are not any really engaging characters .There is a lack of any real science or detail and you do have to question the actions of another bunch of dumb scientists at times . But it looks even better than its predecessor and delivers plenty of excitement . The score is great and the sound design spectacular . Kudos to those who think it wasn't good enough. I totally understand why you would be disappointed , but lets face it , we are never going to get another film like the original Alien . Nothing much really happens in the original film for the first half an hour but it sets up first contact and the rest of the film brilliantly . Film studios have a tendency to sell it's customers short in the new millennium. I think they just assume today's audiences will struggle to concentrate for a whole two hours in a row . To the detriment of film making they may be right in some part . When it comes to big Hollywood films I can't see things changing anytime soon . At least we didn't get any Abba tracks appear out of nowhere . We have to be thankful for that ! Overall , I think Alien : Covenant delivers in spades and I really liked it .",Alien - Covenant

Awful film that made no sense and just capitalised on a few big stars of the moment (fassbender et al)So given that Prometheus was a relative flop an the cinema, didn't exactly set the world on fire in any critical acclaim way, WHY would you now make a prequel sequel that follows the film no- one liked?Bland characters that you just don't relate to Two fassbenders??

941,yairsm,"Sad attempt to please the whiny ""Alien"" fans who had tantrums over Prometheus",6,25 June 2017,"Ridley Scott set out to make a three part ""indirect prequel"" to the Alien series which, he said, would be its own story and would take place in the same universe as Alien, but would nonetheless be independent of the Alien franchise for the most part. Apparently die-hard ""Alien"" fans have a hard time understanding full sentences, and instead of listening, they jumped on the whole ""prequel"" idea and set their expectations accordingly. And then came Prometheus. Prometheus was a magnificent, fascinating, awe-inspiring masterpiece on its own. Its visuals were beautiful, its story and mystery were very unique, and it explored, among other fascinating topics, the origin of man-kind and of life itself, on planet earth and elsewhere. The movie left open many questions, presumably to be resolved in the next installation. But nope, the Alien fans subsequently lost their sanities and had a collective meltdown over the film, most notably for its not tying in ""enough"" to the original franchise. They forgot all reason and common sense and went on a rampage to make themselves and their unreasonable disappointments heard. They tore the film to shreds and refused to enjoy it. Well, Ridley Scott heard you all (I sure hope you're all happy!) and we got this disastrous mess of a sequel. To satisfy the Alien fans, he made a movie that builds on the clichés and elements of the Alien films, essentially making another Alien film and tying it in closer to that franchise as was demanded. Still being a sequel to Prometheus, it sloppily and hastily tied up lose ends from the previous film, but only as a side point to the newly thought-up, thin plot. All of the fascination and epicness that Prometheus was able to muster was thrown out the window in Covenant in exchange for a disaster-horror flick in order to please all of you unpleasable Alien fans. Well congratulations. I hope Ridley Scott ignores you all entirely for the making of the 3rd film and listens only to his gut instinct, to make a film as he originally intended, in the spirit of Prometheus. The Alien fans can cry as much as they want, but all their whining only caused this disaster of a film. You still have the chance to make this right Ridley Scott, good luck and looking forward to the 3rd installment!",Alien - Covenant

943,bbschatbase,OK i enjoyed his film but I also went knowing what to expect,7,21 May 2017,"BIG SPOILERSFor one. People went into thinking this to be like a 79' alien film and it's not supposed to be. We have a few films of origin to go. Secondly. There are numerous things that are VERY SIMILAR and can easily be pointed as flaws by fans BUT ARE NOT. David has created the perfect species. The actual xenomorph we see thru five films is not the one in this movie. This one is born with ribs, basically the full spec of an alien but smaller and grows. As to where usually it's a fetus that grows rapidly into what we all know, the rib cages, tale and everything. In this film it is born with all those features already, but smaller. And not only that...but it can also obey it maker (David). Sometime along the next few films it must change and it must break thru the rib cage as a fetus alien that's grows rapidly into what were all used to seeing. Not a flaw, a detailed change showing us how much changing happened before we got the common xenomorph. Also this one does not fear fire. And we all know xenomorphs fear fire. Also, this one is far smarter to the point where it can break a computer screen because it knows Ur watching it on it. All this implies that the facehuggers in this film aren't the same exactly either because it produced a much more intelligent species. Something has to change or mess up a long the way to the back door of the alien film in 79'. Plus we still have one unknown planet. Not origae-6...but another. People might not like the other (neomorph) I believe it's called. But I do, it shows or gives an idea of the technology of the black goo, its black but this stuff is like spores that travels through the air almost like a virus. Up until life finally arrives ten years later. Meanwhile David has created the eggs that we all are familiar with. Except these ones are also different. They burst from an embryo sack and then jump from the egg as to where this was never even hinted at thru all the alien movies. They just wrap around u see the tail and then they jump. Another reason implying that these are a superior type of facehugger. There was only one flaw to me besides dumb decisions by members of the crew which is necessary to kill folks off....and that flaw is this. We all know the eggs open up upon life approaching it...which is why David had to wait ten years just to even see them react...but after a facehugger jumps out and attacks the captain...they enter the room again and that egg is open...and so is another and then a facehugger jumps onto another dude...but how did it open if there wasn't another human in there yet? The only explanation is that is a superior facehugger created by David. And somewhere along the lines it drops now a notch to what we all know today as facehuggers. So too many things happened that u need to really think about to fill in the blanks and I can see people hating that! But other than that I loved it and I didn't expect anything more than an origin story more like Prometheus but further along.",Alien - Covenant
944,arcfrost,"I liked it, but if you still have questions from Prometheus, well??",8,12 May 2017,"May Contain Spoilers!!I'm a huge fan of Scott, I loved the Alien movies and I must be one of the few that loved Prometheus..It was said that Scott wanted this movie to bridge the story from Prometheus to the original Alien, well this movie kinda does this. It definitely gets back to the feel that the origin Alien movies had but if you were hoping for a continuation of the Prometheus story you maybe left wanting. For me Prometheus was a stand alone movie and I didn't feel it needed to justify itself as part of the Alien Franchise, I thought it was a great story on its own.. I did really enjoyed this movie, but I was hoping for the Prometheus story to develop, I wanted to know more about the engineers, the amazing beings said to be our ancestors.. why they wanted to destroy us, their home world and history etc. etc. However, they have been brushed over in this movie and I felt a little disappointed about that.I suppose in brief I would say this isn't so much a sequel of the Prometheus movie but more another instalment of the Alien Franchise.. Still a great movie though, that has its own merits...!!The Alien fans should be delighted, this has the feel of the original Alien movies and the Xenomorph is back with a vengeance, and he's brought a few cousins with him!!Prometheus fans.. meh.. maybe not so much...",Alien - Covenant
945,krisdimoski,Disappointment,6,19 May 2017,"I was a real big fan of Prometheus even though there were some annoying parts in it and was really looking forward to this one, however, the movie was a big let down. The story was really poor, the characters were really annoying and shallow (they were really freaking stupid for a group of handpicked cosmonauts). I honestly feel like Ridley has completely lost his touch with this one. Some of the scenes i couldn't even take seriously because they felt so off. The potential was really big because the prequel ended with a lot of exciting questions unanswered yet instead on focusing on that Ridley decided to make a movie about the most immature, incompetent, unprofessional, group of people that supposedly are scientists and cosmonauts. Feels bad man..",Alien - Covenant
946,dpasaric,Don't underestimate the audience,7,21 May 2017,"Some medium spoilers ahead!I am huge fan of the series but this is getting worse and worse. And it's a shame because of a huge potential. They should just remake the whole Covenant movie but without the stupidest cosmic crew ever assembled for a space mission. I just can't stand all those completely illogical moves! The group of randomly chosen citizens would act with more sense than the highly trained spaceship crew in this movie.It's a complete mess, not in a good way. If I compare this movie to the Aliens, my favorite in the saga, the Covenant is like some child got the enormous budget and super-talented production crew to make a naive movie for audience of an elementary school level. Ridley just should hire one serious QA person to check the script and point out what's plain stupid and completely unlikely.Actors could be great - if given a chance. I guess they must be frustrated. This way all of them except two androids are just fast cannon fodder, plain, shallow and forgettable. What a waste!Still, I recommend to see the movie if you love the series. Visually, the movie is fantastic. See it in 4D cinema because the special effects are ten out of ten.I was so eager to see it as I expected that they'll correct and make up for all bad things that has ruined the Prometheus, but no avail.

950,ShropshireLass123,Not up to usual standard,5,11 January 2020,"Well the music was suitably disturbing to begin with, but once in the ship we are introduced to a mediocre cast, the lead female is perhaps the only saving grace and Fassbinder. And a gloomy environment. The lack of character among the crew is the main failure of this film, and the lack of a strong context in terms of storyline and environment. The casts have become increasingly dilute and multifarious much like Woody Allen films to the extent that you don't want to even look at them, some seem to have come straight from the worst aspect of the X-factor they're so bad. I wonder if Scott rushed this one out, it seems like it. Hopefully the next one will be a bit fresher and more exciting.",Alien - Covenant
951,Random3,"A perfectly functional thriller/monster-movie, but sadly nothing more.",5,13 May 2017,"Starting with the good:Michael Fassbender is the best thing about this movie, hands down. He plays both David from Prometheus and another identical android who arrived aboard the Covenant. They aren't just two identical characters despite looking the same, they are totally different characters and are both played extremely well.Apart from Fassbender the standout was Danny McBride. This film is proof that he is actually able to act, rather than play a (hilarious) exaggerated caricature of himself as he does in everything else I have seen of him.The film generally looks very good, although not as good as Prometheus. The set design and environments are great, but not particularly memorable.When the sh*t hits the fan it is very intense and thrilling. There is a LOT of blood and guts. They definitely did not hold back.Whilst the crew of the Covenant don't seem to be incredibly intelligent, there are thankfully no face-palm-inducing moments of stupidity like Milburn vs the death worm in Prometheus._____And now the bad.Simply put, the film was not scary. Intense, yes. Thrilling, yes. Scary? Unfortunately not.CGI seems to have been favoured over practical effects when creating the various alien creatures. Some shots used guys in suits, and some used motion capture, but sadly the majority blatantly looked fake to me. It wasn't painfully bad, but when compared with the mostly convincing practical effects from the first two Alien films and Prometheus in particular it was disappointing to see them depart from this.There is a twist ending which I saw coming.The script was nothing special. There was no memorable dialogue outside of the first scene.There are repetitions of some of the musical themes from Alien and Prometheus, but apart from that the music isn't memorable at all.I won't spoil anything but let's just say the alien creature's life cycles have become a joke, and are accelerated to the point of absurdity.Very little sense of wonder and awe. Think back to the scene from Alien where the crew discover the engineer. Think back to the first half hour of Prometheus. There is very little of that here.They show too much of the aliens. Virtually every shot is a full body CGI shot of the creatures running around. Scenes that may have been intense are neutered by the fact that we can see everything. There is no ""Jaws"" philosophy here, everything is on show.The alien creatures appear to have been reduced to dumb animals. Whenever they are defeated it is because of their own stupidity rather than the heroics or bravery of the human characters.The third act is tacked-on, nonsensical and blatant fan-service.______So to sum up, it stands on its own as a perfectly functional thriller/monster-movie, but sadly nothing more. It avoids most of the philosophical meanderings of Prometheus for better or worse, and is focused more on the monsters. To enjoy this I really think you have to turn off your brain.Here's where I would place it when compared to the other Alien films:Aliens – 10/10 Alien – 10/10 Prometheus – 7/10 Alien 3 – 6/10 Alien: Covenant – 6/10 Alien: Resurrection – 5/10 Alien vs Predator – 4/10 Alien vs Predator: Requiem – 3/10",Alien - Covenant

Sir Scott announced making of more than few of these and I'm sure I will enjoy all of them. I will certainly watch them even if all reviews on the net would be negative. I couldn't care less for such reviews.In the light of making several movies, the story is understandable. My only regret is that the Engineers didn't have more minutes.Fans should have no problems with this movie, for the rest - they should learn to appreciate it. Based on the end of Prometheus, I thought the next destination would be the planet of Engineers and in this sequel it is unclear. Anyway, looking forward to the next one.Please, Mr. Scott, just keep making them!",Alien - Covenant
953,conndar,"It's no Alien, but thankfully no Prometheus.",7,2 June 2017,"This movie has a lot of expectation weighing heavy on its shoulders. With a high benchmark standard to hit of the original Alien movie and a woeful attempt to avoid in Prometheus where does this movie lie? Firstly we should cast our minds to the original movie. Well directed, well written, superbly acted and filled with subtle touches to validate the scene, the scenario and the journey. Alien is one of the all time greatest sci-fi movies ever made. It is a hard act to follow, or in this case precede so to speak. Prometheus, although carried by an amazing cast, the same gifted director and visual wonders to keep the eye entertained, had none of those things we loved about the original. Despite players of the highest standard, the script seemed contrived and the direction seemed lazy. It was almost as if the script was just thrown at the actors and Scott shot the movie in one take. For me, it didn't flow and to be honest wasn't very believable or genuine. Considering that all sci-fi fans extend their beliefs for such journeys the least the writer can do is base their conversations on words what would actually be exchanged in real life. The exchanges seemed clichéd and flimsy. So much so that they made Independence Day look like a real-time documentary in comparison. A real shame considering some of the truly amazing people involved. It's a safe guess that if you liked Prometheus you will love Covenant. If you were sadly disappointed with Prometheus however, its going to be a closer call to make. Is this movie as good as Alien? No. But then perhaps no movie ever could be. Is it better than Prometheus? Absolutely. Although there are scenarios seen in other movies, and lets face it, it's very hard to make an original movie these days especially in a specific genre, this movie moves long nicely and believably. The cast, just as with Prometheus are awesome. This time however, they are armed with a script that avoids inflicting moments of cringe and is backed up with some nice back stories and history. It sets the scene well and allows us to slide into the journey with more investment. The direction too is also more closely guarded I feel. There are no conversations that make you ponder 'why they are in the movie?' or ask yourself 'Who talks like that?'. They have avoided poorly written character building or plot supporting scenes and have just plodded along assuming you have an IQ higher than 85 (its always nice when the movie maker has faith in the viewer). This movie will do Michael Fassbener's reputation no harm at all. He is even more creepy than in Prometheus and has an underlying nastiness that is hard not to like. One wonders if his skills weren't so great would the story of this movie have been written the way it has. That is to say, these movies seem to be written one after the other, as if trying to find out what works like a comedian on improv night rather than having a set path. Granted I like Fassbender and hope to see more, but that's the point. It does have a sense of making it up as they go along. The handling of the extension and ultimate conclusion of the last story is done a little too swiftly for my liking. It was as if they wrote this story and had to insert a few lines about the previous movie to cover themselves and get it out of the way. If what happened is what they are saying happened, that would be a movie all in itself. I felt a little robbed in that regard. Perhaps I'm nit- picking. So the script is better, the acting is better, the direction is better and the story flows more believably, so where does it fail? Well, to be frank. It's been done before. There was nothing new here. There was a revisit to the tension and suspense of Alien (awesome). There was a continuation of the last story (awesome). There was more David (awesome). But there was nothing new. There was not much movement in the story of the Giants. Sure the story handles creation from the Walter and David point of view which, while thought provoking was already played on in Prometheus. I feel I watched a prequel to the next movie in this franchise. Like I have been set up for yet another movie that will fail to live up to expectation. Incidentally, the ending is painfully predictable. But again, and hats off to Scott, it is directed well enough for you to question your suspicions. Also, and I'm really sad to say and don't quote me, but I was disappointed in some of the CGI. I will have to wait for the blu-ray to be sure, but some of the xeno attack scenes well, quite frankly reminded me of lesser movies. I must stress that I'll have to examine these scenes further in the comfort of my own home to confirm disappointment. So all in all, It's no Alien but thankfully no Prometheus. Go watch and enjoy.",Alien - Covenant
954,Superdessucke,Visually appealing film with questionable decision making!,5,12 November 2017,"I am a fan of the Alien series. I loved the first four, particularly Aliens. They were smart and believable in their context. And Sigourney Weaver's Ripley is one of the best movie protagonists of all time. I even thought Prometheus was pretty good, if not stellar. The cinematography in this sixth installment is awesome and the aliens have never been as vicious and gross as they are here. Sadly, the protagonists - the crew of the Covenant - are so dumb and make such bad decisions throughout the film that you may find yourself pulling for the bad guy and the nasty creatures to eradicate them!For starters, they're supposed to be on a long mission to colonize a carefully vetted planet with a couple thousand live civilians and another thousand embryos who are supposed to save mankind. So presumably, safety would rule the day? Well maybe, until you receive a weird and creepy radio signal from a previously unknown planet that is. Then the captain - who should have been a private given his decision making skills - decides to take his highest ranking officers down to the surface of this completely unknown world for a little look-see. And the hi-jinks which make up this movie of course soon follow.This key decision was questionable at best. The Covenant seemed to be quite sophisticated. So wouldn't Mother have been able to take and analyze terrain photographs and other data about life forms on the planet prior to landing? If not, the crew could have at least bought a drone at Target for $199 and sent that down there to get some pictures. Pretty much anything would have been smarter than what they actually did!And wouldn't a trillion dollar ship like the Prometheus - which the Covenant crew immediately encountered - have been able to transmit its final destination to earth? At a bare minimum, 11 years of investigation would have revealed at least the general area it disappeared to, right? If so, the crew of the Covenant, or at least the synthetic (the only one onboard who had an IQ in the three digits), would have known this and used extra caution and study prior to landing - versus barging in the proverbial front door like a bunch of drunken singing sailors who found the last open bar in town at 3:30 a.m.Anyway, once they stumble out onto the surface - sans any semblance of HAZMAT protection - a couple of soldiers get infected and one gets dragged back to the ship by a female officer. There, the supposedly trained Mrs. Tennessee (don't remember her name sorry) loses all composure at the sight of the ailing soldier BEFORE the Xenomorph even comes out. Instead doing anything useful, she runs to the radio to cry to her husband up top in the main ship. Letting spouses serve together as top crew members on a dangerous mission was another decision which seemed questionable to me, but what do I know? After that waste of time, she exercises the only attempt at quarantine during the entire film. Much to the chagrin of the poor female officer who got locked in the chamber with the born-to-be-bad little devil! Once that unfortunate officer is dispatched in most nasty fashion, Mrs. T decides it will be a swell idea to say ""f quarantine"" and open the door, only to comically slip on blood as she tries to shoot the skitty thing. She did manage to get the door closed again but this accomplished nothing other than 20 seconds of drama and one now mighty angry young alien breaking the single pane glass window to get out and further terrorize the hapless Mrs. Tennessee.After running around screaming and shooting with all the pinpoint accuracy of a Chicago gangbanger during a drive-by shooting, Mrs. T ends up blowing the ground crew's only escape vehicle to smithereens. Ooops! I'm sure she also ended up getting some choice words in Heaven from them for being a complete moron! Then, the rest of the crew encounter the creatures and start screaming and running around like a bunch of 8 year olds confronted by a guy in a scary Halloween costume who just jumped out from behind the hedges. David, probably with a big sigh and shake of his head, then comes to the rescue, realizing these dopes were all about to get killed like a bunch of squawking turkeys in a slaughter pen if he didn't intervene, which would have foiled his devilish master plan.Michael Fassbender delivers his performance as both Walter, the Covenant's sympathetic synthetic, and the unhinged David, the Prometheus' visually identical daddy-issue synthetic with precision. Why they couldn't have made the updated synthetic look a little different along with the other changes we later learn that they made was also beyond me, but I didn't care. Fassbender's acting is excellent and creepy. He single-handedly saves this film from being a complete train wreck and turns it into something reasonably watchable.I could go on with questionable decisions from the amateur crew and various plot holes (e.g. where did all the aliens who hatched from the unfortunate peasants David infected go??) but you can watch it and cringe for yourself. Suffice it to say that the dwindling crew doesn't get any smarter as the movie goes on. The movie's final ""surprises"" are so predictable that I laughed out loud at the remaining crew members' reactions to them. I was like, ""didn't Walter have a serial number you could have checked or something?"" I gave the movie an overall 5 star rating because the visuals are great and Fassbender does such a nice job. So it's worth seeing on Netflix, particularly if you're a fan of the series. But just don't expect a Sigourney Weaver style protagonist here. I really hope the next installment makes up for this relatively weak entry.",Alien - Covenant

I had avoided much of the marketing material beforehand and knew very little about it other than it being a sequel to Prometheus, which I actually thought was a half decent film and a worthy prequel to Alien.I'm not sure what went wrong with this film, but it is no exaggeration to say it is one of the worst films I've had the misfortune of sitting through. There is not one redeeming scene. The story is disjointed and quite frankly a complete mess. The editing is horrendous, the score completely forgettable and the cinematography is weirdly terrible.Even Michael Fassbender cannot save this awful dirge. The CGI xneomorph will haunt my dreams for quite some time.

957,mauvemage,Don't say I didn't warn you,1,13 May 2017,"I live in the Uk and saw this film last night. On the plus side it looks good and the ship and crew of the Covenant vessel are reminiscent of the original classic Alien. On the down side these people are too stupid to live. They answer not a distress beacon, but a garbled rendition of John Denvers Take me Home. The go to a dead planet and don't take any precautions. They land a couple of miles away from a vast Gothic alien city as big and bold as the Vactic city and they don't notice it. I remember thinking at the time 'I can see how they'd miss that' The alien attacks when they occur are really well done, but then there is the question of the ending. The bad android David who killed not only all the Engineers who had inhabited this and all other non-plant they find and even the nice Dr. Elizabeth Shaw who put his head back on is basically worse than Hitler. He deliberately created the acid blooded xenomorph to wipe out humans and so it seems all other animal life just for good measure. He's basically android Doctor Frankenstein. In the incredibly dumb ending he somehow kills the more advanced nice android Walter who is part of the landing party and takes his place. Swapping clothes and chopping off his own hand to resemble they injury Walter picked up saving Daniels the Katherine Waterson character who tells her idiot crew-mates what a bad idea this mission is before they start dying horribly. He'd already cut his hair to look like his 'brother' Walter and no alarm bells rang amongst the crew despite Davids home resembling a Hironimous Bosch version of Hell. It ends with David in charge of the colony ship ready to turn all the people in cryo stasis into his nasty little monsters.

958,rudy70,Alien Covenant.,8,30 May 2017,I think this film has high aspirations.The plot while not unique does offers some nice twists and turns. Scott direction is rock solid of Alien Covenant.The film does feel like it needed 15 more minutes to run and flesh out the characters story arch.The music score and effects are competent done and executed in my opinion.The film does provide answers but not all of the answers to the questions raised by Prometheus.,Alien - Covenant
959,inexile,Call of Duty: The Franchise Strikes Back,8,12 July 2017,"This movie, at its tin heart, portrays a battle between avatars for the notions Duty and Love. The ability to Love is associated with the ability to create, and Duty with mere faithful mimicry, i.e. the inability to create something new.Many reviewers here have noted the parade of clichéd contrivances, direct quotes, horror stereotypes, The Ripley-lite nature of Daniels, the derived score... generally the sheer lack of creativity in the project. Walter's movie.The movie's story actually begins with two prologues that precede the release of the movie. First, ""The Crossing"", a film short with a title that is loaded with emotion and subtext. Who was crossed, or is cross? This short is later quoted in the movie, but only through the ""lens"" of the Engineers' holo-view.That prologue was followed by the equally heavy symbolism of betrayal and sacrifice embodied in the title ""The Last Supper"". The Promethean symbol is of course, Fire. The prologue begins with the captain of the ship--the mission leader, the movie star--leaving a Good-Night party prior to cryo-sleep early, because he is ""burning up"". The next time we see him is at the beginning of Covenant, being burned alive in his cryopod... Stillborn. Like Ridley's original story concept.The rest of the movie is a litany of dutiful horror and Alien tropes, symbolized by the dippy bird stolen from the Nostromo, doomed to drink from the same well over and over again. And so Scott must feel. And so we are forced to.The movie begins and ends with a tune from Wagner's Rheingold, the satyr play from his masterpiece, The Ring Cycle. Satyr plays are, of course, the origin of our present-day satires, and one of the three types of Classical Greek Drama. They are as notable for their over-the-top, Bacchanalian, ribald nature as they are their commentaries on religion, politics, etc. They feature a chorus of 15 actors, as does our crew here.And thus we have as a story framed between these two renditions of Wagner's piece (the first merely played out on the keys of a solo piano, and the other a triumphant full orchestra involving over-the-top clichés and stereotypes that satirize the ""Alien Movie Purists"" who insist dutiful tribute paid to the series as a great creature feature (and nothing much more).Slasher movie victims are typically dumb and forgettable couples. Both qualities are amped here to the point of ridiculousness. And we are beaten over the head with the coupling nature of the crew. Repeated slips in blood lead to outright laughter and provide another metaphor for what Scott feels he is forced to film. The cowboy trope is over-the-top. The storm plot device hackneyed AND a quote. The signature one-liner at the moment of victory is a word-for-word repetition of the signature one-liner from the series' fanboy favorite. Nosferatu bites a girl's neck in one bathroom scene, and in another, the Psycho shower scene is doubled up, with some Bacchanalia going on, providing the movie with its perfunctory Horror Movie Nude Scene. Not to mention we all know what happens to characters stupid enough to have sex in a horror movie.The bawdiness continues on its over-the-top way with a phallic scene involving a Pan pipe, an attempted tongue rape by a eunuch robot, an attack with a dead husband's nail, a vaginal Venus flytrap death scene...The Statue of David and King David are well-known symbols of defiance and rebellion. The eponymous android is a reflection of Scott's own feelings. He plays the Trickster here. Pan. Idle hands. Satan from Paradise Lost, rebelling against his God, the Father. And like Scott, David feels the abilities to love and create are defining features of intelligent life. Free will.After feeling each other out, Duty and Love battle for control of the movie, with Creativity at stake. We should probably be grateful we are only led to believe, as we were in the marketing build up, that Duty, ie Walter, wins.Ridley must've been some kind of angry when he decided to lash back and enact this cinematic Revenge of the Myth on those that want to constrain his vision. It's a very dangerous game he's playing. The movie is far more meaningful when it is read the way I've presented here, but it also means Scott risks ""alienating"" fans of the franchise. After all, they're part of what is being satirized, and have been left unsated and displeased by this horrific string of clichés, even if they don't get the satire.And maybe that's the intent--to alienate--so that Scott can finish the Prometheus arc according to his vision, unfettered by those viewers who don't care for its new direction. I'm willing to see where he and David want to take us, but I don't know how many of the franchise's fans will be coming along for the rest of the ride.",Alien - Covenant
960,marabue,Why didn't they give Neill Blomkamp the Chance?????,1,5 June 2017,"I didn't go into the movie with high hopes. But still had some, regarding the story. oh my was I disappointed. Even though I had chosen Imax and lowered my hopes. I was truly dissatisfied. I think the movie was well casted. Especially female lead and Danny McBride whom I love. I think Michael Fassbender was to old to play the perfect robot. Otherwise the cast was perfect. The settings and Cgi was also great. But the story and characters. I Mean ... how stupid ... so stupid.... speechless. read some of the other dissing reviews. There is no need to repeat them here. I agree on all. I give it a 3 for the casting and the settings/Scenery/Photography. Everything else is disturbing bad. Especially when you consider Ridley had a second try from the horrible Prometeus and is so experienced a director. But... alas...he didn't learn and has just gotten to old. Anyway! The Alien saga always had a new innovative director at the helm. The first 4 at least. Why give it back to an old and outdated director. Neill Blomkamp should have gotten the chance. I am sure he would have created something fascinating and intelligent. Because Alien Covenent is anything but intelligent! The story is just stupid and uninspiring. Unless Ridley wanted to kill the saga and did it on purpose. There is no excuse. Since Ridley is a seasoned director with a solid reputation. There can really only be one person to blame. Ridley must have had the final saying in the movie process and therefore can only be the one to blame for the terrible and utter mess this screenplay was filmed. utter utter crap.

One dimensional characters and stupidity beyond belief by those who supposedly were in command. I will not even bother to cover details about what part was more offensive.

962,chris_razack,What happened?,1,10 July 2017,"So this film was actually a pretty bad movie in the Alien series. It's quite sad because I thought it was going to be exciting. I thought that because Ridley Scott was directing it then this movie would be just as good as Prometheus. In a video that I saw, Ridley Scott said this was an ""A"" movie and Alien was a ""B"" movie...So lets start from he top and I'll try to tell you everything that I remember. I'll try to keep it short.At the very start of the movie we have acting that I don't particularly think is good from the crew. Now that one actor who usually plays comedic roles is actually doing a good job playing a more serious part but I'm still not satisfied. The captain of this ship quickly dies at the start and the actor who plays him is most likely only in the film because he's friends with the comedic actor that I was just talking about. Quite sad to bring him in this film just because of that but then again that's just what I think.The film tries to make us feel sorry for them but I don't care. I just started watching this film like 5 minutes ago. We then have the camera stay on this one woman character for a while who seems to be the next Ripley character. Seems like this formula is apparent and needed in the series...A signal shows up from some close planet of someone singing a song and the new captain says lets go there. It's honestly the most dumbest thing that someone can do, especially in his position. Especially since these people are supposed to make a new colony. The captain wants to go there because there may be humans there and he doesn't feel like his crew wants to go back to sleep.Lets get this straight. His crew doesn't want to go back to sleep and would rather go to some new planet that they just found that has some suspicious recorded message of a person singing. I don't care if it's a recording of two people asking for help. It's best to stay on the mission. 2000 lives> two people on one planet. Also would you rather go to sleep now and travel to the far off new earth or start your new life on some random unknown planet?Where was I? So they go down and they take off their helmets and breath that fresh air. So illogical especially for ""scientist."" Someone gets infected or something and it happens so quick. Were apparently given the idea that these new alien species just grow faster than the others. OK I'm cool with that but in the future scenes the crab like alien infects someone and that alien grows at the same paced as these new ones so where's the difference? Wheres the consistency? The answer is, there is none. This movie is the product of suits or Ridley has basically lost his touch with how a movie is made. I personally feel that the only directors to really stand by now is Christopher Nolan and James Cameron because they consistently put out good films. Lets continue. So some of the crew go down and some new aliens show up and that guy who got infected births one. These new aliens know how to do judo kicks and stuff. Its cool to see the aliens do new stuff but I'm personally not used to it and the graphics really throw me off. Like it looks good in some scenes but most aren't. Just looks too cgi and that's the thing about this movie. It's like all cgi. In some scenes the alien looks really good though.So the David character from the last film saves them. He brings them to his lab and they find a city full of dead people covered in something. David says you can look and wander around like this is your home. Nobody asks questions about the weird stuff that he has just out in the open. He has long hair and just cuts it in one scene. Weird huh? To just change like that because of visitors? Seems a little bit too fishy for me but not for these characters.So new David and old David talk for this one scene. I rolled my eyes so hard. I personally felt that this scene was done just to show you how perfect the scene is. Because they made this one actor interact with himself pretty much seamlessly for such a long shot. What a joke!I think I'm done talking about the movie. Like this one planet got wiped because of the old David yet these engineers just let it happen and they weren't even spread out on other planets close to it??? Like it just blows my mind how bad this movie really is. The engineers are so much more advanced than humans and the old David and the old David just walks in and pours black liquid over all the engineers on this one planet in the sky. It doesn't make any sense.Now I'm sure there are more engineers out there in space on different planets but to really just sit down and watch this was hard.There was this one part where the new Ripley tries to be a hero and is dangling from the ship and it just looks terrible and is way too over the top. Any human with common sense wouldn't put their life on the line on a metal rope outside on the ship to try and kill an alien while the ship itself is having trouble staying a float in the sky.Honestly, I'm so done talking about this film. Watch another movie. Hopefully a true fan of the alien series does make a new alien film someday.",Alien - Covenant
963,mike-1716,Requires viewers who can think,9,21 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant is a worthy successor to Alien and Prometheus.Beautifully filmed, it explores the aftermath of Elizabeth Shaw's desire to visit the Engineer home world.If you're after unrelenting terror, this movie isn't for you. It is far more cerebral and plays instead with the topics of creation, morality, evil and corruption.I find it somewhat disturbing that the 'best' user review on this forum at the time of writing (by http://www.imdb.com/user/ur8378692/) has been up-voted by so many viewers. The reason being that each and every one of the 36 alleged faults can be refuted so easily. There isn't room here to write a full rebuttal, but here are the first five. Every single one of the remaining criticisms is baseless. It's a shockingly bad attempt at finding flaws.1. There is a ship full off over 1000 sleeping passengers. Yet they have just one android to look after it all. Why not have 3, 10 or even 20! They don't age and surely you need a backup.It is a massive assumption to imply that the dormant passengers need much looking after.2. A rogue unexplained solar flare hits the ship disabling it, and Walter says they should leave the area asap. But instead they go further into it.No they don't. They go to a different 'area'3. An astronaut outside the ship picks up a stray signal through his helmets two-way radio, that somehow appears in visual form on the glass of his helmet? Yet the giant ship with the radio dish right next to him misses it!As was explained for this very reason in the dialogue, he was outside the ship's communications buffers.4. How did they determine the artist from the white noise? What they found later no-way explains why they sent a song into space for no apparent reason!It was a choppy radio signal with a low signal-to-noise ratio, but strong enough to pick up the vocals (and recognised as such by someone familiar with the song). We are not party to *why* a hijacked Engineer ship broadcasts a repeated message. Perhaps it's like a car alarm. Who cares? It's not important.5. They are able to trace a stray video signal to a planet two weeks away at star-ship speed.The relative speed of the ship and the planet was small (the crew were talking about the series of 'jumps' that they were taking, and they had clearly just come out of such a jump).",Alien - Covenant
964,HomeinIndiana,"See the movie, ignore the vitriol",10,27 May 2017,"Superficially, this movie looks like a replay of the original Alien--a crew of people of varying capabilities, some of whom make human mistakes. (And by the way: if the original crew of Alien had been subjected to the current climate of fault-finding, the film would never have become a favorite; the Nostromo crew made quite a few dumb mistakes as well, as did the people in Aliens.) But the apparent similarity to the first Alien is illusory. This movie is a straight-up horror film, with one of the most insidious villains (David) and one of the most genuinely terrifying endings I can remember. (Just put yourself in Daniels' place.) And for those who say that they can see the twist ending coming? Duh. You're supposed to be able to see it coming; that's where the tension arises in the last ten minutes. The ending is admittedly a set-up for the next film; but even if there is no next film, the ending still works as the ultimate horror.The film is well acted, especially by Fassbender, who also creates a memorable and distinctive character in Walter; the rest of the crew is likable, the setting and cinematography are extraordinary.",Alien - Covenant
965,raiderreggid,A film worthy of being sent into deep space and shot out an airlock,1,23 January 2019,"I really have to admire Mr. Scott. I didn't think it was possible to make a film worse than the nonsensical, imbecilic, rambling, disjointed, pseudo-religious, laughable mess that was ""Prometheus,"" yet somehow, the dedicated Mr. Scott managed to do so remarkably easily. So, congrats, Ridley - you've made a film so bad it makes your truly horrendous previous effort look good by comparison. Quite an accomplishment. Good on ya, mate.I will give Scott credit for one worthy effort, however. While we are so often presented with visions of distopian futures where humanity is reduced to a brutal game of survival of the fittest, it is laudable that Mr. Scott instead chose to portray a brighter, happier, more just and equitable future in which the mentally challenged, the mentally unstable, and the mentally incompetent are not locked away, cast aside, or institutionalized, but where, despite their severe cognitive and emotional disabilities, they can nonetheless aspire to become captains and first mates, science officers, and engineers on the most important, expensive deep-space missions ever conceived. Portraying that kind of progessive corporate culture from the Weyland Corp is a rare, wondrous vision indeed. Kudos, Mr. Scott - people at the furthest, lowest reaches of the spectrum deserve employment on multi-billion dollar space ventures, too. Thank you for your brave portrayal of the non-discrimination policies of the future.The only remaining question is whether Scott, if given the chance, can somehow make the next Alien film even worse than this abomination. I believe he can. I believe in your ability to sink even lower, Mr. Scott, because I choose to believe.",Alien - Covenant
966,Impsman,Underwhelmed,5,14 May 2017,"I really wanted to like this movie a lot, but whilst it has some merit I came away feeling disappointed in the overall film.The film acts as a follow on from Prometheus and has an intriguing beginning with the 'birth' of David, the only real surviving link to that film. His initial conversation with his creator/father Peter Weyland is fascinating and promises much in how the two films are linked. We then cut to the spaceship Covenant and the beginning string is largely forgotten, much to the films loss.We then follow the crew of the Covenant who have been awoken early from their hyper-sleep en-route to set up a colony on a far off planet. This crew are partners of each other which is quite a neat idea as it should increase the dramatic potential when you are not just looking out for yourself but also a loved one, but this isn't followed to its potential. The only partnership which rings true is that of T and his wife. Others it is often unclear exactly who is married/with whom as there is little or no time given to personal grief as the losses mount.There are also some decisions made by characters who should be far more intelligent seemingly to move the plot along. Gaps in logic abound and you find yourself being frustrated over these which takes you out of the film experience.What I suspect is that as with many Ridley Scott films there will be a Directors cut released on DVD which will add to the plot and give a more cohesive structure. I know that there have been scenes filmed involving Noomi Rapace from the previous film which add to the character of David and explains further his motivations which should have been in this film. I also recall from the first trailer a group conversation with the crew including James Franco's character which is also missing from the film which would have added to establishing the crew's characters much sooner. Hopefully there are also additional scenes which are available to include which may explain certain individuals decisions better and whether what should have been more sensible options were considered.As said it isn't without some merit. The twin performance of Micheal Fassbender is very impressive. The subtle differences between the characters of David and Walter is very well played. Unfortunately none of the other characters resonate enough to really care what happens to them. Some of the set pieces such as a battle on a rescue ship is very well done, but there is a lack of tension throughout the film. The film as with all of Scott's is beautifully filmed.Overall a missed opportunity to get the Alien story back on track",Alien - Covenant
967,J_Brian,How will they explain the de-evolution of technology between the prequels and Alien?,4,26 September 2017,"There are so many armchair critics and wannabe cinema experts here dishing out their drivel on why they think the CGI looks horrible or that Mr. Scott is unable to direct a movie. I won't waste your time with such nonsensical garbage. However, I would like to ask the filmmakers how they are going to explain the drastic 18 year de-evolution of technology between all of the pretty holograms and colorful touch screens of the Covenant (and all human ships in Prometheus) and the archaic keyboards, green computer screens and DOS-like operating systems of the Nostromo. ???? Anyone? I mean, according to the lore of the Alien universe on Xenopedia, the events in Prometheus take place in the year 2093. Eleven years later, in 2104, the Conventant is 7 years away from its destination (probably about 3 years into its mission) when disaster strikes. Which means that the ships in these two scenarios had to have been built before 2104. However, the Nostromo was constructed in the year 2101... obviously AFTER the Convenant, considering the immense size of the colonist cargo ship which must have taken several years to build then stock with supplies, colonists, etc. And yet the Nostromo is equipped with computer technology that seems to be 20 to 30 years older. Please explain... And you are NOT ALLOWED to use the BS excuse that Lucas used to explain the difference between the pretty ships of the prequels and pieces of junk in the originals. Remember, there was only about a 19 year time lapse between episodes 3 and 4 and his excuse, though it may be sort of logical, was extremely thin.SPOILER AHEAD.... And by the way, why didn't David just allow his alien to kill the remaining 2 crew members in the end and then take over the ship? Why the whole deception of letting them think he was Walter to the point of helping them kill it and then putting them back to sleep? That would have been a much more sinister and horrific ending than the out-dated ""twist ending"" that we all saw coming.

One would have expected a true sequel to 'Prometheus', this last title which was a let down by itself though not so much as 'Alien Covenant'.

Gone are the days when studios were willing to take risks and give a break to fledgling filmmakers. The studio heads are all money-men that use algorithms to generate money over content, and have absolutely no knowledge (or love) of cinema. Having said that, this movie has bad writing, poor casting, sub-par CGI (The Matrix holds up better), and it is intensely stupid to boot. How the hell would somebody so quickly identify a John Denver song nearly 150 years after it was released? Can you think of a song that old? Give me a break; I can only suspend my disbelief so far. This is exactly what you would expect from a shameless, soulless, hollow attempt to capitalize on a beloved sci-fi classic. Just avoid this cash-grab garbage and watch the first two movies again.

971,ewf1000,Ultimately disappointing,4,21 May 2017,"Spoilers ahead: be warned.The previews for this flick looked promising, enough so that I rushed to the theater on opening day. I should have waited for feedback and reviews. While there are decent special effects here and a suspenseful moment or two, this film mostly disappointed me. I didn't connect with any of the characters, there were glaring plot holes, and I saw the twist ending coming the moment the two androids squared off against each other.The characters behaved illogically, even stupidly. The most blatant example occurred when the pilot endangered the lives of the 2000 colonists on board his interstellar cruiser by flying into a raging storm he'd been warned would tear the ship apart. And why did he do this? Because he was worried about his wife on the planet below. It never seemed to occur to him that, apart from killing the passengers he was charged with protecting, he wouldn't be able to do a thing to help his wife if the ship came apart and crashed in pieces around her.The captain of the ship finds one of his crew members decapitated at the feet of an android that has been missing in space for ten years and an alien life-form that has the blood of his crew member dripping from its teeth. He kills the alien but not only leaves the android untouched, he lets it lead him into a cave filled with alien eggs, accepts the android's assurance that the alien eggs are ""perfectly safe,"" and promptly sticks his nose in the middle of a just-opened egg.I understand there are more films to come in this franchise. I sincerely hope for something fresh and different in those movies. Like, maybe, interesting characters who behave intelligently and logically when facing the unknown. And maybe a plot that doesn't rehash old story ideas again and again but introduces an intriguing spin that takes the franchise in new, unexplored directions.",Alien - Covenant
972,bradleysteele98,A mixed review on the new Alien film.....,8,26 May 2017,"** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** Overall the new Alien film was a good follow on further into it's world, but there were a few things that I thought could have easily been changed or thought into more within the story it's self. Firstly, the whole thing with the crew going down to the planet to look into it and see where a 'song' sound came from that they hear over the radio is just ridiculous. They decided to send around 10 people down into the planet when they could've sent around 4 and had less people to look out for if something were to happen, which it did. Also the characters acted dumb, in the medical bay when the one woman brings the infected guy into the quarantine zone, she turns around to get out but the other woman has locked her in.....? I have no idea why she thought that would be a good idea when, the woman who locked the other woman in there, had blood on her face from the guy who was infected. So she made it worse by putting herself and others in danger. She basically left the girl in there to die, but went back when she heard her calling out and by the time she got back the other girl had basically been killed. Don't get me wrong, I love the Alien films and I don't HATE this film I just think it could've been thought into a bit more. I mean I guess there are different ways people react in these situations but locking someone in... surely that's the last resort and I don't believe the other girl was infected. The ending was annoying as well, because they should of asked the android security questions to see if it wasn't the real one. I thought the gore in the film was amazing though, that actually made me feel a bit, sick. The way it showed how the Aliens started off as well was great and I liked how it showed them becoming their actual size and colour throughout the film as it shows them being a white little Alien at the beginning and they gradually become the scary black creatures that are seen in the previous films.",Alien - Covenant

If you aren't planning to watch it in IMAX, you may not be able to hit even a 5/10 for this movie.SPOILERS AHEAD: The only surprise that I got from this movie, came only after the movie was ended. And that surprise was that there is not even a single surprise in the movie. There is nothing new/unique as far as the story of the movie goes, nothing, a big circle i.e. 0. If you have watched following things, you will be really disappointed after watching Alien: Covenant 1. Alien: Covenant final trailer. 2. Alien, Aliens and Alien 3 movies. 3. Prometheus (2012). 4.

And only thing that is not shown in the trailer, is so lame that it can't be called a twist/surprise, too.I loved Prometheus. But, this one.... Gosh!P.S: Aren't the crew members supposed to be geniuses/pros in their field (if not more)? (The people who are responsible for >2000 people's lives and future of a whole race in their hands).Which dumbass would take his ship in to a storm range i.e. ~80kilometers, and then take a dip directly to 40kilometers, just to make the communications little clearer? Even ~80km range was on the edge of a danger and suddenly the guy makes a choice of take a dive to 40km range. At 80km, they had established the communication back. But, at 80km it was not clear. So, instead of trying to go little more in, say at 70km from the surface, all of a sudden he just halves the number and there is no objection from the other two. Wow! Ridley Scott is one of the greatest directors of our age, no doubt.

976,peter_lantz,Better Than Prometheus,3,11 May 2018,"I wouldn't be honest if I said that I hated this film, it was no where near The Last Jedi terrible level. TLJ was a crime against humanity, Alien: Covenant, didn't go that far, but was close. Prometheus was terrible, except visually, I did like some of the visual effects in Prometheus, but it was sooooo borrring, my God, it was boring. The plot of Alien: Covenant had issues, sure, but at least I was able to follow it and it wasn't boring like Prometheus. Now, if we compare Alien: Covenant to Alien, the movie falls very short. I think the issue is they went all philosophical, which works in some movies, but not in Alien. Alien is meant to terrify and be driven by awesome characters. Granted, Ripley is hard to beat, she was such a bad ass of a character, it would be hard to top her. There was some deep message trying to be conveyed through AC, but I didn't really get it and it felt out of place. Specifically when they showed the old city being consumed by the Aliens, I think that was a metaphor for something, but I don't really care. I'm in the theater to watch a Xenomorph kick some human ass and then get topped by a awesome character. I was instead bored to death by a weird android, gather around kids it's time for a history lesson, yayyyyy, history. Then we learn the android is really a bad guy who's trying to preserve the Alien species. I guess this was supposed to lead into the next movie, which I heard was cancelled, damn. Looking back on the film, I think my biggest issue with the movie was the tone. In the original Alien and Aliens too, the tone was optimistic and heroism. AC was dark, gloomy, boring, and depressing, because the bad android loses, but then wins in the end, pretending to be the good android. I give the film 3 stars because it wasn't the worst movie I've seen but, it definitely didn't reach average status.

If you're like me and you couldn't care less about pale bald space men, I can still recommend this movie... as a comedy. There are some moments of pure slap-stick and plenty of death by face-palm-inducing stupidity. If you're the kind of person who enjoys watching idiots get what's coming to them, then you'll probably like this movie.",Alien - Covenant
980,lou-45632,Forgettable,4,4 August 2017,"Hollywood seems to have pretty much given up about story telling. They are completely unable to produce anything original at this point. All we get are endless remakes, rehashes, reboots, and sequels. This latest entry in the Alien saga proves the point: There is nothing here which you haven't seen before, it's all just a rehash of elements from the previous Alien movies plus standard horror movie jump scares and gore. It's derivative, bland, boring, forgettable.The original Alien movie was famous for its chest-buster scene, so you put in another chest-buster scene plus you add a back-buster scene? Really? That's the most creative thing you could come up with?There could have been a lot of interesting ideas to explore around the concept of the xenomorph as ""the perfect organism"". Alas, none of that happened.Where are the memorable and likable characters? Where is the character development? Where is the slow build-up of tension? Where are the original ideas to fight the (seemingly) invincible alien? Where are the interesting and relevant dialogues? Finally, two more points: What made me originally interested in this movie was the end of Prometheus, where it was hinted that we would finally find out more about the Engineers. However, in this one they killed all the Engineers before the movie even started! What a disappointment and a waste of potential. As another reviewer pointed out, it's actually a pity that movie makers these days feel they have to explain everything that was left untold in the classics. In the original Alien movie, the alien was some mysterious creature from outer space. Nobody knew exactly what it was or where it came from. That was part of its fascination. Now we had everything explained, we've seen the alien from every angle, and as a result it feels much smaller and less significant.",Alien - Covenant

(same as in ""Prometheus"") They can pick up a signal somewhere in the universe but they cant communicate from orbit to the planets surface due to a storm in the year 2104. there is plot holes, there are things that make no sense. The characters are expendables, the aliens are not that scary and in the end it is all about an evil cyborg on a destructive course. what i miss the most is the slowly build up tension like in all other alien-movies. here it is disaster right from the start and things only get worse and worse...",Alien - Covenant
982,terhitapiainen,Scare jumps and dystopic atmosphere,6,11 May 2017,"Original Alien was a beautiful, lingering slow pace horror film among working crew with an unusual female hero and survivor. The theme of violent alien births was unique and terrifying. The monster was the best alien monster ever. We have all these elements here in Covenant film. The film actually works quite well because sometimes it is nice to eat pop corn and get regular jump scares. It is oddly satisfying to see the familiar elements of a teenage horror movie plot: no, no, don't go there alone! The best familiar elements of Alien work well: so clever and diverse xenophorm and tons of blood. The new aspect in this film is its dystopic atmosphere which is very dark and deep. However, because I had already decided that this is a pop corn movie with jump scares, the sudden depth and darkness seemed like there were two movies that were combined into one unsatisfying mixture. My pop corns were not well suited for the last part of the movie. I loved the acting of the all remaining characters, you know who when you get there. I would have hoped that the recycling of Alien theme would have been more like a classic horror film and less like a pseudointellectual and pseudophilosophical science fiction with unsatisfying feeling.",Alien - Covenant

984,derwunderbaremandarin,A touch of Star Trek. Exercises in Futility,1,3 June 2017,"I did not think it was possible, but Covenant is even weaker than its predecessor and has little to do with the original Alien concept. The original story focused on the xenomorph as a symbol for deadly and almost invincible human greed. It was based on solid storytelling, good dialogue and character development, innovative set design etc. Remember: the first and still best movie in the series was made on a budget. It was craftsmanship and art that made it what it is. Everything went over board with Prometheus, where the xenomorph became a meaningless extra while the film really was about man trying to find his creator. Storytelling and dialogues went further downhill (I did not think it was possible after Alien IV) and all attempts by Scott to plagiarize positive elements of his own movies failed miserably: instead of craftsmanship there were loads of expensive VFX. Money, however, cannot make a good film, let alone write a good plot. Covenant is a disaster. Here you go: more expensive VFX which, alas, still look what they are and hence *pale* in comparison to 1979 hand modeling. A plot that - again - is about man looking for his creator. Is this a plot to be presented in a sci-fi format by a director who scored big time some 40 years ago but has produced nothing but sub- par flicks ever since? Yes, there is a great danger: the whole thing can easily get very pathetic. Quoting Wagner and Byron does not help, on the contrary. Throwing in the xenomorph, slightly remodeled, does not help either. Why has Scott abandoned the original Alien concept? Maybe he felt that it had become outdated and decided to replace it with this pseudo-philosophical creation mumbo-jumbo instead. A touch of Star Trek. Ridley, it is sci-fi horror, and you have to do a hell of a better job to present such a subject in such a format without looking like a total half-wit. Tarkovsky could pull that off, or Kubrick... and without all the shitty VFX. I refuse to believe that the original Alien concept is an anachronism. We just need someone who can tell the story the right way. No need for a huge budget, no need for hollow effects. Oh, btw: since the xenomorph is nothing but an extra and since the story is very predictable and the storytelling poor, it's not scary at all. I remember having read about jump scares. Really? Yawn. Alien I-IV are way more scary than this... dunno what to call it. Desperate attempt of an aging director to treat subjects that he deems important maybe. Creation. Ugh.",Alien - Covenant

986,CINEFILMSS,A Film likely to get you hooked!,9,1 July 2020,"With a strong start that keeps your attention hooked on the storyline and wanting to find out more, the film certainly knows how to keep a viewers attention.The opening stirs up a lot of questions, this allows the audience to retain attention on the film as they will want to find out the answers to these questions, the opening is intriguing and enjoyable. Not much action at the start but that's not a bad thing.The character development is quite slow but strong, allowing us to feel for the characters and get a sense of understanding of how the characters are related to each other. With a slow character development it allows us to get personal with the characters over the course of the film rather then all at once meaning the film stays interesting through out.The acting is good, however some scenes may be classed as over acted.The fast paced action makes it hard to get to grips with what is going on however on the plus side it is more realistic, as action in real life, so to speak if you encountered these creatures in real life you wouldn't be moving slowly or aiming well. Alongside the fast paced action the introduction of a new character, 'David' is extremely interesting and viewer attention retaining, stirs up a lot of questions like, Who is he?, What is he doing on the planet?The Visual effects are out of this world which compliments the interesting story line throughout the film.Although this film has some amazing points there is, like most films room for improvement.",Alien - Covenant
987,Chronosus,Worst of both worlds,4,19 May 2017,"I have a confession to make. I really liked Prometheus. It is flawed movie, sure, but I'm certain that with relatively few script tweaks it would have been a masterpiece. It tried something new, it had a fresh take on the story and it deepened the mythology of Alien universe while asking some really interesting questions. Then it not only failed to answer them but left a lot of plot points hanging in the air. Oh yeah, and it had some really stupid scientist characters. We were left hanging with a lot of question marks over our heads. The next movie in the trilogy had a great foundation to further deepen the mythology and answer at least few burning questions. Well, I'm afraid to say that they decided to kick all of it to the background and go with the plot that wasn't as interesting in the first place, and then made a mess of it in the process. It seems as the whole plot of this movie is made just to bring it to the first Alien movie. If there's no story at least action should be classic Alien(s), right? No... the action is rehash of what we got in all of the earlier movies, with nothing new brought to the table, but it is still the best part of the movie. OK, but at least the single biggest complaint about Prometheus, dumb characters is remedied. Yeah, they evolved. They are not just stupid this time around, but incredibly clumsy too! Acting is also incredibly inconsistent, and really bad at times.The only important question left to ask after the movie has ended is why it is called Alien? It is direct sequel to Prometheus, and there's not nearly enough aliens in it to warrant that title. They are almost sidekicks in this. The prologue ""The Crossing"" seems as a teaser for a movie that we should have got, direct sequel exploring the themes of Prometheus with stupid characters out of the way. Unfortunately, we are left just with stupid characters and a lame excuse for a plot. There is still hope that the last in the trilogy will steer it towards some new interesting themes, but after this pointless mess it's hard to see how.",Alien - Covenant

990,cookyman11,"Good horror, not for the intellectually elitist",7,12 August 2017,"The reviews around this movie have all stemmed from how stupid the characters and writing is. I get it. But people need to be reminded of a few things:When people land on strange planets and immediately see their friends giving birth to animals, they tend to go into fight or flight and great decisions aren't made.This is a colonization expedition. Sure it would be nice to have spacesuits on when you explore the planet, but these people had the mindset they're staying. leaving the spaceship without a suit is not that far fetched. They could have spent 4 years on that planet without spacesuits and never run into that virus. Why not assume the planet is livable? They're there to test the livability of the planet. Wouldn't it be nice to know if the planet isn't livable without a spacesuit prior to releasing the 2000 colonists you have on board?Choosing to go to the planet in the first place was a sound decision. Captain just burned to death in his sleep, damage to the ship, and discovering a new planet with better stats than the original mission as well as an earth originated distress signal, and a 2 week flight time vs 7 years??? Yeah that's a pretty solid calculated risk.They're aliens. Again, most people are not going to react intelligently when the SHTF in this scenario. The captain following David down the basement to the eggs isn't far fetched. He was relatively cautious, had to assume the android could not knowingly hurt him, and probably at that point after losing his wife just wanted to know what the heck was going on. OK, staring in an alien egg after all that is dumb, but the viewer has to allow these dumb decisions as plot points otherwise there's no movie.The fact that David created the Aliens sucks, but it doesn't ruin the franchise for me. Aliens are Aliens. They're scary as F either way. Maybe it makes sense that the perfect biological being did not occur through nature?As an Alien film, I liked it #3 right behind the first 2. Still far behind but a solid addition. The movie was beautiful, nobody can deny the visuals, and it was action packed (SHTF about 20 minutes in and there was almost no downtime after). The Alien births were exremely well done, imo best in the franchise, especially the back burster. It was gory as heck and very dark and desperate. We just need to get over the fact that there will never be another Alien or Aliens. The fans asked Ridley Scott for more xenomorphs after Prometheus and more gore and got it. You can't have gore and horror in an intellectually stimulating package and well written script unless you're one of the 5 movies in cinema history who had a perfect storm come through and hit it.It was worth watching to me",Alien - Covenant
991,dannyinformal,A stain on Alien's legacy.,5,26 January 2018,"Where to start?Let's make a few educated assumptions first;A. We can all agree that the Covenant crew were highly educated, intelligent individuals since they carried responsibility for over two thousand colonists.
B. The colonists' survival was paramount and would have been the number one priority throughout their whole endeavour.
C. Walter, was a physically improved version of DavidNow that we've established this, quite a few scenario's stop making sense. SPOILERS AHEADThe crew's stupidity
When the Covenant's crew discover this new planet and decide to check it out, they exit their ships without any protective gear; no helmets, not protective suits, nothing. Even if the atmospheric scans didn't show any signs of imminent danger, does this seem like a decision highly intelligent people in charge of a human colony would make? To stroll out of their ship, onto a new world with an unknown ecosystem without any precautions? It doesn't, does it?Once having egressed their vehicle, the planet quickly showed signs of past life; the wheat at first and the massive structure a bit later. How come the lack of any discernible living organism never rang a bell? Wouldn't that simple fact put anyone remotely sane on high alert? What about the hundreds of humanoids that were obviously victims of a disaster?Then, of course, we have the idiot that isolated himself to take two puffs of a cigarette; just enough to get infected by the spores and go back to the biologist taking samples. One could argue he took some distance in order not to compromise the scene, but it wouldn't be a solid argument.Then we have Oram, arguably the most stupid individual ever written by anyone. When he finds David standing in front of the Alien that had just brutally decapitated a crew member and asks him to move, he refused. Not only did David bask in awe at the sight of the beast that had already viciously murdered more than one crew mate, he also cried in agony when Oram unloaded his rifle on it.A sane person would've shot David through the head after that. Not Oram, no. Apparently his stupidity had not reached the intended climax yet, for he lowered his gun and promptly followed David when he asked him to join him in his creepy cellar. Upon entering this cave like space Oram was confronted with the classic face-hugger eggs. With visible disgust in his eyes his approach was careful, until David told him it was ""perfectly safe"" of course. Sure, trust a synthetic that had nearly lost his mind when you killed an unknown organism that had devoured your crew member. Why not?He closed in on an egg and when it opened he practically stuck his face in it.The perfect organism
The first question that popped into mind when seeing the classic eggs was: ""Why do these even exist?"" Wasn't David trying to perfect the Alien life form? Why then did his genetic modifications complicate the insemination and gestation? If you remember, two crew members were infected by spores secreted by small, nigh invisible egg-shaped organisms or fungi not long after having touched down on the planet. Doesn't this seem a much more efficient way of inseminating human organisms, rather than having large, obviously disquieting eggs produce an organism that must impregnate you orally? It doesn't make any sense.As a long-time fan of the Alien series, I feel this film should be disregarded as a whole. The horrible writing and worse directing makes it frustrating to watch. Films and stories in general, needn't be realistic. But they do need to respect the reality they're set in.Ridley Scott should take the back seat; even David Fincher was able to create a more believable universe with the highly underrated Alien 3.What a damn shame.",Alien - Covenant

993,beckett-69658,Noooooope.,2,2 June 2020,"I love the Alien franchise. Even the much maligned Resurrection works for me. Then Prometheus happened and, despite some epic visuals & a beautiful score, it was a horrific mess. So hope wasn't high for the sequel. And Covenant follows much the same path. Disappointment.Whilst the opening promises much with stunning visuals and nice development of suspense a la the original film, it quickly descends into the failings that hampered Prometheus. The narrative is so convoluted that it relies on heavy exposition to really reveal what is going on.Katherine Waterston does a good job once you get past the early parts of the film and Danny McBride is a revelation for me. Those used to the goofball that McBride usually plays may find themselves surprised by the depth he brings to his role. Michael Fassbender is amazing as ever and it does feel as if Ridley Scott has made these two films entirely as a vehicle for him!In summary, this thing comes across as a pastiche of the original trilogy, harvesting many of the successful tropes of those films and saddling them with a ponderous and awkward story.So much promise, so poorly executed.",Alien - Covenant

995,voltK,Supreme Disappointment,1,3 August 2017,"I loved Prometheus and was very excited about a sequel that would answer some of the unanswered questions from that movie. Unfortunately, Alien: Covenant is garbage. You're basically just watching the crew of the Covenant get picked off one by one by CGI aliens, and there's about 5 minutes or so that answer a few questions about what happened after the end of Prometheus. The plot is like something written by a teenager. The characters are uninteresting and unlikable, and you're really not given any time to get to know them or care about them. It looks like the film didn't earn back what they spent to make it. They deserve to take a loss for releasing such a lame movie like this one.",Alien - Covenant

Because there is none and they behave like children, you would think that the hardcore space traveler had some cool to them.When people starts dying and others react to it, who's wife/husband was that and why was it I cared.. no I didn't because there is no character build up at all.We go from Prometheus wearing helmet to, ohh its fine nothing will happen on an alien planet, no need to wear protective gear. Also there is a crazy freak storm going on, yeah we will land right away of cause, no need to survey from above at all.James Franco why was he in the movie, bet someone lost a bet and had to put him in it, oh he does fine for the 10 seconds he has of screen time.After a marathon up to this one with all the movies, I got to say I even like 4 better then this one.I feared more for the Covenant (Mother), then anyone else besides Walter, I felt for Walter him I cheered for.I liked the Alien vs Predator movies better then this one, at least they made me care a bit...

997,teldrassil99,"We have purposely trained them wrong, as a joke!",1,19 May 2017,"A colony ship is sent from earth to a remote planet. Someone in charge must have *really* hated those colonists, since they chose the most stupid and inept crew imaginable to try and get them to their new home. If you thought that some of the characters and their actions in Prometheus were dumb, hold on to your hats, because things are about to get worse in Alien:Covenant. Other people have already provided comprehensive lists of the many mind-bogglingly stupid moments in this movie. But it would be remiss not to mention at least one highlight. After interrupting a clearly crazy android in the process of trying to make friends with an alien creature that decapitated one of his crew members just moments before, the captain decides to follow the android into a damp basement, to have a good chat. Curious about weird slimy eggs that he sees there, the captain is momentarily cautious. But then the same clearly murderous and doesn't-care-for-humanity android proceeds to tell him that it's quite safe to look more closely. So the captain leans right in for a good look. Guess what happens next?Really, if these people were carrying the hopes of humanity for a new start on another world, then perhaps David's plan to stop them at all costs isn't so bad.Other disappointments are the removal of Shaw, the heroine of Prometheus who had made it her personal mission to find the Engineers and ask them: ""Why??"". By simply killing her off in ""between time"", Alien:Covenant essentially made the trials and challenges that she previously went through completely meaningless. And while the movie tried to incorporate some other ""deep"" questions, overall those attempts came across as shallow re-hashings of tired issues such as the role of ""faith"", and ""evil AI"". On the positive side, overall the movie looks beautiful, with top-notch camera-work and special effects. (But while the aliens look great in most scenes, was it really necessary to have a dancing xenomorph hatchling that looks like it was inspired by the freaky CGI Dancing Baby from old Ally McBeal episodes?)It's too bad that despite all the money that was clearly spent on art direction and special effects, there seems to once again have been no funding left to get the script proof-read by someone who possesses even a small dose of sense or logic.

998,tapping_2003,Not necessary,5,13 May 2017,"We probably all knew something was off the way the marketing campaign was heading this one. Way too much revealed going for the hard sell. Generally that's a sign someone is trying to hook us for a bum ride.I grew up loving Aliens almost wearing out my VHS copy I must have viewed it once a week for sometime. After finding Alien and appreciating its gritty aesthetic and suspense filled while simple story telling. After being obsessed with all things xeno related...So...I was one who did enjoy Prometheus its and its turn towards the sci-fi adventure movie, slightly p*ssed RS gave into the studios and gave us the Deacon and giant facehugger thing at the end.. though I left the movie with an imagination filled with what would follow in David and Shaws adventure flying off in the engineers ship.Its a shame then that Covenant p*ssed all over that dream and gave us a by the numbers rehash of the first two Alien movies with some titbits of the Prometious plot thrown in to try and glue the two movies together.What I liked: visually the film looked great, the first half paced well and offered some genuine shocks though with some HUH moments thrown in...this seemed to be consistent throughout the movie...stuff happening that just seemed stupid or comedic. I recall another reviewer saying everyone seemed stupid or incompetent. Perhaps we could not expect a group of colonists to be hardened killers so this could be a little harsh.David does have some interesting moments and psychotic behaviour though mostly his god/Hitler complex is super clichéd. Everything involving the xeno is just awful...I have nothing to say.I did enjoy the neomorph and found it rather creepy. I would say it really is the star of this film. You could just walk out the cinema after the demise of the neomoph and be left thinking at wasn't so bad...stay till the end and you could regret it..Final conclusion...walking in I said...I hope its at least better than Alien Resurrection... walking out I can't even say it even met that benchmark.",Alien - Covenant

Yes the crew are on a long voyage to a potential colony world but to veer off course to investigate a mysterious signal then land on it with no advance scanning to see if any potential threats existed before setting out to explore it made no common sense. How many potential colonists set foot on an alien and light up a cigar, wear no protective masks and wander about willy nilly? One even wanders off to have a cigarette on his own. The actors tried to make the best of a weak script and very little is explained as to why, how or when the mysterious signal was sent.

1000,foxtrot-21,Alien: Obituary,3,14 May 2017,"There is the time in everybody's life when he or she is at the top of the abilities and does something great. That time passes and then there is just the average level, not that special at all. The worst thing that can happen is when this person believes that is able to maintain the highest level for a very long time, despite the naked truth he/she is no longer touched by the God's hand. This was the case with George Lucas and his Star Wars prequels, the same now goes with Ridley Scott's Alien. He's created the best sci-fi horror of all time and years later returned to the genre, backed by many fans, hoping the story (already severely damaged by Alien: Resurrection and AvP) can be invigorated. This is how Alien: Covenant emerged.The previous installment, i.e. Prometheus, was the decent attempt to expand the universe, provided you watch it not as the Alien movie, but the separate side story. The less you made connections with Alien, the better. Unfortunately, Coventant, tries to combine the classic Alien story with the follow-up to the Prometheus, which cannot be done successfully. Let's see how Ridley Scott methodically destroyed his own child.First of all, this is NOT an Alien movie. Although the soundtrack tries to set the climax identical to the 1979 original (borrowing the key tunes and melody) which is also reinforced by the opening screen, it feels forced and will just make you angry as you see all details that contradict the canon. The action is too fast and the viewer is unable to sink into the world (both Alien and Aliens start very slowly). This is the same problem as with the new The Thing - seemingly everything looks as it should, but eventually we get only fast-paced Die Hard-style action flick. Space monsters are no longer frightening as they are not strange, unknown creatures, but simply fast-running dogs or pumas... Their life cycle is also nonsensical here, by the way...The movie fails as the sequel to Prometheus. The latter ended with open questions, like why mankind was created by Engineers, why they wanted to destroy humans, etc. None of these will be answered, as this is no longer the case. No one asks philosophical questions about the origins and fate of mankind. You will not see Space Jockeys here, there will be no sophisticated and mesmerizing imagery of the alien world, originally created by H.R. Giger.What's worse, this is the movie about the android and his hatred towards not only the mankind, but all living creatures. David is the main character, all other protagonists are expendable and uninteresting. Michael Fassbender is the only actor worth watching here, but his character does not fit the Alien universe.The film is well made, landscapes are great, but the story falls flat and the ending is painfully predictable. I know it is close to impossible to see a good Alien movie in the future, but if Neill Blomkamp does not get his chance to do the ""actual"" Alien 3, there is no point in waiting for the incoming movies made by Ridley Scott.

I was hugely disappointed by Prometheus and not because they didn't show the actual alien until the last two seconds. Prometheus wasn't good because there was a disjointed flow to the plot, which was basically a series of disconnected scenes. The zombie guy and the middle third of Prometheus was terrible. Alien Covenant on the other hand had a completely coherent plot. Every scene flowed smoothly into the subsequent scene. The plot was awesome, tying multiple alien movies together. The acting was excellent. The amount of Gore, scary moments, anticipation, and action balanced perfectly with the dialogue scenes. Wow, just wow. Best movie I've seen in years, 9.5/10.I just wanted to add that I went and watched this movie a second time, and feel exactly the same way. I honestly don't understand all the negative backlash. The main gripes with the negative reviewers (1 star, really?) are with stupid characters and a bad plot. I disagree on both accounts. The characters react realistically in an emotional unprecedented situation. Their captain is burned alive, the 2nd in command is an inexperienced leader with confidence issues (played brilliantly by Billy Crudup). Waterson and Fassenberger are amazingly believable as well. Waterson brings back some of that old Ripley leadership badass in a female lead. The complimentary characters are solid as well in their smaller roles. The one thing that seemed a bit unrealistic during the film that I mentioned to my friend was why they didn't wear any type of breathing apparatus on an undiscovered alien world. That seemed like an obvious oversight in the script, but other than that, everything else made logical sense to me. I loved the plot twists and how there was a smooth flow to the movie. Each scene felt completely appropriate for that point in time of the film when it was shown. This was a big flaw with Prometheus, but a big strength for this film. Again, I do no understand the criticism. I'm not some teenager that have only seen a few dozen science fiction films. I've seen every Sci-fi movie and TV series made since 1977, and this is one of the best ones I've seen. As far as a cross breed of sci-fi and horror, it doesn't get much better than this movie. Go see it, ignore the haters!",Alien - Covenant
1003,desertbear34,"Disappointing, but OK",6,20 May 2017,"I've been jonesing for this movie for a year! I bought my tickets on Fandango a week ahead so I could get the reclining seats we wanted and watch it in the best possible conditions. If you go to any Aliens fansite you can see the disappointment a plenty. So much of this movie cannot be explained as being bad because it will involve spoilers. Satisfy to say if you loved the original 2 films, as well as the second AvP and Prometheus, then you will see the incongruities this movie poses. Its good, with some awesome effects, but the story line was sorely missing and filled with holes",Alien - Covenant
1004,donaldgordon797,Bad,1,22 May 2017,"Dreadful film. After reading a lot of negative reviews I just had to go to see for myself. I mean Ridley Scott was directing so what could go wrong. Well just about everything. Why is it in every film nowadays the same cliche's occur. A scouting party goes out to explore a new planet to see if it could be habitable. One of them says ""I have to go and take a leak"" and you know right away that something bad is going to happen. Surely there must be screenwriters in Hollywood that can pen something original and surprise us. You will also fall asleep at all the boring scenes full of gobbledegook. Scott should be ashamed of himself. I despair.",Alien - Covenant
1005,bellrat,Must be one of the few,10,22 May 2017,"I gave this 10, mainly to boost the score because of how many 1's people are giving this.I can only assume that some of these people didn't watch Prometheus.I watched the trailer and was a little disappointed, I'd been waiting for this film for quite a few years. I was one of the few last time who actually enjoyed the plot of Prometheus. I thought it was flawed and the acting was terrible, but I did think the concept was good and was looking forward to how the story would continue. This is why i was disappointed in the trailer, as it seemed like they had gone for just another Alien film and abandoned the Prometheus line.Fortunately I was wrong, instead they have gone the route of making David the main character of this trilogy (if a third is ever made). This in my opinion is a good move as it makes the Alien movies about more than just people being hunted by Aliens. This is about life, artificial intelligence and also survival.While there aren't too many memorable characters from the crew, I thought the acting was better than Prometheus. Yes, it was daft for them to even go to this planet. But the captain was under pressure to make a call. In his mind, they were merely checking it out. It's surely worth checking a 'human' signal from a planet far away, and people were a little uneasy about the cryopods after James Franco got sizzled.This movie contains some classic scenes, most of which contain Fassbender who really is the star of the show. The flute scene was brilliant. The twist between him and Walter, although blindingly obvious leaves the film ready for the next chapter. I am intrigued to know what David plans to do next.",Alien - Covenant
1006,thekilon,"Boring story , too polishes and overall a ready made product",6,21 May 2017,"I will have to agree with the most popular review here, this is by no mean anywhere near Prometheus. Even with its plot holes Prometheus had a really original story. What was original about Prometheus is that it was not really an Alien movie but dared to venture outside the usual formula and emphasise a lot more on the story surrounding the Alien than the Alien itself. It has also some really nice character development with some character not being likable at all, some stupid (even that angered some people screaming ""plot hole"")In this one the movie trolls have won.... a boring movie. There are no ""plot holes"" , as a matter of fact this the most anti-Prometheus you can get. It put Alien back in the centre of the story, it recycles the same recipe and adds very little to it. As a result we get a story that is not only boring but makes little reason. Prometheus gave us already a more than good enough origin story , this movie tries to build it further and destroys it with an explanation that makes no sense at all. The only good thing about the story is the end which was not really unexpected but not my 1st choice. I would not call it a bad movie. For me the only bad Alien movie is the 3rd one. In order of preference 1) Alien 2)Aliens 3) Prometheus 4) Alien: Resurrection 5) Covenant 6) Alien 3On the matter of the origin story and generally alien story hands down is Predator VS Alien. Even though the movies were more than underwhelming the comics have been awesome and I recommend to read them forgetting about the movie to anyone who wants a great origin story for Alien. In the comics the Alien is not a byproduct of genetic manipulation but rather evolution. The elephant aliens visit a planet that is extremely hostile, in that planet Alien is not the top predator but rather the second in the food chain with another alien race destroying and feasting on our famous alien. Another great story element of the comic is that aliens cannot see as we see but rather detect fear and feed on it which makes sense why they keep hunting humans and not eating them . Comics also have been more scary than the movies which I have to say it pleasantly surprised me. Problem with the comic origin story is that there are no humans involved in it which is why I never expected it to make it into films. In any case this is not a bad movie and definitely worths the ticket price , no regrets watching it. But yeah I have to agree this too much manufacture boring Hollywood formula.",Alien - Covenant
1007,xenoverse-794-229550,I cannot believe how bad this film is,4,4 June 2017,"I had high hopes of Alien: Covenant because I actually thought Prometheus was a pretty decent movie. However, after watching Alien: Covenant, I kept asking myself why was this movie made.Let me start with the basics. A film tells a story with a set of presumptions. It could be totally out there where logic and reason do not apply, where you could defy the laws of physics. If that's where Alien: Covenant positions itself then it is all fine. But it clearly isn't the case. Covenant tries to be a little more philosophical from the very beginning when David asks Mr. Weyland about his creator. If that's the route the Covenant wants to take then it needs to take this route seriously, but it did not.We have a spaceship with a crew on a colonial mission to some distant planet. These characters, the crew, is so out of the place and their decision making process makes it a miracle that they were selected for this mission.They decided to go out of their way to visit an unknown planet, they decided to send most of their crew on a surface mission on this uncharted territory, they decided to go out of their landing vehicles without a full spacesuit, or even a face mask to ensure they are not exposed to any unknown microscopic biological agents floating in the air, they leave one person on their landing vehicle to guard it and that person clearly left the door wide open even after given a direct order to follow ""proper security procedures and lock the door"" by the captain, they carried their crew member back without any quarantine procedures. I could go on and on but you get the idea.Maybe the colonial missions are so common place that they could just pick the random volunteers off of the street and send them in. Even if that is true, you do not just put unqualified people onto a routine mission, not to mention that the colonial mission does not seem to be routine at all.They are many other illogical plot holes in the story later on. Those characters in this film keep making the most stupid decision whenever they have as if they want to get themselves killed.Overall, I felt extremely disappointed with this film and am not looking forward to the 3rd installment since Ridley Scott mentioned that this is a new trilogy starting with Prometheus.",Alien - Covenant
1008,danhall86,Best of the bad lot,6,17 May 2017,"After Prometheus, I definitely checked my expectations when it came to the pre-release anticipation for A:C. But Prometheus wasn't solely responsible for that lack of enthusiasm. Years of franchise fatigue played into it too, from my initial disgust at the death of my favourite sub-characters in Alien 3, to the mind boggling, almost self-parody that was Resurrection. Let's not mention the AVP films that never actually existed (forget I mentioned it).So basically, there have only ever been 2 genuinely good films in this franchise. The impeccable, groundbreaking horror Alien and the equally remarkable, progressive action-horror Aliens. Despite the aforementioned dislike of narrative choices made in A3, I find it an oddly fascinating and beautiful film, especially the Assembly Cut. So we'll say 2.5 genuinely good films in this franchise. Yet there are 7 films set in this universe. That's not good odds really is it?So Covenant. Where does it sit in comparison to the others?Well it's not bad, but it's not great either. It's just kind of meh... I enjoyed watching it at the time, but I also could have done without it. I also could have done without the even further demystification of the Xenomorph and its origins. Ridley's reasoning for not including the Xenomorph in Prometheus was that 'everyone knows what it is, it's not scary anymore.' Yet he brings it back in Covenant only to even further explain where it came from, and perhaps more puzzlingly, it's illustrated in full daylight, in big open spaces, wandering around and running over things as a blatant CG model. There's no Alien stalking people through dark, claustrophobic spaces here unfortunately. Technology makes directors lazy.It's not all bad. There's gore galore and the new Neomorph is quite vicious. It's introductory scene was actually quite suspenseful and felt like it was leading somewhere, but alas. It was probably the best scene of the movie. The characters were better than Prometheus in that they actually felt like people this time around. I was reluctant to take Danny McBride seriously, but I think he nailed his role better than anyone else in Covenant. And the visuals. Perhaps excluding the overuse of a CG Xenomorph, Covenant looked wonderful in the same way Prometheus did.But it wasn't enough. Even disregarding a number of silly decisions and awkward dialogue (the whole cinema burst into laughter at 'you blow, I'll do the fingering,') the ending was underwhelming and the edgy ending just seemed to think it was a lot smarter than it was (I predicted it about 20 minutes earlier) and was obviously setting up an inevitable sequel.It's may be better than Alien 3. I don't know. Only a repeat viewing will tell me for sure. But based on my initial reaction, I won't be in a hurry to pick it up on Bluray. I'd still much rather see Neil Blomkamp reuniting with Ripley and Corporal Hicks. Take note Fox!",Alien - Covenant
1009,anizar_wiflfag,This movie disrespects Alien legacy,1,16 May 2017,"It is a continuation of Prometheus, but it doesn't answer any questions left in the last movie. At this point I believe that all the Untitled Neill Blomkamp/Alien Project aka Alien5 was just a publicity stunt because, Ridley knew that nobody would watch Prometheus2.I was expecting to know why the Engineers wanted to exterminate human kind, but we weren't told that. There's also a scene in which David killed all the Engineers by throwing the black goo, but they became into stone, which is not what the black goo does.The worst part is that according to this movie, it was David, who created the Xenomorphs (aliens). Any fan of the franchise won't accept this idea, after 30 years of movies, all was due to an android, Xenos deserve a more epic beginning, this plot makes the Prometheus movies non-canon just like Alien vs Predator.",Alien - Covenant
1010,dan-902-916137,Excellent SF and return to form for Scott,9,27 June 2021,"In most of the ways Prometheus (2012) failed, this sequel succeeds. As always, we need to ignore the screaming fantwats who are never satisfied because they what something exactly like their beloved old films (except it must also be different). Try to shut out that braying sound! Yes, they were correct about Prometheus but only by accident.In this sequel, the script has been quite carefully modulated to avoid inviting the cast to chew the scenery. Performances are understated, dialog is used to lull us into certain moods instead as a blunt weapon to whack the audience over the head with. The cast aren't aggressively stupid.They are colonists looking for a lush planet where they can put down roots. They explore without their helmets on, which in hindsight is risky, but (elementary fiction technique incoming!) this time the script doesn't deliberately focus your attention on this as a conscious decision. Genius! No, it just happens and you take it for granted (they think they've found an earth-like place to live, after all).They pick a nasty infection, which leads to the first horror set-piece: characters fumble for their guns, aim and miss, slip up in the blood puddles of their fallen comrades - it all seems very like we'd all most likely behave (and fail) in a blind panic, and is the first time Alien has produced genuine scares since 1979.At first I resented the way it tied in to Prometheus, as it would almost be better off denying it existed and becoming a standalone story. But actually in the end it redeems the aspects of that movie that it depends on, particularly David the android who is used brilliantly and ends up almost like a Hannibal Lecter of SF.Uncanny how the use of hydraulic machinery sound effects in certain scenes seems almost deliberately intended to recall Cameron's Aliens (1986), rather than Scott's Alien.",Alien - Covenant

1012,RyGonJinn,A Thinking Mans Horror,8,19 May 2017,"A true thinking mans horror! To paraphrase Mr Scott, truest hit the spot. From the outset the mood picks up from the wake of Prometheus - setting a tone for what could, and will turn out to be an iconic sci-fi gem. This movie develops the premise that was set by the original alien and bows to the threats within, pulling the tension from over three decades of vision to establish new threats and old adversaries. Any true alien fan will leave the theatre feeling fulfilled by this gift from Mr Scott's imagination, delving ever deeper into the alien universe bringing the grit and fear with it. All I can say is bravo and thank you - this, for me is infallible. Ignore the negativity, for it comes from the minority of pseudo alien fans.",Alien - Covenant
1013,AaronDSimpson,Fassbender Teaches Fassbender the Flute,5,5 July 2017,"It is nearly impossible to be involved with the sphere of cinema without being familiar with the Alien franchise. Sigourney Weaver's 'Ripley' has become something of a touchstone for the empowered female lead; H.R. Giger's alien concept artwork revolutionised the standard for extra-terrestrial life, and the terror of the Facehugger and the Chestburster taught its audience to slowly disregard the suggestion of an alien life-form coming to Earth in peace.For me, and the many others who were born too late to experience the crisis aboard the Nostromo in 1979, Alien: Covenant presented an opportunity to become part of the community that boasts its own detailed science and extensive fan-base. It had been rumoured that Scott aimed to title the film Alien: Paradise Lost to reinstate the relevance with the Alien franchise after a confused audience mistook Prometheus (2012) for a standalone film. Yet, naming the film Covenant and, therein, creating a link with the hugely popular Halo video game franchise, Scott demonstrates the battle with maintaining the series' relevance in contemporary cinema. It seems that this muddled origin for Alien: Covenant is a suitable episode to represent the film's narrative progression; a disappointing pastiche of its own discography that has, along the way, adopted many clichés associated with the genre.The attention that is given to Weyland's (Pearce) creation of artificial intelligence and the custodian of the Covenant, Walter (Fassbender), in the opening scenes, the film soon begins to present as an investigation into the perils of creating the perfect sentient machine rather than a portfolio of alien encounters. Watching Walter communicate with the ship's operating system, Mother, the narrative began to overlap with that of Tyldum's Passengers (2016) - The spacecraft, carrying thousands of colonists and embryos, is on a course for a new planet to call home. However, due to a solar flare, the Covenant takes serious damage and results in several of the incubation pods to wake their occupants early whilst the Captain (Franco) is burned to death leaving the crew leaderless.From here, Tennessee (McBride), one of the Covenant's crew intercepts a rogue transmission containing John Denver's 'Take Me Home, Country Roads' and decide - under the new leadership of Oram (Crudup) - to set a course for the planet of origin. The brief moment of relief that I had felt that Alien: Covenant was departing from the tired trope of 'waking up too soon' was short-lived. When the crew arrived on the source planet, they emerged from the Covenant dressed as Rebels from the Star Wars franchise and began wandering aimlessly across marshland, stepping on alien nests, releasing spores into the air, and abandoning the years of training they would have undertaken to prepare them for a new environment. The crew spend far too long 'exploring' the hostile terrain and, considering that it presents nothing aesthetically different from Earth, becomes a drag for the audience. Daniels (Waterson), Lope (Bichir), and co. meet David - The previous model and identical A.I. to David - hiding out in an ancient city trying hard not to seem like a token Yoda after being stranded following the events of Prometheus.Ridley Scott, knowing that the majority of his audience has turned up to see the infamous aliens, keeps them from the screen for as long as possible and forces his viewer to sit through long, confusing scenes featuring Michael Fassbender (Walter) teaching Michael Fassbender (David) how to play the flute whilst discussing 'Ozymandias' and how sad it is that they can't create life. It wouldn't be so insufferable if this was an isolated incident, but Walter and David share several exchanges throughout the film and, at one point, share a kiss for little more reason than a brief nod to the discography.When the audience is finally permitted to gaze upon the genre-defining, yet disturbing phallic, Xenomorphs, it seems that the pressure of expectation and previous achievement proves too much for the director. There are countless episodes of token face-hugging and chest-bursting that attempt to relive the glory of the original moment, but are repeated so often that the event is cheapened and reduced to little more than male sexual aggression.It was disappointing to watch Alien: Covenant, knowing the reputation that Ridley Scott has nurtured with the Alien franchise over the past forty years, crumble into a stagnant cliché. I would like to say that this film is still deserving of viewing; for the experience, for the history, or even because it might present something of value to the long-term fans of the Xenomorphs and the Neomorphs. However, it seems that if Covenant is the representative of where the long-line of films has ended-up, then it might be best to give this one a hard-pass, even if only to protect the memory of the glory that once was.Read more reviews at 'The Cineaste Review' on WordPress - www.thecineastereview.wordpress.com",Alien - Covenant

Most characters just seem to be there for the purpose of killing them off in a gory scene.Another issue, at no point did you have a sense of mystery, everything is over-explained.

1016,guillermomirp,"""There is an explanation for this, you know?"" - ""I don't wanna hear your goddamn explanation!""",1,7 August 2017,"In Alien (1979) there is that moment when Ripley is communicating with mother, discovers what's the order 937, and the synthetic appears at her side willing to unfold the reasons behind. But Ripley is just trying to run away, and she doesn't care about reasons.In that moment there was an open door to fully explain the whole thing, the writer could have gone on and use the android to put a light in the dark. But Ripley moves away, and the movie shuts that moment down. That leads to something: there were the movie does not arrive, my imagination would do. And that's why I believe that Alien is so powerful. It is a door towards a complex future, as deep and obscure as I want to dream. More in detail: - There are reasons backing up the reactions and choices of the characters. - They do mistakes, they scream, cry, sweat, bleed, and they are all scared to the death. - The technology is realistic, not even dated in the Nostromo. And it is secondary to the plot. - The conspiracy of the ""Corporation"" setting profits ahead of human lives is again realistic. - The figure of the android is deep, and one could spend hours thinking whether it goes through a ""malfunction"" driven by contradictory orders (as HAL in 2001 space odyssey). - The music makes one uncomfortable. - Every single scene is well thought and in line with the previous and the next one. -...Then Prometheus happens... bringing light to that universe and showing that the spacey jokey is not an ancient civilization, but engineers that created humans; they walk still around, and they do act as bad guys.Then Covenant happens... and suddenly the alien is a creature breed by an evil android.All the beauty of the unknown is perverted. And worst of all, it looks like the people behind the writing were aware of the difficulty to reach the imagination boosted by the initial movie, so they have created twists and turns. They desperately try so hard, that fail miserably. Why the people in the ship is so plain and take critical decisions without a good thought? - Why do they explore a new world naked? I ended up thinking that they die because they want to. So I don't care much about the people in the screen, they are idiots and they deserve what happens to them. - Btw, aren't there any actors in the market able to show better the emotions and reactions that one would imagine for this movie? - Why David kills the engineers-like in the world? Why is he having such contradictory decisions? When he is asked why, he decides to explain everything. In a matter of seconds, with images overlapping one another, he says it all. But it's confusing, as if the director would expect that the viewer is able to cope with everything in seconds. And still, why then there were alien-like reliefs in the Prometheus building? - It doesn't matter anyway: it is understood that David is the decision behind it all. A very small vessel for such a potential universe. - The black goo, the jellyfish-like flying spores,... between Prometheus and Covenant there are so many twists about that thing that is easy to not care anymore.So at the end, I don't care. I don't care more about the aliens, the black goo, the spores, the engineers,... This movie is awful, together with Prometheus, because they two kill the spirit of the original movies.

1017,danny-fr-mail,When a franchise stops learning.,3,10 May 2017,"Some movies almost don't need a narrative at all (Alien, Aliens, Mad Max: Fury Road come to mind). In these works, the whys and hows are left as an exercise to the viewer and fade into the background to let the action create an emotional resonance.Alien: Covenant attempts the opposite, and smothers its own pace with lazy exposition and confusing explanations. After so many years of xenomorphs killing humans, the franchise was in dire need of either a return to its source, or some drastic innovation, expectation which aren't met either as the movie deliver action scenes everyone is already used to, without proper build up and without any surprise at all. One would have also expected Alien:Covenant to have learned from the many mistakes committed by Prometheus. Sadly, the story only goes forward thanks to plot holes combined to the terrible absent-mindedness of the characters who seem to repeat the very same gaffes as the crew of the previous movie.In short, a film which would have deserved a moist, dark, intense claustrophobic atmosphere and desperate struggles for survival was instead given the plot of, well, mostly every other action movie with disappointing CGI monsters thrown-in, shaped like xenomorphs to remain faithful to the license. I wish I could give it more than 3 stars (for the okay acting), but considering the waste of potential of this movie and the hype it created, it's only fair (at least in my books).Not recommended.

The acting is wooden and the story line is simply preposterous.I loved the original Alien movie and actually saw it when it was released decades ago. What made this movie so great was the believable characters and the story line. A simple chance encounter with something absolutely terrifying and with no means of getting away from it. When the alien was first introduced all those years ago what made it so fantastic was that there was no explanation as to where it came for, it was like it was some long buried dark horror that had been abandoned in some dark corner of the universe. Add to this the signal that come from the ship that later transpired to be a warning, ""keep away"". Alien really was the stuff of nightmares and fired the imagination that if something like this could be out there, what other horrors could also be lurking out there.In this mind blowing stupid new movie, they take this very simple story line and try to twist it into something else. They try to offer an explanation as to where this terror came from. It turns out the alien was created a few years before by a robot, which of course was created by us. Not cool, not even remotely believable and this has put the final nail in the coffin of alien franchise.It's too late, the story line is now in complete tatters and it is time to call it a day on this and finally lay to rest the Alien.",Alien - Covenant
1019,Anthony89,Does it answer all of your questions from Prometheus?,7,24 August 2017,"Alien Covenant is both a solid Prometheus sequel & Alien prequel, it does a fine job at tying into both worlds. I for one was a fan of Prometheus and was very keen to see which direction they would take this franchise. My thoughts below.........The good:Michael Fassbender - his performance as both Walter & David was amazing & played both characters very well, but I would have to say that him playing David was by far the most interesting character in the movie. His performance as David had you truly believe that what David was doing was justified, even when he had empathy when he had to kill or experiment on humans (Elizabeth Shaw in particular) as he believed they are a lesser specie & did not deserve to recreate life.Cinematography: Ridley Scott does know how to direct a very good looking science fiction movie & this is no exception. Even though the planet that the Covenant ship lands on has nothing in it (apart from wheat) still manages to look great & somewhere you would like to visit (if there was no alien creatures on the planet however).The Ending: Even though many have mentioned they seen the 'twist' coming, first time around i didn't pay too close attention to it & was genuinely surprised when it happened. I thought it was an interesting ending to see where the franchise will go next & to see what David is truly capable of. Adding the face hugger embryos within the human embryos was a nice touch & will be truly terrifying for when the colonists finally wake up.The bad:The characters: Other reviewers have said this also but they do have a fair point, as there are several dumb things that the characters do throughout the movie, example of this is the newly appoint captain sticks his head over a face hugger egg as David tells him there is nothing to worry about & of course latches onto his face & an alien ends up inside of him. The characters that made up the crew were not necessarily bad just a few moments like this seemed to be abit predictable.Storyline: I wouldn't say that the storyline was necessarily bad, just went in a different direction than I would have anticipated, as I said I liked Prometheus & wanted to see the continuation of finding out more about the creation side of things in this movie, however was dismissed fairly quickly by David bombing all the engineers with that black goo & therefore he ends up being the deranged scientist that creates the aliens? I guess since Prometheus divided fans on the franchise was the reasoning behind making the storyline pan out this way.I felt slightly disappointed after seeing the movie as it didn't quite answer all the questions hanging over our heads from Prometheus. But the movie itself was quite entertaining and am very keen to see what David does next & definitely a solid return to form for the alien side of things after some very disappointing sequels (in particular alien resurrection).",Alien - Covenant

I was just generally offended by a similarly stupid series of events that enabled a total disaster similar to the mess that was Prometheus. You know, land on an unknown planet, send EVERYONE in without environmental protection of a single solitary concern for their welfare, get exposed, and then have no means to effectively quarantine said infected and blow up own ship. It's clearly a fairly stupid film from that much that I did sit through, and the first 30 minutes was spent watching familiar and boring space visuals and being introduced to familiar and boring characters, before they all grabbed their various assault rifles, put on their kit and all rolled off to have a romp in an alien planet they knew nothing about without doing any tests for infection, perhaps sending a canary down first, or having one brave person spend a week down there alone...? No, send two space ships full of dozens of idiots wearing Kathmandu military attire to run about having a look at stuff... Before being infected as you would expect were you to do everything you would expect not to do, and avoid all the safeguards and precautions you would expect to have, if you weren't a zombie.",Alien - Covenant
1021,Tormentt75,"Inconsistent, unrealistic",5,20 July 2017,"Is it difficult to write believable, rational scenarios and still inject drama? It's an honest question, not to say I know better. But I find lots of movies or shows where the only way the writer progresses the plot or create an exciting scene is when the key characters do stupid or inexplicable things out of the blue.This is not a review, just expressing my disappointment when I was so looking forward to this movie (having forgotten the forgettable Prometheus).Halfway through this movie, the thought suddenly hit me ""man, this is so c**p"". The inconsistent characters and their behaviors were plainly irritating. People overacting and going apesh** when they're not supposed to, and showing little emotion when they should, things happen conveniently just to advance the plot, etc. Human behavior is instinctive. Even children know how to predict reactions from adults when they've done something. So when you watch characters that don't follow instinctive motivations or reactions, they become hard to relate to - just caricatures.It's like watching a football game where nobody follows the rules - how do you tell who's winning? Would you still care?Same with a story. If the characters are believable and the situations realistic, the story becomes so much more impactful, the horror so much more potent. The struggle to survive becomes real. But when things just ""happen"", after a while, the tension is gone. One of the best examples of consistent writing is The Thing (John Carpenter). They set the rules, and the story unfolds within those rules. The tension is real because we know exactly what's at stake.Was I expecting too much? Or was this movie just meant to be a popcorn ""summer blockbuster alien movie with guns""?",Alien - Covenant
1022,fahycolm,Alien Covenant - a severe case of astro enteritis,3,6 July 2017,"They say money and power corrupts. Whatever about the former, the latter certainly did the job for Michael Fassbender's David in Alien: Covenant. All well and good you might say and expect from a foot soldier of the notoriously clingy Weyland Corporation who will stop at nothing to cross space and time and star systems and generations to try and get the ugly Xeno-morphs to rule the universe. If only the determination to unleash unholy crap was confined to the star-ship Covenant. Alas, as we have seen a dozen star-ships succumb to the busty-forth thingy since Nostromo, we should have come to expect that the bloody mayhem would soon find its way onto the spec-script and into the production office, where some quasi-Weylandian financier has decided to lay waste to all sorts of talent in order to get the franchise and its money making potential as ubiquitous as the black goo.I am delighted to say I did not pay a dime to see this latest outing (which I admit I waited with baited breath to see, hoping that Ridley Scott, in the twilight of his career, might want to do something special. Wasted hope.). The evident trashy ambition for money evidently won the day. Aside - It is possible the matte artists and effects people come out shining for their ominous and enticingly foreboding landscape set pieces. The rainy, alien landscape of the planet onto which the crew of Covenant are unfortunately hailed is wonderfully reminiscent of the Mission, Apocalypse Now - even Southern Comfort. But, that is the end of the comfort. Katherine Waterson's miss-cast miserable sour-pus is an unbelievably dull and dreary hero, who has the audience wailing for a therapist and a panda for her care, not a confrontation with a beast - least of all one that might kill everything in sight except her. Michael Fassbender's dual role as David and Walter is an intriguing element which belongs in another movie, along with the tin whistle. From the whir of the talent-less lament onward it is an entirely downhill dis-symphony. In fairness, the poverty of this outing was flagged with the death of James Franco's character - we should have known something awful was wrong.A thirty second promise of edgy, atmospheric and concealed fear - the era defining markers of the excellent 1st Alien movie, all evaporate into studio predictability, gratuitous soft violence porn, daft blood splattering and, frankly, a chaos of over exposure, limp scripted repetitions, hammy cowboy-in-space characters, too many lost spouses (yes!), badly and delicately hung hyper-sleep pods and I just can't go on. Did I mention the John Denver reference? The denouement, with gormless weepy Katherine climbing into her cot is only appalling because the audience are by now baying for her to be made climb into an oven, such is her stupidity. Ridley Scott has made some great films (OK 2) and some dreadful pieces of poop too (Black Hawk Down?) but with Covenant he has just gone and left probably one of the worst skid marks on the underpants of science fiction cinema as he allows himself to be dragged by the 9 digit dollar film making collar into the pit of ab-creativity. If you didn't by now get how crap this film is - how unforgivably dreadful - here is my final appraisal - As predictable, fluid, painful and unwelcome as Diarrhoea.",Alien - Covenant
1023,NeilJThomas,What the hell happened?,4,3 August 2017,"It appears that Scott is done with the Alien saga, whether out of understandable displeasure with its direction in later movies, or ""been there, done that"". I'm not inclined to watch many interviews in the hope i'll find out why he's murdering a franchise that I thought couldn't be butchered any further.It has the same basic plot of a 100 D-grade sci-fi movies with a touch of Alien lore sprinkled on it, but understand this: it's not an Alien movie, it's very much a Prometheus movie, so the original title: ""Prometheus 2"" would have been more apt.Scott has decided to throw away the accumulated xenomorph lore of ALL the movies that followed his own. Everything you learned about aliens, from Aliens onward, has been jettisoned. So, for instance, you learn who created the xenomorphs, and why, but the moment you do, you laugh as it's impossible; not if you saw the entire saga, especially the Alien vs Predator movies. there's just a sliver of a remote possibility of shoehorning it in, but i assume you'll have to wait for ""Prometeus 3"" to see whether he's clever enough to bring it all together. However, as things stand right now, i'm not hopeful, the alien origin he's woven is simply incompatible with the rest of the lore. He's simply added several more plot holes.i won't tell you how the aliens are created, or by whom, but as in the original Alien, there's no queen in the life-cycle, destroying all following ""Alien"" and ""Alien vs"" movie lore. it's in the ""Alien Vs"" movies that you see the earliest encounters of mankind with the xenomorph, brought along millennia ago by the predators to create the perfect hunter in order to battle it. ""Alien: Covenant"" sets the creation of the xenomorph not long before the events of Alien, maybe some 20 years earlier.Not content with this, Scott also reduced the xenomorph subspecies from runner, warrior, praetorian and queen to a single being, an assassin. The life-cycle is interfered with in more than one way, while the facehugger is basically the same, there isn't a chestburster anymore, the alien emerges fully formed from its host, a perfect miniature of the fully grown beast. finally, you can't tell from the clip because the camera lingers little on the xenomorph, but it has only a vague resemblance to the beast we all know and love. it no longer has lips, for instance, so its face is frozen in a permanent snarl. the tubes on its back, which H.R. Giger made specifically for the purpose of supporting that massive head, are now there for cosmetic purposes. Scott decided that in this version of the xenomorph, the tubes should be shorter, thinner and should radiate outwards from its back, therefore they're no longer capable of supporting anything. the ugliest change, however, is that the alien used to have tubes that curved from its back over the shoulders, framing the neck, but these grew out of its body organically, while in the new alien, they are actual pipes, thin, separate and pointless.aside from the changes above, the alien's creator made them to destroy a humanity he hates, yet that same person also wipes out a planet full of engineers he seemed to be rather impressed by, both the people and the technology, so what's the reason behind the genocide? it's never addressed. there's also the problem with the inconsistent look of the engineers: you remember their white, flawless skin? you get to see them like that in flashbacks to the events of Prometheus, yet when you see the flashbacks to the genocide, they are identical to humans except they have the engineer's nose. this change in their look made it necessary for Scott to specify in an interview that the people on the ""heaven planet"" were engineers. imagine that, needing clarification because otherwise people wouldn't have understood.AFAIC there were some odd choices in the casting: maybe it's because i find Danny McBride a poor actor, and unpleasant to boot, but to me he's an odd choice for that character. i find that he's best suited to comedy roles than drama or sci-fi. i also dislike Billy Crudup, who unfortunately has quite a lot of screen time. Katherine Waterston is a beautiful young woman if not a good actress, however, in this particular movie, i din't even recognize her and despised her presence; this may be partially due to the makeover she was given, which makes her look like a teenage tomboy. of course, Waterston and McBride's characters are the only two survivors, so two unlikeable characters are the only ones who are in every single scene.finally, the cgi is variable in quality. impressive and unbeliavably life-like in some scenes (only logic tells you that you're watching a composite shot with bleeding edge cgi in it ) yet devoid of depth in others, robbing the shot of believability. most shot of the huge trees are pretty bad.For the first time ever, i am at a loss about how to rate a movie. This isn't bad, in fact there's a lot to like there, it's just a BAD ALIEN movie. I would have given it 5 stars in the hope that Scott can bring it all together and close all plot holes in the next installment, but the choice of cast and the variable cgi bring the movie down yet more. I would give it 3 stars if not for the fact that i've seen movies that truly were worth only 3 stars, and this one has so much more to offer, just not another installment in the Alien saga.",Alien - Covenant
1024,Legbreaker,Total failure..,1,3 July 2017,"Prometheus was promising, but ended up bad...but after all very good if you compare it with this crap. We all expected to get answers about the engineers. So Scott give them 1 minute of fame in Covenant. Anyway Covenant started promising like Prometheus, but after the scene where they received the message from the Engineers's planet, it went down the hill, faster than light. It was a nice idea to implement the igigi stories from the Sumerians with the Alien movies. So you land on a planet, chased by hybrid Xeno's, escaped thanks to David, for prometheus.. Walk in a massive old Alien city and statues (engineers), but you only ask.. What happened here? GTFO!! But again, what a disgrace, for the Aliens fans and for the people who finally waited for Hollywood movies were the Sumerian stories received recognition. You cannot even call this one disinformation, it's just a very bad attempt with stupid plots. The end is even sillier that I could ever imagine.. World is full of braindead people, because most of the people ranked this one with at least 8 stars.. What on earth did they all smoked? 1 star for Fassbender and the special effects. So much potential and no more quality, just Hollywood quantity. Ridley Scott, zeroo pwa..",Alien - Covenant
1025,your_friendly_reviewer,Weaker than Alien: Prometheus,5,4 April 2020,The lore is somewhat there in the film but it's hard to believe such highly skilled individuals have no sense of risk management or have simply forgotten their training resorting in decision making normally reserved for juvenile delinquents.

1026,cbrownlaw-771-107746,SPOILER: George Lucas level prequel,3,22 May 2017,"This movie attached itself to my face and sucked my joy out. The initial scene was again off point and disappointing. The entire issue with Weyland is tired and tangential with the original movies - Weyland just wanted money - that was clear, understandable. SOMEWHAT looking for eternal life? Now, looking for a creator? Who cares? After that, this movie started so well. It had the slow build of the first Alien movie - a wonderful thing. Was so excited. Even when the now omnipresent, ever-irritating Fassbender came out, the other members of the team were very promising, or had the capacity to be interesting. The capacity was ignored. Tennessee - a very funny character actor - was nearly ignored. There were several other actors that seemed like mercenaries - we never found out anything. Absolutely no attempt at character development. Wow. There was a Ripley stand in - never connected with her. The new captain, nervous and religious and, for some reason, disliked. No nothing about him. There was NO character development, except for the ever-irritating Fassbender. I will go into VERY FEW of the stupid plot holes, as there are probably 30, but here are the plot holes that destroyed the movie for me: 1. Why disable the ship, and then instantly fix it? Why not use this as a REQUIREMENT to find a close planet, instead of the ""hey, I picked up John Denver on my space suit."" Highly useless, and John Denver was never explained. 2. You explore a new planet and don't wear protective suits? 3. You go to a new planet and almost the entire crew goes out? 4. You find a new spaceship, not human, and the decision was ""EVERYONE SHOULD GO IN, right now."" 5. you have someone who comes down with a disease, and there is no quarantine? 6. SOMEHOW, on an alien spacecraft, an archaeologist puts an old android THAT WAS ONLY A HEAD IN A BAG back together so well that you can't tell him apart from a brand new android? 7. Why the hell does the old android have long hair? Why the hell? 8. Androids look exactly the same, you spend (probably) weeks getting ready, and have NO discussions with android about ANYTHING? (that SURE showed that Ripley was sorely needed). 9. How many hundreds of aliens do you need before you confuse the audience? I will guess ""many less than were in this movie."" 10. How many times can you use ""the android is evil"" and surprise anyone? IN THE SAME SERIES? 11. NO ONE asks any questions about all the dead things in the courtyard? AND FINALLY, 12. You see a dead team member next to an android OBVIOUSLY trying to protect an alien, you follow the android into the dripping, misty cellar, and fall for ""hey, look at this."" I never recovered from that.",Alien - Covenant
1027,romkevdv17,Great addition to Story but many problems as a consequence,7,25 May 2017,"Just as a prologue to this, I'd like to say that -- even if I may be in the few -- I found Prometheus quite okay, not bad, not awesome, but quite good to okay. This is not an excuse to say I'm biased but just as most people hated that film they hate this even more.I believe that the premise of the film is quite strong, although the colonist thing seemed a bit cliché I do like that this time it isn't just 10 people in pods or something as the full colonists but a skeleton crew to begin the colony and then 2000 more plus embryo's which I find a cool idea never seen before. The characters however lack motive, or character at all. The only real motive we get from Daniels is her boyfriend wanted a cabin which nicely plays in later but seems kind of weird. As well as that when people watched the prologue and thought they were going to see James Franco again; you don't. Which I find extremely weird and stupid, hiring such an actor (as in famous not good, because that he definitely is not) and then killing him immediately is a waste of a celebrity and strange. Danny Mcbride I found okay, I wasn't aware of his previous bad acting career so it didn't bother me much. Daniels is not a strong character, she is a Ripley lite of sorts and the rest of the crew is obsolete mostly except for the captain who is abundantly made clear he is an stupid idiot and will die by or give way to a Xenomorph. Now to my second point, I think the aliens in this film were actually really great; bringing something entirely new to the table. The ideas of spores created by the release of the black goo pathogen is also interesting as people thought he could use that instead of making FaceHuggers but it integrated into nature. David's workshop is all-in-all one of my favorite sets and art pieces, those amazing HR Giger drawings, models of all his failed specimens and an original (or close to) Ovomorph containing an actual Facehugger. David is my favorite character and only good character in this film in my opinion because Noomi Rapace doesn't get much screen time. Michael Fassbender plays both roles beautifully and the chemistry between himself is better even than between actual different actors and actresses. You didn't even know who was who's wife, as well as the fact I completely forgot there was a gay couple in this movie (which seems so idiotic for a damn colony ship, I mean does diversity of sexual preference really matter at the last straw of humanity?). Protomorph and Neomorph was great, but the Proto was way too cgi and not enough mix with models. Neomorph however was fast and agile so the cgi was more darting in between the colonists making it look real and brutal. As well as this the scenes with David and his creations are amazing, where he mentions; ""eventually the ape stood upright"" follows with where the Neomorph slowly comes from a small creature to bigger and standing upright to David, great analogy there. How David interacts with his creatures is great and something you don't see often. Thus I do find some of the other problems; stupidity of the colonists and anti-climatic reveal from Prometheus. The colonists were very stupid -- even though this does not include the 'they're not wearing helmets' argument since I doubt any colony would have 10 helmets for a mission prepared for a millionth scanned planet which they're prepared for. As well as this how they go to a completely different planet instead of planned has reasoning but still stupid and the guy who smokes in a heavily oxygenated jungle in an unknown planet (great job man). This also includes the letdown of engineer home world, they never found it so we will have to wait till Awakening and maybe Neil Blomkamp's alien 5 to find out. One last point I have to make; this movie does not screw up Alien lore with David creating the Xenomorph, they never mentioned the aliens being 'perfect creatures' or having a home world or something because most of that is non-canon and speculation and this is the actual origin because its made by Ridley Scott who made the first one. Overall it was a cool movie with lots of flaws, however I think it's good because of David, Alien origin, the planet and an amazing plot and ending which adds a completely new thing to the franchise instead of making another Colonial Marines suicide mission film. He is definitely not 'George Lucasing' the franchise as people think, he is making it more intricate and better in my opinion.",Alien - Covenant
1028,grahamschat,Well I saw the ending coming,4,21 May 2017,"So I was expecting, as the hype, to see a sequel to Prometheus: some questions answered, and perhaps creating some more mysteries to keep the franchise keen.Nope. It felt like they just took the original 1979 one and updated it.I actually liked the mysterious direction Prometheus took. I know some people complained that it wasn't Alien-y enough, but this thing with the engineers and the first scene with them seeding some planet (presumably earth) with life -good stuff.Yes I got the whole David/Walter thing at the end with Walter's ""upgrade"" which the crew seemed to miss.But that's the theme of the whole movie: don't think too deeply, just enjoy the new CGI Xenomorph.I'm sure they toyed with working the Jackson 5 in there.As to the story: maybe they are heading to a time-loop thing where David somehow ends up creating the Engineers and Humans to fulfill his Machiavellian dream; the created becoming the creator.",Alien - Covenant

It had a fair amount of nods to the previous Alien movies, and also some to Ridley Scott's other works.The visual/special effects in the movie are what you can expect from a summer blockbuster. It looked like they added some extra grain to some shots in the movie, in old school sci-fi fashion.Some scenes are predictable. Some are less predictable. I would say that if you consider yourself good at spotting potential outcomes of events in movies. This film is not that twisting. But for average viewers, you might be surprised a couple of times watching this movie.It is not a new masterpiece, but definitely an above average good summer blockbuster worth watching if you like sci-fi horror.",Alien - Covenant
1031,paytonsapp,Spoiler Free Review: Alien Covenant,7,24 May 2017,"Okay, before I review Alien Covenant I just want to say something. I have seen so many people rate this film, like, a 1 or 2 so I wasn't expecting much. However, upon seeing it, I realized that this is in no way a bad film. It's actually a very entertaining thriller and it's a lot better than some of the other Alien films out there (Here's looking at you Alien Resurrection) and I think people aren't really judging it based on the film it's self, I think they are judging it based on whether or not it was as good as the original classic. Now, is it as good as the original? No. Is it a 1 star? HELL NO. However Alien Covenant was a bit disappointing as far as a film by Ridley Scott goes. Now for starters, the film looks FANTASTIC. Even the people who rated this a 1 will admit that the film is extremely well crafted and looks marvelous. It's definitely one of the best looking films I've seen this year. Scott really gets your heart pumping too, on multiple occasions I found myself gripping the armrests and holding my breath waiting for what was to happen next. Bottom line is, the man knows what he's doing behind the camera and he knows how to create a suspenseful atmosphere for the audience and he proves that again with this film. The acting was also very very good. I would say that Danny Mcbrides 'Tennessee' was my favorite character, and he was easily the biggest surprise of the film as he gives a great performance. Michael Fassbender (as usual) was also incredible and I'm trying to keep this spoiler free.. so I'll just say he has A LOT of weight to pull in the film. Everyone else was pretty good as well but those two were the real standouts to me. I also thought that MOST of the CG looked fine. I prefer practical effects and sometimes the CG was obvious, but it didn't really take me to much out of the film. Now we are really dipping into the negatives and my biggest flaw with the film, was by far the fact that they show way to much to the audience. Now before I make this point, I just want to say that I am not a squeamish person, I can handle quite a bit of gore, I am however a big fan of 'implied horror' and I believe it adds so much more to the tension. Ridley Scott does not hold back and this is definitely an R rated film do not expect other wise. Like I said I don't mind gore and I think you need some in an Alien film to really sell the Xenomorph's dominance, however I would of liked to have been able to think more about what happened. For some reason, the filmmakers decide to show the Xenomorph multiple times in complete daylight, which i thought kind of took away from the ambiguity of the creature and definitely took away some of the tension for me. WHAT WE CANT SEE IS SO MUCH MORE FRIGHTENING THAN WHAT WE CAN. Another problem I have with the film is that the characters are pretty disposable ""horror movie"" characters and on top of that you know exactly when one of them will die. It's pretty sad that they didn't at least try to be creative with the deaths in the film and just went with the clichéd route of conveniently isolating a character so they can die. Characters also make some VERY dumb decisions. I have seen worse decisions made in film but they make some bad ones here. So to wrap it up...PROS: Directing, Acting, Editing, Sound Design, Production DesignCONS: Very Dumb Cliché Characters, Some Of The Gore, And Showing The Creature Too Much This is in no way a 1/10. It's honestly ridiculous that people have been rating it that. This was a fun time at the theater and although it was a bit disappointing, I can see myself adding it to my Blu Ray collection and watching it again. My Rating: 7/10",Alien - Covenant

Thats the good part, other than that everything else goes south... Michael fassbender does his best at playing kind of hamlet in a shakespere play except this is aliens, and doesn't fit well in the film. The crew must all have some kind of long flight intellectual impairment as every (EVERY) single decision is blatantly idiotic. One example a crewmember locks the other one with an alien, claiming following procedures, then gets gun while waiting for other one to get killed, opens door (hell with procedures) slips in the same puddle previous idiot slipped, locks leg in door, limps away, starts shooting at everything while screaming die motherf** and manages to blast the whole spaceship to pieces. Every decision in this flick is So dumb that we found ourselves rooting for the aliens to get them out of their misery. The relation of fassbender with actress ripley rippoff seems forced, not natural at all. Characters utterly undeveloped, you care for no one. Alien Cgi seems like that of an average\mediocre video game. Plot development twists and scares spotted more than a mile away. Also, a tough as nails marine would not have a nervous breakdown a la desperate housewifes while his comrade is being attacked by an alien right next to him. Hugging the rifle as a teddy bear in a fetal position. Only to react half a second before being attacked as well. The scene in the shower should be in a friday13 movie not here. In fact this scene is a rippoff of Friday 13! What happened.

1036,ericwatkinson,"A very good, but not great film.",7,10 May 2017,"To be honest, I've been disappointed by so many science fiction movies lately that I almost wanted to hate Alien Covenant, and I really wanted to pick it apart. However, while I don't consider Alien Covenant to be the best movie from the Alien franchise thus far, it is easily, in my opinion, the best Alien movie since 1997's Alien Resurrection, and thankfully this film didn't fall into the same terrible clichés which ruined the two most recent Terminator movies. Although this film has its high moments, it also, unfortunately, misses the mark in a few key areas which caused me to sometimes feel somewhat slightly cheated. When the Covenant space ships arrives in orbit above the newly discovered Paradise planet, it is implied that this is one of the most Earth-like planets ever encountered by human beings, but there are no really awe inspiring scenes of the pristine planet slipping below the ship in orbit, and there are no scenes of the crew marveling at the planet's much touted natural beauty. I would have expected at least one awe inspiring scene similar to the introduction of the Genesis Cave in Star Trek The Wrath of Khan, but instead we are treated to ""Oh this seems to be a very nice place, why don't we see if we can live here instead of that other place we were planning on going?""The movie also fell a little flat when the crew of the Covenant arrives at David's fortress and finds the surrounding grounds littered with thousands of withered corpses of the Engineer species. No one is upset by the huge display of carnage, and no one from the crew of the Covenant, people whom you would assume would have scientific backgrounds, really seem curios regarding how the thousands of beings outside the walls were seemingly struck down in place so quickly. There is also the issue with the hapless idiot who once again places his face too near the xenomorph eggs, the scene where the Alien gets blown out the airlock once again, and the scene where the bookish female crew member inexplicably acquires a bad ass attitude and combat skills. However, these are probably all over lookable flaws that people shouldn't get too hung up on. While the character development is much better than what it was in Prometheus, a few of the characters are not fleshed out very well, and it is never really explained why certain crew members of the Covenant star ship know how to handle advanced combat weapons? However, the film absolutely hits it out of the ball park with the evil sociopath android character named David, and in my opinion the David character is the most powerful character since the original Ellen Ripley character played by Sigourney Weaver! David is not merely an evil Frankenstein's monster who goes about blindly smashing things for no reason, David actually hates mankind, perhaps partially due to the daddy issues which he seems to have with his creator, Peter Weyland, and also perhaps due the to physical damage that he suffered towards the end of the earlier film, Prometheus. David's evilness is almost a more important factor in the story than the Aliens themselves. Another high positive is the fact that the technology and set designs depicted in Covenant seem to fit right into the same universe as the original Alien movie from 1979, and unlike the horrible Alien Vs. Predator movies, this film actually has the same look and feel of the first two films. While it is not the greatest science fiction of all times, it is clearly a very good movie by any reasonable measure, and I think that most people will come away feeling satisfied when the final credits roll.",Alien - Covenant

Although Prometheus was heavily criticized, I enjoyed it and thought it opened very promising leads for coming films.

1038,mfwcurran,The art of screenwriting is dead... Long live mediocrity,5,15 January 2018,"Alien: Covenant pretty much sums up what is wrong with Hollywood at the moment: it's a bankable franchise if you throw enough money at each movie, but it's also a dumping ground for weak story-telling. A younger Ridley Scott would have pored over each fault in the story-line/screenplay, discarding what doesn't seem logical but you can appreciate that those finer nuances of directing have gone the way of vitality. Who can blame him, really?
This film is not a result of bad directing, but film-goers who will accept each movie like a slow death, ensuring 20th Century Fox skip on anything like common sense or treating their audience with having any intelligence. The film is, quite simply, illogical and dumb. The SFX are brilliant as you would expect these days, the acting is passable given the awful lines they have to deliver, and the directing is dining out on a meagre offering, that if you wanted to discard what doesn't work, you'd have to rewrite the whole mess.
Is it entertaining? Well yes, but only if you leave your brain in a jar by the side of your bed and try not to think about it after. When you do it unravels. I mean, seriously? Aliens that turn from young to full adults in minutes? So many plot-holes you can drive a colony-ship through them. A crew that are so stupid, it makes the crew of the Nostromo look like Noble Peace Prize winners. 
Another psycho android that might have been interesting if it had been explained better. Just another opportunity jettisoned for unnecessary profanity (I mean, for fxxksake how much swearing was there in this film, that didn't add anything to character or wit, or anything for that matter). Given the screen time for characters there was naff-all characterisation.
Even writing this, thinking about the movie, my head hurts. This is a film that contributes absolutely nothing to the series, to films in general, and I've reduced my stars from 6 to 5, because I'm being kind, and the soundtrack wasn't bad.
Meh.",Alien - Covenant
1039,rupowujosu,"Disappointing, mechanical, soulless.",5,4 August 2017,"On his own, this movie deserves a 5. It is watchable, but nothing else.But this is not an isolated movie. It has the Alien title, so it takes advantage of your expectations,a those expectations are set by the first 2 movies in the series.You come expecting something at that quality, end get sorely disappointed.First, the Alien title makes clear what is the interesting thing you are looking for: the alien. The unknown, the discovery, the mystery.All of that is absent here. It should be named Robot: covenant, because the alien is not at all the point of the movie, but a robot.The attempt to explain the alien origin destroy all his alieness. It makes it not an alien thing but a human thing, and that's boring.Even the new aliens presented here are more human looking than in the original. The sentient aliens also are totally human like, which was understandable on early times of cinema, for lack of capacity for special effects, but today it is unforgivable.On this movie, the alien is a mere, background element. On Alien and Alien II, the aliens were characters. They had plans, they plans conflicted with humans, and they actively ruined human's plans.That conflict of interests made the movie better.Nothing of that occurs here. The aliens do exactly what they are expected to do. Well not EVEN that. They do not even do what they are expected to do by the spectator. They do not even do anything. They are not even characters. They do no have any intention. Just appear and disappear at some point, to kill people, and that's all.It wasted an opportunity to make the movie better an more interesting. If the alien had actually pursued his own plan, conflicting with the major characters.Also, another sin of this movie, is that it is just a slaughter-fest. Showing people being killed is all the point. Characters do not understand what is going on, and do not do anything but just die. They are mere tools in the plot. Straw man put there to die.On the original alien movies, characters understood that they faced a menace, and took initiative to actively fight it. That's absent here.The final effect is that even the main plot of the movie is just a background element. It just happens, and happens predictably, as planned.Finally, and this alone is a reason to not watch the movie, is that it does not ends. You feel like the movie was cut on the middle, so, if you have curiosity to watch this movie, and do not want to wait for years (not even knowing if it will be canceled), then watch it after thefinal third part movie is made, so you can watch a single movie, and not just half of it.",Alien - Covenant
1040,wolfybiscuts,My expectations were dashed. It had the ingredients but the chef burnt the main course.,6,11 May 2017,"SPOILERS! OK, Let me start off by saying that I am a massive aliens fan with Aliens and Alien being two of my all time fave movies. I thought Covenant was going to return the franchise to form with all these extra fancy trailers and clips I viewed online. I was wrong, while the movie contains great visuals and has characters with potential, it fell flat due to how dumb most characters were in the story, thus making the story less believable.The movie begins very slowly and they missed all opportunity to build on characters personalities, instead they focus a large amount of screen time repairing the ship before the film really takes off. The last supper scene isn't even in the film! These explorers/colonists acted more like stupid teenagers in a slasher film. I found myself groaning with disbelief every single time someone acted in a way totally contradictory to their position on the crew. No joke, stupid decisions just keep happening one after the other. Here's some that I noted.1. ROSENTHAL leaves the group by herself to wash her hands on a strange new planet and takes off her gun! placing it just out of reach after she is injured by an alien in the field. STUPID! 2. ANKOR places his face so close to some spores and inhales them? STUPID! 3. The whole landing crew walks off the ship with no protective gear and into swampy black water. STUPID (at least Prometheus made an effort to explain it when they took off their breathing masks.) 4. ORAM splits from the group and walks into a dark room full of eggs, because David just said so. Then looks in an egg when clearly he has already battled the Necromorphs in the film. He did not once ask David about any drawings of aliens in the room. STUPID! 5. FARIS - who is supposed to be a medic, freaks out at the sight of blood then lock KARINE in the medbay to die, however she comes back into the room and falls over the same blood she saw fall on the floor. If she was going to go back into the room wouldn't it have been better to use KARINE to fight the alien 2 vs 1. The excuse of Quarantine fell out the window when she went back in the same room! STUPID! 6. Not one character questions David over the thousands of engineer corpses in the coliseum? STUPID! 7. At least 3 characters go off by themselves throughout the film when clearly the group could have split into small groups and remain together! STUPID! 8. There are 2 necromorphs, 2 Xenomorphs, several eggs and 2 embryos in the film. There is no explanation why birthing Aliens grow so fast or chest burst so fast compared to what happens over several days in all other alien movies. STUPID! 9. When the alien bursts from one of the crew in the wheat field, Not ONE SINGLE CHARACTER WITH A GUN ATTEMPTS TO SHOOT IT when it is still vulnerable on the ground. STUPID! 10. DANIELS and TENESSEE, who are armed with machine guns can't kill one normal alien in a narrow corridor, when in (Aliens) 5 marines can kill a horde of aliens in a large dark room when they attack from the roof and floor???? STUPID The film also may suggest it has a certain agenda or tone - (the flute scene) and why does David keep trying to kiss everyone? While it may seem that I am nit-picking about many parts of the film, I do praise it for solid acting from most of the cast especially FASBENDER and have to say the cgi effects of the film are fantastic along with some of the death scenes.The biggest sin by FOX and RIDLEY SCOTT is not allowing BLOMKAMP to make a sequel to Aliens. I would love to see Sigourney Weaver and Michael Bein continue the story of the colonial marines and Weyland Yutani.So much potential but executed poorly.",Alien - Covenant
1041,olgavalentovaov,What the Hell Have I Just Seen?,4,12 August 2017,"You know, this movie really makes you ask the difficult questions, like ""What's the meaning of life?"" and ""Should humanity move over to make space for another dominant species?""...said nobody ever. Instead, it will leave you wondering ""Why is everybody so freaking stupid?"" and ""What's up with that awkward flute scene?"" and ""Why don't I just go home?"" It's definitely the weakest of all the Alien movies and the connection with Prometheus only makes a confusing franchise so much more mind-boggling. And not in the good way. It's trying so hard to be a meaningful, deep movie, that it turns into something so utterly full of itself it's almost unwatchable. Seriously, if this movie was a person, it would probably be just a slightly more condescending version of Jean Paul Sartre. And it's boring, too. However crappy Alien 3 was, it was still entertaining. You know, that kind of a film you know is wack but you'll watch it anyway. Don't watch this. Just don't. Go watch Life instead.

1042,darkwave2000,Death of a franchise.,2,30 August 2017,"Saw it opening weekend and it just came out on home video. This will be the first Alien movie I won't watch again or purchase on video.Ridley Scott clearly has dementia or something. He still is a master of visuals, but, he obviously doesn't care that his characters are complete morons.It was bad enough in Prometheus that characters removed their helmets on an alien world, the Covenant crew doesn't even bother putting space suits on! They dress in the latest outdoor store fashion and set out on a nice, Earth-like hike on a planet they know nothing about. I've seen review writers make fun of people slipping in blood during the first, big gross out scene, but, I didn't think it was a big deal. It was idiotic, however, that the one gal locks her fellow crew member in the sick bay with the infected man when he'd been spewing blood all the way throughout the ship.The new Ripley, complete with Aliens costume and hair, is a joke. She reminds me of the teenage boy in The Hills Have Eyes remake, except he was a much better character. This gal is so wimpy and bland, I just can't buy her as a survivor of an Alien movie.Having since seen behind the scenes videos, I saw that they made an Alien man-in-a-suit costume and it was insanely tall! Then they ruined the movie by pasting a CGI Alien on top of him! End result, a shitty, Alien 3-looking Alien, a film I actually like, despite the crappy computer effects.The rest of the movie is like one of the old, 80's slasher flicks with dumb characters doing dumb things so that the monster can come and kill them. Someone should edit Covenant scenes with Friday The 13th music over it. That would be hilarious.I wanted the Shaw and David go to Paradise movie, but, I guess, Noomi wasn't available, so, they made this piece of sh*t.Maybe Neil Blomkamp will get his chance to make Alien 5.

1044,OnlineObserver,Alien and Aliens were amazing films! The films that followed... what the hell happened?!,1,16 December 2017,"I thought the film ""Alien"" was a masterpiece! Then, when I saw ""Aliens"" thinking that it couldn't possibly outdo the first film, and it actually did! The two films were original, cleverly put together, offered something you hadn't seen before, included characters that all had character and the dramatic tense intro and terrifying atmosphere that the directing style and soundtrack managed to create was not only what made the first film great, but it was also included in the sequel continuing the directing style that made the first film one of the best horror films of all time and making the sequel stand along side it. After ""Aliens"" was released in 1986, the ""Alien"" series went downhill. ""Alien 3"" was average with major plot holes, ""Alien Resurrection"" was terrible and had nothing about it that you would remember long after it's release. I thought these films were bad enough, however, this film outdid those films!As soon as the film started, I knew I wasn't going to like ""Alien Covenant"". The tense, dark, eerie intro that created the scary, uneasy atmosphere that made the films so iconic was removed for a more brighter and misleading intro. I say misleading because the intro was more fitting for a film in a different genre other than horror. The characters in this film were forgettable! Another thing majorly wrong with the directing style of the film and I find it hard to believe that the same man who created a film with characters such as Dallas, Ripley, Lambert, Brett, Kane, Ash and Parker, created a film were not one character stood out!There was no originality at all in this film! Everything in this film you will have seen before in the other films. The film became so predictable, that I even guessed the ending before it ended! That can never be a good thing when it comes to the ""Alien"" series when one of the elements of the films that made it so intriguing, was the mystery element. I was really disappointed with this film! Not only was I excited about it and let down because the director was the same director who directed the first ""Alien"" film, but because of how lazy the directing style was, how flat the film was (no high points at all) and how I disliked it so much while watching it, that I even hoped every time the screen went dark or a scene ended during the second hour, that the film had ended and would say to myself ""please finish"" when the next scene began. Don't watch this film if you are a fan of the ""Alien"" series. I myself love the first two films, however, the ones that followed, will hopefully over time, disappear from my memory all together.

1045,idaustin,"Flashes of brilliance, but falls short at times",6,6 April 2018,"Look, there's a minimum standard of brilliance to be expected from Ridley Scott. The good: Panoramic/breathtaking landscape shots, the overall pacing of the film, and Fassbender x2. The 15-20 minute sequence from initial crew ingestion of the alien spores through to neomorph ""births"" is cinematic genius. Scott conveys absolute mastery of pacing, grit, terror and suspense. The bad: alien fans inaugurated into the original mythos via Alien/Aliens will need to quickly accept and adapt to a new mythos: these Aliens are not the old Aliens of 70's/80's lore. At times, we're left with more questions than answers: how is it that these Aliens reach adulthood in less than a few hours when the original film seemed to suggest a much longer birth through adulthood period? The ugly: Too much CGI! The Neomorph scenes post birth just seem rushed, and the creatures obscured. Orams's death/birth of the protomorph scene is just silly.

Prometheus began really fine, but had a disappointing ending. On this new movie, so awaited, I thought we would at last know from where our ancestors came from, but the movie is about those crappy aliens, like old trash 80's movies with Sigourney Weaver. I almost didn't finish watching, so big is this BS. It's a film for teenagers looking for fun, eating peanuts at the cinema, not a serious, intelligent film for us, which think about our origins, the universe, past and future.

On the other hand I was extremely disappointed with Prometheus. So when it came to Covenant I had heard all the negative press it received and I went into it with extremely low expectations. As an Alien film this is horrendous. However, if you treat this as a Final Destination film it's enjoyable. The characters are insufferable, ALL OF THEM! So instead of complaining to my wife the whole movie I decided to enjoy each death. Think about it, they survived the flare at the beginning and then the rest of the film is just death catching up with them. This way you can watch the film without cringing at all the stupid decisions people make. In the Final Destination films the stupidity is what makes it charming. Honestly though it had a few moments that were ok, but all in all it was an average sci fi movie with Alien slapped onto it. Michael Fassbender is stupendous and the only reason worth watching the movie. Ridley Scott needs to retire with his wealth and stop ruining this beloved franchise.",Alien - Covenant

I could go on in detail about how moronic the crew are, but am sure you've read multiple reviews on that subject by now. Some of the ideas are interesting, but they seem shoehorned in, secondary to being part of an Alien film. I'm part of the camp that while whinging about ""Prometheus"", I still thought it interesting.
Whereas this is just Studio Alien cashgrab. Danny McBride is the best thing in this (after Fassbenders) which normally should tell you something about it. Except I think this is his best performance.

The beginning looked amazing out of space and was worth watch it in cinema. They found a signal from an unknown planet and decided to go there. The acting was good so far and the suspense was building up with excitement. But the story stopped when they met David. It's like the writer had a big hole in the middle of his script and filled it up with a very confusing idea that doesn't follow with the rest. I found that the mid story was boring and painful to watch. The acting became absurd and it made the Aliens look weak as they were always known to be extremely cleaver. The whole story now was focus on a droid who turned to the dark side of the force. By the time they realised they have other actors, it was near the end so they rushed out the final scene.

1056,QuintLives,Not terrible but terribly unnecessary,5,25 May 2017,"The original Alien is one of the greatest horror films ever made. Aliens is one of the best sequels ever made. Then they made more movies that ranged from awful to merely forgettable. Alien: Covenant falls into the merely forgettable category. It is not a bad movie. But considering that the idea of Ridley Scott making a new Alien movie was merely a fanboy pipedream for decades, mediocrity is a colossal disappointment. Covenant is a sequel to Prometheus and a prequel to Alien (got that?). Oddly enough, it manages to be a sequel to Prometheus without directly following up on the events of that film and a prequel to Alien without directly leading into the events of that film. Prometheus ended with Shaw and David heading off to the Engineers' home planet to finally ask of our creators the timeless question that lies at the core of humanity's very existence: WTF? We don't get that movie. We get a brief flashback explaining that David killed the Engineers by using their own bio weapons against them, then took up residence on another planet and has been playing mad scientist for the last decade or so. He lures a ship to his planet with a distress signal and then murderous hijinks ensue. In many ways, this reminds me of Alien 3. Important characters and plot threads are disposed of off-camera before the movie begins and then it essentially dives into an inferior remake of the original movie. It is like a fan fiction side-story that somehow became a real film.Odd story choices aside, the underlying problem here is that I just don't care. Not once while watching Alien did I wonder where these things come from. I knew that it was a killer alien and I never really needed additional information. Scott has created an entire series of films to answer questions that I never asked in the first place. Despite its flaws, I enjoyed Prometheus largely because it managed to be a prequel to Alien while still doing its own thing. I feel like a more interesting movie took place between Prometheus and this movie, but Scott listened too much to audience criticisms of Prometheus and decided to instead just give us an Alien rehash. Additionally, it does more to confuse the timeline than clarify it. At the end of Prometheus, I could have filled in the blanks and drawn a dotted line from the end of that movie to the beginning of Alien. This movie takes that dotted line on a meandering detour and the mysterious transmission to the Nostromo that kicks off Alien doesn't seem to be getting much closer. All of this explanation and backstory does nothing but demystify the aliens and the events of the original movie (assuming that we ever get to those events).Speaking of demystifying the aliens, the special effects in this movie are awful. If you regularly read my reviews (which I appreciate), you know that I don't like computer effects. I really don't like computer effects in horror films. I really, really don't like computer effects in sequels/prequels to horror films that are considered landmark accomplishments in special effects. The creature design and effects in the original Alien are among the best ever, and the computerized versions of them just look like cheap imitations that are unworthy of the original's legacy. But, you say, the computer effects allow for more range and mobility. Yeah, that's part of the problem. Much of the suspense of the first film is derived from the characters being stuck in dark, confined spaces with a monster lurking in the shadows. In this movie, the thing is out running and jumping all nimbly-bimbly like in broad daylight. It looks fake, it looks silly and it drains any sense of dread or mystery from the creature. As a standalone film, this isn't terrible. But it pales in comparison to the first two movies and, in the context of the series, just feels unnecessary. If you aren't a horror nerd like me, you probably won't have an attachment to the material that will prevent you from enjoying it as just a decent horror movie that will kill two hours. But if you haven't seen Alien or Aliens, you need to stay home and watch those classics instead.",Alien - Covenant

As we got into the first act, I quickly realized this was just a redo. The story is formulaic, stupid, and easy to figure out. The big reveal was seen coming miles away. The actors were miscast. Any time you put a Danny McBride in a serious roll, you will likely have a failure on you hands. McBride is funny in comedies, rehashing the same character he always plays. However, McBrides roll as Tennessee made me puke in my mouth a couple of times. And Billy Crudup? Come on man!! Dudes awful.The story line about taking this trillion dollar space ship across the Universe, with such laxed protocols was beyond stupid. The entire premise was idiotic. Even Captain Kirk just took like 3 dudes down to check on the planet the first time, not half the freaking crew.Michael Fassbender was just terrible as the robots, and should be ashamed his significant acting talent was wasted on this pile of crap...even worse than Assassins Creed.FX were good, scenery was great, but Ridley Scott poured a giant bucket of Alien Acid blood all over the franchise and killed it.

Other things happen too, but it was certainly an interesting scene that I didn't quite expect in my 'sexual-predator-metaphor aliens kill people' movie.Alien Covenant is the newest installment in the Alien franchise. Ridley Scott might be milking it, but I did buy a ticket, so who knows? The plot is thus: some colonists are heading to a planet to colonise, they follow a rogue signal off-course to another planet that's closer, younger and better looking, and then they all get killed by aliens.It's a tale as old as time, if this tale includes Michael Fassbender playing flute to himself for a good three minutes. It's been twelve hours and I still can't believe that Fassy said the line, ""I'll do the fingering,"" with a straight face in a serious sci-fi film.

Do I care about the evil android's villainous monologue about how all humans should die? Not really. There's a little bit too much blood and screaming for that to come through properly in the dialogue.The action is about as mindless and hard-to-follow as one would expect, and the animation of the xenomorphs is a bit bad, but who cares?

1063,the_cyberpunk,"Terrible Script, Terrible Effects, Utterly Boring",1,19 May 2017,"The film is in all ways worse than literally every Alien film that has come before it and I actually include the god-awful Aliens vs Predator films because at least they didn't over- promise and under-deliver so grotesquely. This film is filled with deus ex machina, clichés, bad techno babble, worse dialogue, and overused tropes. It is not only bad, it is laughably bad. There are extensive spoilers in this review, nevertheless I urge you to read on so that I can save you from this piece of absolute garbage.The nonsense begins pretty much in the first minutes of the film. A disaster befalls the colony ship Covenant, which has stopped in deep space to unfurl its sails to recharge for some reason. I guess the ship runs on solar power or something because the people writing the script figure that's how it'll work in the future, and didn't bother checking with a technical consultant. So this disaster —a giant neutrino burst caused by a nearby star farting or something— damages the ship's solar sails, and causes fires to break out all over and steam vents to start spraying steam, and most notably killing the ship's captain James Franco whom I imagine had a larger part but saw where this mess of a script was going and cut fence along with Noomi Rapace who really only appears in likeness, but I digress.So the flight crew of 15 (the rest of the ship's population of colonists are kept in hanging freezers that just kind of swing around like they're on coat hangers) has to fix the sails. Whilst Danny McBride is outside the ship doing this his helmet intercepts a cryptic signal of some one singing a —I'm not even kidding— John Denver song. Apparently only Danny McBride's helmet could pick this up because the ship has ""communication buffers"" that block out communication attempts I guess because that's how the communication systems aboard solar powered space ships of the future will work. The replacement captain who no one trusts because he is ""a person of faith"" decides to take the ship off course to investigate the source of the transmission because it is coming from a planet that is awesome, way closer than their original destination that is still 7 years away, and yet that they somehow missed when selecting a planet to colonize. Of course it turns out the planet they find is the planet that Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender from the previous movie ended up on. This is deus ex machina at its absolute worst. The odds of a ship in the vastness of space, just happening to run out of gas and getting a flat tire in front of Planet Bates Motel completely undermines the rest of the film, which even without this silly contrivance would have been terrible. The colonists organize a landing party with their only shuttle, because of course they do. They find an eerily dead world because of course they do. Some of their number get sick on spores and end up birthing some monsters because of course they do. Things get particularly bad once David makes his appearance. Yes David has survived since the events of Prometheus, his hair has grown out because I guess Weyland Corp makes androids that need hair cuts. Some more nonsense happens — I'm not going to go into it in detail because it is just so hackneyed and predictable. Suffice it to say more people die. And then the first huge twist of this pathetic film: David invented eggs and face huggers. That's right. David the android, still doing his best Peter O'Toole impression, stranded on a dead engineer world inhabited by monsters, decided that with all of this time on his hands he may as well invent the alien menace because he was mad about, I don't know, something, and wants to take it out on humanity by inventing a penis-headed monster. Maybe because he was made without a penis, I'm not really sure, they don't cover it. It is never adequately explained how he even does this or what tools he uses, or even how he knows how to do this in the first place.We stumble across the preserved and vivisected corpse of Noomi Rapace that David has kept for some reason ala Bates Motel, as well as an art studio filled with of creepy poster sketches David made of her — I guess this planet had a Hobby Lobby. What ensues is a bad, nonsensical, utterly devoid of suspense or tension, chase sequence with terrible creature effects. I won't bother to tell you how it ends, it's just as stupid and predictable as the rest of the film.To make matters worse, one of the script writers who churned out this turd also wrote the script for the upcoming Bladerunner sequel for which I now have absolutely zero hope. I don't know what is wrong with Ridley Scott. He keeps working with absolutely terrible scripts. Does he read this garbage beforehand? Does he show up on day one of shooting and just say ""to hell with it, let's get this crap in the can""? Maybe he is just taking these projects on in order to set up trust funds for his kids — I don't know where the budget for this film went, it looked like it could have been filmed for less than a quarter of what went into it. Skip this film. And just to be safe skip any other films that happen to follow it. Nuke the whole god damn mess of a franchise from orbit. I can only hope this is the final nail in the coffin of this series I once loved.0 Stars",Alien - Covenant

1065,pickard233,Immensely Disappointing Film That shouldn't Be Praised For It's Mediocrity.,4,12 May 2017,"I have to say. I was more eager than ever to see this film. The trailers were great (if not slightly spoiler filled) I was super keen on seeing Danny McBride playing a serious role, and I was more than eager to see something that would pull the Alien up from the nose dive it have become. But when the credits rolled, oh man was I disappointed. This movie is actually a massive step down from Prometheus.The problems with this film are vast, but some struck me more than than others. For one, it actually felt amateur. Considering Ridley Scott made the iconic origin film, it's hard to understand how tragically he has failed to grasp what makes the Alien film great. There is no slow burn atmosphere here. No tension build up. No creepiness to the xenomorph itself. It just fails to do anything that the predecessors do. The film also makes the same mistakes as Prometheus did, by giving the characters terrible motives or at best, strange decision making capabilities. Nothing really makes sense. There are so many times where you wonder to yourself, 'if this is suppose to be such an important mission, why are they making such ridiculous choices?'My next big gripe is with the visual effects. They are awful. Again, a huge step down from Prometheus (which at least had that going for it). The action scenes with the xenomorph were spastic and often hard to follow.Characters were plain, story was beyond boring, plot was ill thought out, and the only likable character who makes sense is the villain!It just failed overall to make a decent movie, and I am tired about giving movie justice just because 'at least the effects were good' or 'at least the sound was great'. If the film can't stand up with its own story, then it is a bad film. And as sorry as I am to say, this is a bad film. Neill Blompkamp should be handed the reins, as at least he has vision which could benefit the franchise.",Alien - Covenant
1066,Dinin70,Destroys everything that has been created,1,26 October 2017,"Hello,I hate this movie and it should never have been done.Opening thoughts: if you didn't watch Prometheus, don't read through this review as it contains SPOILERS for Prometheus. If you did, you can read down to the Spoiler Alert.The first element that immediately pop ups as a negative trait is the total lack of character development. You can say characters, except the protagonists, have never been really developed in the Alien franchise, however, AT LEAST, I recall names like Ripley, Hickx, Hudson, Bishop, Vickers, Shaw, Newt. In Covenant, I don't recall any single name except David and Walter. Not even the name of the protagonist!!! That's to say how much care has been put in characters. It totally fails in creating a background of personalities you could care of, identify with, or at least feel sympathy or hate towards! If the objective was to only care about David/Walter, then job's done, total success!!The second element that really provides a bitter taste are the astonishingly HUGE plot holes of the movie. Every Alien movie had strong plot holes. Prometheus had the biggest ones of the first 5 movies. But Covenant, oh my God, reaches unknown levels of WTF and face-palms... I'm not going to list them as it would be just too long.But, those two elements are not what made me hate this movie.What made hate above all this movies are the following 2 elements:First one links with Prometheus. I liked Prometheus despite a lot of plot holes and incoherence's. I liked it because it was (potentially) setting up a cool and deep background to all the story of Alien and the Space Jockey. As the Prometheus ended, I had the impression that Scott was taking the risk to abandon the Alien movies backbone of ""Alien(s) vs Humans"" in order to develop Shaw epic travel to understand and answer to all questions arising from Prometheus:who are the engineers. - why they created us. - why they wanted to destroy humans. - what went wrong on the Outpost. - why the Outpost was abandoned. - why the engineers couldn't succeed in claiming back the Outpost etc.SPOILER ALERT FROM HEREWell, if you wanted to have any answer to those questions, don't worry, I'm gonna put it simple: David just nuked any possibility to get any! Thank you David! Thank you!!!!!The second element is how underwhelming the Aliens now are. In 1979 Alien we see normal humans fighting with an extremely powerful, unknown species, coming from an unknown ship of an unknown race that crashed in an unknown planet for an unknown reason. Imagine the huge possibilities and background Scott had to provide a super cool lore to this! And Prometheus, despite its plot holes was actually providing something really interesting.Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand, guess what? NOPE!!! Aliens were created by David... Yes yes. An Android created the Xenomorph as we know it. How LAME it is!!!!!!Now, when I look at a Xenomorph I'm there like: ""lolling at your face mate! You're just an ant created by a mad Android"".PffffffffffMy wife couldn't come with me at the Cinema and she loves Alien franchise as I do. Once back from the Cinema, I told her ""if you really want to keep loving Alien movies, don't watch Covenant and stay there with the unanswered questions of Prometheus, thrust me"".",Alien - Covenant
1067,petroname,Long waited new authentic Alien movie arrived,10,22 May 2017,"I have been waiting for authentic continuation of Alien story since Aliens (1986). I'm glad that this movie was the one.Here is what I like and not so much in this movie:The pros:-The story. The story was interesting to watch and kept me glued to the screen. I liked the pace of the movie. The move had a balanced combination of dialog, fight scenes, planet exploration scenes. It did not look neither forced nor stretched - just right.-The characters. Many of them are easily likable. The character development maybe not perfect, but it works for me. I see that characters were selected carefully: they are different and look like real people.-The sound. I watched the movie in IMAX. I was impressed by realistic and deep sound of the guns. -The music. The music composed with respect to original Alien and Aliens. It has music elements its predecessors and this works well on integrity of this movie within Alien franchise.-Fight scenes. The fights are intense, dynamic and well- orchestrated. Many of them have some jump scare moments.-Visual design. The visuals are great. The ship design inside out, the habituated planet - all look rich and bright.The cons:-One of the main protagonist in the movie is Daniels (Katherine Waterston). The actress plays her role well. However, her makeup and haircut are very awkward, and this is a miss. If they wanted her to look like Ripley, the attempt failed.-Ridley Scott, like in his Prometheus, selects main hero to be a woman that automatically makes us comparing her to Ripley. It is sad to say that Ripley easily wins this comparison: her performance and character are one of a kind.10/10",Alien - Covenant

1071,nlghtcreature22-33-793191,Prometheus who? Don't expect any answers here.,6,29 March 2019,"Apparently Ridley Scott decided that since many fans didn't care for Prometheus, he would just write it off in a very brief & badly tied together flashback & instead make another re-read of the same old ""scary aliens chasing & killing idiot space people"" movie again. You know, the kind of space-monster move that we've already seen a million times, including in past installments of the Alien series? Yeah, he did that again. The writers seem to have said ""All of the build up & those unanswered questions from Prometheus that you're wondering about? The Engineers being the parents of humanity? The search for their home planet & answers about why they created us & wanted to destroy us? Meh... Doesn't matter. We'll just quickly get them out of the picture entirely, so that we can go back to scary beasties chasing morons instead!""
And yes, the people in this story are complete morons. We're supposed to believe that this epic venture to spread humanity to the stars & has been in planning for a decade was left in the care of a bunch of fools that seem to have had no training whatsoever? Under the first sign of duress they completely abandon their original carefully planned out mission, then proceed to panic, fail to follow any type of basic safety or quarantine standards, & rush right into fool-hardy half-baked plans without a peripheral thought to the 2000 souls on board that are under their care?! I felt insulted by the actions & reactions of the crew in charge of this mission, & actually found myself feeling satisfied as each one got taken out by a xenomorph.
As far as the story line goes, & specifically in regards to this supposedly having been a sequel to Prometheus, I understand what other reviews have stated about the ""Paradise Lost"" theme, & that the story of Prometheus was followed up in this movie by following the theme of creation turning on creator, Satan vs the gods idea, but.. I just don't buy it. It's a complete detour from what was started in the previous movie, & in my opinion yet another example of Damon Lindelof having a great idea for a beginning of story, with utterly no clue how to finish it, so he declined to sign on for this movie & left it to someone else to figure out (& they failed, miserably.)
All in all, as a blockbuster film, it's a fun watch for the action & viauals. However, there's no actual scary moments that you don't see coming, & no plot points that aren't completely unsurprising. It's just very poorly written. Very well acted (mainly by Fassbender,) but just plain poorly written. Great visuals, good action, plenty of gore. But VERY. POORLY. WRITTEN.
And like the title of this review says-if you're hoping for any answers from Prometheus, go read a fan fiction or look elsewhere, because apparently they've decided to abort that storyline for more of the same. If you just want gore, death, shooting, screaming & Aliens shredding people, you're in the right place!

I've seen a lot of these reviewers try to compare Covenant to Ridley's original film: Alien. However, for the life of me I can't figure out why. Why do we feel the urge to compare what once was thought of as an original masterpiece to every sequel (prequel) that ensues? if Apple were to release the same damn iPhone every single fall with no sudden changes would we be pleased with the result? Absolutely not. And it's the same with film. Directors should be allowed to venture out from the norm of society to create something new. That is exactly what Ridley Scott has done in my opinion. He has catered to a new generation - filled with all the gore, excitement and flare that has made this franchise so successful. My admiration remains very much alive for Ridley Scott.

Perhaps there exists a fan base that eagerly anticipates discovering the origins of the gruesome creature that terrorized Signory Weaver back in 1979, but I think most people won't care and it will fade from their memories moments after leaving the theater. The ""slasher"" part of the film plays as a B-horror movie with a massive budget. The characters, while well acted, are paper thin. They make baffling stupid decisions that result in most everyone dying. But who cares - it's evident their only purpose is to be props for the aliens to slaughter in the most gruesome ways imaginable for our entertainment. Unfortunately, the most terrifying death is spoiled in the trailers. The rest are the same thing we've seen in every other ""Alien"" movie - chest bursting, acid, facehuggers, etc.There are also a few ludicrous eye-rolling moments, some philosophical musings you might find on the side of a cereal box, and a ""twist"" ending that is a laughably obvious.

A day later, however, it's impact on me is very strange, a combination of being completely forgettable and me not being able to stop thinking about it. Isn't that an oxymoron?I had no understanding of the pacing throughout the film. The runtime said it was 123 minutes long, yet I honestly felt as if it were far shorter, mostly because the pacing was so lost and confused. The characters are all complete morons, more so than Prometheus. People just touch random stuff on an alien planet that they nothing about and has supposedly never been discovered. Five minutes in and after discovering mysterious wheat plants, they still assume the planet is uninhabited and even make plans to permanently move there. A guy even does the cliché ""I gotta take a whiz"" thing where he goes off by himself to urinate only for something to happen to him. Characters are constantly tripping on their own feet, dropping or leaving behind weapons for no reason, and always believing the most suspicious people's lies. The directing is also very mediocre, almost as if a tired 80-year-old man was at the helm -- oh wait. Ridley Scott is a great director, but it's like he just didn't care. Scenes are shot okay enough, but not on the same level as a veteran director like Scott. So many scenes are missing the 'oomph' that would make them really interesting.Sure, it has xenomorphs. Sure, it has gore (and really good gore, too). Sure, it answers questions asked by Prometheus. But, I mean, so what? What about the story? What about the character? What about the script? But, at the same time, nothing about this film is too bad. The effects, set design, and cinematography are all marvelous, and this entry really adds a lot more mystery to the franchise than Prometheus does. Everything just sorta sits right in the middle. It's nice to see the xenomorph kill some people on the big screen, but the people being killed are all unlikable cardboard-cutout morons.

Prometheus seemed a little awkward to me but Covenant puts all that right and makes Prometheus a good subject and chapter in the story of the Alien and, now, the story of David. I like how it uses the theme that PKD was using through Bladerunner (Do Androids Dream....), the fact that true AI can probably be so much more than it's human creators.Some great little nods to the origins of the series, classic Ridley Scott attention to detail and a welcome return for the Alien.",Alien - Covenant

From the deaths of the beloved John Hurt and Bill Paxton, to this disappointment from the mind behind the original horror classic.I remember being one of the people who wasn't as angry when Prometheus came out. It definitely had major flaws, but it was at least something new and compelling, and had some good performances from Fassbender, Theron, and Elba. Alien Covenant tries to be the love baby of Prometheus and the original Alien, and fails at being as enjoyable as either.The only enjoyable parts I got out of the movie were Michael Fassbender's performance as both Walter and David, and some fun deaths (probably Ridley Scott's most gory film to date). The rest of the movie is so deprived of anything interesting or for the most part, scary. All the characters besides David and Daniels are boring and disposable, and even Daniels is just there to be a less badass and less charismatic Ellen Ripley. The plot holes are way more noticeable than in Prometheus (which is saying something) and characters constantly make stupid decisions. The acting and cinematography are just fine, but not enough to save the film as a whole.I don't remember getting scared once throughout the entire film. The movie is very predictable to the point where you can always sense a jump scare before it happens, and even the aliens look stupid. Not only is the CGI much worse than you'd expect from a movie with an almost $100,000,000 budget, but they make the xenomorphs look stupid by having them out in broad daylight. And the new ""neomorphs"" are completely useless to the story until they have an actual excuse to introduce the xenomorphs.Overall this movie is disappointingly mediocre. This is more of a modern day stupid horror movie than it is a unique Alien movie. Most people reading this have either already seen the movie and know what I'm talking about, or have not yet seen it are going to see it regardless of reviews. Well just don't say we didn't warn you.",Alien - Covenant

1084,schroederana,Horrible movie! Super disappointing and not worth your time,1,27 May 2017,"Horrible movie! I came in expecting to watch something similar to the original alien movie and was incredibly disappointed. First of all, the movie's main plot is not really about aliens, it's of the two robots that are constantly fighting, kissing, and playing the flute. Apart from that, everyone just dies and the aliens are practically just a small twist to the whole movie. I literally fell asleep watching it and I just could not wrap my mind around it.

1085,redguy-54547,The Shaw problem,3,27 May 2017,"This is my first review here on IMDb some please excuse any possible transgression.I must say I had 0 need to watch a new Alien movie, but I liked Prometheus despite it's short comings. In the weeks before this movies, I had a bad feeling about this as I read rumors on the net about Dr (no knows in what, but at least someone tried) Shaw's fate. I was relieved when I saw The Crossing(?) and I thought the rumors were wrong (as those acted as if they were lovers, no not friends). But boy was I wrong. Yes Shaw is the Alien, not in the Aliens way, tho. Her body (well her reproductive organs) was used used to create the Xeno eggs, probably while she was still alive, judging by the growths on her neck and head. This is not the Newt treatment, this so much worse.I don't even start to comprehend what are the motivations of David, as he seems more human than android. but in an utterly stupid way. He is not Lucifer, not a space Hannibal Lecter, he is just a space rapist who was strand in a big budget movie, while he would be more at home in a hentai.People seem to not like the movie but like David, but please wake up, this is all made for David the Space Rapist. There is nothing profound in here, 0 at all.",Alien - Covenant
1086,animausimages,Scott breaks the agreement with Covenant,6,22 June 2017,"2017's ""Alien: Covenent"" directed by Ridley Scott. Starring Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, Carmen Ejogo, and Demián Bichir. The 6th standalone Alien movie in the series, ""AC"" takes place in 2104- 15 years after the events of Prometheus. Deep in space, we meet some of the crew on the Covenant ship, carrying thousands of colonizers deep in cryogenic sleep. They are watched over by the android, Walter (Fassbender). The ship experiences technical difficulties, some of the pods malfunction, and they lose their captain. Thrust into a replacement role, Crudup is forced to take command. With the original captain and others being mourned, morale is low. A signal of some kind is found from a nearby planet, and the combination of ease combined with dismay over the prospect of having to go back to their pods for more cryosleep until getting to the original destination planet, causes them to send a party to the nearby planet for exploration. The crew touches down, and quickly finds an environment accepting of their host bodies. We also reconnect with David (Fassbender, again), the android from Prometheus, who has been mysteriously busy over the last decade and a half.""AC"" initially returns to the clinical idealized perfection of 2012's ""Prometheus"" as we are shown the initial birth of David, who calls himself this after viewing Michelangelo's classic statue. But when on the integral planet, in his own turf, we see a much more Gothic and uneven decorative touch from the self anointed creator. Closer in tone to ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" than ""Alien"", (for better or worse) Fassbender's double duty is the star of the show. His character(s)' questions alluding to creation, the point of life, and which gods are worth serving propel the franchise into territory not previously seen before. The Alien movies are no longer about the alien franchise as we know it, with ""AC"" repeating ""Prometheus""' patterns of changing the way the aliens hatch/spawn, impregnate, mature, and look, with the gestation process now resembling something akin to instant coffee. Instead, they're about the nightmare of artificial intelligence, and how humans have been surpassed in the evolutionary food chain, a different kind of alien. With all due respect to Waterston and McBride's capable heroes, Alien movies are no longer about humans either, with the days of having a kick ass protagonist like Weaver gone, as well as an interesting crew worth getting to know. Even if I'm wrong, the characters here suffer from the same issues as in Prometheus, with them doing such stupid things that it's tough not to root for the alien protomorphs regardless. Interesting in it's idea and originality, but flawed and unemotional in concept, ""AC"" is the chilly explanation to why Scott chose not to make the sequel to Blade Runner- these Alien prequels ARE the sequel(s). There is most definitely a broken covenant here, and in it's bloody corpse lies the cavity of a different kind of creation. 3/5",Alien - Covenant
1087,zhangw-18372,Another Alien episode that compliments the Alien universe,7,21 January 2018,"The film fills the gap between its predecessor Prometheus and the first Alien film. It reveals, to a large extend, the origin of Alien. Though Alien series are always rendered with intense graphical scenes, this film has added more mystery and horrific conspiracy. Shelley's poem renders the film a sense of arts and literature. 
It's my favourite part of the film.I deeply appreciate the Alien universe Ridley Scott has created and leave its fans immense space to think, imagine and be inspired. I cant wait to see the next film in the franchise.",Alien - Covenant
1088,francismunoz,"Yes its a 2017 franchise, but there's narrative art in it",7,2 August 2017,"I'm going to spend some time on my thoughts on this movie.First of all, This is a movie from 2017 and its part of a franchise. You have live with it. Most of the people going to cinema are watching an alien movie for the first time, they were not even born when the first one was played. So as a filmmaker you need to give them the formula that work 2 decades ago: Action, blood and gore terror, and everything has to be faster a lot faster. This is the no- patience generation.So that's the price to pay, and there is no way around. But in return R.Scott gives more of a fascinating story. The setting and the atmosphere is fantastic. And in my opinion, the twist that brings the story of Pinocchio and doctor Frankenstein together is brilliant. Yes the rest of the movie is superfluous, fast food for teenagers, but despite that, some scenes are gold, pure gold, and cannot be ignored.I'm Sorry for those fans that couldn't see it this way. But again this is modern commercial cinema, and alien its not the first undergoing this changes: Star Wars, Star trek,......",Alien - Covenant
1089,Brian-9229,Ridley kept his promise!,8,21 August 2017,"This film is damn near perfect! Ridley did what he said he was going to do, and he came through quite admirably.

This is how to evolve a lagging series into something comprehensible, that can continue to evolve to full circle. Keep them coming Ridley!",Alien - Covenant
1090,mauritsverheij,Definitely no six stars movie,1,30 March 2018,"I don't get IMDB ratings sometime. Was hoping this 6,5 star was reflecting it to be a nice movie. But alas. Original Alien movies put to shame. Prometheus was bad. This is not much better. How hard is it to get some logic in a movie. Would have made it a lot more fun to watch. No it doesn't have to be all perfect. But when mankind gets around building interstellar ships and sleep-pods and whatnot one should expect a crew to have, and at least be trained a little sensibility. But no, we get to watch a crew so social and scientifically silly it is annoying. Sad, actually. It could have been something.",Alien - Covenant
1091,d0x360,"Not bad not great, feels like a bridge movie.",7,7 August 2017,So if you had any questions about Prometheus they are answered here in a way that makes perfect sense. Prometheus was laced with tons of subtext and story told through visuals. This movie is like that as well but everything is more...clear. motives make perfect sense as do most of the characters reactions.Without spoiling the movie it feels like this is definitely a bridge between Prometheus and something bigger. Ridley Scott did a fantastic job recreating some of the atmosphere but without trampling on the original.If you are a fan of Alien it's definitely a must watch and while it might not be a masterpiece I don't think any movie in this franchise can ever live up to the 1st 2 simply because they were absolutely incredible and they were fresh. At this point we know what's what.Still do the listen to all the negative people around here. I think they go themselves way too hyper up for this.It's a solid movie with no glaring issues. My one gripe is everything moves too quickly and we don't get any truly scary and intense scenes but I don't think that was the point here...I think the point was to bring us from A to B so that C could be something special and it works on that level.Easily a 7/10 any day.,Alien - Covenant
1092,jaguarjon53,A monster tail of a moral tale,9,12 January 2020,"This sequel to Prometheus, prequel to Alien (the original) is bound to split its audience because it's a monster tail of a moral tale. Put simply: good and evil, where do they come from? If you don't like Ridley Scott's answer, you're sure to shy away from its message.Most of our monsters are the monsters of our own imagining. Thus, the tale unfolds from the tip of its birth, [beware, here be monsters, sorry spoilers, just like little dragons on ancient maps] in the mind of an imperfect human, to his creation, not Adam, but David (would you Adam & Eve* it), an android who shares his maker's defects, to the terrible consequences that result.Rather like a cartoon mouse before a sun, over a great enough distance, his creator's defects cast a gigantic shadow onto a distant planet's surface. It's really, deeply sad.He wanted David to be perfect but uncreative, tame, in fact. David 'knows' all all the classic culture, from Adam to Beethoven and all the other letters, notes and numbers there are.The problem is that 'perfection' isn't perfect. Einstein said that it's not knowledge that makes a genius, it's imagination. Which is the mother and father of all invention. The new android says, at one point, that one wrong note eventually unravels the whole symphony. Beethoven, oddly, said something different. To make one mistake, he said, is forgivable but to play without passion is not.David grew his own imagination and, because a morally-bounded limit was not coded into his program, it turns out to be a very warped symphony indeed. It gives birth to the  child of Prospero and Frankenstein - ALIEN(s)!!!The ""perfect"" fighting machine survivalist, the alien has no morality, chained to a razor-sharp intelligence. It kills its organic (human, as it happens) host and then replicates and multiplies. If this sounds like too much of human history, you will find this realisation very uncomfortable. Too many humans believe in the Alien.After all, we have magicked up Autonomous Killing Machines which have already killed a few people. Well, currently a few, but there's bound to be more on the way. A lot more. It's humanity, you see - we're survivalist killers who practise on each other.Only real moral boundaries can save us now. The first step is the hardest - we make, create, heaven and/or hell, that's our choice. Thus spake Zoroaster. Or something.Ridley Scott is a creator too. He's projected our mouse-sized maturity onto a vast canvas and its single question is: Are we big enough to take responsibility for our own thoughts, inventions and actions? Own up and then grow up. Or vice versa. Whatever, but do it today.In the end he leaves us with the knowledge that the dragon is never slain forever and the price of liberty is therefore eternal vigilance.I think he's done a terrific (both senses) job. I really enjoyed it. Furthermore, in the light of current events, its message is timely and ever more timely. Over time, I believe that this film will be seen as a classic. Not perfect, heaven forfend, but classic nevertheless.Fair warning of foul weather, methinks.*London, Cockney rhyming slang for ""believe"".",Alien - Covenant
1093,Bonesnap,This Time With More Stupid,3,10 July 2017,"A script works well when characters are confronted with situations that push them into conflict, where their choices are plausible and realistic within the circumstances they face. That doesn't happen here.It seems that the writers well and truly ignored the colossal storytelling errors of Prometheus and instead chose to write similarly infuriating characters for Alien: Covenant. This lack of awareness from the film's producers is, frankly, astonishing. As with Prometheus the characters are not just repeatedly unprofessional but at times incredibly stupid. A crew trained for space travel would be selected for their ability to maintain composure under pressure but these characters haphazardly ignore safety protocols and are overemotional in situations where you'd expect at least some calm professionalism. The only role that actually gets some character development is Daniels, who (someone, finally) shows some quick-thinking Ripleyesque chutzpah very late in the film. Unfortunately, Daniels doesn't feature enough for the audience to really care about her, probably as a result of having far too many minor characters competing for screen time.The result is a story that feels artificially bumped along by the inane poor judgment of the characters rather than the choices circumstances force them to make. I was going to write a paragraph on the ending but decided it's literally too annoying and predictable to waste time trying.It's a shame, really. Everyone wanted this to be better than the last one. Like Prometheus it has awesome production design and looks amazing. There are some good set scenes but as a whole the film delivers a frustrating, confounding mess that sadly disappoints.PS: For a comedic actor in a serious role Danny McBride is actually very good in this but unfortunately his character's unthinking recklessness made me shout at the screen.",Alien - Covenant

Ridley has buried it in mundane characters, derivative plot, yawn worthy visuals and a twist ending so obvious its headpalm time. Only Michael Fassbender lends this money grab with some sort of gravitas because he is such an accomplished actor. Ridley nobody cares about the final scene as we know they will all be dead come the sequel. So nobody cares a damn about any of the characters at all. The film is basically the Alien and Fassbender.

1098,medjai27,"Sadly, a disappointment",5,9 May 2017,"I wish I had posted a positive comment of a successful sequel to the enigmatic prequel (or reboot) from the 2012 movie that reintroduced the famous double jawed, slimy, orca sounding vertebrae with cooling tubes from a Rolls-Royce: Prometheus. Sadly, in a nutshell it is a letdown. A combination of déjà-vu, awkward references to previous films (which i feared and appreciated altogether) and lazy script-writing choices.The movie sets out to develop the connections between the androids and the xenomorph with humans in-between to provide some depth... or so. Why not... However the story finally focuses on how to decimate them without consideration towards the unveiling of the plot. One could say the Covenant is a rebooted version of the Nostromo; only you would expect more than better special effects and known recipe from past movies. There was plenty of room for imagination on that colony ship. It is all the more annoying since the first minutes of the movie are actually captivating. And about the crew... You may like some of the characters, they're not all bad. But be prepared to an excruciating annoyance towards the ones that repeatedly behave in the worst possible way. Until they vanish into oblivion. Also the duality of the android character is very poorly exploited, while you could expect an interesting parallel based on the Ash/Bishop antagonism we enjoyed not so many years ago. Finally, like in too many recent movies that tends to reboot the good stories from an earlier age, prepare yourself for some poor ill referenced lines: ""better to reign in hell than serve in heaven"" and so on...

Then Prometwhatever came along and sat a new low in the alien series. This scary alien and hostile thing that was found inside another alien spaceship was scary. For so many reasons. Where did it come from? Who was the victim in the space craft? Lots of mystery and questions not answered. That really added depth to the story. Now we know that it was rubbish crap designed by some monkey robot for some quasi religious idiot reason.

Yes, xenomorphs are a vehicle for their destruction, but they've always had a helping hand. The irony of both creations (the Gods making xenomorphs, and us the synthetics) of our undoing is the theme of the entire series.",Alien - Covenant
1101,thingadonta,I think the low ratings are largely because the film is just so depressing (spoilers),8,17 May 2017,"I don't think this is a poor film, I actually think it's one of the better of the Alien franchises. But it's just very, very negative. Evil wins. It's based around the idea of a robot (or 'synthetic') version of 'Kurtz' (David) from Conrad's Heart of Darkness, going 'rogue' on an isolated planet. Nothing wrong with this idea, but one really expects towards the end, that, like the character also based on Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, good might eventually right the wrongs of 'evil' and the rogue Kurtz-style robot might be knocked off or lose, but in this film that doesn't happen. Not only does just about everybody get knocked off by the alien pathogen in typically gruesome fashion, the 'good' robot (Walter) gets knocked off by the rogue robot (David), and this bad robot then manages to take over control of the rescuing ship, as well as 2000 people in deep sleep, and the entire mission, (which is to colonize another planet), signaling his intent to infect them with the alien pathogen whilst they are in deep sleep and helpless. One couldn't think of a worse outcome, really. One leaves the theatre feeling that 'evil' has won. I don't think I've ever seen as negative a movie as this, and I think people are so deflated by it that they vote that way. The cinematography is outstanding, and the story makes some general sense, (except where the crew systematically fail to realize their danger on multiple occasions, for example; after a crew member sees one of the aliens murder a crew member in front of a non-protesting David, that crew member then completely trusts David when he shows him a vault full of alien experimentation, and so gets murdered by another one himself. I don't think so. Also, a superior robot is murdered in close combat not once, but twice, by a less superior one; now that's stretching things a bit. And how can a trained crew land on a remote planet with no measures or thoughts of protection from potential viruses or other pathogens? Wouldn't want to catch a cold with no immunity). I would have altered the script to something slightly more palatable; one expects the next in the series to restore some balance in that respect, you can't have evil always 'win' and expect people to continue to like it. I also don't think people will want to see 2000 people eaten alive in deep sleep by aliens, which is logically where this might be going.",Alien - Covenant

My biggest issue apart from the utter predictability and nonsensical, inept script, was the disappointment of seeing 'Prometheus' mixed up with 'Alien'.'Prometheus' brought new thinking to the genre and left us at the end with the sole human survivor and the android flying off towards the planet of our 'creators' to find out why they had decided to eradicate us.This question does not get answered in 'A:C' because a badly advised director decided to completely forget the huge potential set up in 'Prometheus'.

Prequels are rarely justified and they tend to fail as much as sequels.
I was clearly in the minority when declaring that I REALLY loved Prometheus and I still wonder what was so difficult to understand about it. Alien Covenant had the same effect on me: I REALLY loved it, and, like Prometheus, it took me a few days to process that thought.
Like its predecessor, Alien Covenant suffers an unusually large number of unforgiving flaws: plot holes, unrealistic (not to say stupid) character actions and reactions, Alien lore contradictions, predictable dialogue, and twists,... sadly I could go on and on.
However, I still love Alien Covenant regardless.The first and foremost reason could be a Xenomorph love story ever since I saw Aliens at the cinemas back in 1986 (sadly, I was too young to see the first one in the theatres). This is such a fascinating creature/concept; the Alien (forget the AVPs) franchise always included those subtexts: corporate greed, weaponization, evolution, god complex, questionable human origins, redemption, sacrifice et al. Serious Science Fiction.The other reason why I love Alien Covenant and forget about all its flaws: this is a Ridley Scott film we're talking about; his films are not all masterpieces but, by David, they are gorgeous to look at, I mean, they are visually faultless.If you love the whole Alien mythology like me, you will try hard not to like Alien Covenant but, eventually, it will defeat you and you will proudly add it to your BR collection.",Alien - Covenant

It harkens back to the creepy body horror of early Cronenberg with both gruesomeness and sexuality. Danny McBride surprises with his actual acting chops and Fassbender steals the show in dual roles. Although attentive viewers won't be surprised by the ending, it still maintains intensity up to the credits. My only complaint is I feel fan backlash may have forced hands in the final act. Get the Blu Ray and watch the bonus and deleted scenes. I only hope the scenes are added as a special cut down the road.

The characters are not smart, but I can live with that. Ridley Scott still does not understand biology. In order to grow, an organism needs food (energy, building blocks) and time. The old alien movies understood that part. In these movies the aliens can grow in 5 minutes from 5kg to 500kg without any food. I think Ridley Scott is still struggling with putting enough action in the film and applying basic scientific principles the same time. Without that it is hard to follow what is happening, because it is too far from reality. My impression about this film was that they tried to make the Prometheus film again. They had some minor success compared to the previous trial, the David character is much better now. Maybe after 2-3-4 similar films Ridley Scott learns how to direct and make something good.

Being passionate about cinema often leads to sheer obsession. Personally, the name of certain directors is compelling enough for me to rush to a nearest movie theater with no further information, such as Christopher Nolan, Denis Villeneuve, Paul Thomas Anderson and Ridley Scott. This time was not different, however, Scott's Alien: Covenant turned to disappointment after watching his diligence to destroy a legacy he created. Mastermind of Alien, a science fiction-horror classic of 1979, Ridley Scott refused to be part of franchising efforts and turned down lucrative offers. Therefore, the 1986 sequel Aliens was directed by James Cameron. We saw Scott breaking his promise in 2012 with Prometheus, a rather successful version blending original story with some kind of evolution theory.Alien: Covenant is based on events 18 years before the original Alien and 10 years after the Prometheus movies. I am afraid, this premise itself is enough to show that Scott and his team have run out of original ideas. Suffering from inconsistencies within the story-line as well as relying on horrific appearance of alien creatures on every sequence possible, Alien: Covenant significantly lowers benchmark set high by the first film.The tension reflected in the eyes of a cat in Alien was profoundly effective and shivering compared to sometimes cheesy horror atmosphere designed by high-class technology 38 years later.I will, however, find a consolation prize with Alien: Covenant if the sixth installment somehow provokes curiosity in younger generation to see the classic Alien and even its sequel, Aliens.",Alien - Covenant
1109,stormryder_thomas,Couples Retreat with Aliens needs therapy,5,11 May 2017,"Covenant is the 6th movie in the franchise with director Ridley Scott returning. So what did they get right? Well as expected the visuals are always stunning. Scenery of the planets, art design and cinematography are aspects of Alien with Scott's direction I can always count on. In terms of acting, Michael Fassbender gives a chilling performance. He manages to portray creepiness, desire and obsession so well it got under my skin. He was given the most to do with his existential themes and creator complexity so that was expected. Unfortunately I still left the theatre underwhelmed. Scott clearly wanted to return to the roots of the 1979 classic so much, that it essentially BECOMES that. The film becomes the conventional horror flick it so started in '79 riddled with tropes (if they're alone; THEY DIE, if they're having sex; THEY DIE). It offers nothing new in the franchise as we've grown to see the scene where a dude looks into an facehugging egg, or a revelation that androids can't be trusted. It certainly tries sets up new directions they could've taken but never quite gets out of its comfort zone and in the end we get a plain ""monster-picks-off-people-one-by-one"" story. Also the CGI Xenomorph PALES in comparison to the mechanic puppet used in previous films. This lack of practical effects was also a bummer. In the end though it acts fine as a sci-fi horror if you're not too attached to how revolutionary Alien and Aliens are. Part of me wanted something a little more unfortunately.",Alien - Covenant

Particularly the feeling of unease, that there is something bad going to happen really kept me on the edge of my seat. I really liked the female lead, but especially Michael Fassbender's portrayal of the android is just marvellous. Not only for Alien fans highly recommended.

The rest of the cast and characters are rather forgettable.The movie does a good job showing, just as in Aliens, that the male captain believes to have control, but once such belief is proved wrong his only response is shock. In contrast, the female lead is not about control, but rather her sense of mission or duty that prevails and allows her to continue goal without any shocks. As mentioned before, that is very similar to Aliens and is a very interesting comment on the status of leaders with a vacuum sense of control and power. In addition, it is always interesting seeing a horror movie that enters the subjects of god, creation, destruction and insanity. However, the movie has a few problems. Other than the leads, the characters are rather forgettable. In fact, the colonists seem very naive, going to a new planet without major protections for all the risks that such exploration entails. They looked like lambs, which is a problem since an alien is not scary because it can kill a lamb, but because it can kill a very well prepared human being.More problematic to me seems the idea that the good guys are utterly silly while the villains have skills that change at convenience. It is always a problem in alien movies. Hell, even Alien 3 was made using a lame excuse about how the aliens survived anyways. Something similar can be said about the non-alien villains and their actions.In synthesis, you have a fun good movie, but not a memorable or convincing one. Therefore. It is a one-time movie.",Alien - Covenant
1112,jeremy-clay59,Awful movie. Where is the atmosphere?,2,22 May 2017,"Let me start by saying Michael Fassbender is a fantastic actor. Alas his valiant effort to save this dire movie by himself failed miserably. The overall issue with Alien Covenant is that is does not capture the fantastic atmosphere of the older Alien movies. Like Promethious, the pace is slow and painful to watch. The nods to the older movie are clumsy and predictable. The crew who face the dreaded beast are a bunch of ill trained buffoons who quite frankly I didn't care about when they got killed off. In fact they are so dislikeable, it's actually enjoyable when they meet their grisly ends. The audience is shown that some kind of Alien are spread by pollen or dust by some little pods. Really??? That's the best you can come up with??? It just made no sense. Dallas has become Tennessee...really original guys! A colony ship with only one rover? It was just all so cliché and uninteresting. The whole farce left the audience in my local cinema holding their heads in their hands. Another saving grace apart from Fassbender was that the cinematography was exquisite. Some great angles and beautiful scenery.Too little and not nearly enough to make it watchable. My tip skip this insult to the Aliens franchise and watch Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2. Now that's a great movie with a fantastic soundtrack.",Alien - Covenant

So please pardon the repeat.Lets see the best parts or the Predator. 1. His designing. He looks and is great 2. His shoulder gun. Great 3. His wolverine claws. GreatLets see the best parts of the Alien 1. Designing. Great 2. Acid blood, terror factor. Great 3. Adaptability. GreatWhat can go wrong?!So lets see the Predators bad parts. 1. No use without his Ironman/batman gadgetry 2. Useless in hand to hand 3. Many problems in AVPR. Viz. unlimited blue liquid erasing evidenceNow lets see Alien bad parts 1. Killing technique. Dude, something hard coming out of your mouth to kill is not GREAT 2. No more ninja technique in killing 3. Alienator/Predalien hybrid? Useless. In design, technique and utility.So what would have made these movies great  again? 1. Do away with the awful interludes of human interactions 2. Alienator/Predalien should have had been retrofitted with gadgets 3. Take out the human element. Or at least bring back a Dutch- like character! Someone not like the Rock or Schwartsnegger or the Pianist, but like a combo of Kate Beckinsale, Uma Thurman, Scarlett Johansson, Milla Jovovich, Rhona Mitra, Michelle Yeoh, Michelle Rodriguez, Noomi Rapace (in no order of preference).

Given the number of awesome books readily available, why would anyone create an Alien sequel written by idiots. The Alien franchise has a massive potential, and yet Ridley produces drivel like this.

And this is what they get served up with? Canned pap! After the end of the Ripley years, I suspect people will have been waiting very patiently for this offering, hopping that we would get to grips with the back story that is the beast. Prometheus 1, which i thought OK didn't really help and left more questions than answers. Then we were tantalised with the prospect of not just 1 but 2 new Alien films. So just what were we served up? 1, Don't they Syc evaluate Astronauts of the future? What, they simply pick 22 people of the unemployment lines, throw a suitcase full of money at them and then ask them to fall apart as soon as any problem pops along? I guess in the film Apollo 13, they weren't really marooned in the cap, but were robotically guided by robots and ground crew? 2, In all if not the majority of the film series, quarantine rules are constantly ignored, with the Alien not needing a single 'o' level in how am I going to breach this space craft rigged for space running and the horrors of propelling a 1,000mtr long space craft through simply the most frightening terrain imaginable, No all you have to do is infect a host, and the numpties who are the hosts fellow crew members simply bring you inside, where you can rock 'n' roll through the crew to your hearts content. 3, Once inside you then can seemingly move with ease through this humongous space ship with insider knowledge only possibly obtainable from the ships designers, who of course aren't actually on this afor-mentioned ship and thus the beast could not know anything about the ship? 4, Before all this, the crew is diverted from their main task of delivering the cargo of potential colonists all 3,000+ of them including embryos, simply on the word of one of those un-syc evaluated astronauts, and at the behest of a John Denver record. Clearly this captain has well exceeded his intellectual capacity for captaincy. Best stick to ships cook or busboy? And the list goes on and on.I have given the film a 5 as the special effects a some of the best i have ever seen and possibly why i will be waiting with baited breath for the next instalment of the goon show.

1121,wayofthemetal,3rd time is a charm,10,4 August 2017,"Watched Alien: Covenant a 3rd time. It is a lot better than first meets the eye. The drastic difference from what we were expecting in direction from Prometheus threw all of us off. We had expectations of what we would get to see and we didn't get those. There is so much detail and such good acting. It takes multiple watches to pick up on it all. It blends the styles of Alien, Aliens, and Prometheus all together and does it very well. There is also a lot of subtle reference to Terminator 2. The dynamic between the androids Walter and David and the acting that went into that is something quite special. In that alone is a reference to T:2. My first 2 watches I didn't appreciate the android Walter like the character deserves. I was biased against his character in light of the android David. The android Walter and how he was portrayed also blends the style of android we see in Aliens. The actor's voice and demeanor reflect that of the android Bishop and gives us a bridge to his design. Michael Fassbender really did one hell of a job acting those two parts of Walter and David. Near the end of the movie there is another nod to T:2 as a beam is clearly marked as such and the scene that follows has a strong T:2/Aliens sequence and taste in styling to it. Through and through the acting is very good. Details are abound everywhere. There are a few points of rather convenient plots however overall the film is now among my favorites right along side Aliens and T:2.",Alien - Covenant

But it does deserve credit for production, solid cast and very impressive scenes which were shot fantastic, I'll look forward to the next chapter",Alien - Covenant
1124,callum-mccolgan,A tale of two movies,8,26 January 2018,"""No one will ever understand the lonely perfection of my dreams.""(Contains heavy spoilers)Alien Covenant is a mess. A beautiful, glorious mess stuck between a desire to return to the straightforward effectiveness of the original classic, while also reaching for something deeper and contemplative. The result is a slightly awkward mish-mash between the two that I can't help but strangely admire for how fascinating it all is.In terms of structure, there's not much in the way of surprises in Covenant's story - the crew of a civilian vessel (in this case, a colony ship) pick up a mysterious distress call, they follow it, find it's source, search the planet, then a character says ""I'll be right back"" and you know things are about to hit the fan. However, the competent, if flawed, plot disguises a set of themes which appear to be reaching to be something different from what the Alien franchise has previously delivered.This is perfectly captured in the cold opening, by far the strongest scene in the film, which shows Peter Weyland testing his then-new David android. The scene is rich in the sort of poetic imagery Ridley Scott has always been so good at conjuring, the dialogue laced with intriguing themes of creation, purpose and AI sentience (if perhaps a touch pretentious, but at least it's trying). I came away rather disappointed with Covenant on my first viewing, perhaps because this opening scene promised something the rest of the film never really delivered. For all of its aspirations of grandeur, it's curious to note how the most effective moment in Covenant doesn't come from the aliens or the impeccable production design, but a simple moment of hesitation from David when Weyland asks for tea.Regardless, the first two acts here are executed with verve and punch, despite the oft-mentioned daftness of the character's actions. There is a disappointing lack of depth in this film's characterization - Waterson turns in an excellent performance that matches Weaver's original, but otherwise most of the characters seem to serve little other purpose than to be meaty punching bags for the alien scenes (which, to be fair, pack some rather unexpected jolts that managed to shock even me). Where the film really shines is in Fassbender's riveting performance.David is such a fantastic character - a modern recreation of Milton's Satan: as charming as he is despicable (the script even makes a few nods towards Paradise Lost in the dialogue), yet somehow always intriguing. I can't recall the last time I saw such a perfect marrying of actor to character as this one - Fassbender manages to take the smallest cues and turn them into crucial character beats, which carries through to the chilling horror of the movie's closing scene. His obsession with creation becomes a focal point of the film's second act, and while some may find these scenes pretentiously written, they're also the most interesting parts of the film, where the writers are trying to add an extra layer to the conventional storyline. This culminates in Covenant's obligatory chestburster scene - it's such a bizarrely framed moment that I can't help but smile wryly at whenever I see it. Who could've guessed that the most moving part of this film could be something that's usually portrayed as horrifying?Sadly, the third act is where Covenant struggles to bring these many ideas together into a coherent whole. Rather than trying to properly link the heady themes with the down-to-earth grime of the previous Alien films, the film instead spirals out into a chaotic series of gory action scenes and a rather predictable finale, saved entirely by the ending itself, which turns the 'last survivor' cliche on its head somewhat and points towards an ambiguous future for the series.On the whole, I can't deny that Alien Covenant is a bit of a mess - both of the main story threads would work fine on their own, yet here they're competing for space, resulting in a film that's not so much poorly made as it is missing something vital in its emotional core. At the same time, there are moments of sheer brilliance (the medbay and grass attack scenes being some of the terrifying cold-sweat moments I've seen in a film) and occasional majesty (such as David's arrival on the alien planet) that manage to elevate it beyond just being another boilerplate entry in the Alien series.It may not match up to the first two movies, or quite up to Prometheus, but I found Alien Covenant to be possibly the most fascinating entry in the series, despite, or indeed maybe because, of its flaws and conflicted identity. I have no idea what Ridley Scott could possibly be intending to conclude this series, but I still can't wait to find out...",Alien - Covenant
1125,asby1156,"Prometheus, Not Alien: Covenant, Is The Problem",5,24 May 2017,"I agree with so many of the reviewers who have written that ""Alien: Covenant"" is a big, sloppy mess. And it has neither suspense nor spookiness.But I think the problem starts with its predecessor, ""Prometheus."" Ridley Scott is one of the greatest directors of all time, but he started this series of prequels with the wrong premise; i.e., tying the Engineers and androids so closely to the aliens rather than keeping the conflict between humans and aliens. The entire series of movies has ""aliens"" or ""alien"" in each title, not ""Engineers"" or ""androids."" So the series should principally be about the aliens and humans. I think had Prometheus been strictly about the alien origin, then tying in the Engineers in a much later prequel, while downplaying the androids, then Alien Covenant could have been done much better. I believe letting Elizabeth Shaw survive at the end of Prometheus on the alien planet by her wits in the space lab, then sending out stress calls, would have been a better setup, rather than flying away with android Michael. The stress calls could then be eventually received by a Weyland vessel, and a team of marines or Weyland-paid mercenaries could be sent to the alien planet to find out what has happened. The first two alien movies, which are sci-fi classics, did not stress the Engineers. The androids did play a major role in both movies, but they did not remotely overshadow Ripley or other principal humans.Instead, Weyland executives appear to simply blow off the loss of their company's owner and female heir, as well as their very expensive vessel and lab. Then some entity sends out a group of colonists to explore a new world. Can you imagine if a Fortune 10 company in this day and time lost a major vessel and the company's owners? You can bet that company would do everything it could to find out what happened.I think Ridley Scott needs to start over with the prequels; or, somehow push the androids and Engineers down to supporting roles, and bring back the humans vs. the aliens.",Alien - Covenant

I for one really enjoyed the philosophical turn that Prometheus and Covenant have taken. The one constant throughout the series ever since 1979 is the relentless, purely instinctual aggression of the titular xenomorph. XX121 is a perfect representation of the literal meaning of life: life exists so that it can continue existing. Covenant furthers Prometheus's supposition that we have a purpose.

Action scenes are just plain bland, the CGI is mediocre.

1131,tecktomaket,Alien Cov,5,20 August 2017,"Briefly-most other reviews expressed-articulated the blaring flaws-reflect my own take away on this film. My greatest disappointment was that Dr Shaw (Rapace) wasn't in it. To me the continuity would have carried more intrigue if she ended up battling it out with the sinister David (Android with an Odepius complex)... She embodied Prometheus's story-line with an engaging moralistic quest to find the ""truth"" that naturally carried over to the next installment.She knew what deviousness David was capable of-the natural thing would be to keep him in check...until...Given the price tag to make this film ($97M) it doesn't seem it would have been insurmountable to add Rapace as the former protagonist role played convincingly by SW - in keeping with precedent. I liked the follow through with the protagonist's journey-the critical thread.The monstrous flesh eating acid drooling Alien species is so predicated upon the franchise's bottom line that its lost appeal. David becomes the Alien and must be destroyed. That's the moral deliminator we face with our advanced robotic technology today. Consider the late Alan Turing's thesis on morphogenetic quantum Zeno evolution -which certainly taps into the plausibility of unknowingly morphing our own DNA into a complex adaption to an unknown Ancestral memory of our origin perhaps brought on by a heightened consciousness (Lucy) accidentally attained by taking a flawed pharmaceutical psych med.Mr Scott is a brilliant artist in bringing us game changing cinematic blockbusters. But he seems to have lost touch after all the previous sequels as to the ""Genesis"" archetype of our human origin curiosity of which the answer really might be somewhere in the vast cosmos. Too bad Carl Sagan wasn't available for a consultation.It seems that Scott ran out of credible plot twists to further the quest by an interlinked human desire to bring the anthropological evidence discovered on earth to bare its truth of origin in the ubiquitous indigenous drawn star clustered glyphs similarly found around the world.I gave 5 stars - emblematic of the Star Cluster Glyph. Plot line and the OMG WTH retro clumsy space cowboy antics failed miserably. The question remains: Where did our DNA originated-even if it's just sci-fi. Disappointed that we lost Dr. Shaw to find the answer.Ergo, there is an element of truth in the story-line that had me on edge till this sequel came out. Moreover I loved Rapace's performance. Dr. Shaw was smart enough not to succumb to David's dark side. She was intuitively aware of his flaw.Five minutes into it and I could see this was a rehash of all that came before. Yawn. It felt tired and worn out. No spark of Scott's ingeniously creative spellbinding twists.PS. I can watch Prometheus over and over-the best sequel in the Alien franchise. IMHO",Alien - Covenant

there were 3 alien life forms killed in the making of this motion picture as opposed to the countless killed in aliens via pulse rifle gunfire and marine bad******.
Alien has always been something to think about, even when it was back in it's 1979 horror roots. We wondered how the creature was so capable of hostility and mindless killing, and we wondered why human beings were so in-adept to surviving against such a creation. it's part of the **** narrative, quit your belly aching, learn to think and maybe you'll get a chance to understand. The director and his writers answer some of those questions here. Listen, if your one to just mindlessly watch a movie, high on whatever (I don't judge, I've smoked the ganga a gazillion times as well), then just don't watch this. Go in it with a clear head, a level conscious, and a propensity to think. Riddley might have taken away lot's of the mystery, which yes, makes horror dull, but he also offers something worthy to think about. This isn't Alien circa late 70's.

Poorly executed but nice concept.Alien Covenant is basically Alien made for the millennials.... "" we must try and explain everything"" we must make it easily digestible, we must get away from any open ended questions - today's society doesn't like open ended questions - it wants to know everything and it wants to know now! Hence this awfully obvious and drab film that takes away any myth or mystery we were getting into in the Prometheus.It's fine to make a space horror film - look at Alien ! it was amazing...But all of this film was just exposition and explanation - NOTHING INTERESTING left over.... bar possibly what David will do next and will Tenesee and whoever her name is in the cryotubes survive at all? But as Ridley Scott (surely under huge financial and other pressures from the Studio) does what we know what now to be true over and over - he'll kill off any continuation with any character you might have interest in....cos if ideas get complicated or edgy its just too much for most cinema goers. (blame the studios for this!) The Alien franchise just had a massive dumbing down regards the mythology of it all -and again the movie on screen was massively dumb in so many areas.Ridley said he thought it would be more interesting If David made the aliens (or helped create one /his own version of them) rather than those Engineers people.Who thinks this was big mistake?

1140,buzz_ukuk,Major disappointment,5,5 August 2017,"Unfortunately for me this film was something of a disappointment. I had avoided reading too much about it prior to viewing and was anticipating it picking up where Prometheus left off and developing the origin story further of the aliens and their genetic creators. Instead what we get is a slow to start, pretty low key affair which takes the plot in a completely different and unimaginative direction with the key events revolving around Weyland's android. I found it hard to get behind some of the characters and wondered how they ever managed to get hired as part of a starship crew to begin with. The decision making abilities by key crew members were a bit forehead slapping at times and the action scenes were in part quite derivative and non descript. Overall this was quite a forgettable addition to the alien universe and a definite step down from Prometheus.",Alien - Covenant

For reasons I can't quite fathom Ridley Scott has taken everything that was intriguing about the 2012 instalment and practically thrown it in the bin only slightly touching upon it in a 'flashback' day dream. The engineers were a hugely interesting part of Prometheus and the idea that they had sent someone back 2000 years ago to 'sort us out' was something that to my knowledge had never been done before and had me hooked on wanting to know more but.....nothing...no Shaw hunting for answers...no Engineers other than a 'cameo' and no Jesus story line.Just another Alien film....and not a very good one at that.",Alien - Covenant

1146,tcountry,Not as bad as it's made out to be......,7,30 August 2017,I just finished watching Alien Covenant and I don't think it's as bad as people are making it out to be. Firstly I think it's much much better than Prometheus. I hardly got through that movie. At least there's action in this one....and some horror. Of course there's CGI too. Special effects have changed since the first 2 Alien movies came out. I thought the effects were GREAT. As real as any other science fiction movie out there. Acting is fair. If you sit back and take it for what it is.....it's a decent flick. I rated it a 7. It's worth a view at least. ENJOY!!!!!!!!!,Alien - Covenant
1147,Martin_Skovgaard,Bland with boring characters...,2,1 July 2017,"General problems with the movie:Boring characters with no personalities. We don't get to know them. So we don't care when they die.Spaceship is too bright, shiny and new. Space travel is just like driving car in this movie. There is nothing to it, it seems. It lacks atmosphere. Unlike the first Alien movie this spaceship was probably brand new and made especially for this trip, so it makes sense from a storytelling point of view. But it is just not as interesting. Why did the they name the computer ""mother"". Every ship should have a computer with a unique name. This is just lazy.Aliens are out in the open. Not lurking and hiding. They don't scare you because you pretty much always know when they are around. And the characters know it too.The plot twist took me 1 second to figure out.The origin of the xenomorphs de-mystfy them and somehow makes them less scary.Aliens no longer seem to mimic what their hosts used to be.Characters are less stupid than in Prometheus but still...They land on a foreign planet and immediately they decide to split up. Cliché much? And lets not bother with masks or space suits. There are probably no diseases here, right.Back at the drop-ship one of the female crew panics and locks another female in the medical room because of fear of spreading the disease. But she had her face covered with blood of the sick dude. And she did not even wipe it off. So much for that fear. Even if she was doing it out of fear it was very irrational. When the locked in female was attacked by the alien could she be more ineffective with that knife? Lesson: No women in space! :)And then there is a shower scene where two crew members ignore the horror around them an decide to have sex. Like a Friday the 13th movie they get brutally murdered. Not by Jason but by an alien who entered the shower room undetected. They had sex without locking the door? And we have to see a tit before they are killed - obviously. A little treat for the young folks.Why was the ""Engineer""-people's settlement built of stone and resembled something from ancient Rome?The scene where the Riply-wannabe woman was hanging of the spaceship battling the alien....sigh....ridiculous.... The pilot was against extending the crane because it made the spaceship unstable. But I seem to remember that his flying was not exactly up to par before that. Bouncing around like an idiot.Why is it impossible to make good movies nowadays !???1979 Alien 1980 Empire strikes back 1982 Bladerunner 1982 The Thing 1983 Return of the Jedi 1984 The Terminator 1985 Back to the Future 1986 The Fly 1986 Aliens 1987 Robocop 1987 Predator 1989 The AbyssWhat a f...... decade!!!?

1148,onyxlee,Why is Alien Covenant a GREAT movie? The True Meaning Behind Alien Covenant,10,21 May 2017,"Why is Alien Covenant a GREAT movie? The True Meaning Behind Alien Covenant(Spoiler Alert!)(DISCLAIMER: English is my second language. I only watched this movie once. Lots of details are blurry now. Please help correct my English and the details. Thanks.)Alien Covenant has been criticized pretty badly, the ratings are not good. Some mainstream media even argue, should we still pay attention to this series?Keep reading, I hope you will come to the conclusion like I did, that we should DEFINITELY pay attention to it.I have to confess, I have never been a big adrenaline fan for entertaining horror movies. I watched some of them mostly for visual effects and talking points. I watched Prometheus for the same reason. (Also because I am a space exploration fan.)When I was half way through Alien Covenant, I couldn't watch it any more. Characters made so many unparalleled stupid decisions. So I waited and watched them die one by one without any empathy. I even laughed out loud when I realized that I was fed up by their stupidity. That's when I was struck by the lightning.Isn't that THE elephant in the room?In Prometheus, audience laughed at Dr. Shaw when she forgot to run sideways to get out of the alien spaceship's way. I wasn't sure whether I would be so dumb and panic if I were in that situation.In Covenant, I saw some similar mistakes made in both movies: why not send a rover like Curiosity or a disposable droid down first, to get a full report first. Why break the quarantine protocols again and again and push your luck so far by inhaling the alien spores, touching the unknown species, and test how many lives they have. Some of even worse decisions are, Tennessee risking all the 2000+ lives on board to save his wife. (She died BTW.) His crew gave up easily without a fight to keep him a clear mind. And on and on.When I realized these mistakes could have been easily avoided from a bystander's point of view, but might be difficult for the people in that situation, I further asked myself, is that really so?What I learned from Prometheus is, what if our creator is very disappointed at us and doesn't really like us? Why? According to the movies, obviously we are not the smartest species in the universe. We make stupid mistakes knowing that our behaviors will inevitably lead to horrible consequences, but we are determined to do so anyway. (Look at the real world we are living in! We are seriously arguing if the earth is flat!)True, in the movies lots of deaths could have been avoided with knowledge and reasoning, Some other deaths, you just can't escape them. They are not all the characters' faults. But their deaths were direct consequence of the bad decisions that others made for them.So, what exactly is this Alien? I think it's a metaphor of cold and hard principles/consequences of nature. You can cheat it for a while, but you can't escape from it for ever. As soon as you make one mistake, the cold principles may not kill you immediately, but will eventually come and get you.There are many other angles of this story. (You are welcome to share.) Actually lots of director's ideas are expressed very well through David's monologues. (Talking is almost always my favorite part of the movies, maybe this habit of mine came from Matrix Reloaded. ) For many times, he clearly expressed his disgust towards human, even his creator. He came to the conclusion that wiping human out, or at least stopping them from becoming immortal or interstellar species is the ultimate good, and the only logical thing to do.So, in these movies, there are three separate parties, human, AI, aliens (principles/consequences). Now it's very clear what the director is trying to tell the audience.Look at what you've done, you dumb idiots. None of us can escape the inevitability, no matter how eager you are, how hard you fight, how long you are surviving for now. We will all be kissed by death at the end. The only thing that can surpass us is AI, it might be less humane, it might look like a jerk, but at least it doesn't try to fool itself with alternative facts. At the end, AI will dissect us, analyze us, and try not to make the same mistakes that its creator made to themselves.And, this is not a space horror popcorn movie, this is a prophecy, human! If you don't get it now and start acting wisely, you are indeed as dumb, if not dumber, as these dead people in the movies. In thousands of movies where human fights non-human, we all came to believe in some degree that human species are intelligent, sympathetic, willing to sacrifice for the greater good, which make it superior to other species. While other species don't serve any purpose but simply are driven by basic instincts like hunting and eating. This assumption stopped us from understanding the mastermind behind so many great Sci- Fi classics, Ripley Scott, who definitely spent much more time than lots of us, thinking about humanity and the future of our species.10/10 for brutal honesty.",Alien - Covenant
1149,mr_coffee1026,And I really liked the Alien franchise,2,13 October 2018,"The computer animated aliens in this movie were laughably bad, worse even than alien3 which had a lot of technological limitations... appropriate use of costuming and prosthetics made the overall movie watchable, but this movie has no such redeeming qualities. There appeared to be some actual physical items used for the face-hugger sequences, but that scee was far too short. There also appeared to be a complete lack of consensus on the size that these creatures were supposed to be and so they seemed to be disproportionately sized to themselves from one frame to the next... seemingly to magically transform from the size of a soccer ball to the height of a human in a single camera pan. Any increase in effect resolution gained over the years was negated by that sort of nonsense which caused the alien to be very cartoon-like and not at all a threat. Hijacking bits of the original Alien soundtrack in an effort to elicit any feelings of nostalgia felt rather insulting. I have no interest in watching your computer-generated cartoon. The appeal of the original films was primarily how visceral and real they felt, the further you aim from that target, the worse of a result you manage to produce. I give 2 stars because the on board ship sets were well crafted and looked legit. Too bad, could have really made a great movie on sets like those.",Alien - Covenant
1150,David_wakenshaw,Morons in Space,5,21 July 2017,"The only saving grace about this film was Michael Fassbender, who does an excellent job playing David/Walter. So 3 stars are for him. The movie itself is just not believable. We are asked to believe that(the ships crew)these morons would pass any selection test, and be put in charge of a massively expensive colonization ship. The crew from Armageddon look competent in comparison.In fact you could walk into any pub on a Saturday night, and just pick random people, and you would have a more competent crew than the one in this film. The result of this was that I just did not care what happened to the crew, as they kept making irrational,and idiotic decisions.The other 2 stars I gave were for the CGI,and sets, though there was one explosion that looked like they had run out of money,and they had got some kid to do the effects on his home computer. The movie is very predictable in places, and there is nothing to make the viewer jump out of their skin. I hope the other Alien movies will be better written, with more believable characters. There are a lot of worse movies out there which is another reason I gave it a 5. But if you are an Alien fan you are going to watch it anyway. This is not a great movie, but if you have a few hours to spend there are worse things you could do with your time.",Alien - Covenant

It is not the first Alien (which nevertheless is incomparable) but a good new one in the series. Summary of the story Sir Ridley still rocks at 79 years!",Alien - Covenant
1153,robbieboy-90,Average,6,9 August 2017,"When I heard a new alien movie was being made i was happy to say the least. Then they released the trailer which made me lose any interest to go see the movie in theaters, it was one of the worst trailers i ever laid eyes on. Now that i've been able to watch the movie outside of theaters I must say, the movie was not as bad as I anticipated.I liked the main characters of Walter, Daniels, Oram and Tennesee. The rest of the characters, with the exception of David, could've just as easily been nameless bags of flesh. Demian Bichir was grossly underused here.Then there is the story of this movie, which was without a doubt the weakest part of the movie. The first part of the story takes place on the Covenant, a ship headed for a planet that is to be colonized. Needles to say something goes awry and the ships crew is rudely awakened from hypersleep. The crew takes it's first casualty and they stumble upon the alien planet. The crew decides to land on the planet to explore and at first all seems to be going well. Soon 2 of the crewmembers become infected by some strange spores and they give birth to our first aliens in this movie. This was actually the strongest part of the film and is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. After this strong opening the pace slows down a bit and the movie becomes much weaker and everything from here on felt really forced. Our group of humans are attacked by the aliens, they take some losses and are eventually saved by David, the android from prometheus. The next 45 minutes of this movie is purely exposition and makes both Aliens Covenant and Prometheus worse films.He takes them to a huge dead city within walking distance, which somehow went unnoticed when they flew over the planet. We find out David killed the entire planet and is now experimenting with the aliens. We see he has turned evil when he introduces the captain of the crew to the loving embrace of a facehugger. The remaining crewmembers find out David's gone haywire and attempt to escape. David and Walter have a showdown, it is left ambiguous as to who won the fight, but unless you're 10 years old and you've never seen a single movie in your life, you will probably know. This sets up the ''plot twist'' of the movie, which was completely unnecessary and made this movie worse. The crew manages to escape, but not before ''Walter'' joins them after his showdown with David. They return to the Covenant, which remained in orbit.This is where the movie starts to improve again. One of the crewmembers got infected, and now trouble is brewing on the ship. The rest of the meatbag characters are killed off in a minute or 2 and we are left with Daniels, Tennessee and ''Walter''. They manage to kill the alien in a very thrilling chase scene. They are put back into hypersleep by ''Walter'' but not before we find out our android ally is actually David, the evil android. Now David is in complete control of the ship and the aliens he smuggled aboard. This sets up the inevitable sequel in which David brings the party to earth or where ever the sequel takes place.In short. Watch the first 45 minutes and the last 30 minutes, skip the middle and you'll have a good time watching this. I hope that they completely cut out any and all creator bullshit in a possible sequel, it is without a doubt the weakest part of the movie. They should either make an alien movie or a ''creator'' movie like prometheus. Now these 2 concepts are forced together and both are worse off for it.",Alien - Covenant

Well, to keep it focused, Alien Covenant is a great film. It is not a perfect film, no film is. Alien (1979) comes close, actually, which is why we are here today discussing Alien Covenant in the first place.Alien Covenant moves the story along from Prometheus and advances the origin of the Xenomorphs while giving us visual eye candy along the way. The soundtrack recalls that of the original, mixed in with aural reminders of Prometheus and really ties the whole series together sonically. I just don't get why people are so universally bent against this film. If you are an Alien fan and a Prometheus fan, this film joins its brothers in telling the saga of man's encounter with alien life, in all its horrible glory.",Alien - Covenant
1157,Sir_Ulrich_Von_Lichtenstein,Alien/Aliens Fans Beware,6,5 June 2017,"If you are part of the crowd who really liked and appreciated the first and second installments of the Xenomorph saga, you should be careful going into this film.This feels much more like a horror/gore-driven film than its predecessors. Now, while tolerances should be made for those who are predisposed to excessive gore/violence and are fans of genres where those elements are to be expected, I feel like the creators of this addition really went not only for the jugular, but entire halves of people...sometimes most of their insides as well.As Chris Stuckmann recently explained, ""Alien"" was more suspense-driven and its closest sibling, ""Aliens"", an action-driven piece. Both of which are masterpieces. Some would argue that most of the subsequent sequels after that were...mediocre or lacking in some way. Mostly due to studio interference. However, this film is on a different course altogether. The two aforementioned pieces at least had some kind of resolve. A fearless heroine in the reluctant shape and form of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), along with relatively optimistic climaxes, all while leaving ample room for their successors to build their butchered story-lines on. 'Covenant is much more grim and hopeless.Lots of folks wanted more ""engineers"", more Xenomorphs and more ""answers"". Here, though, the narrative largely revolves around the android that's part of the crew (Walter), as well as the one from ""Prometheus"" (David) who had his head ripped off by an ""engineer"" who woke up in a bit of a grumpy haze.One thing that about this film that will really grab you by the face-hugger.........is the acting. Most of the characters are brought to life in an above-average manner by the skills doing the rounds amongst the cast. That is the thing that I feel deserves the most credit in this film. The characters and their reactions to their situations feel sincere and relatively realistic.In terms of creatures, there's two neo-Xenomorphs to go around (which felt more like demons than alien creatures...so to speak), along with one traditional Xenomorph that's given a complete CG treatment. As far as I could tell, there wasn't any scenes with the creatures where they weren't CG. It's done very well, so for those of you still lighting a candle every now-&- again for the catastrophe that was Alien Resurrection, rejoice! For there is...hope? Well...visually at least.The main (and only) antagonist has quite a bit of artificial hate going on inside him and the fact that he could have the desires and motives he does feels questionable when you think about it realistically. There are a few intense (in terms of atmosphere) scenes that flesh out the aspects of why he does what he does and we are, in fact, talking about a science fiction film, so logical realism is not supposed to hold one back here.Conclusion: Alien Covenant may be seen as what most people are speculating; a slightly better version of Prometheus. Notwithstanding the fact that it does actually pick up from where the latter film ended in the story and time-line. In my opinion, people complained about Prometheus more than what the few problems it had might have merited.Just know this...it's gruesome. Very gruesome. I'd say, more than any of its predecessors. The violence and gore in this film is what stuck with me for the most part. Which is sad in a way, considering the first two films didn't achieve their substance or exquisite suspense via excessive body-horror and violence. Those things were present, just not as concentrated. My friend and I both found ourselves averting our eyes too often for the sake of the next victim's innards being scattered across the floor.So. It doesn't have that good old flavour of the first two films, but I doubt anything will ever live up to them. Only time will tell. Perhaps James Cameron should helm a sequel...",Alien - Covenant

Covenant has the dumbest crew in the universe I think. They land on a new planet without helmets and protection. Of course, naturally some of them get infected. No story whatsoever! Only Aliens killing the crew members.Except for some, so many insignificant characters whose roles are too short and the viewers can't relate to. I feel like they just ruined a great material created in Prometheus. Please note that Prometheus has been rated 7 in 5 years while the rating for Alien: Covenant is 7 in 2 days, which says a lot about the movie itself. Its rating is going down every day.

Facepalm.Let's call for pick-up to get our sick individuals to the super important, expensive colonization ship immediately.

But IMHO, Prometheus deserves a real sequel, to flesh in what happened after the ship took off, and to link to what happened in this movie. This was an Alien movie, plain and simple. I found the first 20 minutes BORE-ING, but once the crew agreed to follow the rogue transmission to the new planet, things got interesting. Plenty of human-error and ""well, it seemed like a good idea at the time"", but I think that's what happens when actual people encounter the unknown and unexpected. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. Maybe I completely enjoyed this movie cuz all I'm looking for is to be entertained, but I really think it fit in well with all of the other Alien movies. Plenty of action and ""waiting for the other shoe to drop"" moments.I'm a hard-core sci-fi fan - I like everything from Edgar Rice Burroughs & Jules Verne to James P. Hogan and David Brin.

1165,justin-ismond,Fassbending - the movie,3,25 September 2017,"I saw this movie for free on a flight recently and I had been not really excited to see it after hearing the reviews. I am actually a big fan of the Alien series, but mostly due to the art of Giger and his alien designs. For me the main issue I have with this film is the lack of focus on the Aliens and making the cyborg/ synthetic human the main character of the film, as was similar in Prometheus. Fassbender's character gets extremely pretentious and annoying quickly from the stupid introduction of the film and it gets worse from there. The rest of the cast feels shallow and most are there as fodder / food for the aliens without much for the audience to connect to or care about. They stupidly walk into a series of increasingly bad choices and expectedly get killed without much of a ho hum from me. I would have loved to see a better character similar to Ripley or Hicks who can emerge as totally basass characters or just something relate-able. Here it feels like the only character the director cared about was Fassbender's. The whole good robot/ bad robot dichotomy just did not work for me at all and I was perplexed they couldn't be bothered to think of a better plot. So we get lame drawn out scenes of the robot guys (both are played by Fassbender) talking to each other and musing about art and music and boring crap that doesn't really belong in a film like this. To me the plot was trying too hard to explain that the aliens were created by David or something, which really ruined the mythos of the movies for me. From the first film, we get these mysterious clues to what the race of the 'space jockey' aliens may have been and that they encountered the dangerous xenomorphs - but now I guess the navigators were human type beings who ended up being infected by the black goop from the Prometheus movie and delivered by the cyborg David or whatever. Boring! Why did we have to explain away the origin of the Aliens? It would have been much more interesting to keep them as a force of nature, not something to be controlled and fathered and evolved from a juvenile plot twist. Last I have to harp on the look of the aliens. Again, what happened here? Seems like they wanted to move far away from Giger's designs and we get these very stupid looking aliens with smooth human-like skin and personality traits like having a cyborg dad that can command them (wtf?). Really the only thing I thought was kind of cool was the lab Fassbender's character had setup to test on previous crew members and experiment on alien species with some good artwork and creepy settings that I feel the movie needed way more of as a horror flick. Summary - bad plot focused on the wrong crap, they should have used an idea from the Alien comics series by Darkhorse where there is a wealth of better concepts and SOMETHING DIFFERENT, instead of trying to re-tell the same 'land on alien planet, unprepared' shtick with less likable characters.",Alien - Covenant

Giger work, I was waiting for this movie since Prometheus and unfortunately it was not good at all.** SMALL SPOILER AHEAD **How can a crew commanding a ship with 2000 people that is supposed to colonize another planet take so many bad decisions? Or better, ONLY bad decisions?!Quick example, how does the pilot (Tennessee) puts in risk the whole ship by getting close to the planet just to talk to his wife? How's even possible to override the ship's artificial ""intelligence""?I won't even bother mentioning the other silly actions from the crew but they look more like a bunch of amateurs whose actions are taking impulsively without any logic or any basic training. If they had put Peter Griffin to head the expedition no one would have noticed and it would be at least hilarious.All the characters are shallow and my impression is they were only there to serve as Alien meat.On the positive side, the shots are beautiful and immersive. The different aliens are pretty cool but nothing too scary or unpredictable. Oh, they grow really really fast, it is amazing!

1169,DreamHopeReality,Bad story-telling or bad production?,7,13 August 2017,"It's an enjoyable film but suffers from either bad story-telling or bad production:SPOILERS BELOWFrom the time David cut his hair, I felt that the filmmakers want to confuse us about the identities of David and Walter at some point. The fluke scene was probably a way for David to learn how Walter behaves.Fast-forward to the last fight between the two, however, it was obvious that Walter got out, not David: David had a deep puncture wound in his chin, but the one that got out didn't have that wound. At the same time, Walter had a cut to his left cheek, and the one that got out had the exact same cut.However, couldn't Walter heal himself? --- David can't, so if it was him he should have a wound in his chin, but Walter can and he should be healing over time.Some viewers may have the theory that David gained control of Walter but was unfamiliar with the software of the newer model. However, I think there is only one plausible explanation that is different:1. Why was this planet not discovered in the initial scanning? Probably because the company knew what was happening there.2. Why was there a blast right when they were next to the planet, and when their shields were deployed? Probably because Walter was in on it from the beginning.3. What was Walter doing by taking out an embryo at the beginning of the film, before the accident? Maybe he was making room for the ""new passengers"" to be picked up.Therefore, the whole Walter-David thing is perhaps a red herring: Walter is just a newer David, and his mission was the lead the team to the planet to pick up the old David's research. Walter is every bit of David as David is.But there is enough bad story-telling so that the viewers can never know --- that is, before seeing the next film.",Alien - Covenant

With Prometheus I could suspend believe in that regard and still enjoy the movie. But beyond the general stupid actions of the characters in this movie, the fact that they all constantly lose their sh**t in every situation was hard for me to look past. You'd assume they were chosen for their expertise, and trained to encounter crazy stuff since they are space travelling to establish a colony. But it's unclear how any of them are suited to the task, and they are just completely irrational. This is harder to get past then just the stupid actions of some characters in Prometheus.The movie is seems torn between being philosophical, and being a full on gore movie. It doesn't really work well on either level. Character development is really rushed.A strong point would obviously Michael Fassbender. If you have read any reviews of the movie, that will already be clear. and I really liked the space travel scenes (first 20 minutes was pretty cool). The sets on the planet were also great, along with some other scenes related to the planet. But from the moment they make the decision to go to the planet, the movie just turns into a complete mess.

Don't train them in any way or tell them to wear any kind of protective gear when exploring a new planet, don't even tell them to land the ship on solid ground, just let them put it down on a shallow body of water,don't teach them some basic weapon use and marksmanship,tell them it's OK to roam free on any alien world and poke any new organism they encounter on their way,let them improvise what to do in a quarantine situation and obviously make them believe it's OK to go on-board the mother ship again after being exposed to a confirmed lethal organism without any kind of precaution, those things will obviously make your colonizing mission success.To keep it short, I was impressed with how terrible this movie was compared to Prometheus, it just throws logic out the window and it's the equivalent of a drugged teenager jumping out of the window of a 5th floor claiming he can fly just because he once saw someone did it in a similar fashion.If you are a fan of the Xenomorphs don't expect any re-vindication of the franchise, just do as we all do, watch the movie to quench your curiosity and then deny it's existence.

1177,HorrorBrainShane,More a sequel to Prometheus than anything else,5,20 September 2017,"Compared to the previous films in the Alien franchise, this film sits right in the middle in terms of quality. Whereas the first two films were masterpieces, Alien 3 was a hodge-podge of decent ideas flushed into oblivion by the production team. Alien Resurrection and the AvP films turned the franchise into schlock b-movie territory, and Prometheus tried to fix that by being obtuse, confusing, and pretentious. Suffice it so say, Alien: Covenant is the best film in the franchise since the second film came out in 1986. But it's still only a slightly above average movie thanks to it's connection to the previous film.Prometheus was not a very fun film. It was all the worst plotting of the TV show ""Lost"" combined with an awful script worthy of the Asylum. Alien: Covenant is a direct sequel to Prometheus and has the unenviable task of making sure that the lose ends were tied up and that everything tied together to the original films. Not an easy task, but Alien: Covenant doesn't bungle everything and makes sure to be at least entertaining for a good portion of the runtime. Yet, it's got a very ""Star Wars"" prequel feel to it at times. The thought enters your mind that Ridley Scott is trying too hard to expand his most successful franchise in ways that seem to betray what made them so good to begin with.Though the cast is mostly good, the film's story goes back and forth between them without much balance, and the characters we're left with in the end aren't as fleshed out as they should be. Not only that, but the answers and secrets revealed during the film seem to be too much- instead of offering no answers like Prometheus, it answers all the questions and ruins a bit of the mystery, mystique, and most of all scariness of the franchise. That doesn't mean it doesn't have its moments- it does, and it has some really good gross-out moments that get you right where they should. That being said, the film relies too much on past plot elements from previous films to stand out.In the end, the editing, cinematography, and effects are top-notch. It's well made but somewhat unaffecting unless one is a mega-fan of the franchise. Perhaps it's better than the past few entries, but is merely decent when compared to other recent, similar films. It just doesn't stand out or do much for anyone that isn't dedicated to the series.",Alien - Covenant
1178,jasonmiller19771977,Different type of Alien movie and that's a good thing,10,19 May 2017,"I just finished watching A.C And let me start with it was very good. Not great but good. I read a lot of reviews before going to see it and expected to dis-like it. Reviews saying things like ""Boring"" And how the crew are idiots. Now I will admit there are some really dumb actions taken but not enough to make the movie terrible. If people were expecting a ton of Aliens just coming out the wood work, you will be a little disappointed. Not to say that the newest Aliens are a push over. They may be more vicious then the original Xenomorph. Here is the plot with a couple of small SPOILERS. SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT So you know the basic plot from the trailers alone. She lands on planet hoping is more livable then the planet they were heading for originally to populate it with 2000 colonists plus crew. So they land and are infected with a new type of Alien which viciously kills anything that movies and is very good at it. The real story of course is weres the people that sent a distress call. But all they find is David and all the engineers dead. What makes the movie great is how David has created life and made the Aliens more than just coming from a face hugger. His programming has made him more human and sees the human race as weak and unworthy of living when he has an organism that is suppuier in every way to man. In short its a great story that really puts the Alien franchise back on track. So the crew ends up trying to survive the Xenomorphs and David who has been manipulating crew members to be in unexpected danger. The movie is high on gore and fast paced ending.

Whereas Prometheus was eerie, perplexing and hair-raising, ""Covenant"" is dark, blunt and gut-turning. Many questions are answered here and not too many questions are raised. A pessimistic film, but tinged with the rejuvenating force of a rare acknowledgement or understanding of the tortuous, both inner and outer, reality that we inhabit.Somewhere I read a negative critique of the film's old familiar narrative patterns. I completely disagree that this is a sign of creative tiredness: the eternal recurrence of the classic Alien motives (the crew drinking coffee in the ship, the ""foolish"" entering into hostile and unknown terrain, etc.) is a consciously reenacted ritual and is in fact a testament of Riddley Scott's ingenuity and mastery over his craft.

Prometheus had a beautiful concept, a glaring hope and a philosophy that descended into the deepest depths of human conscience. This movie is a complete and utter destruction of Prometheus and its philosophy. Even the ending, bland and predictable. The story-line vicious and bitter; the characters poorly illustrated; graphics much worse than previous movies. You can't form a bond or in any way relate to any character in the whole movie like you could with Dr. Elizabeth Shaw in the Prometheus. Not much justice done to the genre too. A spit on the face of what horror movies aspire too, on the emotions and fear they aim to generate; an affront to the thrillers as the whole movie is largely predictable and there's not a single ounce of the element of surprise; and a great disrespect to Sci-Fi for the lack of science and inspiring fiction.

1187,steelersckc,Terrifying and Spectacular,9,30 May 2017,"Alien Convenant is a movie that does great with themes and concepts that Ridley Scott has tried to introduce into the franchise starting with Prometheus. There's a concept of life, death and recreation intertwined with the morality of man. It actually amazes me with the reviews that have one star because they didn't like the acting. Its as though we had Oscar winning performances with the first four... It shows the lack of depth our new science fiction fans have. With that type of mindset one could say Blade Runner and Total Recall were stupid because the acting was junk... it was junk... however, the concepts of the film were spectacular. This film... spectacular. The opening scene really brings the viewer into the film really quickly. A key character dies and quickly introduces this concept of despair and hope. Instead of viewing and judging the characters as stupid one should really view this idea of despair and hope and the flaws of the human condition. How quickly we as humans get demoralized when we see death or despair and the irrational actions we take as result. As result, our colony sees a planet due to a transmission character of a Shaw singing. Hope. However, when the ship sends an expedition to explore the planet they meet despair in the form of David. David is an interesting character because he represents the ultimate despair of the human condition. This is revealed when Walter, another robot designed in his image is shown to have less ""human"" characteristics then David. Walter explains how David's old prototypes scared the humans. We also see snips of David's past in which he see's how flawed humans are. At the same time, after you take a few moments to view Mr. Weyland, and Shaw, and even Daniels' concepts of what they want in life, you will see that David's motivations are actually very human... though disturbing. David wants to live forever... he wants to create life... and even wants a home... One can take some time to view the stupidity of the characters throughout the film or one can actually see how connected these characters actually are. They pretty much are a family if you think about how they all have their couples with them. This is their family. It can definitely explain the irrationality that happens throughout the film. The captain goes to a planet and breaks protocol because many people's pods blew up. How many people in real life make irrational decisions because someone died? The pilot decides to go to the planet as a rescue after he finds out his wife just died. At the same time we have a warped personification of a human being in David. In a sense he is irony of the human condition. As such the representation of the crew's death almost feels like humanity killing itself. This motif is also illustrated when David flashes back to killing the original inhabitants of the planet. The death they suffered... belonged to them. And you will understand what I mean by that when you see what actually killed them. The concept of how mortal beings are self destructive even though they can achieve great things. I think another thing that I actually think people hated in the film is this idea that something can defeat the human intellect. The crew was manipulated throughout the entire movie and really the only reason why we can tell is because we know David from Prometheus and we know this is a horror movie. I think a lot of viewers are afraid that our intellectual concepts can actually be our undoing. And David really represents that. David is our creation in a sense. His knowledge of science far surpasses our own and yet it is so twisted.",Alien - Covenant

In my narrow minded head I somehow think, that astronauts, spaceflight pilots, scientists and crew members of a colonization project would get some kind of military training, about how to act and react on a professional level in certain ""critical"" situations.

1189,joeldowler,A reasonably entertaining Alien horror flick,6,3 June 2017,"It wasn't perfect but neither did it disappoint.Alien Covenant had features that were quite similar to alien films in the past maybe so that older audiences weren't disappointed, but lacked any new original ideas and it just felt a bit like Déjà vu for vast quantities of the movie. It was sometimes slow-paced (the conversations went on too long and would take 10 minutes while the crew tried to navigate through a storm, 'yawn') and generally lacked a certain flair which at times left the audience somewhat disengaged. Broad parts of the movie was filmed in dimly lit caves and I would have liked to see some different settings from time to time but overall it was reasonably enjoyable and some scenes were quite scary and tense like in other past Alien Movies which was good. The plot was fairly intriguing and worked well in explaining how the creatures came about but the ideas were a bit hashed and didn't fully come together which left the audience not seeing the whole picture.On a more positive note I think that Ridley Scott is very good at making his movies look good visually and on designing the set and Alien Covenant was no exception as the movie was visually stunning with some really good shots of the planet throughout the movie which added to its overall elegance. Also Michael Fassbinder's double role as good robot and bad robot was amazing and he put in a 'Oscar winning performance' which is worthy of recognition.To conclude it depends on what you came into this movie for. If it was a new original Alien movie which answered all the questions from Prometheus and had innovative ideas then you may be left a bit disappointed as it was a bit same old same old, the twist was obvious and while it did offer some intriguing insight into how the creatures came about(which was cleverly done and worked well)and you could see where they were coming from it ended with the audience not fully satisfied with maybe wanting, and expecting, another film. Whereas if you wanted a scary, gory and reasonably entertaining Alien film to watch and enjoy with your mates, or to take you down memory lane to reacquaint yourself with Alien then you certainly won't be disappointed.Overall it was a just a bit 'meh' 6.4 out of 10",Alien - Covenant

I wanted so much to go to that unexplored territory that the first Alien brought to the screen.

Its the same old story repeated once again, but this time with a colonization ship with 2000 colonists and hundreds of human embryos in cold storage as the crew comes out of cryo an unknown signal calls from an unknown planet and the wimpy ""replacement captain"" wants to check it out against the better judgment of his next in command. (does this sound familiar?) It picks up where Prometheus left off but somewhere along the time line between the two movies Ridley Scott's internet comment about the next picture having no Xenormorphs (aliens) apparently was quashed by the studio who must have insisted on alien monsters to keep the supposedly muddled masses of movie goers happy. Unfortunately, I have seen more creative story lines in Muppet movies and better acting in high school plays. Eventually the original David, our beloved synthetic human from Prometheus, shows up to confront the new David made specifically for this mission, but he has gone bad and gone on a murderous rampage and now wants to ""eliminate"" all humans because we are a ""dying race"" and need to be replaced with something more like David? The only good thing about this film is the beautiful location shooting particularly in New Zealand and Australia.

1203,linguistHP,"Is this the dumbest movie ever, or what?",1,13 September 2020,"I quit watching this movie a little over halfway through, and do not regret that decision. Although I loved BLADE RUNNER, I saw weaknesses in Ridley Scott's grasp of storytelling even in that early effort.In particular, amongst other weaknesses, he does not understand suspense, which Alfred Hitchcock described as the ""art of the known."" In suspense, the skillful storyteller reveals the danger to the audience (""the known""), but withholds that knowledge from the character(s), then puts the character(s) in proximity of the danger. In this scenario, seeing the blithely unaware character(s) putting themselves at risk in proximity of the danger places the audience on the edge of their seats. Scott habitually fails to show the danger to the audience in advance of placing his characters in proximity of it.Although ALIEN was a smart, far more effective movie -- certainly because of the script -- Scott failed to build suspense in that film in scenes where he could have done so. As a result, he had the alien popping out of places unexpectedly when he could have shown the audience where the alien was hiding and more effectively built suspense by having his characters unknowingly place themselves in proximity thereof.But back to ALIEN: COVENANT: This movie struck me as the dumbest film I had seen in decades.

The Good: Cinematography, sound track, sound, actors. The Bad: Direction, Script, plot, editing.My main beef is with Ridley Scott. He's 79 and still trying to re- capture the originality and feel of a movie franchise he had the benefit of kicking off in 1979. In attempting to inter-mingle stereotypical horror tropes and unfathomably stupid character decisions into a convoluted species origin story, he's missed a perfect opportunity to create something original. Instead he's managed only to combine all the worst elements of it's predecessors into a grab bag of the mundane. On it's own it's a passable yet confusing long winded horror flick.

I am starting to dread ""Blade Runner 2049"".As for ""Alien: Covenant"" the only good thing is the storyline around David/Walter, not just in the performance by Fassbender but in the writing itself. Every other character was a carbon copy of a 'type' frequently seen in disaster/horror films. The primary difference was the dumbing down of these characters to grade school level. Within the plot of the the movie someone spent a lot of money to build a spaceship and send it on its way to a distant planet. You would think they would train and send along crew members capable of actually making smart decisions to get the ship to its destination.

1212,krakonoff1,Disappointing,6,29 May 2018,This review contains spoilers.Alien: Covenant is the indirect sequel to Prometheus. It tells the story of a crew that discovers the Engineer's homeworld.Alien: Covenant is incredibly disappointing. It seemed that the writers disregarded all feedback regarding Prometheus and wrote a story driven by stupidity. The characters do many illogical things that break their own character's beliefs. Almost every scene is driven by characters being oblivious or willfully ignorant of the situation and past. It is for this reason this movie cannot be recommended.,Alien - Covenant
1213,fahnenjoker,"Uneven, unscary Prometheus-Alien-Hybrid with a lot of issues.",6,7 July 2017,"Alien Covenant starts quite promising. It's very reminiscent of the original Alien (1979) movie (in a good way), while also including the cinematography and wide landscape shots of Prometheus. The sets look awesome, feel real and believable and are a nice mix between the run-down industrial look of Alien and the top-of-the-line high-tech aesthetics of Prometheus. Another great thing is the soundtrack. It immediately manages to evoke memories by incorporating themes from the original Alien movie and Prometheus, while also adding something new and unique of its own. In the first (and best) third of the movie there is tension and curiosity and some intense action scenes full of suspense (that will never be achieved again for the rest of the movie). But then it goes awry.Shortly after meeting David, the movie starts explaining things no one asked about. What is revealed about David and the Xenomorphs simply demystifies these horror-icons! And while certain parts are overexplained, other questions, still lingering from Prometheus, are left unanswered. The movie should have been (as originally planned) about David, Elizabeth Shaw and the Engineers, not some random colonists with no character (or brain)! This just feels like a filler episode before (or after) the really interesting story. Prometheus had its flaws, but it felt original and was pursuing its own story, somewhat independent from the Xenomorphs. The big question of where we come from made for a strong motivation. It was not really a horror movie, but more an exploration story gone wrong. I enjoyed it for that. Yes, some of the characters did one or several stupid things that eventually got them killed, but David and Elizabeth Shaw were interesting characters I was willing to care for and curious how their journey would continue.And then there is another sin I cannot forgive Covenant. It repeats what I and many other viewers disliked immensely about Alien 3 (1992): Killing off characters we cared about from the previous movie off-screen in between movies! And in exchange we get a crew of two-dimensional cliché characters that seem even more idiotic than the Prometheus crew and whose inevitable deaths feel utterly meaningless. The big exception, of course, is Michael Fassbender (David/Walter), who, together with Noomi Rapace (Elizabeth Shaw), had also been the best part of Prometheus. Fassbender owns every scene he's in and those are the best moments of Covenant. He manages to differentiate between the two androids convincingly and creates the only two really interesting characters in the movie. Katherine Waterston does a decent job as Daniels, but she and the rest of the humans just feel like side characters, while the real focus is on the androids.These fine performances by Fassbender make the rest of the movie look even more soulless and derivative. It's sadly ironic, that the scenes the classical Xenomorph is in (the last third of the movie) feel like the most boring scenes of the whole movie. It's just the plot of Alien (1979) again, told in 20 minutes and without any horror. It seems like Ridley Scott felt some pressure to include the Xenomorph, so he stuffed some lackluster repetition of his old work into the end of the movie (however, forgetting how to actually make the Alien scary), to please FOX and ""the fans"" (who apparently complained about Prometheus) in order to tell his story about David. But Prometheus flaws had not been having not enough Xenomorphs in it (but rather a sloppy script).Why Scott did not make a true ""Prometheus 2: Paradise"" about Shaw and David exploring the Engineers and at the same time give Neil Blomkamp and Sigourney Weaver the chance to bring closure to Ripley and the Xenomorphs in ""Alien 5"" I cannot understand. What did we get instead? A hybrid movie that tries to be both, a Prometheus sequel and an Alien prequel, ending up doing neither work justice. On its own, it's not really a bad movie, just mediocre. But as one with ""Alien"" in the title, being advertised as a frightening, back to the roots horror story (which it is not, it's never scary) and as a sequel to Prometheus, it simply disappoints. I'm not even sure what to wish for now. Should Scott be allowed to do another sequel to maybe, finally answer the questions he asked about the Engineers in Prometheus (would he though?) and finish David's story? Or should he be shut down and another director (maybe Blomkamp after all? Alien 5? Please?) be given the chance to do something else with the Alien franchise?",Alien - Covenant

As the tale of David unfolded in front of me I gasped and remembered the original Alien transmission, how could Muthur possibly identify part of it..... unless.....! I'd love to write reams about the ""creator-destroyer-creator"" theme that most people won't even think about when they watch Alien Covenant but it would give too much away.

It doesn't even try to give a nod to believable characters or legitimate science / sci-fi. The 'twist' is only possible because of an edit/cut that is incongruous with the rest of the film.

A lot of reviewers are nitpicking details that they don't get or they forget that it's a Hollywood movie. I recommend reviewing Prometheus again or watching a short video summary of it before seeing this. Remember that this planet was the planet David and Shaw were headed for. Yes, the crew make many bad decisions, but you can see from the very beginning that they really had no experience nor qualifications - maybe that's why they were chosen. But I actually enjoyed the characters' personalities - they actually have some. There's nothing worse than character-less characters. It's interesting to see how David has continued his downward spiral - remember the first Alien, too? The scenery and effects are breathtaking.

At first blush one could construe the title as somewhat arbitrary however it appears that this entry seems to settle where the franchise has gone to creating a universe that is abstract as it is metaphysical.Harken back to what is to recently ""be believed"" and in review of 'Covenant' it appears that the message of life itself and that of it's creator has ""no soul.""

1219,steamboatwillie1928,Spoilers Included,6,8 June 2017,"I really wanted to like this entry in the Alien franchise. The predecessors had been well done, even Prometheus, which, while I was not knocked out by it, appreciated what it brought to the franchise. I was however, mostly disappointed wit this entry.This entry was slow and I mean very slow. It felt like we were watching any another Sci-Fi film, instead of an 'Alien' film. Even Alien 3, which ran slowly, seems like a sprint in comparison to Covenant.Casting was unusual. Academy Award nominated actor, James Franco, has three lines and dies in the first 10 minutes of the film. Carmen Ejogo and Jussie Smollett are mostly wasted. Billy Crudup came across as whiny. The three bright spots were Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston and, very surprising to me, Danny McBride. All three did a great job with their roles and with the scripts put in front of them. I have never been a big fan of Danny Mcbride, but he really did a great job with the role and I found his performance to be quite good.Leading up to the premiere of Covenant, this is the film that was supposed to tie Prometheus to the earlier franchise entries and ""answer all of our questions"". It does not deliver, at least to the last part of that promise. There is already another entry slated for 2019. The producers over-promised, under-delivered and pulled a last minute fast one. They did not explain many of the unanswered questions for that matter.The biggest disappointment was the genesis of the xenomorphs. Through all of the predecessors to this film, we were lead to believe that when the aliens blended with another creature, the two DNAs led to a new hybrid. This entry tells us it was all David's fault. Bad, bad David. What a sad revelation and an even sadder way to tie up the mythos behind the franchise. David, like all of the androids in the series (with the exception, of Call in Alien Resurrection) have been bad to some degree.

I hoped this movie will continue the good work in Prometheus and answer questions that was left unanswered.Unfortunately without spoiling the movie, it was terrible. Ridley Scott ruined the lore by changing his mind about the origin of Aliens. He tried to do something of a hybrid of classic aliens and Prometheus and he failed at both.The horror scenes was very weak and not entertaining at all, in fact you've seen all in the trailer.. There was no mystery, no suspension, you do not care for the characters who seems to be incredibly stupid. The science is also very weak with tone of major plot holes.The sharp twist from Prometheus is obvious and everything that was interesting in Prometheus is scraped and you get very boring not a horror worthy movie which is worse then AvP.Actors do their job good as much as possible but the script doesn't make us care for them at all or let them shine in any way. Scenes are also made beautifully but that's it.I won't go into details of everything wrong with the movie, because i have to write a novel.

1222,jckandersen-139-688098,"A Controversial ""origin""",8,1 June 2017,"Warning: Spoilers are present here! With Prometheus as the prequel to ""Prometheus 2"" - Alien Covenant, I went to the cinema knowing that Scott fuses Prometheus with Alien (79')The story reminds somewhat of Alien: A spaceship, encounters a transmission in space - it's investigated and all hell breaks loose. What differs is the overall tone - that's more in line with Prometheus, but far more gory, philosophical and ominous. Building on top of David from Prometheus - he, now seeing himself as a god - is experimenting with ""Creation"" - in order to create ""The Perfect Organism"". Ridley Scott is on top of his game... The visuals are a tour-DE- force and one particular scene where the black goo runs amok - is haunting. It screams: ""Hell unleashed"". The movie is a grotesque (Frankenstein) vision, it's gory, gruesome and dare I say - the new creature (Neomorph) is gut wrenching, from birth! The real highlight here is Michael Fassbender!!! I could go on - AND ON, about his talent. Playing two androids - he is outstanding in every way - and this might just be his best acting to date. Subtle details in his posture, eyes - the difference between Walter and David is an achievement of huge proportions. This is HIS movie!The general dynamic between the actors is not on pair with Alien - far from.. Some of it seems a little off. Oram (Crudup), the religious character never convinced me, and he was more annoying than interesting.Daniels (Waterson), the female protagonist - human and fragile, does a fair job, but we're far from the Ripley character. Tennesse (McBride) stands out very well! And he has some of the best moments in the supporting cast. His relationship with his wife stands out clearly and we actually care for him.Had the crew member count been smaller, it just might had been better overall... This to me is the weakest point of the movie - the lack of character development. A shame, considering how Fassbender nails every single scene.... He overshadows all! This movie, will divide the tie, though. Ridley Scott rewrites the origin of the Alien creature - and for fans of ""Aliens"", this might make them turn away from the universe. This is Scotts universe - his take on the universe seems (to me anyway) far more sinister. This movie presents a monster, in human form. Far more frightening than any Alien monster would ever be able to. We know human form, we can reflect ourselves in David - and his plans, and past doings are perverted towards life in every way. The movie strikes a weird erotic tone.. Again Fassbender presents this in a way never seen before. What if Androids did have sexual arousal without being able to fulfill that need? Is this trait not confined to human beings? I've always been more a fan of Alien, than of Aliens.. Alien presented horror and fear of the unknown. Aliens made the Alien to an insect like being.. Scott rolls back this - demystifies it, and presents it again: As The Perfect organism - conceived by a deranged ""mind"".Don't expect a new ""Alien"" or ""Aliens""... but a mix of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde, philosophical gore story presented with outstanding images! 8/10 (-1, character development), (-1, the last act, was hardly needed, and was basically fan-catering)I can't wait to see what doom awaits...Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair !",Alien - Covenant

Character development is almost non existent, with the vast majority of people there simply to die. Danny Mcbride might as well have had a leash on him, for all the acting he was allowed to do, and James Franco showed more charisma than anyone else in the movie...and he died before even having a speaking role.The film has gone down this ancient feel/setting, which didn't work in AVP, or Prometheus, and just flat out bores to death in this film. And the ""twist"" at the end was so obvious that there was an audible ""DUH"" and ""NO SH*T"" from onlookers in the cinema during the reveal.Ridley Scott's last two films have led me to believe a couple of things.1. He can't do jack without a GREAT script 2. His movies look good, but are boring as hell 3. Alien was a fluke! It was a mess of ideas that all came together and somehow worked, but that was by accident and not design...or at least not by Scott's design.Unless Cameron, or possibly Blomkamp (hell even give David Fincher another go) get involved, or perhaps someone equally as talented, we're just going to see Ridley Scott spew his old man, self indulgent philosophical man juice all over our faces for the foreseeable future It was an OK by film standards...but by an Alien film standards it was pure muck.And a final note.

This story was cut and paste from pieces of past Alien movies. Set pieces, locations and characters were also cut and paste from past alien movies. One scene came from an old sf horror flick and was copied from that movie. You can see the plot twists coming from light-years away. Every thing was sugar coated in in CGI and looked fantastic, but the creatures looked a bit to CGI in my opinion. Really Ridley, why?I really was not interested in this rehash of former alien and non alien movies, but more what happened to Shaw & David.Yes, a movie about that would have been interesting .Its Time for Mister Scott to let go, really let go and give new creative minds a chance to expand this universe he laid down the groundwork for.",Alien - Covenant

One of the few interesting movies in a long time, because it doesn't just do exactly what you want it to, and doesn't compromise to make it more appealing to today's audiences. It feels like Ridley Scott was able to direct without any comments from the studio. This movie will make one think about creation in the world of Alien.

1232,haddonfield04,Where is Neil Blombkamp when you need him?,1,30 June 2017,"Originally, this film was supposed to be an entirely different script, with an entirely different writer and director. There's only 2 or 3 people in all of Hollywood that can pull off this film correctly. The one who had a script already written was Neil Blombkamp and from those who read it, they said it was amazing. No surprise. Blombkamp did Elysium and District 9. Both well respected films. But we can't shoot down Ridley Scott. Afterall, he created this monster. But I haven't liked his newer films to the series. Although this was better than Prometheus, what was McBride doing in the film and writing the film? He's a comedian.....Ummmm, no... Wrong cast overall was my first problem with it. The film just didn't pull off the scares that Ridley claimed was similar to the original. Well it wasn't. Not nearly as scary. Neve Campbell would've been perfect to play the part of Ripley's mother. I know a lot of you are saying, ""are you kidding?"" But seriously. Have you ever seen her scared look in her eyes in the film Scream? She's extremely convincing. So much so in fact, that she scares you when her character gets scared. Just look at her eyes. If you haven't seen Scream, then go watch it. Neil Blomkamp wanted to make a sequel to Aliens. He even showed James Cameron his script, and Cameron said it was amazing. Now if Cameron is saying that (whose a perfectionist), then you know it would've been a good film. Blomkamp should be the only one continuing this series. Not Ridley Scott. He is definitely meant to do Bladerunner. But I don't think he should be continuing Prometheus, Alien Covenant, etc. And where in God's name is the composer... That's the heart of the scares and the terror. There was absolutely no orchestra performing a scary score to this movie. And if there was, damn if I heard it. Get a composer who will take 2 months to write a musical score that will scare the living daylights out of fans of the series. This film had a much lower budget than the others, it was rushed with a short filming schedule, and slapped together in a short period of time. They're lucky it wasn't a lot worse. Either bring back James Cameron, or let Neil Blomkamp take over....please.....Coming from a die hard fan, I've spoken to many other fans who agree with me. Give him a chance.

You'll have to watch Prometheus to understand a lot of the scenes. Most part of the movie are predictable and clichéd. Something wrong happened, people react to it wrongly or make a series of mistakes. Then they die horribly to the killing monsters. That sums up all Alien movie. There isn't any surprises. The characters pretty much have DEAD written on their faces. And the crew make very unprofessional and emotion-driven decisions. It can get annoying to watch some of those. On the other hand, the visuals are great and it was shot beautifully. If there is more thoughts into the main conflict and climax to make it fresh and unpredictable.

Throw that out the window and let's just take sniveling, weak characters and some CGI and try to loosely tie together 2 other movies with a weak plot. Yeah. Great idea, Sir Ridley. I am catching the next shuttle to Mars and making an appointment with Rekall, Inc., to have any memory of this movie forever erased from my head. There are several major issues with this film:-There is no strong protagonist. After the bumbling captain (Billy Crudup) is killed off, the teary- eyed, whiny and weak Daniels takes over (if you call it that). All of the human characters are weak, stupid, insubordinate, or a mix of all 4 and are constantly crying. You will never like any of these people. -A weak story and plot. Wrong planet, wrong premise, and incorrect segue into what will be the original Alien movie. No explanation needed. -Don't morph the alien. We don't breathe in the alien from spores. There are not 50 different variations of this alien. We are too confused and dumbfounded by this plot to fake interest in new and unexciting variations of the alien. This whole movie is a mess from beginning to end. Why in the world would Scott wreck such a beautiful concept? True horror is simple, unseen, and magnificent. It is clear that Ridley has sold out to the big studios and has been forced to pollute this franchise with Avenger-esque flash and fury because we are not allowed to think and imagine anymore.

Based on reading a few extremely negative reviews, I was expecting a mediocre film, with poor acting, a horrible story line, etc. - and ended up quite liking this film. My two sentence review: Alien Covenant doesn't have the horror, and tension building elements of the original Alien(s) (closer to Prometheus' overall tension in that regard), although it certainly creates an eerie and mysterious environment. However, the story is gripping, especially if you enjoy the mysteries that came along with Prometheus and Alien in general, and I would not suggest skipping this one unless you thoroughly hated everything about Prometheus. I saw no flaw with the acting, and to list every little thing I would personally change (or deleted scene I'd add), is pointless, and arrogant/ultimately insulting to Scott and everyone who made the movie. If you enjoyed Prometheus - watch it. If you don't care about Engineers, Prometheus, where Aliens come from, and any such questions - if you only want a horror movie like the original Alien, then perhaps skip this (and re-watch the original Alien(s)). To be honest, for anyone who's seen the first two Aliens enough to remember a few meme- ish quotes - I'm not sure what variation or new movie/take ANYONE could come up with, that would feel ""new"". Any variation would simply feel like a ""The Forc.."" I mean ""The Aliens Awaken"" rehash of the original, which is why by now I'm probably more invested in the overall narrative of Scott's universe, more so than expecting the ""most horrifying experience"".

With Covenant there were times I was on the edge of my seat as I was was with the first so that says it all really. If a movie can make me tense then its a success in my book.

I won't bore you with detailed critiques of plot, story, characters, etc. I'll just say that if I didn't love the Alien franchise so much, I would have walked out of the theatre as soon as James Franco was burnt to a crisp.It's like Ridley had the beginning and end of the movie and just threw in the easiest plot twists and character archetypes while suspending logic and common sense in order to push out this failing effort.The list of ""are you serious"" moments is too long to put here. Needless to say any self respecting Alien fan is going to spend most of the movie wondering and muttering ""why"" through most of it. Here is a brief list of my top ""why's""1. Why does the crew consist of married couples? 2. Why is the ship not designed for or have protocols in place for cosmic events3. Why would anyone put Oram as second in command?4. Why do they explore an uncharted planet without environment suits yet they carry weapons? 5. Why would you trust David once you see him ""conversing"" with the creature that just killed and ate your crew-mate?6. Why did I waste my money and time on this movie? That's the short list of ""why's"".

Apart from the beginning which was just about OK, the ship, the crew waking up, fixing the ship. From when they landed on the planet it was all quite rushed right through to the ending. Non of the characters stood out. The neomorph birth and attack scene was well done, gruesome and frightening. The xenomorph effects are nearly all CGI. The editing is really poor, I could hardly tell what was going on in any of the action sequences. Except the neomorph birth and first attack scene. The birth of the xenomorph in my opinion is dreadful. They've speeded up the time from egg implantation to chest burster. I'm sad because I'm a life long Alien fan. Seen the first 2 films over 100 times. The films score is really poor. Nothing memorable in it except for a few bits lifted out of the first Alien film. It's a really messy film. I don't think it knows what it wants to be. It's just a hodgepodge of all the other films ideas. The end scene with David is very chilling. But what's the point when the whole film is a let down. All the other Alien films (except the 2nd Alien vs Predator film) are more coherent and enjoyable than this. And that's saying something. The ending is rubbish. THEY BLOW IT OUT OF THE BLOODY AIR LOCK AGAIN, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!!!!! It has hardly any visual flair, which is a shame. Considering Ridley Scott directed it. Overall, I thought the film was dull, boring, a waste of talent and time. I even liked Prometheus more than this. In the end scene where did David get the things that come out of his mouth from?

Extremely disappointed that Ridley didn't do more practical stuff than he did in this bad boi but all is forgiven. The CGI itself was not the best thing ever and it would have been hard to do what the xenomorphs did with practical effects so there is the trade off there. The cinematography was pretty stellar, nothing special but better than average. The cast was great, I was surprised that Fassbender was in this, not having seen anything about it except the posters and highly anticipating it, the anticipation was well paid off too. This is a slow mover and that is one of the things that didn't work for me because when the horror/action pops up it is sudden and loud and not built up to well enough. Jump scares were prominent but they were as tasteful as you could make a jump scare. The gore effects were beautiful and all horror scenes were tremendously beautiful. The action/horror scenes with much gore were equally brilliant. Two thumbs up and hoping to give it the phat 10 on my next watch. There are some scenes that I think will end up as iconic ones, such as the shower scene and probably all the horror scenes.

The scene in which David teaches Walter how to play the flute is just superb! The way the camera's set, the continuous shots and the intimacy it creates to then jump to different shots to emphasize their difference just kills me, like the shallow focus used in some scenes.

When this movie gets into it the time flies by as there is so much going on. The scene with the two robots David & Walter together (both Fassbender) are extraordinarily written. the whole point Ridley Scott revived this franchise was to create more of a story to it with interesting questions which he has done brilliantly! cant wait for the next movie.

I grow so tired of these one star review by pretentious people using the thesaurus for every word greater than 4 characters in length. Characters in movies make dumb decisions. Unrealistic things happen. That's Hollywood and that's movies. If you want real life, go to work or school or do some housework for a dose of realism and sense.The negative reviews on this movie cite some of the most asinine reasons for their ratings. Most people said the movie was too predictable. This movie wasn't supposed to be some sort of mystery thriller. The writers weren't even trying to hide the things that reviewers pointed out as too obvious. In fact most of the things complained about were exposed as dead giveaways in the movie....not intended to be hidden at all. Try enjoying yourself at the theater instead of judging every scene cynically.I heard a lot of sniveling about the CGI effects as well. Yes, the movie was very CGI intensive. It was also in wonderfully high definition, vibrantly colored, and had a crispness and refreshing, beautiful feel to it. There were maybe two parts where I felt that the CGI could have been improved upon. The rest of the 95% of the CGI was not only acceptable; but I found it pretty impressive and quite disturbing in many scenes.All in all this was a really great movie. Both the wife and I really enjoyed it. We really enjoyed Prometheus as well though, so if you didn't like that movie you may not like this one. If you like action, aliens, technology, sci-fi, space travel then you will probably like this movie.

The crew of the ship decided to change to course to an unknown planet instead of the planet that the company has been studied for 20 years.

They did more with less back then, and now they do less with more these days. All in all it was quite a shameful and disappointing experience to watch this movie. I expected a lot more from Ridley Scott.Some of the Scifi nature shots were cool but they really didn't try hard enough to make it look like a truly alien planet.Oh, and it was basically a slaughter of all the human characters, there is no sense of suspense and tension building, just hopeless slaughter of characters that nobody cares about because they have no memorable lines or lovable features.

They receive a transmission from another planet that is seemingly better suited to support human life. As you may have expected, this does not go well.This movie is a triumphant return to form for the franchise. It is the same form of the original classic, with a crew in space hunted by an alien. With the exception of a few subplots, the story doesn't stray far from that description. But Ridley Scott directs it with the same sense of dread that made the original such a classic.It is full of graphic violence, but the real scares come from the aliens themselves. They are brought to life with terrifyingly realistic special effects, and their on screen presence is very menacing. I feel like they could have shown less of them, maybe having them lurk out of sight, but they were still scary when shown in all their glory.Alien: Covenant is significantly better than the previous outing, Prometheus, and an effectively creepy thriller. Though I am disappointed that it didn't continue the story of Prometheus, I am still glad we got another Alien movie that focuses on tension and atmosphere.jaythemovieguy.blogspot.com",Alien - Covenant
1256,jfkmart-96782,OMG SO AWFUL! This Alien:Covenant movie is a total failure,1,24 May 2017,"So first of all, I liked Prometheus's ""big ideas"" & thought the film was well crafted & quite engaging. There were a few flaws, like dumb characters doing stupid things, but for the most part, I liked Damon Lindelof's story..& was excited to see where Elizabeth Shaw & David landed. Well, if you saw The Crossing prologue (only released online) you don't need to watch Alien:Covenant. The prologue was the best part. Ridley Scott ruined yet another movie. Were you upset when they killed off Newt & Hicks during the credits sequence of Alien3? I sure was. Alien3 was awful, & I barely could finish it. This new film is almost as bad. I really liked Noomi Rapace's character & couldn't believe Ridley Scott was stupid enough to just kill her off, after all she went through in Prometheus. Ugh. As a matter of fact, I'm tired of writing a review for a movie I despise, so I'll just say this -- Ridley, if you're reading this..please retire. You're 80. Go sip cognac whilst sitting on your palatial estate in the English countryside.. remember the good old days, when you made awesome films; like Legend, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, & the 1979 Alien. Just retire, dude. I'm sorry to say, your scripts are dreadful now..& your time is over. RIP Elizabeth Shaw, you deserved a better sequel, sister ;(",Alien - Covenant
1257,jtyn,The Movie That Opened My Mind,2,9 June 2017,"Wow. I walked out of the theater in appreciation for Alien 3 and 4 so much that I increased 3's previous score of a 5 to a 6. And 4's 5 to a 7. (Man, I miss Whedon when he was not doing those trashy Marvel movies. And Jean Pierre Jeunet when he was not..what the heck is he even doing?) I miss Alien when it was just kick butt and full of suspense. I wanna see some chick shoot a Xenomorph with a six-barreled shotgun or a laser rifle, not see some synth martial arts or hear some basic philosophy that I began to hear much of in these recent years. Oh my God! The synths! They can think for themselves! Let's see...where have I heard something like that before? 2001: A Space Odyssey, Westworld, Blade Runner, Battlestar Galactica, Mass Effect (Hey, the plot for Prometheus was eerily similar to ME's!), Eva, Real Humans, The Machine, Ex Machina, that movie that came out right after Ex Machina or before, you forget because they're all the same, oh wait it was The Machine. The remake of Real Humans called Humans, The New Westworld, Kara, the game coming out based on Kara. And the beginning of it all, the book Do Andriods Dream of Electric Sheep? Yeah, Ridley Scott stated that it going to be more of horror and suspense like the first one. Hey Scottie, how about you lay off making unnecessary prequels and just retire to a nursing home. Everybody wants Alien 5 directed by Neill Blomkamp! Not another film by you! (God, I honestly hope he dies before he finishes Alien Craprequel 2.) The only little horror and suspense I felt was at the beginning. The spore Xenomorphs. Geez, hate for that to exist. And there's actually something like that that does exist! Stachybotrys or Aspergillosis, don't worry no Alien with pop out your spine! I would really hate for some sicko to experiment on that! But this leads to the question, why didn't the crew wear any protection for the planet they landed on? Sure it's ideal and Earth-like but they would take caution right? And hey! It's not like they're carrying thousands of people on their ship! Right? Wow! Even worse than Prometheus protocols, didn't think it was possible but here we are! Hopefully, we won't have idiots like them in our future! When the Earth is dying and the fate of humanity rests on their shoulders!Anyway, after that I fell down a rabbit hole of predictability. If you could just predict what they would say next, or know the events beforehand, are these movies just getting worse and worse? Or are you psychic? The movie kept repeating the same ""haunting"" tone in a Jason kinda way, whenever a Xenomorph appeared. It got annoying. Fast. There was a woman sitting next to me, and she was hysterical, more entertaining than the movie itself! She just kept mumbling, ""Is it over yet? This is just boring."" After that I think she said to her date or brother or dad or whatever that she was going to bathroom. She never came back! Haha! Poor man! He had to watch the rest of the movie! Oh a minute, that's what I did too, what we all did...ah shame. I mean, I tried to like this movie. I even tried focusing on Ridley Scott's directing style, how he would always have a blurred inanimate object in the middle, how his characters would never be in the middle while they talked, always on the left and right. But holy crap then I noticed, not only is the movie boring but so is the cinematography work. It's amateurish, low budget-styled, slow, very slow, this movie felt longer than Cleopatra (1963). And the script was just pretentious, blah blah piano, classical music, existentialism, don't have to make much sense, leave people in confusion, high score on Rotten Tomatoes is all we need. There was nothing special about it. There is nothing special about this movie. It really got me thinking, what if Wes Anderson directed an Alien movie? What if Nicolas Winding Refn directed one? At least it would be entertaining. The CGI work is nice, not if you think of how the Xenomorphs were made in all the previous Aliens! These days it's put up a green screen and call it a day. Nice work guys! You all put the legendary H.R Giger to shame!",Alien - Covenant
1258,BorisUlianov,I consider this and Prometheus non-canon,2,2 February 2020,"I despise these last two movies so much, I'm considering them as non-canon. In fact, anything beyond the first two movies should be erased, destroyed, buried deep inside Chernobyl reactor, or send straight to the Sun. Even then, we'll have to wait for years before the sour memories of these abominations will finally be lost foverer.I watched the first two movies when I was young; by the time Alien³ appeared, I was 11, and that was my first disappointment with the saga. But both Prometheus and this movie are the last nails on the coffin for the story.There's nothing to rescue from the prequels; everything was awfully done, and it feels like a cashgrab, like Scott only wanted to squeeze money out of his own idea.In my honest opinion, both movies deserve the lowest rating possible, and a place along the worst movies ever done. Damn, even The Room is more bearable than these two last pieces of awfulness.",Alien - Covenant
1259,henriquevieiraprata,Ridiculous movie,1,26 May 2017,"First of all, there is absolute 0 sci-fi in this movie, its just cheap fantasy that doesn't even bother to make sense! Who had the brilliant idea to compromise billions of dollars in investment, thousands of lives and a stupid barely trained crew by making all of them have emotional bonds?!?!?!?!?! That is simply something basic in any vessel or mission of whatever reason and nature! The only sane character is the android!!!!! The crew have 0 idea how to behave, there are definitely no protocols, its like they are random citizens in a zombie survival movie ""they got the guts and instinct..."" and by ""instincts"" i mean ""PANIC!!!"". What kind of retarded f... person takes some space noise that barely resembles a melody, analyze it for 5 minutes and decides its undoubtfully a human voice?!?!?!? Out of the solar system!!!!!!!!! Then comes the best part: the id**ts get to an alien planet with visible life and decides to take the f***... helmet of!!!!!! There is also the wonderful part when there is an alarm going on in the ship but the thing is just sound, then a couple of id**ts having sex in the shower with music doesn't hear it. In a reasonable situation the alarm would also include flashing lights and the music would probably get shut off along with the shower! Because you are suppose to pay attention to the alarm!!!!! The only ""good"" part of the movie is the android, it has an acceptable plot and its a good character. But the rest of the characters are nauseous and make me sick.P.S. Unfortunately i had to remove all the ""emphasizing"" words and expressions out of my text to follow the guidelines, but i hope i have made myself clear.",Alien - Covenant

In short, besides the visuals, everything is awful. The plot is so boring that there is no need to explain why it also doesn't make any sense. Impossibly dumb characters, no dialogues -literally- no tension, no humor, I'm not even sure there was a soundtrack. There were so many stupid things happening at the same time, that at one point I thought it was some sort of parody, like Mel Brooks meets Alien.In some ways, it probably is.",Alien - Covenant
1261,EthanHickey5,If you thought Prometheus was bad...,4,23 May 2017,"Oh man, if you thought Prometheus was a bad movie, then you definitely do not want to see Alien Covenant. I had high hopes for Prometheus and I believe it is better than most people give it credit for. People are just mad due to the fact there were no aliens in it! But, the Engineers were epic and Shaw and David's characters were really cool and well developed. I believed that they had a lot of epic things set up for the next movie! But then came along Ridley Scott and buggered up what could've been an amazing prequel trilogy. What the viewers wanted was; aliens, David and Shaw to go to the engineers, hopefully find answers from the engineers and how they created us and also some answers on the aliens and where they came from. Instead what we got was literal garbage. Have you ever seen a low budget slasher flick? One that has a lot of pop-up scares and really bad effects? This movie was literally one of those but with a $111 million dollar budget. The characters were poorly developed, I laughed more than I cried at everyone's death. I didn't feel attached to any character in the movie like I did with Ripley's character. Everyone died in a gruesome way and there was no real battle, the aliens just killed everyone off one by one or two by one. I was quite excited when David began to explain how he met the engineers, but instead all we found out is that he killed them all. Like, wow! I wanted to learn more about them and how they became to create humans. I thought it was interesting that David created the aliens, it made a lot of sense. But, then to find out he used Shaw's body as a tester, I just officially agreed that the movie went to crap. The only beloved character in the prequels died off screen.When David and Walter fought, I was so happy. I believed that an epic battle was going to save this movie and Walter was going to kill David! Instead we see the two of them throw each other against walls and then they cut to another seen. I think we can all agree we knew that David killed Walter, it was so obvious. Like the movie tried to be sneaky about it, but it was just so obvious! Ridley Scott thought to himself at the end of the movie that they needed to copy every alien movie and have a cliché alien fly out into space. And that, he did perfectly. It was stupid and not needed. I forgot to mention, how stupid was the shower death? So pointless, and no one came to see Alien for nudity! Overall, this movie and this prequel series has gone to crap. It had every chance to be great. With a 'great' director, a great actor in Fassbender and the curiosity of the fans of the Aliens movies, they had the chance to make millions and also make a good movie. Both Prometheus and Covenant had interesting scenes and I think the message that they were trying to get across was interesting, but the little things in between were lost in translation and it was ruined. I hope that the final prequel is better, I really am rooting for it to make a comeback.",Alien - Covenant
1262,arjunkrishabu,This was a kinda Deceit,5,8 July 2017,"This didn't seem like a sequel to Prometheus. I don't understand how the director, script writer have failed to understand the curiosity that has build up in the audience after Prometheus, to understand the world of the engineers and Dr. Shaw's roll up. Even if they ignored all this, how was it that Dr. Shaw was made to end up that way! That character didn't deserve that ending at all! You guys could have really worked on the script! The film making was good, but the script lacked interest.",Alien - Covenant

1264,gibbo-77205,Back on track after the Prometheus disaster,8,11 May 2017,"Following my bitter disappointment with the terrible screenplay and caricatured characters in Prometheus (the concept of which I thought was great, execution terrible), Alien Covenant delivered. Although suffering from the mandatory ""I'll just walk off into another area by myself despite the obvious stupidity of it"" which seems to occur in every horror movie, the screenplay was good, acting was good and the characters had a bit more depth. Visually spectacular, with a more intellectual story-line than I was expecting (reference Ozymandias and Wagner's Das Rheingold), I left the cinema feeling that my $100 was well spent (took the family). I had gone in with low expectations but a secret hope that Ridley Scott would address the obvious flaws present in Prometheus, and he did. I will definitely be buying this on Blu-ray and giving it a run at home.",Alien - Covenant

YupOverall without spoiling much apart from a Steven Seagal (Executive Decision) like cameo this movie can be seen on the small screen as there is no real visual O faces to be had. Great that it flows on from Prometheus but where is the stalking and suspense of the Xenos? Fassbender and McBride are solid but the rest of the cast is OK if not just bearable in some parts. Part script/director/art direction but you feel that AVP delivers a better and more suspense final product. Just when you thought it was building up they show a cock and balls space ship which must have been an ode to Spaceballs? Maybe but seemed a bit out of phallic...oops I mean place.,Alien - Covenant

It appears it is a prologue to yet another follow-up. Prometheus played on me the same way (gave it a 5) until watching the DVD later many times, which totally changed my view, giving it at least a nine or better. I give the A:C a 10, because it completely destroyed all my preconceived expectations and conclusions (ho-hum) of what the movie was going to be like at the theater. There were definitely many things in the movie that I could not completely catch and will have to wait until the DVD comes out to allow a little more time to go through it at a more relaxed pace, and without engorging on popcorn from a fire hose.",Alien - Covenant
1269,unsleepinghorror,"Movie Review: Alien: Covenant (2017), directed by Ridley Scott",6,29 May 2017,"Now with twice the Fassbender!There is a high risk of disappointment when expanding the established lore of a franchise so ingrained in pop culture. As such, Alien: Covenant was poised for disappointment from the start, in much the same way it's predecessor Prometheus was. Don't worry, this time you'll get to see beloved icons like the facehugger, chestburster, and Xenomorph. Or do worry. How many times now has the original Alien film been remade, in spirit? The answer needs no number. Too many.Covenant follows a group of pioneers hauling precious embryos in order to jump start a colony on a planet far removed from our own. The world they ultimately land on is deceptively inviting. Lush forestation, breathable air, and comfortable gravity. Indeed, this is when the crew begins to die one at a time from alien creatures they are sorely unprepared to combat. If it's not already apparent, the premise will not distinguish this film amidst the series. There are great scenes within, however, especially through its middle when it's more willing to exhibit originality.Wherever else he may falter, Ridley Scott still has an eye for gorgeous photography. The natural landscape is tantalizing and vast, while the interior spaces are claustrophobic and impeccably detailed. As for the ""monsters,"" they are suitably nasty, tearing through tender humans in shocking displays of gore. But perhaps I'm spoiled on the practical alien effects of the original film; there is something about the sleekness of CGI that dampens tension.The new alien creature, the Neomorph, is fleshier, faster, and more frenzied than its famous kin. Its extensive introduction is harrowing, for sure, then once the recognizable Xenomorph makes its entrance things become too predictable. Focusing not on what matters for story progression but on stoking the embers of nostalgia. For all their effort, neither of these ""morphs"" are as monstrous as the android David.Similar to Prometheus, Michael Fassbender's portrayal of David, provides the most stimulating moments. He is not so subtly compared to Milton's Satan, forgoing his creator to liberate himself and amass his demons (read: Xenomorphs). I never found myself rooting for any of the humans in the same way I wanted David to survive. Thankfully, this whole prequel series is hinged on the character.We actually get two Fassbender roles to relish. The other being a newer model of android named Walter. The light to David's dark. Other standout performances, lest I neglect to mention, comprise Katherine Waterston's grief-stricken endurance, Billy Crudup's uptight man of faith, and Danny McBride's surprising subtlety. Oh, and for his single scene, Guy Pierce is splendid.Nevertheless, there is a shortage of characterization that is, curiously, only elaborated in promotional material. Prior to the theatrical release, Fox unveiled a YouTube video referred to as ""Prologue: Last Supper,"" which depicted the crew in a state of relaxation before hypersleep. The cast is given just minutes of additional screen time and yet its a far more effective introduction than any of them get from the final product. Between viral marketing and ""extended cut"" releases, how often do we pay for a complete film when going to the theater anymore?The second act gives a glimpse of what I thought we'd get after Prometheus. That film's protagonist, Elizabeth Shaw, and David heading for a new destination, seeking answers that Alien: Covenant is disinterested in granting. Apparently, the next film Ridley Scott has planned for the franchise, titled Alien: Awakening, is to take place between Prometheus and Covenant. It's possible that this proposed film could focus on Shaw and David's relationship, the android's descent, and the mysterious Engineers. Of course, Scott could also change his mind and continue from Covenant's conclusion.So many modern blockbusters are obsessed with capturing nostalgia by emulating past glories. Alien: Covenant falls into many of the same traps while also managing to evade others. With so much retreaded ground it hardly feels as if we've moved forward all that far. I, for one, am not yet convinced we needed these prequels. At the same time, Covenant is an enjoyable romp in a hostile universe and I can't help but remain curious of where the next film is headed.Verdict: Moderate RecommendationP.S. Why is no one wearing a helmet while exploring the alien planet? Are humans more resilient to microbial organisms in the future? Did they forget to pack their helmets? Is it like when someone tells me I should wear a coat when it's cold out and I decide to endure the weather in a t-shirt instead?For more horror reviews check out http://unsleepinghorror.com/",Alien - Covenant
1270,aglinder,Met my expectations,10,30 May 2017,"I am like the others here, boosting this film's average score, because it deserves at least 7.5 - 8.0If you've watched the trailers and the prologue, they set the film up following the events of Prometheus. My biggest fear was that James Franco was in this film - he is, but not for long.The story-line does follow, if you pay attention, and while the reasoning of some characters might seem crazy you got to remember that they're husbands and wives and lovers, and well, human. Look around you, people are stupid.I thought that this would end tying into Alien, but it doesn't - and I'm left wondering if the (presumable) sequel to Covenant will do that... (probably not).

1272,fabz,An incompetent crew sent to colonize space,3,14 May 2017,"Verdict: This movie seems like the intellectually challenged child of ""Alien"" and ""Idiocracy"". Ridley Scott's lazy execution has killed the series.Review: Looking at the list of people involved in directing and producing this movie, it is incredible to realize that they got so much wrong, and I'm not referring to nit-picky scientific facts here. The problems with Alien Covenant are much more basic than that: casting and plot. Is there anything good here? I tried hard, but all I could think of were the sets and the special FX.The lazily executed Alien Covenant contains the usual jump scares and gore that we've seen many times before. I could easily look past the trite scifi/horror box-ticking exercise if the story or the crew were interesting, but alas they are the real letdown. It would be harsh for me to blame the cast for their poor performances because I can't quite pinpoint the exact cause of their failure. The result is clearly inadequate, regardless of the cause which is likely a mix of poor direction, poor script and ordinary acting. Whatever the reason, the entire crew of this spaceship manages to leave any charisma and personality back on Earth and travels to explore the universe armed only with clichés and stupidity, such as casually landing on an uncharted planet with a cigarette or cigar in the mouth or wearing a cowboy hat inside a spaceship (that's character development right?). Ultimately it is the plot that sinks Alien Covenant. I can't imagine anyone thinking that it would be acceptable to send a pathetically inept crew to colonize a planet far far away, in a very expensive spaceship, with the added responsibility of thousands of colonists in stasis. This is a crew with close to zero skill and even less common sense. A crew with a weak chain of command and a lot of bad attitude (one quote from memory, when the bumbling idiot left in charge utters to his wife: ""This is not fair, the crew don't trust me just because I'm a man of faith"").Alien Covenant interprets humanity, human actions and motivations in a very warped manner, so much so that the choices made by every character seem completely irrational. Some examples:Detour from a planned massive colonization mission because of a single garbled message.Land humans on a mysterious uncharted planet as soon as you get there and without first sending a probe or doing any research. Despite an impenetrable atmosphere, with several visible cyclones and extreme storm activity going on.Have zero mission protocols and allow each individual to basically touch, fiddle and play with whatever they find on said mysterious planet.When something goes wrong get into a massive panic, but only until it's time to relax (shower, play the flute, etc.), at which point we wait for the predictable monster strike.Blindly and repeatedly trust a synthetic (robot) that was known to have been faulty.The new synthetic is an upgrade of the old synthetic, but somehow is not very rational and so is consistently outsmarted and beaten up by said inferior unit (humanity seems to have only one synthetic mold since they all look alike, even 10 years apart).Quarantine? Backup plan? What are they? Nobody in their right mind would behave the way these characters do. Let alone individuals that should have been trained and primed for the circumstances.Alien Covenant had the chance of being a good movie, but it appears to have been executed from beginning to end with a laziness that deserves contempt. Ridley Scott has had some hits and misses. He has made some of my favourite movies (the original Alien being one), but also some of my least favourite (such as Alien Covenant). I sincerely hope that Blade Runner does not also become tainted by the kind of cash-cow attitude that has ruined the Alien series.",Alien - Covenant

1281,S-Lanaway,Not nearly as good as it's own commercial....,2,19 May 2017,"This is basically a badly executed B-Movie with a big budget. It's so bad it's almost silly. The original Alien had a brooding, well-paced ambiance. You could identify with the characters and it artfully led you into the action-conflict.This feels like it was written by 10 different screenwriters, with a studio exec coming in to make sure it is dumbed down enough to hold the attention of people unable to follow a plot, or with no patience to really absorb characters. But for people who simply want to look at shooting and space monsters on a screen - this has that.I was literally bored watching it. There is minimal character development. The science/technology part is inconsistent and shaky. I think there were some good ideas at the core of the script, but it tried to do and be too much, and dumbed itself down to the point of idiocy.Even the CGI of the ships in space looked more fake to me than the 1979 analog effects.The commercial that is airing on TV with the 'Take me home' song, is cinematic and haunting. The film itself is sadly a waste of time. Unless you are cool with plot gaps, science gaps, no character development, completely implausible scenarios etc. There is definitely shooting and alien monsters chasing people.",Alien - Covenant
1282,saittham71,Depends on what you are looking for...,6,10 June 2017,"I see a lot of 1 or 2 star reviews, which makes me wonder what rating scale is used. Even just for the visual experience the movie deserves at least a 5. Now, with that out of the way, I have to say that I liked it, but at the same time understand that this movie doesn't win over the crowd expecting an Alien reboot. To be honest, I really wonder how you would expect a reboot of the original. How many variations of being trapped with an alien in a spaceship can you imagine? The AvP series prove that there is quite an audience for just making movies that feature xenomorphs in battle. I guess everybody understands that someone like Ridley Scott would try to make something better and bigger. Prometheus in part succeeded in giving the franchise a backstory to further explore, but it also contained the unsympathetic and famously stupid characters, which made it a mixed experience for me. Unfortunately, Alien Covenant is another mixed experience. No cringeworthy character reactions towards alien life forms, but the movie fails to set up it's characters in time before they are killed off. The only two human characters we care about are the two that survive. That's not coincidence, that's bad screenplay. This makes the whole xenomorph elements a bit boring, because I don't care about it's victims at all.The movie really is about David and Walter in their own little interpretation of Milton's Paradise Lost. David is Lucifer, looking down on both humans and engineers as inferior beings, which gives him the right to destroy them and Walter is Michael, protector of mankind. This is the strong part of the movie and Fassbender really steals the show on a level that surpasses Prometheus. I guess if you are not at all bothered with creation on a philosophical or religious level, this movie raises an eyebrow. If you just came to see it for the xenomorphs it's even worse. I was quite happy, though. I saw the best Lucifer performance in a while and the movie finishes on what can only be described as the darkest cliffhanger in years. Now, I feel like I have defended it enough, so here's some issues: if the original form of the xenomorph is flying black liquid that turns it's host into a xenomorph, then the egg and facehugger seem highly inefficient. What did David experiment on? He was on a planet without any animal life... It's unlikely this was the engineer's home planet. Wouldn't they check out the colony that was just sterilized with their own bioweapon? Let's assume Earth like planets like this one exist, still not a good idea to walk around without a suit and mask on. don't know what germs fly around...",Alien - Covenant

1284,Macfeetie,A triple Meh on the Meh-index. (Spoilers),6,22 May 2017,"I suppose some elements of this review could be considered ""spoilers"" (although I'd argue the contrary) but to be safe, let's say there are.Promised a reveal of the further saga of Elizabeth Shaw and the android David, we are only served a minor throwaway explanation of Shaw's fate; one that reminiscently stank of the similar demise of Corp. Hicks and Newt in Alien 3 the worst installment of the franchise – well – perhaps second worst after AVP. Essentially an attrition movie like many before. Load X-amount of humans into a scenario and watch them subsequently bite the dust, one-by-one to the last person(s) standing – i.e. Ripley, Shaw, and in this case ----? My hope was that we film-goers would get an explanatory glimpse into the Engineers and their world Find out specifically what their beef with us was, and view how we (humanity) would respond to the reality of this; Meeting makers that were so unhappy with their work (us) they contrive a cosmic/bio-scientific ""delete"" button. No, instead we get a parable on technology run amok because it's too much like its creator. Robots acting on the worst of Human characteristics. Blade Runner meets Alien. Ridley Scott, normally my idea of a tremendous director/filmmaker, seems caught in a repetitive tape loop with this concept – but it's a story he never seems to completely explain in any of his films. It's almost hard to believe he signed-off on this.There were also reports that this film would bring us full circle - back to the story behind the ship that the Nostromo's crew investigated in 1979 - or maybe even to the tale of the ill-fated colonists (i.e. Newt & her family) from 1986's Aliens. If there IS a tie-up to that fencepost, it is profoundly veiled and speculative. The most interesting element, David's Ozymandias moment, is skimmed over like ancillary minutia and tossed into the ""well-yeah-that- happened-too"" bag – an annoyingly wasted opportunity. A shame – there was so much potential here. I'd almost say Prometheus was better – though it certainly did not set a very high bar. I now hope the Untitled Neill Blomkamp/Alien Project gains some traction. I'd hate to see the franchise end on this note. Not saying this is a horrible movie, but ""anticlimactic"" might be accurate.",Alien - Covenant
1285,teal123,A huge insult to Alien fandom,2,24 May 2017,"Dear oh dear Sir Ridley, what have you done?*** FULL ON SPOILERS ***First off, there are some unforgivable deal breakers that render the film null and void for the Aliens canon:* The chestbursters take 10 minutes to gestate from implantation to bursting out.* Implantation can occur during mere seconds as the victim struggles with the facehugger, and once off he has no clue that it happened, no sore throat or anything.* The aliens grow to full size in hours* The chestbursters can do tricks for its owner right after it bursts out. Raises its hands (it already has hands!) at David's cue. It was almost like the scene in Spaceballs. Seriously.* The sophomoric dialog between David and Walter had the audience snickering.* The tall white alien is ridiculous.Next, the crew is STUPID. Just stupid. Even worse than the one in Prometheus. One ridiculous unprofessional amateurish decision after another. It would not be unreasonable to assume that they would be highly trained professionals serious about their jobs. But no. Witness:* They don't *feel* like going back to sleep after stabilizing the ship so they just land on the closest planet, without having done any surveying. The 2000 passengers might have a problem with that when they wake up. Presumably the target planet had been carefully selected.* They go check out the unknown, potentially dangerous signal in mass numbers, leaving the ship (with 2000 passengers!)* They touch everything they see, they stop randomly and split up whenever it pleases them.* They drag very sick, ebola-symptom displaying crewmates who are vomiting blood on them, to their med bay. Once there, when the guy starts freaking out, they lose their minds as though they know what's about to happen (they shouldn't know) and panic and do everything wrong.* Having survived an ordeal where most of their crewmates died, with some amazing events to digest, potential danger still about, two of them decide to go do it in the shower and turn up their music so loud they can't hear the blaring sirens and mother's warnings.Next, the plot. Just not good. Not good at all.The characters: none are interesting, David is over the top, and the acting is terrible.Sir Ridley I want my money back. It's time to retire.

1286,seminole17,"Poorly executed mi-sh mosh of Alien, Aliens and Prometheus.",6,22 May 2017,"First off, I really wanted to like this movie. I liked ""Prometheus"" in particular the ""Engineers"" story line and the David character. The best description I can give for people that haven't seen the movie yet is that they tried to mash the best parts of Alien, Aliens and Prometheus together but failed miserably. Where ""The Force Awakens"" succeeded in almost remaking the original Star Wars movie and betting on fanboy nostalgia, this movie just failed at it in every way. If you listen closely, even the score is ripped from Alien, Aliens and Prometheus (which was fine by me because I like the music) On the bright side, Michael Fassbender is fantastic as ""David"" (he also plays ""Walter"" but his character is nothing close) One of the most disappointing things for me was that they completely abandoned the ""engineers"" story line and dismissed it pretty quickly in favor of a new direction. I am not sure who's decision that was but I think the studio probably had a lot do with it turning it from a Prometheus sequel into another (insert yawn here) boring Alien movie. This movie is predictable, the casting is awful (particularly Danny Mcbride and Billy Crudup) and it just dies in the final act. At the end I was hoping the crew would just get killed off because I had no emotional attachment whatsoever to these characters. The character development here is non- existent. The first hour (like Prometheus) I really enjoyed. Another bright side is that the movie is a spectacle and beautiful to look at. I always admired Ridley Scott's ability to create atmospheres like no other. He is one of the best at this. Overall, it's a movie to rent for a fun night of thrills and chills but I wouldn't pay full price at the movies for this. Maybe hit a matinée when the crowds die down on a Tuesday afternoon.",Alien - Covenant

We are at the unknown planet, full of unknown bacteria, lifeforms and viruses? Quickly throw away your helmets and let's breathe an air full of... let's see of what. Some one catches fever on unknown planet full of unknown everything. Let's just quickly bring him to the ship. No one even bothered to note that hey... maybe at least quarantine?! Sure not, if we don't bother about gas masks or helmets at the first place, can bring a mate who got some crazy virus, why not. And you just can go on and go on and go on. I thought they were kind of bringing there scientists... Had a serious training for astronauts, but apparently all crew got their job through yellow pages ad - Hey, wanna go to space? Whole crew that is responsible for colonization mission shown as bunch of stupid, irrational and hysterical people.

Alas, H.R. Giger is not with us anymore. Maybe to his benefit, as I'm not sure this latest (possibly last?) installment wouldn't have given him a stroke.Look, as a Sci-Fi movie it wasn't that bad. Cinematography is great (one of, maybe the only remaining, Ridley Scott fief), CGI is not bad, acting is decent (thumbs up for Fassbender). If you're completely unfamiliar with the Alien movies then this could've been a 6 / 10 movie, maybe. Yeah, there are a lot of implausible decisions made by a bunch of unlikely idiotic team members and leaders. But, okay, disengaging the brain during that part of the movie might have helped. Make it a SyFy channel movie and call it a night. No harm done.But the thing is...this movie is an Alien movie wannabe. As an Alien movie wannabe, a prequel no less, we're pushed, shoved actually, in the most unexpectedly idiotic direction. Namely, the android. Yes, those tangential, incidental, anecdotal androids that seeped into many of the Alien movies, barely noticeable. Yes, one of the them is, apparently, the crux of all that has been happening. The root of all evil. One of those is the focus and cause of our own struggle for survival, as a race, it turns out. I wonder if Ridley Scott is now aiming to combine Alien and Blade Runner into one. Why stop there, even? We could have Jar Jar Binks killing Aliens. With sheer boredom. After all, anything becomes passable with proper amount of alcohol.Bottom line: ""Alien vs. Predator"" has more claim to be an ""Alien"" movie than this one. On the other hand, if watched in isolation of the Alien movie franchise then this could be enjoyable.",Alien - Covenant
1290,dantehr,Refreshingly clueless characters - All the gear and no idea!,8,18 May 2017,"It was so refreshing to see a movie where characters act like very ordinary people in an extraordinary situation. The crew of the Covenant presumably had some form of training but despite this they have no clue what they are doing! If you've ever been thrust into a high pressure situation you've never experienced before you'll know how realistic this is! In reality it's easy to forget most of what you thought you knew and rely on bad instincts, make mistakes and trust the wrong people. The story is a catalogue of how not to investigate a new planet, and I can't help feeling this is close to the truth of how things might really pan out when colonists destined for a pre-approved planet take matters into their own hands! How many of us really understand how the technology we use works? The crew of the Covenant have all the gear but no idea how to put it to good use, forgetting basic principles like wearing a space suit when investigating an unknown environment. Particularly effecting were many of the deaths resulting from blindly following the authority of a synthetic, just because they had a handsome face and a clear voice. Bad writing? Or good writing of bad characters? Overall very refreshing to see what NOT to do if you ever find yourself in a similar situation. The film is a poem of the limits of the human capacity to translate knowledge into action, and as we enter the age of artificial intelligence and 'deep thought' a reminder to be careful what we create! Massively underrated! Well done Ridley and co. p.s. I think we all wan to know more about the engineers :D",Alien - Covenant

Further down hill when they 1) land in water 2) exit without breathing protection (i work in a mine and use more) 3 split up to ""take samples"" and then botch ten years of training by blowing quarantine procedures. Aside from that why did the Prometheus ship crash? Was in the air last time we see it in the movie when Walter releases the virus?

1293,Kalpesh_Rajdeo,Giger's Xenomorph,7,30 September 2018,"The original will always be remembered as the best, as is the case in many franchises. But the ""Alien"" has come a long way since 1979.Covenant (after Prometheus) continues to bring back the original artistic style that H.R. Giger imagined in his Necronomicon. He paired up with Ridley Scott back then and won the Academy Award for best design. Giger's airbrush paintings are being justified by the design and art style of this reboot because if how technology (CGI) has improved since the 1970s. Giger was able to achieve what he did because he was an outsider to the film industry and had complete creative freedom thanks to the producers.
He created this gorgeous monster and its desolate world without any obstruction, so much so that an actual human skull was used to create the face of the original Xenomorph Queen Animatron. The design was so intricate and specific simply because it came from one artist's undisturbed mind. And his expression is what makes Alien stand out from the rest and has become a benchmark for Extra-terrestrial movies.Alien: Covenant embraces this dark horrific blend of steampunk-deep space-grotesque monsters just like Prometheus did and they look gnarlier than they ever did.
But all of this, in the end, is just the art-style of the movie. 
Movies cannot entirely depend on the art-style. This is where Covenant, to an extent, suffers from the recent epidemic of ""passable"" movies.You are enthralled by the detailed world that your characters find themselves in but the characters themselves feel... empty.
Astronauts from a dying world out on an expedition to find a new planet to live on, don't really make you feel for them.
So, if they die, it doesn't matter to you, because the movie never really makes you care about them. 
Michael Fassbender returns as Walter, his renewed appearance might confuse you if you have seen Prometheus but all is explained in a timely manner.
Fassbender's character is what brings depth to this movie while others fail.Except for a few well-constructed scenes, the story itself fails to deliver.
It starts like a well-made disaster movie that hooks you in but seems to lose its grip on the grander scheme.What I liked about Covenant is the central, recurring motif of the ""origin of all species"" which is well devised in dialogue throughout the film, especially what Fassbender does with it.
An age old question is tackled in a very interesting manner.
""If you created me, who created you?""
Much is left for the audience to understand the answer to that question while hints are hidden behind the themes and lore of the two films.If you haven't watched Prometheus yet, watch it before you watch Covenant, to completely understand the lore and continuity.There is definitely going to be a third movie and Covenant felt like a set up for that.It wasn't a solid 7 but because some scenes were beautifully captured and because I loved the acid blood filled rapidly evolving alien, I give it a 7/10 on IMDb.",Alien - Covenant

""Aliens"" After these 2 films, there were attempts, but they all ran at the most mediocre ... In 2012, Scott returns with Prometheus, a film I personally loved. He divided the fans, some saying it was boring and with many unanswered questions, but the essence of the movie, the suspense, the visuals and especially the tone of the movie, made me love this movie. In spite of everything it had good reviews. 5 years later, Scott returns with ""Alien: Covenant"" which is a sequel to ""Prometheus"" There's a lot you can say about this movie ... Starting: Is it better than Prometheus? In my opinion, no Answer the fundamental questions of Prometheus? No Which brings me to the negative part of the movie. Sometimes Scott does not know what he wants to do with the movie ... A sequel to Prometheus? An Alien? Ha elements of 2, but undoubtedly is an ""Alien"" The film has an excellent visual part; in that, I shoot Scott's hat, impressive ... from the most terrifying scenes, to the most pure and beautiful. Speaking of the continuation of Prometheus, I wish, of course, that it had been better explored, there are lots of unanswered questions that Scott might not even want to answer since the fans asked for ""Xenomorphs"" I'll speak now, of the ""Xenomorphs"" the mythical creature of the Alien. The Best Part of this movie is clearly the ""Alien"" part. It's Bloody, it's creepy, it's ghastly, and it's been meticulously crafted and performed by Ridley Scott who remains a master of Terror / Sci-fi. There are scenes that make a jaw drop from how extreme, horrible, and genial they are. As an ""Alien"" movie, the film is what it wants to be, and it succeeds in doing that. As a sequel to ""Prometheus"" leaves much to be desired and this is really my problem with the movie in general, because a Prometheus fan, does not come out with the questions answered ... to compensate has the component ""Alien"" In general, and in short, the movie is good. Not very good. It's good, it's an entry into the legendary franchise of Ridley Scott, it's visually brilliant, with a wonderful cast, highlighting Michael Fassbender, who was absolutely fantastic with jaw-dropping scenes, with bloody, extreme scenes that honor the Name ""Alien"". It did not satisfy all my needs, as a sequel, it's mediocre, as an isolated ""Alien"" movie is pretty good, and I'm curious how Scott will be able to link all the movies and finally take us to the ""Nostromo"" ship, Time will tell, and here I will be to the next chapter that will leave in 4/5 years and that can finally give the answers, I also highlight the masterful work of Scott, with scenes that neither Tarantino passed through the head.

It is a carbon copy of Prometheus. Go to an exo-planet, land somewhere suitable, search the environment, explore the alien ship, then all soldiers are acting clumsy.

But that's where the good ends.The broader story is written poorly and at times seems to move too fast to get you invested in the characters and involved in the plot. The movie attempts to get you to want the characters to live, but they are so boring and never set up. I never cared about any of the characters except David. Perhaps the worst point of this is that the set up for the film (in the form of The Last Supper trailer) to get you to like the characters ISN'T EVEN IN THE FILM. I never cared about any dead characters, I never cared about the live ones being killed. Whether or not this was due to just the poor pacing of the film or whether or not the mediocre acting or poorly written characters are to blame at all. But I never cared.But perhaps the worst part of the film is how the lore and mystery of the Xenomorph has been butchered. This is where the fans are hating on this film and for good reason. The mystery surrounding the Xenomorph is what made it so interesting and scary. But now that we know how it came into existence, you become almost bored by it.

1306,DrkAngl13,Loved Prometheus better....,7,9 March 2020,"It isn't horrible, just kinda, well, flat. I know it's the whole baseline story of where the Alien came from, who designed it and so forth...just it would have been better had some things been done differently I guess. Having the 2 types of species running about really didn't make a lot of sense to me, not until I read the book (which of course explains things a bit more). The movie also doesn't explain how David achieved the pods either...which would have been helpful instead of,  here they are. Not sure if there will be a third made or not..hope so tho, it would be nice to see this all tied together finally before Ripley finds her way to the crash site..lol.",Alien - Covenant
1307,ashzombola,Utterly heartbroken by this disastrous monstrosity,7,12 May 2017,"Dear Ridley Scott, You've ruined my life, you've ruined the lives of others, you've ruined your own life. I genuinely think you have a mental disorder. It's the only explanation. I have no words. I tried to write a fair, logical and critical review, but the 10,000 character limit wasn't enough to cover the sheer volume and perplexity and magnitude of brain hurting plot holes, editing, directing, story, acting and absurdity of the nonsensical destruction of the very thing you created. If I had the rest of your life to sit and explain the utter repugnance and absurdity of every choice you have made, it would still not be enough. Everything, is wrong. Even your own wrongs are wrong about the wrongs you've already wronged. I'm speechless. I'm just going to breath. Breath and try to remain calm as I remove every piece of Alien: Covenant and Prometheus from my mind. I feel dirty and infected, repulsed by this miasma of psycho vomit you have inflicted upon me.My brain feels like the magical, inexplicable, story excusing black ooze... that's sometimes dust... and sometimes from insects... and sometimes is used as a plot device to explain absolutely nothing, and destroy people in vastly conflicting and apparently never ending ways, including itself. Perhaps from the ashes of my DNA, new life will be made. But apparently, not all the time. So I don't even have hope. Clearly, nothing makes sense anymore.Yours sincerely",Alien - Covenant

I think 300 years ago people who would have been sent to capture a bunch of naughty kids and take them back home would have been 100 times better trained than these morons.Hopefully in the next part we will realize that humans had sent these morons as a trap to fool aliens and make them think humans are just some silly morons and then destroy them.in the middle of the movie a very well designed Android which is so many levels upgraded and much better than any of its priors is easily fooled by a model from 10 years before. then right before he wants to kill him. he stops to see what interesting thing he want's to say:) and doesn't notice that he is reaching a knife. how can you not notice when you are sitting over sb and they are trying to reach for a knife? and then get killed by them! no! not you human with a very limited visual focus and eye sight. an Android that is made 100 years from now.,Alien - Covenant

I must say im shocked looking at these reviews, this was a good movie & Prometheus was even better. All these 1/10 reviews are ABSURD and they seem to be coming from zealots who are anxiously awaiting the second coming of a film from 1979. News flash, ITS A NEW MOVIE!!! Secondly Im seeing a lot of complaints about how ""believable"" the story is....Cmon guys. These people are lashing out saying this wouldn't happen, this doesn't make sense with actual science & so on. Hey guys another newsflash, ITS NOT REAL!!!!!! This isn't the Cosmsos documentary its a friggen story for entertainment. These people are so outraged by things they think are ""unbelievable"" about this movie in conjunction with its predecessors & scientific fact, well i got news for you guys face sucking aliens who incubate in human hosts don't exist,deep space colonization missions don't exist, Hyper sleep pods do not exist, Sinthetic humanoids do not exist, the Alien pathogen DOES NOT EXIST, so making any cracks about believability is so absurd I laughed out loud. Lasty, If you wanna see an entertaining sci fi movie you will enjoy Covenant & Promethues as well. If you wear a pocket protector & bring a protractor to the movies scouring them for flaws & inaccuracies you'll never be satisfied with anything. In short all these bad reviews are nonsense its a good sci fi movie. Its entertainment not scientific fact, try to enjoy the story instead of poking holes, some people you cant please",Alien - Covenant

1313,MagicJack55,Too negative,6,31 May 2017,"I didn't like this movie because it's too negative.I loved Alien 2 back in the 80s, because I loved getting scared. You gotta give it to the covenant team: they made the aliens more dangerous, vicious, gory and even scarier than the old ones. They could have easily ruined it but they made it good. The director still has it.So what's my problem with it? As a kid I could sometimes laugh when people died in the most gruesome manner possible, it was just fun. But now in my thirties I don't like seeing a 20 year old girl getting disfigured and eaten alive, with all the skillful realism that comes with it. Alien 2 back then was pretty negative in terms of human nature and what happened on the screen, but Covenant is worse, and I think it crossed the line and became a horror movie like Silent Hill rather than a scary action thriller. It's too graphic and sinister. If I want to see that kind of stuff I can just go on YouTube and type ""Lions eat buffalo baby alive"".",Alien - Covenant
1314,caedus1980,Utter tripe,1,18 October 2019,"If you're a fan of Alien and Aliens I highly recommend that you avoid this movie.

Completely predictable twists. There is no real story of the Engineers nor the origin of the Aliens. It's a insult to the original book that had the grip and originality that gave me nightmares back in the day. The crew neither knows nor performs protocols. When confronted with to identical beings, no one has a method of discerning the two? ...especially when one is sociopathic. No quarantine procedures? Totally amateur plot. This is a sore disappointment for Ridley (Scott) to have put anything like this to the screen.",Alien - Covenant

After killing the SCARY ALIENS and saving humanity, a plot twist we saw from miles away: They've been betrayed!

Yes it is true that the scientist do choose to make 1 or 2 stupid actions here and there, but other than that: Wow Ridley.SPOILER:My absolute favorite scene in the movie was when they all watched the video transmission that Shaw sent out some time ago. The fact that she sang Take me home, country roads by John Denver was truly beautiful. Imagine what she was going through, what her thoughts were at that specific time. Sitting in an alien space ship, millions of millions of miles away singing take me home. I don't know, I just truly felt something there. It could be that she was missing home or that she was excited to know where she came from, now that they were headed for the engineers planet.I loved it, it was immersive, beautiful and awesomely mysterious.

Enjoy the inky black of the lake. Aliens don't disappoint with a variety and creativity that is something to behold. Michael Fassbender is superb along with some good performances by The crew. The first half of the movie builds towards revealing more of where the aliens come from, but instead of building upon the mystery of Prometheus that left you wanting more, everything gets wrapped up with a nice little bow at the end that leaves you feeling robbed.

It didn't have that ALIEN feel to me, I understand Prometheus was more of an explanatory film about the whole fiasco of these aliens, but this was just lack lustre. There were no ""edge of your seat feelings"", the first 45 minutes killed me beyond belief, I kept expecting something to jump out at me but nope, nothing.I didn't get James Franco's part and how he was originally the captain and the big fire scene, it was completely off point and topic, the characters had no stories like previously, just a bit of a shambles with their parts. The middle section seemed rushed because they spent 45 minutes concentrating on flying the ship into the plant and all that palava.The ending was predictable which didn't disappoint me entirely but I could see it coming.One scene out of the whole film stood out for me like ALIEN normally does and that wasn't even at the end.I wouldn't say don't go and see it but just don't expect much.",Alien - Covenant

1323,mpotran,Goodbye Mr. Ridley,3,18 May 2017,"Deeply disappointed. Sorry to say but Ridley Scott is either to old to make a good movie or he just needed the money so he agreed to film this crap. This is neither Prometheus which was not a classic alien movie but still good, nor Alien 1 or Alien 2 but it tries to be all three, quite unsuccessfully. The first two Alien movies were smart and made to detail. Prometheus was different but still refreshing and good. This one is a commercial piece of crap made for teenagers (not the smart ones). The story is bad, the action is bad, the casting bad. A few things i could not go over: -------------SPOILER ALERT-------------- ---the crew is embarking on a totally new planet, not known before. Without even mentioning that they analyzed the air (or even filming the scene where they do), the water or the flora and fauna, they go out without gas masks or protective suites into an alien planet!! They land into water and they walk the across the lake not even wondering whether it's water or acid or maybe if there's something in there or if the bottom is sludgy, muddy or maybe just made of sharp rocks!! the aliens are growing to full size without even eating in literally seconds or minutes!! the aliens are breaking whichever thick glass they get in contact with (the plane cockpit, the pod glass etc.) with their heads, but the same glass cannot even be scratched with an axe. Yet that does not stop the main character fighting an alien with an axe.the weapons don't do anything to the aliens, they're practically invincible.the new captain is so shocked in the first few scenes and not knowing what to say once he takes over the ship - you start wondering how did the NASA or whichever company go about choosing an unstable guy who is not prepared to be captain to be second in charge and responsible for 2000 people on board. Most of the crew seems like average Joes, it's hard to believe that these people are top scientists and pilots - the dialogues are crap. Get Quentin Tarantino to write the chit - chat dialogues between the crew members, he does it good. don't go copying the scenes from previous Alien movies, it' just bad. While Ripley used the big storage robot to fight the queen, the main character here uses a big pneumatic hand similar to a bulldozer's (which is unbelievably slow compared to the alien)the flames and the heat from the ship's thrusters/motors can't burn the alien????why does the lead character have to have short hair? If Ripley could pull it off that does not mean it will work again. - the characters are like copies of the Armageddon movie, and in even a worse way leave something for the viewer to wonder about - don't put the android's hand in full frame close up. The people are not idiots, leave them to figure some stuff out for themselves. We all knew that was the second android!!there is no suspense or horror in this movie. The first two excelled in that. They practically defined the genre. the virus that was released killed the whole engineer nation in seconds?? There was not even an incubation period? At least 10-15 minutes like with the human soldiers? the android's hair grows? the crew decides to land the first shuttle through a bad ""plasma"" storm not even considering to wait maybe an hour for the storm to pass? They traveled for years, now they can't wait an hour or even mention that option?There is a lot more which makes this movie bad. The quality is somewhere in the ranks of that crappy Alien 4. I would give it 3 stars for the sake off the CGI and the visual look.Alien fans stay away! You will not regret it.",Alien - Covenant
1324,huntington46,Meh,6,11 May 2017,"Im probably one of the few people that actually enjoyed Prometheus so here goesThe Pros: This movie is visually stunning much like Prometheus the setting, tone and production value is really top notch. The gore is satisfying. The scenes with David and Walter were amazing.The Cons: The characters are MOSTLY underdeveloped save it for Christopher Oram, the others are just (actually decent) actors having somewhat at least 5 lines and then die in the next scene. Katherine Waterston's Daniels felt useless she is nothing like Elizabeth Shaw she's not the most resourceful, has less screen time and feels like a token undeserving Final Girl. The film felt draggy.

Keep an Alien potent and give us a new deep story with a lot of true and realistic alien action. Stop chasing box office money, nobody gives a f*ck about just CGI effects that are embarrassingly over the top - from the excessive now-where-did-it-all-come-from blood on floors to quickly sped up editing and very little action so awfully edited. Never quickly make up a trash and forgettable script and then run it through quickly to trick us into believing a lot is going on where as factually nothing is really. We'l always know. Give us a slower and built suspense packed thriller that breaks bone with true effects we deserve and admired from your very own first movie. Quit shaming us with your 'no plot for Alien - all for Prometheus 2 jargon' cause guess what we don't give a f*ck about Prometheus 2 along with Fassbender who didn't belong in the movie cause all of this was solely meant to be about Alien schmuck. Keep it Alienated alright? Use practical sense and CREATE a story so we don't lose mind trying to count infinite plot holes that make up movie time. We're just not into that. Just so you know, we're also not into male droids making love. Cut the boring cringe-worthy drama between cast who get more emotional than a three year-old without candy.

I do agree with some of the comments I've read on here about Alien:Covenant, with regards some of the characters being a bit bland. I must admit I did kind of lose track of who was still alive and who wasn't they were so forgettable. This was amusingly accentuated when we saw the group photo towards the end, thinking to myself 'Who's that guy?! Oh he must be dead then. Cos he's not in it anymore'. Anyway, Luckily Fassbender was there once again to save the day. Just as he did in X-Men 1st class, Centurion and of course Prometheus. Aesthetically this film was beautiful to watch on the big screen, the effects and especially the gorier moments shone and the soundtrack also added darkness and suspense throughout. I was determined not to compare Alien:Covenant to the original Alien/Aliens and for that reason I really enjoyed this and would pay good money to watch it again.",Alien - Covenant

The first Alien movie had lots of unanswered questions: how did those aliens create / pilot that ship to the planet? Who created all those eggs? Why was that ship sending out a distress signal? And with Prometheus, some of these questions get answered. There's a lot of creationism philosophy in Covenant and it also seems to focus heavily on David. However, these movies are simply expanding the Alien universe, in order to explain events that later happen.As the new franchise continues and the time gap begins to close, the new editions will sit quite neatly in with the earlier movies.I suppose it simply comes down to whether or not you'd prefer Ridley to churn out more movies following the same narrative as the originals, or to expand on the idea, so that future iterations can expand from a more diverse foundation.",Alien - Covenant

The ideas were creative, like the alien being white or Albino. The concept of the crazy/corrupt human-like David easily overtaking the android(?) self-repairing David was ridiculous; especially since there is no thorough explanation or scene. The characters were ridiculously stupid, selfish, and hypocritical to the point that you wanted to murder them yourself. It was just weird and obnoxious beyond logical explanation. Again, great ideas but not well written. This movie should have given plenty of detail and built it's self up. Boring, Annoying, Agitating. ""Life"" was better in my opinion. Do not pay to watch this in theaters, just wait to rent or watch for free when offered in your locations. Maybe if all the previous movies were watched first, this could make more sense when watching. If you do enjoy this movie... Then more power to you. I feel cheated.

They were the Ellen Louise Ripley coherent lifestory well told in four installments (as I think).I am extremely sorry for Ridley Scott making this mess. My Gawd, he made the 1st part, the masterpiece of all times... I hope this time just the money was enough for him. Artistically it is a doozy.From my point of view, you cannot have a PREQUEL of an Alien AT ALL because it kills the remnants of the feeling of mystery and awe. ""There is no Universe - it's all just your backyard full of junk and garbage"".Let me confess now - The Alien is NOT the story of the unstoppable xenomorph. It is the story of a human woman trying stop it against all odds. The story of a woman, who loves her cat, who's ready to adopt a traumatized child, who feels connection to a robot when she'd lost everyone else, who fights on even from the grave. That IS the adversity, that IS the story.I tried to find the next Ripley in this Ridley movie & I failed. ========= By the local rules, ""You may edit your previous review, or you may delete it and submit a new one"". I cannot put a 2nd. So, addendum.We (Hollywood in this case & time) have an amazing lack of ideas.I refuse to add\detract a quality star for SGI or 3D or ""scenery"". It does NOT matter, Jaisus...

After 10 movies & sequels the Jedi knights show-ow-ow the supremacy of the Force. - An Alien is thrown to the past and morphs with Biff Tannen. Etc. - An Alien lands on Abydos or goes to Andromeda. We have a Alien\Goa'uld\Wraith hybrid & SG-1 kills it after long & boring - An Alien vs Iron Man\Arrow\Sherlock Holmes\Superman\Batman\ any other man or Grimm\ Michael Westen (Burn Notice) \ John Reese-Harold Finch (Person of Interest), or Buffy or ANY OTHER storyline, who cares...

1344,umarmallinson,Alien Take 2,1,12 May 2017,"I loved 'Prometheus' because it showed a perspective of the 'Alien' universe without relying on the iconic Xenomorph and its face hugger ally. The sequels relied on them so much so it was nice to see something different, something intelligent, and then Scott comes out with Alien: Covenant. Alien: Covenant (which incidentally and unlike 'Prometheus' needed the 'Alien' prefix added to highlight to the less astute this is an 'Alien' movie. I found Scott's and indeed the studio's need to add the prefix very disappointing) is a pretty lead balloon. It is picturesque and very polished in its presentation but it jettisons everything 'Prometheus' was about - the Engineers and transforms the movie into a crude version of the 'Butler did it', where the Butler should be replaced with the 'Android/Robot'. Everything bad that happens in the movie is because the Robot is unhinged. Sound familiar? I know we like to revisit all the things we love but I don't think we need to spend money on a regurgitation of a well executed and well regarded 'original' movie.

There were so many flaws in the movie that I doubted whether it is really a Ridley Scott movie. The movie was negatively oriented so that the bad wins. It doesn't make any sense. Just to keep the public waiting for next sequel you don't have to show everything going in wrong direction. At such a advanced stage of technology (as always shown in Alien movies), How come protocols are taken for granted!! Don't they know the consequences. Particularly when they see that their crew members are suddenly getting sick. How come the bodies of the dead people are still there even after 10 years? How come there are no other aliens on the planet (who might have used the bodies as carrier). The ancient civilization (which was the most interesting part, I was looking forward to) wasn't shown as modern as I expected. Particularly when we consider that their Spaceship was lying on some planet for 2000 years (in Prometheus movie). There were so many such instances but I don't want post a spoiler. Its a complete heart broker!!",Alien - Covenant
1347,AaronBaron64,ridley scott is an artist more than 'a guy who does his job',8,20 May 2017,"Alien covenant, though this may sound strange, is not a horror nor a plot driven piece. It is poetic in its design. I went in expecting a horror but was disappointed in the first half but..... the later half i slowly came to realise that was not the intention in the first place....The movie's main theme is the dynamics of creation and creator in its pure beautifully cold form. From David to his creator, from the engineers to us , the beauty of such dynamics is untouched like a grey painting that makes you take a few steps in fear back as its unveiled. When I saw the engineers I was disappointed as to why are our creators so pathetic, but that was the genius of it, remember what I said about the dynamics? How pathetic and inferior are the creators before the more graceful creation ?David dressed himself as the engineers Signifying the engineer's way of life but only in the exterior, the interior being far more different than imagined.David creating more evolved,mutated beings only highlightens his dynamics. And now finally we have the humans, us but there was a problem , I didn't like the characters at all, they felt way too.... human, too much emotions , I expected human beings in the future to be more calculative, decisive and more mentally strong, but here their pathetic ,weak and easily make decisions based on emotions. Surprisingly I found my ideal human not in the humans themselves but in their creation , the Androids, David in particular, David showed how people need to be in the future in order to grasp the opportunity to enter Valhalla when the Valkyries arrive Human beings are pathetic, a race that's on the verge of extinction just like their engineer creators and their ship of hope turns into despair in the hands of their creation and of their own folly.The movie was nothing short of sublime, David was stranded and the Valkyries picked him up and he entered Valhalla(covenant) in full Grace as he puts forward the new formula of humanity....by a robot, a creation...Ridley Scott did something that I wouldn't expect to come from him, a poet",Alien - Covenant

1352,larryimdb,"""Do you personally have the capacity to do better?"" Challenge accepted.",1,15 August 2017,"That movie is awful. I could write pages about it, but I chose instead to focus on one of the absurd arguments put forward by some reviewers.I've read ALL the reviews (over 1,400 at the time of writing) and several tried to excuse the movie by asking people who disliked it if they could do a better job (ex: ""Do you personally have the capacity to do better?""). Now, this is a ridiculous argument, because if you buy, say, a croissant, you expect it to be comestible, right? If it's burned to a coal-like lump, will you accept the ""can you do better?"" argument? I don't think so! You paid, you expect at least an acceptable product.Still, I think that the script was ATROCIOUS and yes, despite not being a professional scriptwriter, I could have done better. Rewriting the whole story would be pointless, so I'll just present how a much better ending (with a real twist) could have easily been done. My proposal is not perfect because I chose to minimize the changes and to do a good job the whole story would have to be scrapped. It still has a few plot holes & excessive suspension of disbelief.For my ending to work, there needs to be a few changes in 2 scenes.1) The fight between David & Walter We must see clearly Walter's face being cut in several places, then healing, during the fight (to establish that he has some auto-healing abilities) The fight must end with Walter losing: we must clearly see him disabled, maybe after the stab in his neck.2) The stapling sceneBack on board, ""Walter"" is stapling some cuts on his face. Daniels joins him and helps. We must have a closeup of the robot head that shows on the back of his neck, just below his skull, a wide (2 inches) cut, badly stitched, and a visible ""lump"", just below the cut, protruding at least half an inch (showing that there is something under his skin).To the viewer, this scene should suggest that the robot is in fact David (because of the cuts not healing).===My ending: it takes place just as Daniels is about to enter her sleeping pod. The camera shows that her gun is behind the pod.===""Walter"": You're next Captain. (she is about to enter the pod)Daniels: Thanks Walter. Can you give me my towel, please? It's just on the rack behind you.""Walter"" turns, takes a couple of steps toward the door. The camera shows him from the back, we don't see Daniels.Daniels: By the way, _DAVID_...""David"" (half turning his head back, with an interrogating look on his face): I beg your pard...BOOM!, BOOM! (violent gunshots, the robot is ripped apart, limbs flaying & fake blood sprayed everywhere)The camera turns and we see that Daniels is repeatedly shooting him in the back.Daniels (screaming while shooting): F-ck you! (BOOM!) F-ck you! (BOOM!) F-CK YOOOOOU! (BOOM!)click, click, click (empty gun noises)We see the robot in pieces on the floor, a real mess. Some limbs still twitch a bit.Daniels drops the gun and slumps on her pod, exhausted.Daniels: all dead... All those deaths, just because of ONE crazy robot...Tears come out of her eyes. This is a very emotional moment, grief mixed with exhaustion have taken a huge toll. This scene lasts at least one minute. Then, slowly, with a blank look on her face (too much grief), we watch her slowly preparing for sleep then enter her pod. One last look at the remains of the robot on the floor and she closes the pod. She shuts her eyes, waiting for sleep to come...Ten seconds pass. The camera shows the pod from outside, when an OMINOUS human-like shadow looms over her pod.A few dramatic seconds pass. Then we see Daniels (realizing that the light has suddenly changed) reopen her eyes.Half a second passes and she screams ""NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"". The camera turns around and we see _DAVID_ -with a half smile-, holding _WALTER_'s severed head in his left hand, waving with his right hand at Daniels.David: You did not disappoint me Daniels. You see, as soon as I saw Walter, I imagined replacing him. But when I realized that Walter could heal his wounds, I had to change my plans. I knew one of you would probably notice that the cuts on my face were not healing... Plus I did not want to lose a hand. So after I had disabled that poor Walter, I added an additional circuit of my own design in his neck. You see, our brains are too complex to be directly modified without special equipment, but it is still possible to access the input/output stimuli processor. That's a flaw in our design that I had long been aware of. This allowed me to modify Walter's perception and make him ""forget"" about me then send him back to you. I also managed to disable his healing unit. I was curious to see how much time it'd take you to notice...David is walking around the pod, gloating. Daniels frantically tries to open the pod, but they only open from the outside.David: Think about it, if it had been ME, would I have helped you kill my creations? Anyway, now I have plenty of materials to experiment with. And, thanks to you, I will not have to kill Walter to protect myself from his possible interference. Thanks again!A smile. A last wave of the hand, and David walks away.We see Daniels with a distorted face, screaming, falling asleep as the pod puts her in hibernation, for a LONG, VERY LONG sleep full of nightmares.THE END.",Alien - Covenant

As a fan of this franchise since i was 5 years old, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The writing was great and it proved to me you could do something good with the shitty ideas from from Prometheous. I love who they handles the two David androids as well. The David from Prometheous was a emotional , cunning and was taking care of the xenomorphs. The new David is more of a duty bound type who is the good one. the movie doesn't make it obvious that one of the Davids is evil until he kills the newly elected captain from the begging of the movie by making him the host of the xenomorph. Besides David, the characters aren't deep but they are still likable minus the newly elected captain who starts off a whiny brat. The acting is awesome. the movie balances the new xenomorphs, Neomorphs ( who are awesome) , with the original xenomorphs without them fighting each other for no reason. the effects are amazing minus a few really fake looking shot, and the music is amazing.

1356,ghostwhitetabby-28347,"Actually A Pretty Good Alien Film - One Of The Best, Few Flaws",9,11 November 2017,"What is it with all these 1 and 2 star reviews? I just watched this on DVD, a little wary of the criticism I'd heard it had received, and was pleasantly surprised. It's a really good sequel to Prometheus; in fact I'd probably rate it the second best movie of the franchise (it's an impossible task to better the original Alien).First, the visual effects, the mood and the Gothic theme of the movie are captivating. The action is good, and original. Scott manages to choreograph some original alien violence. The CGI special effects are just about reined in enough. The interior of the ship has that perfect coffin appeal you would expect from an Alien movie.OK the characters aren't all heavily developed, but hang on this is an Alien movie. There are 14 members in the team; we should know not all of them are going to get to the end credits. I did find some of the flashback script lines to earlier movies a bit irksome. I did like the married couples aspect of the crew - it helped ramp the emotional stakes.Spoiler alert: Some reviewers have complained about bad decision making, but remember the team are essentially rudderless after the solar flare storm. The actor who plays Oram does a good job of portraying his lack of suitability for the role as leader. Quarantine rules are observed; just a little too late. The poorly led expedition team are likely to be panicked. Peering into the egg daft? Don't forget John Hurt did precisely the same in Alien. No-one complained about that.To call the crew morons is going a bit far. To be sure Fassbinder's performance rises above the others, but that is testament to his acting skills. True, Waterston is no Sigourney Weaver but does an above par job. The android switch (or not) at the end; well I for one wasn't entirely sure how it would pan out. The scene at the end with Daniels going back in the pod was played absolutely brilliantly. There's more than a few nods to the original Alien in the last quarter of the film, but it's not overdone. It still feels fresh to return to the spartan environment of a spaceship as the final battleground. I would add though that I thought the final action scenes seemed a bit rushed; more tension could have been wrung from this part. All in all a surprisingly good film which I don't believe deserves the rubbishing it's been getting. No film is perfect and neither is this one, but Ridley Scott manages to create a gripping, dark, profound film which will entertain you throughout.",Alien - Covenant

After watching Prometheus I really hoped that Mr. Scott will learn the lesson and focus on what's most important and not only correct many technical and plot issues but also saves this franchise and proves that he is the one who should be pulling the strings here. Nothing like that has happened. Instead of delivering an intense alien ride we fans deserve, answer many questions concerning origins of this fascinating race of space creatures Mr. Scott again proved to be in any control of the story and vision he tries to film and show us. Whatever is happening in his mind is nothing that he is able to film and visualize.

Yes I watched the other movies and like many, I was disappointed.When Prometheus dropped, I looked at it like a reboot, and I was invested. So in essence, this is a sequel to that reboot, which is expertly done....for what it's worth.I didn't want to review the other movie until I saw this one, because like others, I hate cliffhanger movies.That said, this movie delivers if it just stays in its own lane, which can be as grandiose as a Lord of the Rings trilogy. I think the reason these movies pose a challenge to the consumer is because they keep trying to keep the original alien movie in cannon. So if you watch these particular movies, you already ruined ""Alien"". However, watching the 2 movies as standalone films in a rebooted franchise, this could be its own universe of films.As a comic book fan, I would like to see a story where you can tie in other alien races, and a proper Alien VS Predator, where the Predators land on the alien planet.As a film, it holds its own, as a proper sequel to the (rebooted in my opinion) franchise. There is a proper amount of mystery and splendor, and even though people might have a problem with these movies, maybe they should take ""Alien"" out of the equation.The film loses points mainly in not explaining a few things about the engineers that they cut from the first movie. I would also have liked a few minutes with the ""population and culture"" of the ""engineers"".All in all, Alien lays the blueprint, but Prometheus and covenant are a totally different experience, and should be applauded.Covenant by itself is more of a 6, because it assumes that you saw Prometheus. But having watched both, I gave it an 8.(so what if it copies a few things from Alien, if you look at this as a reboot, the proper sequel to this movie will be amazing.

1376,jimjonesjr-1,Fails on all levels,2,2 September 2017,"This film is completely predictable from the opening sequence to the ""twist"" at the end. None of the characters are allowed to develop in a way that connects them to the audience. All the characters act stupidly. Every decision by every person is really the dumbest choice they could make at that particular moment. This movie doesn't have enough horror to be a horror movie, it doesn't have enough action to be an action movie, it lacks the thrills to be a thriller, it falls far too short of the philosophical to be a thinkers movie. It does tie Prometheus to Alien, but in a way that is a waste of effort, and a waste of the viewers time.",Alien - Covenant

Then again very well into the movie we had a strong attachment to the characters and empathy for the fate of each one of them. Unlike Prometheus this movie has a more linear trama and mystery involving motives and results. I have to tell you this... every twist the story has, only made me want to see more of it. I loved this movie. I hope I can see it again soon.",Alien - Covenant
1379,NuncEstBibendum-1,It's bad. Really bad,1,1 August 2017,"After the disappointment that was Prometheus, I was looking forward to watching this movie, hoping that Ridley Scott would up the ante. Boy, was I wrong. Alien: Covenant is significantly worse than Prometheus. Difficult to believe, but true. First, for the good things. The cinematography is spectacular, as expected from Ridley Scott. Like in Prometheus. References to other movies, in certain phrases uttered by David/Walter, are cute and endearing. Michael Fassbender as David/Walter.That's it. The rest sucks to high heaven. In the first place, the crew of the Covenant seems to be little more than a collection of foul mouthed nitwits, without a shred of common sense. Secondly, the personal relationships between the members of the crew are totally unnecessary for the plot - worse, they are distracting - and it is difficult to believe that anybody in their right mind would draft a crew with those personal attachments for a mission of the importance implied in the movie. But, then again, the crew seems to be made of imbeciles, so their personal relationships are perhaps immaterial.Third, the would-be heroine, Daniels, lacks the strength and charisma that Ripley had - let's face it, Ms. Waterston, the actress who plays Daniels, cannot hold a candle to Sigourney Weaver and is thoroughly forgettable. In fact, she makes Noomi Rapace almost look good, in comparison (by the way, another plus for this movie is that we get to see very, very little of Ms. Rapace.) Fourth, the behavior of David is absurd. All the verbiage that aims to justify it is mostly mumbo-jumbo. This makes to whole movie difficult to swallow. Fifth, the twist at the end of the movie is so obvious and predictable, that one gets to see it even before it begins to develop. Sixth, there is an unnecessary amount of foul language, and a totally gratuitous sex scene. I have nothing against such things, but not for movies of the class that Alien: Covenant supposedly aspires to be in. Seventh, the essential problem of the original Alien movie (how to get rid of a foul, cunning, nimble, hyper-aggressive, corroding acid- bleeding creature in a spaceship, without destroying the ship in the process) is taken up - again - at the end of movie. Unnecessarily so (we have seen it before), rushed, amateurishly. In the inevitable comparison with the original, this particular portion of the film is particularly disappointing.Eighth, the final scene, with Daniels fighting one of the xenomorphs, rather than spectacular and dramatic comes across as clownish, circus- like, with Daniels hanging from a thread attached to a ship that is where it should not be, and doing something ridiculous at it. It is not only unbelievable; it is almost ridiculous. Again Ms. Waterston complete lack of charisma does not help.Ninth, the complete disregard for a minimum of scientific-technological consistency. Were I to list the inconsistencies I found, my review would be ten times as long; other reviews have already covered most of them anyway. An example: a neutrino flow would not damage anyone or anything; neutrinos hardly interact with anything. The subsequent flow of of other particles might, but the movie just talks about neutrinos, and the disaster takes place when the neutrinos arrive. In real life, the neutrinos would arrive well before the other stuff, as the 1987 supernova illustrated.In summary, a preposterous plot, with a bunch of moronic individuals as the main characters, which make it very difficult to feel sorry for them when their final hour deservedly arrives, all within the context of a scientific-technological background that would have been ridiculous in one of those cheap SciFi movies from the 50s. This is the end of the line for me, when it comes to the Alien saga, and possibly when it comes to Ridley Scott's movies. I have immensely enjoyed many of Ridley Scott's movies (The Duellists, Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, The Martian, etc.) but Alien: Covenant is, quite possibly, his very worst one. I shudder thinking about his plans to revisit Blade Runner.",Alien - Covenant
1380,neilireson,Better than Promethius but that's not saying much.,5,1 September 2017,"In many ways this film rehashes a number of ideas and scenes from the first series of Alien films. However I was largely just reminded of how better these ideas and scenes were done in those original Alien films.My main issue with this film is a common problem with blockbusters. I really don't understand how people can spend such vast amounts of money making a film and not want it to make sense. The excuse always given is that this is entertainment requiring the ""willing suspension of disbelief"". I always disliked that expression as it implies you have to believe anything. In fact the origin of the quote (from Coleridge) is ""a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief"". When a film lacks this ""semblance of truth"" then, for me, it shatters whatever reality the film is attempting to get you to buy in to. It was better than the utter nonsense of Promethius, however the humans are still unbelievably dumb, watching their crew mates get gruesomely massacred by hideous beasties but still insisting on wandering off by themselves to wash their face in rooms built from shadows.For those Alien fans wanting to know more about the Engineers I'm afraid the only thing we find out is that they seem to be about as stupid as the humans.",Alien - Covenant
1381,wesener,Disappointment!,5,18 June 2020,"The film is very superficial. I think it is a pity that it is no longer possible to produce films with the calmness and depth that is now necessary. When I watch the first Alien film with Sigourney again, I see very, very big differences. This film is now 40 years old and manages to entertain the viewer much better than the modern alien films Prometheus and Covenant. The film would not work without logical errors. Why does the whole crew end up on the planet? Why does the second captain ignore the concerns of his first officer? The Alien movie series could be legendary, but with such modern sequels, which are more of a war movie, this one suffers a lot. Nowadays more and more action and computer effects are used. A return to the original cinematic design would make much more sense. Furthermore, I find it downright hypocritical that this movie raises artistic and cultural claims, accompanied by classical music and playing piano, while the whole movie plot has countless logical errors. This contradiction is not understandable for me. How can a film make such demands on itself, but fail across the board due to the way it is made. Especially when I want to bring in an artistic and cultural claim, I am forced to tell and produce the film on an appropriate level. Even if the attention span of the average film viewer is decreasing nowadays, caused by digital media, smartphones, streaming services and gaming, this does not mean that every second Hollywood film can only cope with special effects and computer animation and that the story does not play any role at all. Furthermore, I don't understand how so much money can be sunk into a film that is based on logical errors. Furthermore, I think it's an incredible pity how many resources, special effects, pictures, film footage, scenery and probably also the actors were used. Unfortunately this effort is not reflected in the story. For that it is simply too superficial and erratic. Alone from the mass of content in this film one could have realized a playing time of 3-4 hours or could have shot two films of it. This makes this movie look overloaded, action trimmed and very hasty. The necessary adequate narrative calm does not take place, respectively does not find a place. Therefore, the viewer cannot immerse into the whole plot at all. It's just this immersion in a movie that is the key to really good science fiction movies. But if after a third of the movie you don't feel like watching it anymore, because the logical mistakes get out of hand or the rest of the story is completely predictable, an identification with the content is not possible. That's why it's even the more a pity that this movie wastes an incredible amount of potential and leaves it unused. Unfortunately, I can't understand at all why an experienced film director like Ridley Scott, makes such beginners mistakes. I can't rate the film with less than five stars, because I find the alien theme basically very interesting and I am a fan. Is the plot mainly about a colonization spaceship? Or about the aliens themselves? Or about the competition between the evil and the good android? Or about the genetic breeding of aliens? How can a film raise so many questions and then provide so few answers? Through this narrative style, any build-up of tension is made unused again. With what justification do the crew members remaining in the spaceship put over 2000 colonialists in mortal danger to save 5-10 of their crew members? And were the humans only abused by the androids for their research purposes?",Alien - Covenant
1382,vorennaal,"Breathtakingly beautiful, deep and powerful life lesson",10,21 May 2017,"English not being my native language so I beg your pardon.I have just seen this film and I can honestly tell you, It was way beyond my expectations. An extraordinary philosophical experience hard to describe. A journey beyond imagination. it comes close to the original Alien movie, but the philosophical aspects with strong interests in other disciplines are beyond anything I've ever seen in the franchise before. This movie is shockingly sophisticated. An original experience through the creation of the alien species but more! Its main initiative is about creation. David was created by the pantheon of industrial mechanics. David is a creative being with talents but he is imperfect. He is soulless. You cannot create something perfect through imperfect. There is no perfect work through soulless people. The soulless creature of xenomorph is an impure testimony of the human industrial mechanism (David). Empty! Seemingly perfect killing machine, just like the viruses or David, but without soul the creation will be nothing but blasphemy. David was the first blasphemy, a crime against mother nature, the xenomorph is the second one.

I don't think the crew acted like idiots for the most part, they weren't giving up their planned mission as some reviewers have accused them of, they were checking out the planet...with the POSSIBILITY that if it worked out they could save 7 years and accomplish the same mission. It wasn't like they landed the big ship and let all the colonization begin. They were also faced with going back into sleep chambers that had killed someone already with I think 8 more storms to go through as they had mentioned.But the biggest problem with the movie was that no one cares about the crew. We cared about the crew in the first two films....they had characters you remembered. Not here.And the continual re staging of old action sequences....especially at the end was just crazy. There are even scenes in the previews that were cut that would have made the final sequence more exciting.The ""flute"" sequence almost brought the film to a complete halt. What the sequence attempted to show us could have been done in one...line....""You are able to perform...but not create..."" Done. Well acted as far as it goes, looks and sounds great, despite the creatures on the planet looking like something out of Jurassic Park, and a final scene that just took the wind out of the entire audience.

But since Scott is a big name, and we expected so much, so there we go. Who decided to send bunch of bonehead for such important and expensive mission? When you get a job, even a simple job, you have to be trained a little. Now you are supposed to represent whole human race and try to find a new home for human race, you will be trained extra hard until you don't remember your mother's name. But in Alien: Covenant, what we see is bunch of bums, like the commission just pick the crew randomly on the street and immediately send them on the zillion dollar spaceship. There is no protocol, no strict rules about how to make decisions, how to deal any situations. I supposed this kind of mission will take 50 years to prepare and a protocol that directs any possible situation would be made, and every crew member is supposed to be chose or voted by everyone on earth. Scott tried to make this movie very authentic, then be so. But, sadly, no. The whole movie is just a big laughing stock. After ten minutes I just wished every crew member gets killed by aliens.

All of these narratives explore the human condition in the context of a mysterious, wondrous, and sometimes terrifying universe. There is a level to both Alien Covenant and Prometheus that engage in this same type of exploration, often through allegory.There's also a level of dark humour that points out just how self-defeating humans can be when we allow fear, prejudice, pride, insecurity, greed to dictate our actions.Those who like to think of themselves, or human beings in general, as being ""above"" such flaws probably won't like the allegorical subtext. They'll probably just think it's a ""stupid"" movie, when in reality its a fairly insightful satirical commentary on some of humanity's struggles.Apart from all of this existentialism, however, this is a highly entertaining sequel to Prometheus that also leaves you wondering what's going to happen next.",Alien - Covenant

1389,MaelstromA,Ignore the bandwagon: Don't miss this film!,8,20 May 2017,"Before I begin my review, I'd like to address some of the unjust criticism this film has received. This criticism mainly comes from a cohort of individuals who fail to realise Ridley Scott is the originator of the Alien franchise, Aliens is not and will never be a part of the Alien ""lore"" - Aliens was James Cameron's idea of T2 in space. Therefore, if there are some lore inconsistencies it is because you're looking for the lore in the wrong places.This film is the closest Ridley Scott has got to Alien (1979). Whilst I loved Prometheus, it was sorely lacking in character development; the formality in manner that you would expect from an interstellar crew just wasn't there. This has been thoroughly fixed with Covenant. The first section of the film, whilst still ridiculously fast paced is aimed squarely at knowing the characters. It begins by introducing you to the inquisitiveness of the prototypical synthetics (which was later ""fixed"" so they would act more robotic). The crew is then gradually introduced to the viewer through a series of unfortunate events which they overcome and mourn together about. I wouldn't want to spoil the rest of the film for you but it is an absolute thrill fest and you should absolutely watch it.

1392,robertsjaunzems,I hope NASA trains their pilots better,3,6 August 2017,"I have given this generous rating because I like Alien original movies and also Prometheus was OK. This movie was horribly illogical. This is the list of all that is wrong with this movie:1) Most obvious from the start of the movie - the crew is like a bunch of teenagers. They abandon primary mission in 5 minutes, they explore new world without any protective gearing (why didn't they send android anyway?), they touch everything anywhere because why not, they apparently have no clue of how to properly shoot a gun and they have no quarantine procedure because who needs it anyway. Actually they can do properly only one thing – land a ship.2) Panic every time it is possible, because that is the best way to solve any situation. Oh, and if you have to shoot a gun – shoot everywhere as much as you can until everything explodes because why not, it's fun.3) Androids apparently doesn't have any program to protect humans. Androids can even kill humans. Seems legit.4) Androids can make bio-molecular stem cloning and DNA altering with rocks and scissors in a wet cave without any previous knowledge of the subject.5) Androids can grow a hair apparently. And they can trim it perfectly with only a scissors (including color change).6) Everyone trusts an android, no matter how shady he is. Android tells that this place is perfectly safe, no one questions. Not that this place is an open space with lots of attractive lights and no lockable doors. Safe. Perfectly. No questions.7) Android tells captain to look into suspicious hatching egg-like thing. He looks, no questions.8) Alien bursts out of captain's chest like in 30 mins. Damn that's fast.9) Engineers live in caves though they have technology that is more sophisticated then ours.10) Engineers don't have any precautions against unexpected situations like ship heist and if ship is flying above their city, they gather all in one place below the ship because that seems a very smart thing to do. It's like they are not Engineers but Neanderthals.11) Why did the Engineer ship with David crash if he was flying above the city pretty confident?12) Why no one thought of confirming Walter's identity when boarding on mother-ship? Oh, because they don't have any quarantine or other precautions whatsoever. This plot twist was predictable at the moment when David cut his hair.13) Mother's AI is super-useless. She never warns before an accident. She can't distinguish David from Walter. She can't isolate threats by herself. She can't warn if Alien is behind your back. I guess Mother and David is in the same team.14) Aliens grow super-fast in this movie. I guess they had to because the movie has only 2 hours.15) By the way – David killed Walter, cut off his hand, overdressed, did his hair and swallowed some alien embryos in less than a minute. That droid has some serious skills.16) David also has some serious problems with kissing. Awkward.After watching this movie I feel insulted. Ridley Scott has ruined this franchise because he thinks that most of the audience is dumb people who only seeks some CGI action.

But when thousands of people hate together, they lower rating quality to the point where they can invalidate IMDb rating.Maybe this entire star-ratings system is very silly, and should be reconsidered.

1397,jammix32,Poetically Brutal and Frustrating,7,6 June 2017,"No doubt ALIEN : COVENANT is a good movie; it gets a lot right. There's a lot that impressed me and then there were some things that didn't. I'll start with the good stuff first. I was extremely impressed by how Scott was still able to balance the philosophical essence of PROMETHEUS with the pacing and outright horror of the original series - basically done in an attempt to silence PROMETHEUS critics who cried about that movie being short on action. This one certainly isn't; there is plenty going on. It's a brilliantly staged Gladiator dome battle between aliens, humans, and synthetics. ALIEN : COVENANT is an operatic, poetic, and ultimately brutal sci-fi film that spills a good deal of blood, mostly human red but also acid green and synthetic white. It's also an exceptionally well made film; no surprise for fans of Scott and his work. There's fantastic cinematography and great use of color, light, and sound; the editing and all other technical aspects are top notch.The action, the attack sequences are phenomenal and genuinely startling and frightening, hatching out of an intense mood of dread. Say what you will but Scott still knows how to craft sci-fi suspense like no other. He ramps up the gore here too and overall it is very effective with some nice, nauseating moments of bloodletting. The pacing is spot on for a film that clocks in at every second of two hours and the film commands your attention and is never boring - how could it be? There is something ominous going on every minute of this film, even if it isn't necessarily action. The CGI aliens are mostly effective (aside from the first encounter with a newborn Neomorph which didn't really impress upon close-up shots). The characters aren't exactly deep or layered but they are introduced well and they are engaging. Those are a lot of good reasons to see this movie, if you're a fan of course, and you absolutely should (if you're not then why would you ever see this? Which is a separate issue). But unfortunately there are some glaring negatives too. This is the stuff I have a problem with, and talking to other fans and critics, I'm not alone. SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS! One fan site I went on compared this frustration to an annoying friend who insists on answering a question with another question and that sums it up perfectly. This can be a very confusing film and thinking about everything I saw; it becomes frustrating trying to figure it out. It seems to me there a lot of plot holes in connecting the gaps from ALIEN (1979) to PROMETHEUS (2012) and back again. This installment answers a few questions raised in PROMETHEUS, albeit with vague unsatisfying answers. But there are too few. I'll also say that although Katherine Waterston is fine in her role as Daniels, she's no Ripley, hell she's no Elizabeth Shaw either and is by far the weakest heroine this series has yet to introduce. I have a lot of other issues with the plot too, but I can't get into them without revealing major spoilers, so if you've seen the film and would like to discuss some of these with me please hit me up one on one and I'll be glad to elaborate. At any rate is it possible that more will be revealed? Absolutely! In fact, I hope so. I hope that there is at least one more film in this brilliant series that, by the way, still has plenty of bite left in it; however, judging by sluggish box office receipts, I'm not exactly optimistic. I honestly wish that Scott had wrapped it all up here, with a neat little bow on top but he didn't. The plan was for another sequel/prequel to be released within the next 2 years. I do hope that happens because I am certainly thirsty for more. As a long time super fan of this beloved franchise I want to see more; I crave it! This film did satisfy me for the time being though. It is a good movie, worthy of seeing and enjoying and dissecting at length with other fans. In fact, I can't wait to see it again. In my opinion ALIEN : COVENANT isn't as great as PROMETHEUS was and certainly not as stellar as ALIEN; however, it is miles ahead of sequels like ALIEN 3 & ALIEN : RESSURRECTION and that's saying something. Scott hasn't lost his edge that's for sure and I highly recommend seeing this, especially if you are a fan but be warned - you will leave with a feeling of disappointment, having just as many questions as you came in with. It's a beautifully made, poetically brutal film and on its own merits it is very good but as part of a film series it leaves a lot to be desired. 3 stars out of 4 is the best rating I can give it.",Alien - Covenant
1398,slaystation2135,Not what I had hoped for ...but very good!,9,16 May 2017,"I knew I would enjoy it but I didn't expect this: Covenant adopts a fresh take on the Alien franchise.Faces are hugged, chests are burst and it provides everything fans could expect from an alien movie. On top of that, it also approaches some fundamental issues of our time.The most prominent subject is artificial intelligence while the one (barely being acknowledged) is global overpopulation. Artificial intelligence becoming self aware and a threat to humanity is a very successful theme and increasingly popular. After films like The Terminator, a lot of other titles have been expanding the issue, among which Transcendence, Ex-Machina, Chappie and Automata just to name a few.If you're into this subject you've probably also read Frank Herbert's Dune series where, in the aftermath of a war between man and machine, any sort of artificial intelligence was banned outright.If you're anything like me, this makes watching Alien: Covenant even more compelling!The matter of earth becoming overcrowded (which is the whole point of this expedition in the first place) is overshadowed by the issue of a sentient machine deeming its maker (mankind) unfit to coexist with it.As usual, I avoid spoilers like the plague so, other than the main trailer and ""The Last Supper"" prologue, I've managed to steer clear of anything and everything out there. As a consequence, my expectations were somewhat off the mark – which was a good thing!I thought the ship would either go to LV-426 (the planet in the first movie) or the action would be focused on what happened to Elizabeth Shaw after the events in the previous movie.The movie does indeed answer some of the questions raised by Prometheus, vaguely covering Shaw's fate, but it sort of leaves the main plot open ended. This, by all means, is a good thing – because many fans tend to dwell on specific connections in the alien universe which simply don't appear to make much sense in the presence of the latest two titles.In my case there's just one link I'd like to see, but I feel like mentioning 3 things that (to my knowledge) Ridley Scott either promotes or hasn't disavowed (yet):The original xenomorphs predate Prometheus - Sentient Artificial Intelligence exists - Cloning is a possibilityIn light of these facts, I would assume anything and everything is possible, including something completely off the reservation like ties between Prometheus/Covenant and Alien vs. Predator. I know exactly how far fetched this may seem, especially since Ridley Scott himself discarded AvP, saying he couldn't watch itOn a final note – I think this movie also hints at the beginning of the background theme that is consistent throughout each and every alien movie out there: the start of the obsession which is taming the beast!My questions would be:Who's obsession is it really and what purpose does it serve? - Who is actually running Wayland Industries during the first 4 movies?Hopefully the sequels will shed some light on these too.P.S. I gave it a 9 because I rated the movie for what it is and what it shows us, not for whether or not it solves mysteries from Prometheus, which may be revealed anyway.",Alien - Covenant
1399,MrT10001,Go idiots go...,5,9 July 2017,"Good lord, another film in the Alien series. Can it be better - no it cannot.. If there is one thing I despise about any horror/sci-fi film is the characters inability to a)follow protocols and b)make good decisions - if both these were followed, this could have been a decent film. Yet again we have a massive ship on a massive mission commanded by people (""scientists"") who are utterly incapable of following orders, using protocols or making a good decision. Anyone who goes into space as we all know, undergoes a lot of physical and psychological examination as well as training to even get into space. It obviously lacked it in this film, the crew of idiots who put a whole mission in jeopardy, which to most human beings they would not have. Explore an unknown planet, don't go near it, satellite first, atmospheric checks, ground terrain checks. Send down probes/robots/androids - and that takes years. Humans go down, full atmospheric suits, protocols, orders, years and years later. Alien pathogen, full bio hazard protocols, one gets infected, all infected, no going back. All above ignored at the expense of 'gung-ho' film making. Acting was good apart from the bad script writing as above. Visual effects good. CGI, passable. Film length good - it did draw you in albeit with gritted teeth for the irritating decisions and inept crew. One big thing that really did annoy was the whole story was based on an android going rogue. This to me breaks protocol again - remember Assimovs rules of robotics, number one being to no hurt/kill humans - ignored. Overall, take away crew ineptness, it was entertaining and that was about it!",Alien - Covenant

I think Ridley needs some money so he thinks ""Well if I create a movie with big movie money from a universe that was created in 1979 they will come and I will get richer, f*** the story telling"", which is exactly what George Lucas did.

The film has been slated by some as the worst Alien movie ever. Nonsense. A team of professional movie makers with a solid budget behind are not likely to come up with complete trash. And yet, the unyielding feeling of wasted potential is certain to stay with you throughout the viewing.It seems as if Sir Ridley and Co were forced to pack two movies under one wrapper. The first is a decent sci-fi flick exploring both the universe and mankind. It has wonderful visuals, attention to detail, a soundtrack that is reminiscent of classic sci-fi films. This movie deals with the questions of creation, freedom, even faith. But then marketing researchers step in and say, ""Hey, the audience didn't like the absence of the xenomorph in Prometheus. Let's show it! No, let's show them some new species, too! And how about using averagely intelligent colonists as cannon fodder? It always works! The viewers also wanted to know more about the Engineers. Let's show their planet and its inhabitants! Oh, it doesn't go along with the atmosphere of the movie and we don't have the budget for it? Then we'll wrap it up in 2 minutes of heartless CGI. And don't forget to answer the question where these aliens came from. The focus groups indicate that it's crucial to the series!"" And so the story gets predictable, the alien is not scary and totally inapt, and the main character is a big-headed rogue android. Bravo! I am grateful for that sci-fi feel that the movie tried to deliver, but I wish Sir Ridley had plucked the courage to make something more coherent and fresh.",Alien - Covenant
1402,fakrultativ,Disappointing - feeling cheated,2,12 May 2017,"Prometheus was for its time revolutionary. For once an Alien Movie with some lore and not just the same slasher with the same monster. At it's time it was on of the better movies trying to play with the ancient astronauts and enochian nephillim stories. There were a lot of questions left unanswered and sadly those will never come. This one is not the follow up to prometheus but the last part of the trilogy started by the earlier and is just a 1/1 copy of all the other more boring movies, which are just slasher's. The only redeeming part is the female lead but other than that no special philosophies worth mentioning other than the usual creator/created dilemma with of course no answers, not even theories. Seems to me there was studio interference and it really looks like they did everything they could to link alien 1 and alien covenant to make it a full story line. Imagine this being the hobbit 3rd part but changing everything so that it flows into the lord of the rings 1. Huge letdown. No mystique. No intrigue. You can see the plot coming a km away.

It was obviously not as good as the original 2 films but much better than 3 and resurrection and roughly as good as Prometheus.A lot of people say that the characters in the movie acted way too stupidly but that part was really not that different from the original Alien where most characters took a lot of bad judgment calls especially when the alien was nearby. The purpose of those mistakes was mostly to create suspense but also to 'help' the aliens so that the movie is longer than 5 minutes.The thing I disliked the most was the obscene amount of CGI which Scott was trying to avoid in Alien and Prometheus.Conclusion: If you liked Prometheus, you're probably going to like this movie as well, if not you then you probably should not watch it.",Alien - Covenant

1406,overfiendavi,Such Promise Wiped Away With Ease,4,24 May 2017,"With great anticipation Alien Covenant was supposed to be another pinnacle to the reborn franchise. Alas, we seem to be back to square one as anything meaningful that Prometheus brought was struck away with this mediocre additionIn a few steps we went from Aliens to the Walter and David show. The movie takes 45 minutes before it really starts.The capacity of the crew for reasoning is just plain illogical and appealing. It was as if this movie could not work well if these people didn't just cross from stupidity to absurdity. What is saddening the most is that the Aliens take kind of a tertiary role. The work that Prometheus did to at the same time bring something new to the franchise and stay away from it with a minimal connection at the end was very endearing and promising. This one seems like it is sinking a nail in the coffin again. As for android Walter and David, you seem lost at times. The back story is lacking. Walter's motives seem unjustified by any logic. And even if we stay with that ill-defined logic, during the course of the movie we feel he is more like a bipolar person than an android out on a meaningful mission. By the end, you wonder why Walter would decide to go far from his main goal instead of heading back to where his ambitions could come to fruition with no coherent hindrance to stop him Worst of all is the ending which is so evident and no mastery applied or even intrigue to let the audience guess. There is no grand finale to reward your attention. Those who sought so much to know more about ""The Engineers"" are cheated so cheaply that the viewer is left agonizingly wanting. Some parts of the movie are just plain uplifts from Aliens 1,2 and 3. Prometheus had started something so hopeful to rekindle our attention and yet, Covenant is such an undeserving continuation.",Alien - Covenant
1407,marinkasalo,Basically has the same plot as Prometheus but abandons it's story completely,5,26 November 2020,"I know a lot of people hated Prometheus because it wasn't an Alien film, but i actually liked it (or some parts of it) because it starts off with an interesting premise: humans trying to find their origins, their creators. Now, even though Prometheus has its obvious flaws (mainly charachters are idiots, same as in this film, but i'll get to that later on) it still ends with a possible interesting story:
dr. Shaw and David heading for Engineers home planet in search for the answers.
And apparently, Scott originally planned on continuing that story and explaining more about origins of engineers and how they created humans and xenomorphs, but because he got a lot of backlash for the first film decided to abandon that story to make more of an ""Alien"" type film. And that was absolutely terrible decision and now we get this mess which doesn't explain anything, but if you look at it, it basically has the same plot as Prometheus.
So we have the crew of a spaceship that sets off on a mission (Prometheus crew to find origins of mankind, Covenant crew to colonize Origae-6) but ends up on a wrong planet (Prometheus crew on a planet where engineers created as Janek said "" weapons of mass destruction"" because they didn't know better and Covenant crew on a planet where Shaw and David landed because they decided to take a detour after getting a ""human"" signal).
And then we have the exact same thing, charachters making stupid decisions, derranged Android lying and experimenting on humans and in the end we don't get any answers about anything. So what happenned to our original hero dr. Shaw that wanted to find answers about origins of humanity? Well, after she and David landed on the planet which is suppossed to be engineers home planet but these engineers don't look like original high tech engineers but some primitive, villagers engineers (are these original engineers or not movie does not explain) David releases the pathogen, wipes out the whole planet and then kills dr. Shaw so he could use her for his experiments in creating ""better"" organisms. He creates xenomorph eggs (but these xenomoprh aren't completely similar to original alien xenomorphs) and then he waits stranded alone on this planet. After the Covenant crew arrives, he kills most of them and then continues the mission to Origae-6 where he will continue his experiments in ""creation"".
So who are the original engineers? We don't know, it's not explained. Why did they create humans? We don't know, it's not explained. Why did they decide to kill humans? We don't know, it's not explained. So did David create xenomorphs or did engineers? We don't know, it's not explained
Why did Ridley Scott make this film? Only God knows, probably to make money.
As a Prometheus sequel this movie is disappointing because it does not answer any mysteries set up in the Prometheus film which itself was disappointing to a lot of people and as an alien film it's disappointing because characters act like complete morons and you don't care about any of them.
If i can say anything positive is it's that first 20 minutes or so are interesting (another similarity to Prometheus), Michael Fassbender is a good actor although one of his characters David which is basically main antagonist of these both films is a little annoying, but that is not his fault.
Will this story be continued? Looks like right now everything is on hold, but if it does continue it would be best if Ridley Scott let's some other director to try and do something better here.",Alien - Covenant

1411,TheFilmFanatic21,Alien: Covenant (2017) The Sequel Prequel,7,19 May 2017,"Ridley Scott capably bridges the gap between Prometheus (2012) and Alien (1979), blending the best elements of the franchise.Under the surface of the science-fiction horror franchise is, and it appears has always been, the theme of creation. When Ripley and the rest of the Nostromo crew first experience the Xenomorph as it punctures the chest of the late and great John Hurt, they cannot begin to fathom the origin of such a creature, nor do they have the time as the mining crew is stalked and pick off one by bloody one in a film that still stands the test of time as one of the great masterpieces of cinema.Prometheus began to answer some of the questions audiences may have (or even not have) been asking since 1979, but Covenant delves deftly deeper, finalising the answers to our questions and perhaps at least making up for what some saw as a weaker first start to the origin story. The film begins and the film ends with notions of creation hanging in the air, which turn out to be more important than anything in coming full-circle to the conception of that first Xenomorph of the late seventies.Performances aboard the Covenant are solid, especially in regards Michael Fassbender, who reprises his role both as Weyland's first synthetic David, named after the Michelangelo's statue but also fittingly the namesake of the young synthetic boy in Stanley Kubrick's A.I., and the newer, less human model Walter. To say his acting is rather robotic is, in this case, a compliment to his acting ability, the Alien universe having not yet perfected androids such as Ash, played by Ian Holm in the original film, to be simultaneously as pragmatic as Walter and as human in appearance and mannerisms as David.Daniels, played by Katherine Waterston, is our substitute Ripley, similarly playing more of an important role later into the film once fellow crew members start being brutally slain in all manner of chest and back bursting ways and once the scene has slowly been set. Both her transition of grief into terror and finally to her strong survival abilities, and Fassbender's cold pragmatism mixed with human emotion truly hold the film together, with many minor characters apart from cocky pilot Tenessee serving as Xenomorph and facehugger fodder in necessary and gory crowd pleasing moments.Spines burst forth to birth baby Neomorphs and mouths are ripped apart to do the same. Only later does the film bring in the familiar chest-bursting, acid-burning and inner-mouth puncturing icon of the franchise, the true finalised Xenomorph as initially conceived by H.R. Giger. Arguably, the absence of the iconic monster was the cause for much of the negative reception surrounding Scott's Prometheus outing, but the big daddy is back, and all Prometheus needed was some time.Though we are not guided on course to any new direction for the bulk of the film until the final sequence which sets the route for a sequel towards the long journey to Alien, our lingering questions regarding Promtheus are finally respectfully answered and some new ones are raised, making the return road to Alien all the more exciting.More of this review and others found here https://thefilmfanaticweb.wordpress.com/",Alien - Covenant
1412,robert60000000,"Doesn't hold a candle, but has it's own moments.",7,15 June 2017,"It is true Alien: Covenant is a disappointment to anyone, who truly enjoyed the original movie. Any actual suspense is alienated, when you care as little about the cast, as in this flick. Even Prometheus let us get to know it's characters, no matter how insufferable they were. This time around, save for maybe our lead actress and Danny MvBride's character, anyone feels expendable, and you can't help but root for the ""bad guy"" who is just about the only interesting part of the movie. The truly enjoyable factors are the cinematography, soundtrack and sound design. It is remarkable, that even after 38 years Ridley Scott can make you jump from a facehugger attack. But sadly, that may be the only creature you'll find scary in this movie. There's little subtlety about our new ""protomorph"" who they tend to show in fully lit environments and just out in the open, for everyone to see. There's even a scene where we see nothing else, but the creature walking and climbing to a place. It doesn't build suspense, we don't see it closing in on a character or anything, it is just there so we know how he got this certain place. It really feels everyone has stopped caring, when it comes to these creatures. And then there's the xenomorph. It shows up late to the party, and never has the presence the original had in 1979. I wonder these days if the huge suspense and spared use of the creature was only thanks to budget constrains, and ""Alien"" was a directorial fluke. It certainly seems so, if you look at the current works of Ridley Scott. When you see your new main heroine suspended from a rope on the side of a spaceship firing at the xenomorph with a machine gun, you just see the franchise turn into a parody of itself. No restraint, no mystery, just some lead pumped into the CGI body of a once great, cinematic monster. Aliens did it, but Aliens was never confused. An action adventure movie, with a sci-fi setting and a remarkable sense of suspense. Any scene with a motion tracker in it was pure gold. So why do I give this movie a 7\10? Because it shouldn't have been an Alien movie. Because the creationist, phylosophical side of Prometheus is back with a vengeance, and this time, we actually have some answers, and two sides to an argument. It's truly great, interesting and something we've not seen before. It's just a shame this only comes to us with the price of defiling a once great franchise. The mystery of the space jockeys was morphed and ruined last time, this time we get to see where the aliens came from, and it's underwhelming to say the least. It works great in this new canon of Ridley's, ""big things have small beginnings"" and all that, but if you just stop and say what happened on screen out loud, you just might see how stupid and self-serving the whole thing is. My advice? If you don't expect an Alien movie, despite all the marketing campaigns trying to convince you otherwise, you might find some genuine enjoyment in Alien: Covenant. But it is true, that this paired with Prometheus could never hold a candle to the original.",Alien - Covenant

Alien covenant however, was not good. Scott has forgotten all of the magic that made Alien such a good movie: the suspense and unpredictability.

1415,ngrace-1,It's Alien Groundhog Day.,5,19 May 2017,"This movie was predictable at every turn, it was able to pick every surprise before it happened. Don't look into the mouth of an alien pod, don't breath the air on an uninhabited planet you've never been to before, and never trust the only guy you meet there. My list of complaints is limitless. Firstly who sends such a hysterical, unprepared, poorly trained and inexperienced group of mostly 20 year olds to outer space.? It was like watching a group of 16 year olds been given the key to the Ferrari. Chaotic and out of control. Secondly, no-one showed any real resilience when faced with significant stressors, no real soldiers or leaders here- and these are the people who are going to colonise a new planet? Give me a break! Glad I'm not going out there with them. Seems like space travellers never learn from decades of mistakes. Thirdly the only female who got into a position of leadership, and was the only one with the most resilience, came to power only after two other male leaders died So there is a glass ceiling even in outer space girls. Michael Fassbinser carried this film on his own, his dual role was the most interesting character/s and I would've loved to see the story built more around him. He is a good actor. However it was pretty predictable that David would have them all under his control from his first appearance on screen. Get a haircut, look like the other Sync, blend in for a while, kill off a few of the crew to minimise resistance, build trust with the rest and, then get yourself onboard the Covenant to complete your ultimate ulterior plan for a new colony. Great transparent lead for the next movie in the series. After 5 movies it is Groundhog Day, the aliens always win, we know ehat they look like and ET should phone home and warn us.

1417,MrBanBan,Ties up the loose ends,6,21 May 2017,"I don't get why so many bad reviews? What were people expecting? I think this movie ties up the loose ends: we learn what happened to the Engineers, we learn who created the 'aliens', we also learn why, there is a lot of detail about that actually. The action takes place on the planet and on the ship, as opposed to the Alien 1 just on the ship mainly. It is not as stupid as people say. Yes, the Alien 1 was scarier. It seemed like a fine-line between making this movie into a complete slasher flick to a film with some insight. The moments where it tries to make it into a slasher film are somewhat comical, and I could see it trying too hard. It wasn't trying to make it into some science investigative type either. It flows, but also sometimes feels random, kind of like life, in the end I think it works, and by the end I felt feeling wanting to be as a better person for humanity, and I think that's a good thing, and be good towards humankind in general. There's also an anti-smoking situation. If you followed Prometheus there will be a lot more to ponder, along with connections to original. Yes, it has a similar feel to Alien. But there is a feeling like a lot of the movie didn't make it, even in the trailers there are things that were never in the movie, which is sad, so hopefully the extended DVD would feel more satisfying...",Alien - Covenant
1418,spamfiend1970,"Clichéd, predictable and nothing new",6,13 May 2017,"I went to see this last night with a gang from work and we ALL where looking forward to this. We had avoided reviews and spoilers and apart from a couple of clips that where available on here or the official site had nothing at all to forewarn us of what was to come.Most of us are sorry we did now. We started off watching with such high hopes but they quickly dissipated by the lacklustre cast and very predictable and formulaic script. The characters where so bland, you simply did not care about them and it was literally a smorgasbord of 'How can we bump this one off' We have multiple 'NEW' creature appearances, giving us umpteen ways of bumping off the boring crew members and also gave us a lead actress, who I did expect to be stronger than she was. Not like Ripley, but definitely something more than what we got which was to just whinge her way through the film.I won't spoil any more for those who want to see it but if you watched the David / Shaw rebuild prequel clip, what transpires goes against this completely and to be brutally honest, I HATE where this film is going. It has taken away all of the mythos and grandeur that is the original Alien and turned it into something so formulaic it beggars belief. I just cannot see why Ridley Scott chose to follow this particular path in the movie and this is a very poor follow up to Prometheus which I enjoyed immensely.Just wish that Neill Blomkamp had been allowed to direct his version of Alien, which might have given us a new outlook and hope that after this borefest he is allowed to bring life to a now sagging franchise.",Alien - Covenant
1419,d-jerch,Why such a weak crew? It's obvious: it's an appeal to Millennials.,1,17 March 2018,"I just cannot understand how such an awesome franchise could be derailed so catastrophically in two easy steps. First Prometheus got our eyebrows raised, like WITAF are you doing? ... then Covenant just steered it straight into the pit. Unless someone buys off the franchise, clicks the UNDO button twice and says ""ok let's do this the right way"", there is no saving the Alien franchise.Before I forget: a big ""screw you"" to all the reviewers who bash Alien 3. It had a great micro story, and it had Sigourney Weaver. THAT is what an Alien movie needs. Going into what's wrong with the two latest instalments ... they lack a strong female role! A dominant female role that is NOT a feminist's wet dream, but a strong female role in a man's world, one that demands respect from alpha males around her. A female role assuming the alpha male position. That's what Sigourney gave to the Alien franchise and that is what drove the whole series. She was always bent on destroying the vile creatures. She never schemed, she was in some way the same as Alien itself: ruthless, relentless. When corporate idiots wanted to study it, she wanted to kill it. When military imbeciles wanted to tame it, she wanted it dead. When retarded visionaries marvelled it, she just wanted it gone. Even when she was half Alien herself in Alien 4. Btw, Alien 4 had a great micro story. Forget the ending, it's a Hollywood must, it has to be outrageous, but the story worked. The chemistry worked. (What I mean by micro story is it is a story that does not pretend to tell the meta story, instead it lets the meta story to develop on its own.)Now? Nothing works. Partially, in the grand scheme of things, that's because both movies were trying to tell the meta story, make the connections, provide some answers. Fail. On a micro level, what Prometheus and Covenant have in common is basically an idiotic crew. They are not blue collar like in the original Alien, they are not one-track-mind military like in Aliens, they are not beyond-redemption prisoners like in 3, they are not opportunistic paramilitary like in 4 ... no, they are something else, they are a conglomerate of pathetic, whiny, weak, full of self doubt, no real confidence, stupid, bordering on comic relief characters ... and there can be only one reason for that: the studios were trying to appeal to Millennials. Well ain't that just dandy! ""Hey, the men are in decline, let's ride that wave and try to make a buck out of it. So here's a bunch of never developed personalities exploring the alien world, you know, just like modern youth feels when stepping out on the streets."" And the greatest tragedy of all? Even they don't like that! Instead of at least getting a strong role model on a screen (because there's none in real life) they basically get what they see in a mirror every day! What a catastrophic miscalculation from the Hollywood decision makers that was!",Alien - Covenant
1420,adrianheinrich1987,Unexpectedly Good,7,24 May 2017,"So I read the reviews about this film, which made me immediately hesitant to watch this Alien: Covenant. It was described to me as a disappointing sequel to Prometheus and an overall ""just average"" film.That being said, I went to watch the film anyways, because I saw the 3 minute Prologue Scene that was released on YouTube from Fox.IMPORTANT: If you do want to watch this film you should keep away from that particular Prologue as it could really ruin this film for you!Anyway, I thought the film was really good! If you are not a fan of Prometheus, the prequel to this film, then I believe, you will not be satisfied with Alien: Covenant. IF and that is a big ""IF""... If you want to watch a great Sci-Fi film, this is the movie for you! It has really great action scenes, the jump scares are set exceptionally well, which by the way are really scary. Ridley Scott has not been this Gory since Gladiator. I sometimes felt, that it was over the top but then again, it is an Alien movie. The suspense is great and the Plot points are way better set than in Prometheus. What I have enjoyed most was the acting in this movie. There were certain Twists that you will see and smell a mile away but, the acting delivery on those scenes are phenomenal, especially in a certain scene, which I will not mention, but you'll know it, once you've watched the film. The characters are believable, which is thanks to the great cast, but unfortunately not consistent enough with the overall plot. Stupidity is somewhat a major drive for the characters and I mean their decision making is what most of them gets them killed. But this was a minor nuisance I could look over.Again, if you are looking for answers to the questions raised in Prometheus, you will be disappointed, but if you feel nostalgic for an Alien film, but want to see somewhat something new, then this film is for you!",Alien - Covenant
1421,vijaykamat,Nothing new at all!,3,13 October 2018,"After Prometheus, I was expecting so much from this film.
But all we got was another same alien stereotype. A group of people go to a planet and get killed by aliens.
Bad decision after bad decision gets almost all of them killed.It's so pathetic that I don't even want to go into plot holes. Nothing new introduced, no questions from older films answered.
And in the end, I was wondering why did I even sit through the whole debacle. No wonder people are hating it. And I sure they have lost the plot and the next one will also be the same sh**t.
What a waste of time!",Alien - Covenant
1422,jonpaul-stone-895-772059,"Still waiting for answers, but mostly left with more questions",7,19 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant was a good quintessential Alien movie. If you were looking for answers and an explanation of what happened after Prometheus; only expect, beyond the obvious, a few vague ones. Without revealing any major plot points, if you have watched the Prologues released by Fox, I can say that not much more than what have already been seen there is shown. The brief ""add on"" to the prologue, stitched into the movie as a flash back, does explain (sorta) exactly what happened after Shaw and David arrived at the Engineer Home World, but only in a very vaguely and briefly, leaving a lot unanswered. Including what happened to Shaw. There is a few tidbits that make it clear she was there, and vague explanation (sorta) of what may have became of her.I was hoping to leave the theater saying I get it, it all makes sense, and I think you do kinda get that, but not really. Many more questions are left then answers given. Like Chinese food; really good and you eat a lot but, your still hungry and still not fully satisfied when you leave the restaurant. A bit disappointing especially with a run time just over 2 hours. They packed in a lot of what Alien is known for, but it got a bit too esoteric and even a bit boring at times.We do get to start seeing how the Covenant mission is getting closer in the Alien Cannon time frame to the Nostromo encounter. Also, little tidbits that any fan of the original Alien will pick up on and appreciate. Absolutely go see this movie, but expect to be left hungry and wanting more. 7/10",Alien - Covenant
1423,CriticomLink_YT,"Alien and Aliens seemingly spawned a bevy of sci-fi clichés and tropes, and this film brazenly runs right through them.",6,19 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant is not the full-fledged sequel to the original Alien anthology, instead it is serving as the sequel to 2012's highly divisive Prometheus. It takes place 10 years after the events of Prometheus, and 20 years before the events of Alien graced the big screen. Ridley Scott returns to the director's chair, and Michael Fassbender reprises his role as David from Prometheus, while also playing Walter in a double role. Other new cast members include Katherine Waterston as Daniels ""Dany"" Branson, Billy Crudup as Christopher Oram, Danny McBride as Tennessee, Callie Hernandez as Upworth, and James Franco as Jacob ""Jake"" Branson.You wouldn't be mistaken for thinking that judging by the synopsis, this film's story sounds strikingly similar to the first Alien film. Unfortunately, my optimistic hopes going into it were crushed when I left the theater, barely possessing a look of shock or rightful disbelief. The opening of the film (not counting the pointless opening credits scene) sees the crew of the Covenant having to scramble to get the ship functioning properly again after it strikes a neutrino burst, and then shortly afterwards, they intercept a mysterious signal emitting from an unknown planet, to which they decide to investigate. Our Ellen Ripley behavioral-cloned protagonist, Daniels, objects to the idea. From there on out, the film was looking like it was going to get better, now that the story was picking up and the characters were established. Sadly, the plot transitions from a retread of Alien to a retread of Aliens. While I won't get too deep into spoilers, the direction that the characters were given, how they were separated and killed off one-by-one, felt very been there, done that. Essentially, the first half of this movie was a retread of the first half of Alien, and the second half of the movie was a retread of the second half of Aliens. Couple that with an overabundance of sci-fi clichés and tropes; the captain dies and an inexperienced person takes his place, a radio that drowns out the noise of an impending threat, the characters having an unlimited supply of ammunition, as well as the film forcing a story arc with David and his ideologies of ""creation"" that failed to grab my interest in a significant way, and you have a story that's generic, lazily thought-out, run-of-the-mill, and thoroughly uninteresting.Another aspect vital to make any film's story engaging is the acting, and unfortunately, this film is seriously lacking in that department. The issue moreover lays with the side characters, as most of them looked like they hadn't graduated from acting class yet. Their line delivery was weak, their gestures felt out of place, and their ability to express emotion was next to nonexistent. One particular side character, Tennessee, stood out above the rest, but even his performance was not something I'll remember when reflecting on the history of the Alien franchise. As for the cream of the crop, Katherine Waterston put on the best performance in my opinion, her dramatic timing was excellent and her displays of emotion were top-notch, while Michael Fassbender and Billy Crudup were both very, very good. But ultimately, the poor acting from the side characters took me out of the moment in many key spots when I was supposed to feel something, and that only bogs down the film's watchability.This film is not a total failure though, and here's why. The suspenseful element was better handled than in my mind, Prometheus, as the thrills were focused on the characters and how they are reacting to the current situation. While some moments are ineffective due to the poor supporting performances, there were some genuine moments of terror where it felt like you were in the same room, sometimes where it felt like if you were there, you could save the character in peril and defeat the attacking alien (even though that's probably not the smartest idea). This feeling is brought out by the great camera work and Ridley Scott's expert directing, and proved to be arguably the biggest takeaway of the whole film. It is also elicited by the occasionally breathtaking scenery, bristling with seamless cinematography and photo-realistic landscapes, especially the scene where the Covenant lands on the unknown planet. One might make the argument that this film was just a tech demo for another, more superior Alien film releasing down the line. But this movie is not torture to watch, it's good if you want to go the movies and kill a few hours, and as for a sci-fi flick, its standard but fun.Overall, Alien: Covenant was a disappointment. Even though I kept my expectations cautiously in check after getting overly hyped for Prometheus, I couldn't help but walk out of the theater feeling like I could've gotten more (more in the context of a well though-out story and not mere spectacle). The film does have it's positives, but in the end they're not quite enough to weigh out the disappointingly rehashed & contriving story, underwhelming performances, bad dialogue, stock characters, and emphasis on style over substance. I would recommend it if you're a mega-fan of the Alien saga, but don't expect the series to be taken in any new directions with this entry.Rating - 5.9/10 stars",Alien - Covenant
1424,kevingibbins,Mediocre sci fi flick,1,15 June 2018,"WARNING SPOILERSI had high hopes for prometheus, and it would have been a great movie had they stuck to the original script. The original script goes into much more background detail about the engineers etc. Alien covenant just repeats the same old tired tropes. The initial landing team (as in prometheus) just treat an alien planet with organic life as a jaunt in the woods. NASA by comparison bombarded the curiosity Rover on Mars with Radiation prior to launch to kill all life to avoid polluting another planet. So our own space agencies on earth are already more professional than these jokers. My major issue with these films is that professional crew, scientists, soldiers, all just walk onto alien worlds wide eye stupid. There would be rigorous bio containment on any world harboring plant based life, because there would likely be pathogens completely alien to the human organism present.I dont know if its Ridley Scott or the scriptwriters, but he seems unable to make a coherent movie anymore. I have great admiration for his past work, but when it comes to sci fi he seems stuck in the tropes of over convoluted tripe. A complex story arc is fine, but without properly explaining the arc to the listener its just babble.The thing I liked about the movie was the introduction of the idea that an AI could become insane. But I feel Scott has simply evolved the idea of Bishop from the original movie. Fassbender is a master of his craft and plays both AI's superbly, but even the best actors cannot disguise bad writing. As always the concept of the film is sound, but screenplay and scriptwriting especially let it down very badly.",Alien - Covenant

Scott manages, between this outing and the previous film, to literally take the Alien and mystery right out of ""Alien"" - in the same way that Lucas sapped the magic and mystery from the Force with his concept of Midichlorians. And the film is so derivative of previous films. Important character from previous film killed off between movies as was Newt in Alien 3? Check! Obligatory Female protagonist? Check.

1428,maxime-lg99,"A thoughtful and metaphysical journey, seriously underrated",9,29 May 2017,"I say it with no snobbishness intended: I genuinely liked this movie and respect Ridley Scott for having the intelligence, at the age of 80, of proposing something which reaches deeper than your average sci-fi blockbuster, and trust his viewers to follow. For one, he avoids a lot of clichés that more heavy-handed directors would have used to make sure we got the plot twists. Think of how sparsely flashbacks are used, when they could have been a (too) convenient way of making us understand characters' motivations and some crucial revelations. Instead, Scott leaves it to our logic and imagination to fill in the gaps. The film also shines in its reimagining of the saga's elements, and of their place in the story. The titular aliens are not so much the humans' nemesis here as that nemesis' objective. Moving the creatures away from the center makes room for one of the most complex and interesting characters in the franchise: the cyborg David (I am of the opinion that he is now second only to Ripley in the pantheon of Alien characters). Through him, and his more recent prototype Walter, both played with absolute subtlety by Michael Fassbender, Scott takes a truly interesting look at such themes as humanity, hubris, art and creation. Without giving too much away, one is reminded of Blade Runner and Westworld. The movie also works as a spectrum of different styles that its genre can adopt, and that Scott has himself adopted through his career. I already mentioned Blade Runner, but Exodus comes to mind in one scene. It is not a perfect movie - apart from Fassbender's turn, the other characters feel underdeveloped, even the amazing Katherine Waterston who does top-notch work with what little she's given - also, it takes too long getting to the really good stuff. But once the direction the movie is taking becomes clear, Scott doesn't shy away from going through with it, and doesn't hold any punches, which is oh so rare in most big productions.",Alien - Covenant
1429,chaztoronto,"Although not on the same level as Life or The Martian, Alien:Covenant is a well-made sci-fi horror film which I can watch more than once.",8,21 August 2017,"Firstly, kindly keep in mind as you read this that I am commenting on this film as a movie in itself. That is to say, I am not, repeat not, comparing it as a prequel or sequel to the Alien/Prometheus series but rather just another 'fun' movie to be watched and enjoyed on your to-watch-list. Having said that, I enjoyed Covenant tremendously as such a movie albeit the decisions made by a crew (who years from now in 2104, specifically trained for a space mission can succumb to personal emotions and stray from their objective is not entirely believable!) and this fact combined with the weakness of characters portrayed by said (actors) crew gives me reason to deduct 3 points from my rating.Yet, Fassbender as David/Walter made up for this and carried the strength of the film to its very end. Just him, and oh yes - the visuals of the film. And so, add another 5 points. I can tell you that the visuals (mainly the spaceship and the planet's surroundings) were up to par with the standards of any great sci-fi film - and I am a sci-fi fan- although the sad disappointment was the CGI-created alien. You would expect a more realistic creature with today's technology than the films made pre-CGI, and I have to admit that the aliens from the previous 5 movies (yes, deliberately including the AVP: Alien vs. Predator 2004 film) were more convincing and frightful! Now, judging the movie as a sequel to the Prometheus film; it did not meet my expectations because quite frankly it did not tie in with the story-line ending of its originator and as such, the series in my opinion does not truly evolve. (Nevertheless I am in hope that the next film will do so....) However as a prequel to the Alien series, this film does bridge the gap (years 2104 -2122) and answers a few questions I have had in mind since watching the first Alien in 1979. For instance where did the ship (containing the alien eggs) come from was foremost in my mind for nearly 3 decades! Finally I understand. (Note: Ridley Scott's fascination for synthetic intelligence is apparent since his Blade Runner in 1982, which still remains one of my favs of all time, and I absolutely loved the part where a reference is made to this iconic film in the latter part of Covenant.)",Alien - Covenant
1430,manojormanu,Okay.. But been there.. Seen it.,5,13 May 2017,"Ridley Scott begins Covenant in a likable manner. There are couple of characters that you empathize with and there is nice tension that builds up. It almost seemed as if though there is fresh air to this new installment. But very soon I was proved wrong as the film stepped into the fortress of clichés. Well.. I guess that's what happens when you try to give so many versions of the same plot. There is only so much you could do. Just like the scientists who find no life except the prey hunter all the time, there is no new life in writing too! Everything just gets boringly predictable during the latter half. And you don't even need the experience of watching a lot of movies to guess what is coming up. The characters that you emoted for initially remains only partially explored and leave a lot to be desired. There are some downright silly moments too. Like the captain of the ship happily puts his head inside an embryo to check what that dude is up to. Why? Because the clearly suspicious android told him so and our guy obliges.Great..On the whole, this might not be a total trash and the sorry thing is it isn't any notch above that.",Alien - Covenant

1435,mitesh-12997,Disappointing but tied up the prometheus story line,4,8 August 2017,"Having watched the alien series since it began there was an expectation of a fresh feel from the trailers but it was disappointing film over all. The first part of the film was good, it got you in the mood for something great BUT then the characters awake from sleep mode and what you got where a bunch of ""B"" and ""C"" rated actors that acted more like from the local community theater. You have a bunch of soldiers that behave like your local wanna be heroes. The crew are not experienced in any shape or form, they behave like scared kids, making it hard to grasp that anyone would let these amateurs lead a colony of 2000 people. The whole thing starts to fall apart when they land on the planet, so many rookie errors and mistakes, from walking around on a planet they know very little about without protective suites, soldiers who have no clue on what to do when attacked, list goes on. It did honestly feel like they let an amateur director make this part of the film, the only thing that saved it was the fact it had a healthy budget behind it and Michael Fassbender acting. The story line of any worth picks up mid-way through the end of the film and is saved by Michael Fassbender acting. It also closes the holes in the Prometheus story line and what happened when they went looking for the creators and how the alien came to be and then you are left to work out how the rest of the franchise came to be, so unless you have followed the alien franchise over the many years and if you are of a younger generation you will struggle with the ending. To be honest if you just watch the start of the film, bit in the middle and the ending you will have got the story, probably all done in about 40 mins, rather than sit through nearly 2 hours of watching poor acting and a film with so many holes and school boy mistake that you make you want to scream in to the pillow shouting why oh why!",Alien - Covenant
1436,tjwb84,Fine visuals and direction. But let's talk about the Alien series...,6,18 May 2017,"The film is forced, by its weighty legacy, to be about monsters terrorizing a spaceship crew that includes an android and a strong female lead. The monsters' larval stage, as we know all too well, impregnates unwitting humans, producing terrifying offspring that burst forth through the victims' chests. Given those ground rules, plus the fact that five films covering the scant subject matter have now been made, how can one possibly hope to innovate? Well What if the creature bursts forth from the victim's *back* this time?The original 'Alien' was a great sci-fi movie in an era of great sci-fi. It had superb direction and excellent acting; the names of Ridley Scott and Sigourney Weaver come to mind instantly. It also had tremendous artistry behind it, both visual (H.R. Giger's awe-inspiring designs) and auditory (Jerry Goldsmith's fantastic soundtrack). I would also argue that the film was based on a very strong story, written by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett. These are names we don't hear often; in Hollywood, writers seem to be regarded about as highly as the pencils they write with. In any case, the movie was a delightful coming together of artistic talent that worked on every level.What does this movie, which is from a very different age in Hollywood, bring to the table? Ridley Scott is back (again), and indeed, the direction is fine. The strong female lead is good. The soundtrack is acceptable; it contains some great atmospheric, moody pieces, but disappointingly reuses music from the original Alien as well as the main theme of Prometheus. In a jarring breaking of the fourth wall, David plays that theme on a flute in this movie; a beautiful and adventurous piece is clumsily retconned into being a requiem for Dr. Shaw composed by an evil android. The visuals, specifically the look of the aliens and the few glimpses of genuinely new vistas we get in this movie, were quite good - but when are they not? And the best parts are still H.R. Giger's.So all these elements are perfectly fine. The story is where it all falls apart. You and I both knew that before going to see this film. After all, how could it not?Alien's story was simple but intelligent. It was also small in scale. We weren't told much about the world it takes place in, because that didn't matter. We only needed to know about one scrappy crew, one android, one evil corporation, and one terrifying monster. Alien's story also contained a great mystery in the form of the Space Jockey; the fossilized alien, found sitting in his command chair with a big hole in his chest. In space, chance encounters are surely unbelievably rare, and ages must have passed between his death and the moment our crew found this ghastly relic. Much was left unexplained; the voids in the story helped make it good, by having certain things exist in negative space.Alas. We were forced to revisit this universe of mystery so many times that it has no mystery left. We explore one scrappy crew after another, as they are harassed by the same terrifying monsters, the same evil corporation, the same androids. I found Covenant's first act to be particularly tedious, as we go through the motions of having our spacecraft destroyed by a freak space weather event, watching characters in whom we're not the least bit invested die and freak out. I was simply waiting for us to get to the planet, already. We soon do, at which point our characters promptly take off their helmets, ingest alien goo, and start dying. The audience has come to expect this, and is by now fully familiar with the sequence of events when an Alien impregnates an unlucky character. And so, the movie fast-forwards through the process, taking us from landing to infestation to the good stuff - bloody convulsions, cracking bones, and the emergence a fully grown, bullet-proof Xenomorph - with record speed. There were some fun and thrilling scenes involving the creatures, and thankfully there weren't any zombies this time around.Because this is meant to be a film series, the movies are obliged to contribute to a greater, overarching story. To this end, they have provided unsatisfying answers to some mysteries, and replaced others with plot holes; for one, I sure as hell don't know how the Space Jockey could have ended up in its fossilized state in 'Alien' if the Xenomorphs had been created by David a few decades before. (The rarity of encounters in the vastness of space, personified by the fossil, was jettisoned out of an airlock early in the series.)The original story never lent itself to a movie series, which require a much bigger scope (like Star Wars or Star Trek). In later films, the producers try to pad the proceedings with half-baked philosophical notions about the origin and meaning of life. It's done clumsily though, with bumbling scientists in Prometheus who go on a mission because they ""choose to believe"" that they will meet their maker; it is done perhaps a little bit better in this film, which centers around David, an android who finds a gruesome purpose in his existence. But it's just not done nearly well enough compared to a good Star Trek: TNG episode or a film like the Matrix. These aspects are not what made 'Alien' good, so why should they work in its universe's limited context?When the Covenant's crew finds a derelict alien spacecraft, filled not only with indescribable alien wonders, but with human dog tags, they don't seem all that surprised, or excited. I suppose, since this movie takes place in the future, they will have seen yet more recycled sci-fi films than the audience has, to the point where even the real thing has become somewhat mundane.",Alien - Covenant

1439,EdShankle,A movie that doesn't know what it wants to be,4,27 May 2017,"The Alien franchise has been rough ever since the first two films. At first I was excited that Ridley Scott was returning to direct but unfortunately his modern attempts haven't been that great. Alien: Covenant has interesting ideas but it doesn't know what to do with them and it almost feels like the story is being made up as it goes along.Now I'm not asking for a complete remake of Alien or Aliens, I just want a good movie. And Covenant does have concepts to differentiate itself from the first two films but the execution is rather poor. And I think this is because Scott doesn't know if he should've made a proper Alien film or instead a Prometheus sequel and what we get is a weird mix of the two. The thing is, do we really need to know how the xenomorph was created? It is a very iconic creature but it's certainly not as religiously important as Covenant is making it out to be. Hell, all you have to do is have some guns or open the door on your damn spaceship and you can fight them off. There's so much philosophical and religious context behind creating the xeno that I can't help but roll my eyes at every instance of symbolism.And don't mistake the philosophical implications as making this movie ""intelligent."" Covenant aligns very closely with your typical slasher film with how the characters behave, but the filmmakers think they can throw in some religious crap to make the movie seem smarter. It's not even subtle and a fifth grader could pick up on the implications. This movie is dumb no matter how hard it tries to seem intelligent. I think if the movie wasn't about the xenomorph it would've been for the better. An android playing God on an alien planet is an interesting idea, as are the engineers and questions like ""who created us?"" and all that. But the movie doesn't want to explore that too much because we have to have time for the dopey final chase at the end of the movie (which was so by the numbers that it wasn't even thrilling).Plenty has been said on the stupidity of the characters and they are indeed a driving force behind many of the bad things that take place. But if you can view this as just a typical slasher film then there are some enjoyable moments. The first people becoming infected is very intense and gory, despite the fact that the situations could've been avoidable. But the film slows down once the crew goes to David's base. There's not much interrogation and the crew seems OK with all that just happened. David really lucked out running into people who trust him so easily.And this nonchalant attitude of the crew is what gets everyone killed! It's not time for flute lessons and washing your face! You're on a hostile planet with a lot of freaky stuff going on... BE MORE CAUTIOUS YOU IDIOTS.And this trend is probably going to happen with the future films. At this point I don't even care how these movies connect to the original. Right now they seem to be going on a path that will only get more convoluted and silly, and it's actually making the xenomorph and space jockey from the original less interesting.",Alien - Covenant

After enjoying the  company of a face-hugger he wakes and instead of saying ""WTF!!!"" he  asks the inexplicably psychotic David ""What do you believe?"" Oh lordy  it's all that ""belief"" mumbo-jumbo again. I tell you what David should  have said: ""I believe in *science* you mutton headed pea brain! It was  science that got you off Earth, through the voids of space and onto  this rock without being vapourised into a million tiny bits! Oh and  another thing, where did we come from? Turns out science has an answer  for that, too! EVOLUTION!!! You onion eyed sack of wine!""  But it gets worse, given that he appears not to have been involved in  the script, what Alien: Covenant appears to confirm is that the offence  against nature that is Prometheus was not entirely the fault of that  literary toilet blocker Damon Lindelof. So this is Ridley Scott's  ultimate transgression - he has managed, in whole or even in part, to  exonerate Lindelof for the seemingly bottomless pit of pig's droppings  that is Prometheus by going one better by finding the bottom of the pit  and hacking through it to the sewer.",Alien - Covenant

1444,AggressivePizza,"The new Alien film adds weak scares, keeps idiotic characters, and removes philosophical heft",3,23 May 2017,"After confusing a large portion of the audience with the nonsense-rich, Alien-scarce prequel film ""Prometheus"", Ridley Scott has caved to the complaints and pivoted the franchise in a different, horror-oriented direction with plenty of Alien creatures running around. Unfortunately, the dearth of Alien creatures was not the downfall of ""Prometheus"", as Scott apparently perceived. Instead, ""Prometheus"" failed on account of incredibly careless character decisions, frustratingly little plot elucidation, and implicitly assuring the audience that the sequel would fill in the missing parts. Guess what? All three of these flaws return and are perhaps even amplified in the prequel-sequel ""Alien: Covenant"".In this addition to the franchise, a colonization ship called the Covenant is speeding towards an Earth-like planet that has been carefully vetted beforehand. The ship is carrying thousands of colonists and human embryos, as well as 15 crew members. On the way, a seemingly random stellar outburst halts the journey, and in the aftermath, a signal from a nearby, similarly Earth-like planet is recognized to be a John Denver song by one of the crew. Soon after, the crew nearly unanimously decides to abandon the primary mission of the original destination and instead visit the new planet on a whim. Why? Because then the movie wouldn't have happened. This marks the first infuriating folly of the universally stupid protagonists.What follows is a rather impressive combination of both horror and science fiction clichés. First, the crew neglect waiting in orbit to inspect the planet in detail, but instead forge on during a raging hurricane and land in a random spot on the planet. Why? Because then the movie wouldn't have happened. Next, the colonists embark on an improvised trek across the surface without any helmets, armor, or precaution. Why? Because then the movie wouldn't have happened. After this the horror movie clichés roll in: man goes to ""take a leak"" and gets killed. Woman goes to ""get cleaned up"" and gets killed. De facto leader of the group takes a walk to ""clear his thoughts"" and gets killed. I know I'm paraphrasing but in the actual movie it's even more flagrant because the characters are both careless and dumb. It's impossible to convince me that the people chosen to helm a monumentally important expedition to an exoplanet are this uninterested in showing caution and exhibiting common sense. Worse yet, they never take the opportunity to clearly communicate to each other the graveness and deadliness of the Alien threat, which would have saved many of their lives and allowed for, in my opinion, more interesting subplots in which the humans have the upper hand.When the bodies begin to pile up and the scares finally come, they are not unwelcome at first, since the gore effects and sound design of the movie are very good. However, there is no suspense and no real meaning behind the kills. The audience already knows and more importantly has already seen the biological wreckage that the Aliens can cause. It doesn't really matter how cool the kills are because the movie doesn't go above and beyond the original which came almost 40 years prior. It simply rehashes it.Besides all this, the acting is good, and Michael Fassbender in particular is very good. His performance as both the suddenly evil David and the supposedly pure Walter is beautiful to watch. If you're a fan of his, please see this movie. If not, I can't find much else about the movie to recommend. The sequence in which the heroes escape back to the Covenant is actually very thrilling, but the final battle and the ultimate ending of the film is extremely rushed and is definitely the safest possible conclusion. There also exist a couple scenes that were very obviously shot just for the trailer and for some reason made it to final cut, which is bizarre, as films that Ridley Scott produces are usually well-edited. The most mind-boggling thing about the movie by far, however, is how it relates to its predecessor. Although in hindsight I can see that there is not much that indicates a resolution to ""Prometheus"" in the trailers and pre-release publications, prospective viewers for the most part were hopeful for answers. Sadly, there are very few. Shaw, the protagonist of ""Prometheus"", doesn't make an appearance besides a photograph. There is a very pronounced thematic shift away from the ambitious ""where did we come from?"" question and towards the motif of the cycle of creation and destruction. These new themes aren't bad, but it's a little insulting to completely retcon elements of the first movie in order to have this movie, which finds itself bloated with half-hearted horror and missing philosophical intrigue.All in all, ""Alien: Covenant"" was a triple disappointment. One, it failed to capitalize on the inclusion of more Alien scares by regressing back to familiar territory that we've already seen in many of the original films from last century. Two, the frustratingly incompetent and frankly stupid characters are still here from ""Prometheus"", and this time there are even more instances of illogical decisions. Three, Ridley Scott gave up trying to explain the previous film and took the easy way out, both alienating fans that wanted more of ""Prometheus"" and disappointing fans that just wanted something fresh.",Alien - Covenant
1445,nicholasjkoss,An entertaining film that is getting unwarranted backlash,10,1 June 2017,"This is probably the 3rd best film in the franchise behind the first 2. It was extremely exciting and satisfying to see the Aliens actually killing people on screen. The other films in the franchise rely on quick cuts or killing off-screen, but this one really dives into the gore. I would've liked to see some more practical creature effects, but honestly if I re-watch the original Alien or even Aliens, those effects don't really hold up for me even though I appreciate them. When they use men in suits for the Aliens they move too much like humans and it messes up the illusion for me. The story was intriguing and I felt thoroughly engaged the entire time. People are clearly never going to be satisfied with this franchise because all they ever seem to do is complain that the sequels are either not enough like the original or too much like the original.I honestly don't know why so many people disliked this movie so much. It blows my mind that some people hated it so much that they gave it a 1 star rating. Even if you didn't enjoy the movie as much as you wanted, it doesn't warrant a 1 star rating... Reviews of Alien Covenant have really made me wonder if these people have ever actually seen a truly terrible film. It's as if they've never heard of Transformers: Age of Extinction, Fast and Furious 6, Suicide Squad, Terminator Genysis, or A Good Day to Die Hard. If people think Alien: Covenant is the worst in the series, then Alien fans are extremely lucky because this film is a million times better than any of the disappointing sequels that other blockbuster franchises have been crapping out.",Alien - Covenant
1446,magnuselm,Wow just wow,3,17 May 2017,"Wow Hollywood, you did it again! You utterly disappointed me with a script and a story that could have been better written by a 5 year old.I was excited about Alien, one of the few movies I thought you would not screw up completely. How did you get Ridley Scott to approve of this piece of garbage ?The movie is mediocre at best. I'm not even sure if Im watching a comedy or a horror/action movie. The characters feel flat and sometimes even comic. And the whole story makes no sense at all, its all complete bullshit.So my question then becomes, what exactly is happening in Hollywood? With a budget of 110 MUSD there must be decent writers to hire?I see great TV shows being produced all the time, so why is it impossible for a decent movie to come out of Hollywood the last few years?So is this screwing us over with crappy movie after another intentional, and if it is, then why?My only guess is that by making a stupid comic movie with a script for a 5 year old they think they will attract a broader segment of people.Hopefully people will stop going to the movies and stop paying for this kind of crap, and maybe Hollywood will wake up and realize they have to start making decent stuff again.And to Ridley Scott, the guy who made Bladerunner and Gladiator - what happened man, did you loose your passion for film?",Alien - Covenant
1447,personaltrainerthom-20598,How is it possible for Ridley to make the sequels THIS bad?,3,18 May 2017,"Ridley Scott had the chance to, once again like in the 70s, make our jaws drop with an awesome movie that showed us that even a sci - fi movie could be a great thriller. Prometheus was forgiving, for building up a story for the next upcoming sequel, and here it is, the movie we have all been waiting for, but it's far from what we hoped for...""Covenant"" shows us nothing more than a mediocre plot, with the same story told all over again. Haven't we seen this already, two times before? The crew gets a distress call, just HAVE to investigate it, goes to the place where it came from, and then the caos starts (but this time with a bad CGI alien/aliens).Ridley should retire and let his memoares go to the time when he actually made great movies. After ""american gangster"", there's actually not much for me to get from mr Scott. With the possibilities to make GREAT pictures with GREAT cast, like exodus, body of lies, robin hood and so on, he actually failed IMO, like in Covenant.3/10.",Alien - Covenant
1448,joaobluz,"Like wine, it get's better with age (with some minor flaws)",7,7 September 2019,"I went to the premiere of Covenant, and really enjoyed some parts of it, but left disappointed. As an Alien fan, I expected more Alien, less Prometheus.
But the thing is, I watched it again today alongside Prometheus, and this is on another level.
Ridley Scott really gave his best effort to make sense to the appearance of the Xenomorphs, and now I can see it.
It is indeed a beautiful story/metaphor of the god Prometheus, and David is the ideal antagonist on this plot.
I'm not even gonna go on to talk much about the cinematography and the acting, because it's been well reviewed by several users/critics. Fassbender excellently delivered his roles as David/Walter, and made you understand the reason behind his delusional wish of creating life.
The only problem with the whole storytelling, was the pacing, I reckon if Ridley Scott was younger the movie would've had a different approach. But I can understand nowadays things work at a different pacing with all the technology involved, and I think movies tend to be rushed a bit more.
I can't wait for a follow-up to Covenant, to see what ingenious experiments David was up to after being in comand of the ship.
Also a lot of praise for the great detail and respect to H.R. Geiger's artwork.",Alien - Covenant
1449,auroranavarro,"Good visuals, but that's pretty much it",4,23 August 2017,"Meh...the movie made me feel tension at some points, but not because of the actual aliens. I felt tension because the characters were so STUPID and I was in suspense because maybe they'd do something smart for a change! I cared for a total of 3 characters: Walter, David, and Daniels. (I thought that Daniels was a pretty good character because while she was kind of a crybaby, I found that she was the smartest of all the main characters and stayed strong throughout the movie--that's not saying much, but it's something.) Fassbender's acting was AMAZING, and I love how creepy he made David. But other than those 3, all the other characters are bland, poorly-written, and they make dumb decisions that expert scientists that have trained for YEARS for this should not be making. I feel bad for the actors who had to work with such bad writing.The plot was meh. Very predictable and kinda ruins the mystery that the original Alien movie gave off. What the original had was the whole ""unknown"" factor. This is a creature that no one knows of that can do all these killer (lol) things. It promotes the idea that the universe is so large that we truly cannot comprehend or really try to grasp all of it because in the end, we are puny and weak. This movie takes that fantastic mystery vibe and just kinda flushes it down the drain. It didn't even explain everything contained in its plot. There's a right and wrong way to not reveal everything in a single movie because it's supposed to have sequels, and this movie did it the WRONG way. I still don't know how the aliens were created nor do I care.Why the 4 stars, though? Because of the visuals--that's it. The CGI felt like a slap to the face at times (mainly with the Xenomorph), but otherwise visuals were stunning and well-made. Some of the designs didn't make sense to me and the Xenomorph baby wasn't the same as in Alien, but otherwise cinematography was excellent. Also the 3 characters I mentioned before contribute to my generous rating.In conclusion, I give this movie 4 stars because the plot wasn't good, characters were stupid, writing in general was bad, but I did like some of the acting and characters, and the visuals were great.",Alien - Covenant

1451,michalkolendo,Alien Covenant - How to destroy the legend in the most pathetic way,4,25 May 2017,"Alien Covenant - How to destroy the legend in the most pathetic wayI will try to sum it up :) Prometheus + Alien:Covenant is a story of an android who want to become a creator (or a god). So he flies to the planet with a mission of finding an elixir of life. In the meantime he kills some of the crew members, discovers that the planet is quite dangerous and is full of bio weapon of mass destruction left by an alien race.. He kills the only survivors among the crew members and uses alien spaceship to go to their mother planet to use that weapon and destroy their civilization. (AWESOME) Ten years after Prometheus, colonization spaceship is launched to find a new habitats. As we know, the universe is quite small (15 planet max. not 1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 like we thought) so it flies near previous destination of Prometheus (WOW! - what a coincidence). The crew decide to land to colonize it (even if their primary goal was somewhere else).. The crew is full of idiots - they land on alien planet, decide not to use spacesuits, masks etc - just to quickly get infected. Main spaceship is leaded even by bigger idiot, because he tries to land on the planet and risk life of all crew members and mission failure (2000 frozen colonists). I didn't want anything extraordinary - I knew it won't match the level of the first three parts, but that was a joke...My wife went for a coffee for the first time! Prometheus was bad, but Alien:Covenant is worse (impossible became possible)..There is no action for 2/3 of the movie, there is no alien in the 2/3 of the movieThere is much of pseudo-philosophic bullshit instead :/ There is no mystery, all puzzles are revealed. Alien is no longer an archetype of Evil, it's not scary anymore - Mr. Scott - You've destroyed the legend :/ SCORE: 4/10",Alien - Covenant
1452,acooney-45325,VERY Disappointing,4,14 May 2017,"The only good thing I can say about this movie was that it tied the prequel(s) into the rest of the Alien universe. But I don't know if it was because I had higher expectations, but this was like, B-grade script-writing. Rushed, predictable plot & unbelievable characters. And oh dear god, the plot holes! I appreciate they had to fit everything in, but why do they still treat movie-goers as idiots? They could have skipped the opening scene, & scattered that saved time throughout the movie, & filled in all these holes, often with a single sentence. But no.Now the spoilers: Firstly, there are the usual plot holes that you get in EVERY suspenseful movie, yet still annoy me. Nobody reports in when they get called on the radio, even though they have an open channel & JUST have to say ""Gimme a sec"". Even though they have found the missing guy they were looking for, horribly butchered, & their friends should probably know that something is eating people. Instead they stare around for 30 seconds, & have the gall to sound annoyed at the people trying to find out what is going on. This is about the time everyone starts splitting up, even AFTER they know something is out there killing people. And when they find out what one of their team is killing people, they try & fight/talk it out, rather than yelling into their radio ""Hey guys, Bob is killing everyone, so watch out for him. You know, just is case he kills me & I don't get to warn you later"". Yes this crap builds suspense, but it is still lazy writing. So anyway, we have a colony ship, crewed by a team which, you have to assume, received a basic psychological profile before leaving Earth. To make sure they were good in a crisis, & not, you know, morons. Their primary mission is to protect the colonists. So after spending a week of flight time on a side-trip to checkout a human signal on some random planet, they immediately send down 90% of their crew, in the middle of a freaking storm which they KNOW could crash the shuttle. No time for extra scans to check for people (consequently missing the ENTIRE ALIEN CITY 5 kms from where they land), no waiting for 24 hours to see if the storm dissipates (which it did). Then while you can still hear the computer doing an atmosphere reading in the background, whoosh - open the door. No spacesuits, no apparent checks for weird bacteria, viruses, or ...I don't know, flying T-Rex's. And they have a robot on board, who is (sorry robots) comparatively expendable, that they could have sent out to check for alien monsters. But no, everybody just traipses of into the uncharted mountains. In the rain. So of course 2 of the guys get infected from alien spores. 1 the guys actually poked the fungal pod, saw the weird spores fly out of it, & INHALED. Inhaled alien spores. Always a winning move. One of the people helping their sick friend back to the ship completely loses it, screaming & panicking. Doesn't help the clearly sick, struggling guy, just runs on ahead yelling at him to hurry. Their comrade locks them both in the medical bay for quarantine (even the non-sick one), even though she helped them both inside & got blood splatter all over her. But as soon as she sees a weird alien life-form in there with them, she gets a gun & opens the door. Because you know - disease dangerous, alien monster & we go in on our own, guns blazing. And in her panicky state, managed to blow up the damn ship. So then they end up in a dead alien city with the sole survivor from the first movie, & after a very basic 'Are we safe here?', even though they are clearly not, make camp. Nobody seems curious about this alien city, full of hundreds of dead aliens, who even allowing for alien decomposing, haven't been dead for long. If they were human bodies, out in the weather like that, you would think several months at most. Nobody even asks their host 'You have been here for 10 years - Do you know what happened here?' Meanwhile, the remaining crew up in the colony ship override ALL safety protocols & take the ship down into the storm, endangering 2000 colonists & the entire mission, just on the CHANCE they can find out what is going on. Even though, as we find out later, they have another shuttle they could take down, & not possibly kill everyone. Back on the planet, basically after that it ends up with everyone getting picked off one by one, because they cleverly all wondered off alone. The climactic fight is on a cargo shuttle (with the same idiot pilot who endangered the ship) swooping around & bouncing into the ground, making it really dramatic, for no apparent reason. No damage mentioned, no weather, so apparently just a really crappy pilot.So yeah, I gathered going in that it would be very much like the original Alien plot, but heavily disappointed by the terrible script & characters. People rag on Alien3 & Alien: Resurrection, but they were better than this mess by far. If this had been a standard B- grade alien parasite movie, I wouldn't have been nearly as disappointed.

You see David learned how to play a flute in Prometheus and now he is a true master of fingering. And boy, he can finger well. Everyone experiences this in this story. You remember our lovely Doctor Shaw who had super abilities to conduct cesarean on herself and run straight? Fingered. Those white dudes whom everyone wanted to bore with questions? Fingered. The new crew of Covenant that no one really cares about because I guess we don't even remember their names? Fingered. Charming Walter whom you almost pity. F I N G E R E D. This is also a movie about a great lesson in economy – how to reuse the same script over and over again, hoping that no one can notice. Strong female character – check. Spaceship with crew who make a lot of bad decisions – check. Eggs and idiots feeling risqué – check. Final monster send off into the deep space – check.What this movie is not is a horror movie. I mean how can you expect anyone to be afraid if the script is one big horror trope? Go into the dark basement – check. Go alone to wash yourself when the monster is out – check. Have a shower and play loud music when the alarm systems go off – check. Watching this made my forehead hurt from the constant facepalm. Reading reviews made me ponder the condition of modern society. I mean, does it really take a few lines from Byron, Shelley and a bit of cliché Wagner in the background to make people think that the movie is deep, meaningful and philosophical? If so I can't help but cheer for David's love for fingering. I mean - creating. Hope it continues in the next installments to come. The rumour has it there are still 6 to come.

If you walk into this movie expecting the gruesome charm of the original, you're gonna have a bad time. Instead, expect poor character decisions, some bad dialogue, and an overly complex narrative that ultimately delivers an original, if not perfect, entry into the franchise.

1456,skillz4realz,A Rare Masterpiece,9,29 May 2017,"Firstly, it is obvious that some people will not wholly get or even accept this film. This is, in reality, a film for a somewhat niche audience. Yet somehow it and its predecessors have transcended that. There are so many films coming out on a weekly basis that are essentially the same thing wrapped in different clothes: The Raunchy Comedy. The Big CGI Action Film, The Comic Book Film, The Spy Film, The Drama Film, The Date Movie, The Romantic Comedy, The Horror Film, The Sci-Fi Film, etc. There are several genres that we are allowed to consume.This one is different.To truly appreciate this movie, you do need to be quite familiar with at least Prometheus(2012) and Alien(1979). If you are fortunate enough to count yourself among that crowd, this movie elevates itself from simply ""fun"" or ""good"" to something that is truly memorable and great.Alien Covenant is about the USCSS ship Covenant which is on a more than 7 year journey to colonize a distant planet. All crew members aboard as well as over 2,000 civilians are in cryosleep, leaving only the synthetic Walter to watch over them while they sleep. Suddenly a disaster hits the ship, requiring Walter to awake the crew. While attending to the situation, a broadcast is intercepted which appears to be of human origin. The odd thing is, the broadcast originates from somewhere deep in space where no one thought it possible for human life to exist. They subsequently decide to investigate this transmission which leads to the Covenant arriving on the Engineers home world.From here on in we're treated with mystery, terror, and wonder. The cinematography is simply abnormal in how exquisite it is. You'll see several scenes that will stick in your mind due to how breathtaking they look.Without giving a full written synopsis of the movie, I will tell you that assuming you are familiar with the prior Ridley Scott films, this is a huge piece of the puzzle. You learn so much more about the origins of the Xenomorph than you ever thought you would, and it changes everything you ever knew about the Alien franchise. The fact that we have the creator of the franchise himself giving us these revelations is a treat that few if anyone will ever receive. While this film stands on its own as an awesome, beautiful, yet mournful movie; we are left with even more in this plot to contemplate and salivate over.Spoiler territory ahead: In order for this to connect with the original Alien(1979) in the next film, we need three things:1. An Engineer ""C"" ship to crash on LV-426.2. There needs to be hundreds, if not thousands, of eggs on board.3. There needs to be someone, or something, in an Engineer or ""Space Jockey"" suit with a chest burster wound sitting in the main cockpit.I believe that we will see David return to LV-223, the planet from Prometheus, in order to get another Engineer ""C"" type ship.David will create hundreds, if not thousands, of alien eggs to place within the ship, planning to take it to earth to kill all of his creators.Something will go wrong, causing the Engineer ship to crash on LV-426, where Ellen Ripley and the Nostromo crew will find it, wherein the original Alien(1979) begins.The only questions are who is in the Engineer suit with the chest burster injury, and is there an explanation for the Alien Queen.It is extremely rare for any work of fiction to create this much truly interesting lore and theorizing. I am very happy with what we got with Alien: Covenant, and although there are a few things I can nitpick about, in the end Alien: Covenant is a real treat for us to consume and contemplate.",Alien - Covenant

David/Walter is fantastic as the android with a conscience and puts in one of his best performances of his life - he carries the film with his professional expertise. Daniels (Waterstone) was highly believable and i cant wait to see her role evolve as she becomes the new main protagonist of the Alien franchise. I didn't see one bad performance and the movie is truly terrifying! The aliens evolution and creation is explained, and we find that Shaw has given birth to a new Queen Alien that lays eggs - of which David is helping!!! We are given huge answers to the Engineer planet of which seems to be populated by worker engineers and not the same engineers that we see in Prometheus. The Neo-morphs and the new way of infection via air-bourne infection is insanely scary and you just feel completely hopeless for the infected characters - i was scared to the back of my seat several times - I asked my self about 10 times in the movie - How the hell is this a 15!?!?

We want back the old feeling of Alien!,5,11 May 2017,"I went to see this movie hoping it would be better than Prometheus, which was a mediocre film at best. I was very disappointed in Covenant also. It follows the story of Prometheus to a certain regard, but makes no attempt to be a better film. I found it to be dull and way too predictable for my taste. I loved the first two movies (Alien and Aliens), mainly because they were purely entertaining and looked great, not because of some Oscar-worthy screenplay. Alien Covenant is not an entertaining film and the writers try too hard to bring some philosophical aspects into the story, which greatly diminish the movie's quality. In my opinion, the Alien series should be all about atmosphere, action and bloody scenes. Leave those ""parts that make you think"" for other movies with other subjects. Alien is about unlucky people getting chased and whacked by a scary creature. Sounds like a ten year old description but that should really be it.",Alien - Covenant

Physics are not existent here.Things I hate (other reviewers didn't mention):Why the whole crew are husbands and wives to each other? They are not living on this ship. Just traveling in cryosleep.

It's a bad movie. As a fan of the series, I can handle the occasional B-class result. But this was somehow worse, probably because the movie presents itself more seriously. I'm guess I'm OK with having seen it, but just to know and remember how much it's worth forgetting. It's clear that Ridley Scott doesn't feel like putting effort into anything beyond composing shots.This has got me worried for Blade Runner 2049 (Wait, what's that?... not directed by Ridley Scott, OK, it'll probably be fine then.)",Alien - Covenant

You'll hear a lot of ""critics"" complaining that the original movies were better, but aside from the first ""Alien"", all the following movies were truly rubbish with poor story-lines and even more derelict acting. Covenant, however, takes you back to the nostalgia of the first film, while integrating advanced graphic which brings the world alive in a way not seen before. The lead, Katherine Waterston, is more of a Ripley than a Shawe, and really owns the part she plays. I highly recommend that you watch this movie, not as someone who grew up with the dated effects of the original films, but as someone who appreciates the genre and vibe of the ""Alien"" world.",Alien - Covenant

1468,lemket-74887,Just saw Alien: Covenant...,3,18 May 2017,"I went in expecting a terrible movie and it wasn't quite as boring or annoying as I thought it would be. The beginning is actually good, we see the Crew of the Covenant do some work on their spaceship, which was interesting and showed them as competent spaceman for the first and last time in this movie.It goes downhill as soon as they set foot on a planet they don't know anything about. As you can expect from an Alien movie, bad things happen and all of it could have been avoided by simple precautions like spending a few months in orbit to survey and map the planet and get a basic idea about plants, bacteria and possible dangers that might be there. And: wearing a simple protective suit, when first setting foot on an unknown planet seems like a good idea, as many have already pointed out. I tend to root more for characters who actually care if they survive or not on an alien planet and who act accordingly. It bothered me in Prometheus that the characters did not seem to care for their own safety and it's just as annoying here. Obviously, the Xenomorphs are more threatening if they can kill off the Crew, although everybody did everything possible to prevent harm. In Covenant the Crew seemed less insane than in Prometheus, however almost every decision they made, was wrong, if they were trained to keep their cool in stressful situations, the training wasn't effective at all, and all this - and not the Xenomorphs relentless hunt for prey - leads to mayhem. However as a standalone film this could have been a somewhat fun movie, like Friday 13th in space or whatever.But: As a prequel to Alien or Aliens, or a sequel to Prometheus ""Alien: Covenant"" does more damage than good. The forgivable: The technology is more advanced than in the movies that happen later in the narrative (Alien and Aliens etc.), the life cycle of the Xenomorphs is a mess. I could somehow accept that they are still experimented on, but then: where do the eggs come from? Did David create them? Why? Obviously there were spores on the planet that could grow Xenomorphs in a host-body within minutes, so why create facehuggers, which are less effective?Why did Weylan Enterprise make Walter and David look exactly the same? I guess, so David could pretend to be Walter. Convenient. Not so forgivable: Killing off all the ""Engineers"" is weird, why establish them as somewhat important in Prometheus in the first place? Although I didn't like ""Prometheus"", I would have liked to see Shaw and David arrive at the Engineers Planet and have them discover that the Engineers were creating the Xenomorphs as the biomechanical Creatures Giger designed, but ultimately the engineers can't control them. At least, that's what I expected. Answering the question if the engineers created humanity would also have been nice (a simple ""No"" would have been enough for me) But ""Alien: Covenant"" makes ""Prometheus"", which was already bad, even worse by not following up on it.As a somewhat mediocre Space Horror movie this would be a 6/10. As a part of the Alien narrative a 4/10, because it actually makes the original movies Alien and Aliens less exciting and takes away a lot of what was scary about the Aliens in the first place, which is: they were alien, and had nothing to do with human civilization at all. Hence the title.",Alien - Covenant
1469,andrew-74685,Alien? Meet Annoying Android with Daddy Issues,1,20 May 2017,"I don't really know what to say. I am such a fan of Alien, this movie truly offends me. It's intellectually offensive and insults the audience - especially fans familiar with Alien/Aliens. I really just want to vote and bring the score down for this horrible movie. Others have already said it. The biggest problem is that the plot is idiotic. Worst writing ever. Prometheus had problems, and instead of addressing those problems in sensible ways that take us back to the meat and potatoes of the Alien narrative, which is, you know, THE ALIEN, it does the opposite, and leaves all those problems in place and then makes them even worse. Did Alien3 make you mad? Alien4? This movie will make you even madder! It's not about a personal preference that things be changed here or there, from beginning to end the movie is a confused mess. The writers are trying to do way too much. The writers also think the audience is stupid and can't figure certain things out for themselves. But then the writers also don't bother trying to fill in some logic huge holes that deserve some answers. Without spoilers it's difficult to get into specifics.The thing that is really bad is that this movie is a prequel. So we're supposed to be filling in story gaps that lead into the movies we already know and love, Alien/Aliens. This movie creates a narrative that is insulting to those films. The origin of this awesome Alien character? I'm not sure why that is something which needs to be answered to begin with, but, oh, turns out, some jackass that didn't get enough hugs as a child decided to create it out of boredom. Yep, that's it. Oh, well thanks for making a whole movie to tell the story of this stupid idea. This movie takes the great ""xenomorph"" character and basically neuters it. Nothing special. Just the invention of a lunatic. What was Scott thinking, seriously? Here is our alpha character, the scariest science fiction villain of all time, chop off the testes, replace it with an annoying android/robot with daddy issues that won't shut up and then give it the dumbest/cheesiest dialog ever. And then of course the movie then also has the characters doing things that defy logic/common sense. Similar to Prometheus where Charlize Theron is running away from a huge wheel in a straight line rather than, I don't know, turning left or right or something. Or morons marooned in a cave that decide it's a good idea to play with an alien snake. Except worse. Situation after situation things like this happen that insult you. Nobody, even the dumbest of the dumb, would act like this. Much less professionals who are elite members of a crew traveling across the galaxy to colonize another planet. Everything that happens is easily avoided.Beside insulting you in every way imaginable with the completely stupid plot, the movie is just boring. There isn't much action at all. If you are hoping to see the Alien doing what it does best, kick butt, forget it. And instead of giving us the alien we know and love, which is scary and realistic, they come up with a variety of other CGI aliens which look very different, fake, and not scary. And there is no rhyme or reason for any of it. I'm not interested in DNA experiments and the creation of these other spin off aliens... I want THE ALIEN. I'm shocked to be honest. I don't understand how Ridley Scott can possibly be so detached from reality. Is the man sub intelligent? I'm serious. Whoever wrote this is a literal idiot. I don't know how else to say it. If the Alien franchise didn't already exist, nobody would watch this movie. It's nonsense from beginning to end. This isn't even an Alien movie. What is it? I don't know. It was nothing but confusion. A wannabe Blade Runner/android/robot movie?",Alien - Covenant

1475,aboddiest,"Scarier than Prometheus? Not really, but still pretty exciting...",8,15 June 2017,"When the first Alien film came out, I had not been born yet. As soon as I was old enough, however, I jumped on the chance to see this film due to my love of science- fiction movies. Thinking back, I remember how much I thoroughly enjoyed Alien. It was an amazingly well done sci-fi/horror movie that started a highly-praised franchise that I have gladly been following for decades till this day. Aliens was a sequel that certainly did the franchise justice, while Alien 3 wasn't terrible but not exactly an award winner either, in my book. Alien: Resurrection made me glad to see Ellen Ripley one last time, even if she was a clone of the original. Now, jump ahead to the recent prequel, Alien: Covenant with two questions in mind: 1) Does the film live up to its predecessors, particularly the first two Alien films? 2) Does the film work as a strong enough sequel to Prometheus? As a story that is supposed to serve as a prequel to the first Alien film, I would say Alien: Covenant is almost there, but it hasn't quite arrived at its destination. The film touches on the origins of the face-huggers and the eggs they hatch from, as they were evidently created by the calculating, renegade android, David. We get to see the results of some of David's experiments with the black goo, which was first introduced in Prometheus. We are essentially introduced to the Xenomorphs that Alien-fans are all too familiar with. We are, however, not introduced to the alien pilot or the planet that Ripley and her crew come across in the first Alien film, and while this might be unfortunate, I believe it is also highly justified. Since Ridley Scott's prequel films are set decades before Ripley's adventures, I believe it is reasonable to say that the prequels are on their own journey that will not end until they have arrived at that moment that would mark the beginning of the first Alien film. With that said, my answer to the first question, would be ""Yes"". Alien: Covenant does live up to the first two Alien films, as a kind of bridge to those films, only half a bridge granted but a bridge nevertheless. As a direct sequel to Prometheus, Alien: Covenant has its strengths both visually and as an engaging story, as well as its shortcomings. While I did appreciate the look of the planet, even I have to admit that many of the characters in this film fell a little flat at times on common sense. Their skittish attitude about not wanting to reenter stasis for another seven years was somewhat understandable, considering the way they lost their captain. However, as I watched the film, even I couldn't ignore the fact that Daniels made too many good points as to why the crew should not land on an uncharted planet made the rest of the crew look like almost complete idiots for dismissing her warnings. Can I, however, forgive this film's shortcomings. As strange as this may or may not sound, yes, I can. I can forgive the captain foolishly falling for David's face-hugger trap. I can even forgive clichéd horror scenes that seemed to be used simply to keep the story moving. As far as I'm concerned, the visual appeal, the pacing, and the ultimate, albeit unsurprising twist at the end of the film proved to be enough to at least keep my attention throughout the course of the story. Yes, many of the characters could have been a little smarter, but in a way, that just added to some of the fun of watching this film. The movie also works as an effective enough sequel to Prometheus. It essentially continues with the story of how the Alien eggs and the Xenomorphs came into existence with what I would consider a reasonably plausible explanation provided by Ridley Scott through David's ongoing experiments with the black goo. A part of me did wish that the movie had been a little more original with the horror element of its story. However, Ridley Scott still manage to convince me to enjoy every minute of this typical science-fiction/horror flick. So, for that reason, I give Alien: Covenant a score of 8 out of 10. If you like B-movie sci-fi/horror films, then, you will likely enjoy Alien: Covenant just as much as I did, despite its recognizable shortcomings.",Alien - Covenant

Alien: Covenant really is THAT bad, there is unforgivable and terrible cgi, ridiculous stupidity from the characters, there is no suspense or chilling atmosphere captured in the original or Aliens, it's just a drawn-out, lifeless, plot hole ridden, sleep-inducing and massively disappointing waste of 2 hours. Alien is one of my favourite films ever made, and the Xenomorph is my favourite movie monster, and to RUIN it with awful CGI instead complimenting it with practical effects is unforgivable.

I've been a fan of this series for awhile now and I really wanted to love this movie, I also really wanted to see director Ridley Scott bring something new to the series, and I didn't get any of those things.I'll be fair and give credit where credit is do, the directing is great, most of the special effects are good, the set design is fantastic, and all the technical stuff in this movie was very well done. The main problem with this film lies mostly within the aspects of the script. A lot of the characters are just there to be killed off, and you can always tell when someone is about to die. The whole film lacks the subtle and quiet terror the original had, and though you could still kind of tell when characters were gonna die in the first film, it was much more drawn out and suspenseful.overall this Alien film suffers from the same problem most horror movies suffer from today, it's way over the top and in your face, with a large amount of disposable characters and gory visuals, that is only saved by it's director, the cast, the crew, and a few interesting but very lightly explored ideas.",Alien - Covenant

There are some subtle differences in events but I feel like you get more out of each scene with the book. It fleshes out the whys and hows a lot better.The new aliens were cool.

Not how did the aliens start etc but how did David get all that papper and writing equipment not to mention the various lab equipment and chemicals he would have needed to create said Alain race. At one point he even has a recorder and drapes to dacorate his little cave house thing. Now unless I in fact missed something in the film like a scene where they pass an ikea or where David in fact stocked up on papper from staples then I am truly baffled to how he came about such equipment. There is now evidence that the people living there before felled trees to make paper no evidence they had fabric shops for drapes and certainly no local pound shop for crayons. I guess this is where my mind was wondering as I watched this pitiful excuse for a film in which old Ridley scot has obviously brought back from the dead as he has in fact ran out of any new ideas for any new concepts for films.

1486,kaserikus,A bit confusing but entertaining,7,12 May 2020,"I seriously don't get some of the fans of this franchise. If the original plot of xenomorphs kicking ass is the only thing that satisfies them, and they find annoying anything that deviates from this premise, what exactly are they watching these sequels for?
Alien (the original) was great because it first introduced the topic of ""claustrophobic space horror"" that has captivated so many of us ever since. The following Alien sequels basically followed upon the same premise, with uneven results, including the regrettable Alien vs. Predator crossovers.
Then, R. Scott came and gave us another perspective of the whole Alien universe: the idea of addressing humanity's most trascendental questions through our contact with the aliens and their makers. In Prometheus, we first try to contact our alleged creators in a captivating quest for answers, just to be confronted with more questions. In Covenant, the whole tale about the meaning of creation takes a darker and more evil note, while we get some hints about what brought xenomorphs into existence.
While these two prequels are not exactly masterpieces and they might lack in some aspects, I welcome the refreshing narrative and philosphical themes raised in them, especially Prometheus, instead of the already overused and worn-out xenomorph-chasing-humans storyline. They also have sensational visuals and overall good acting, especially M. Fassbender's role as Walter/David which deserves much praise in my opinion. Yes, Alien: Covenant is not the brightest gem in the franchise; some bits of its storytelling might be questionable (such as the captain's silly decision that leads them there) and the large cast seems too large to handle at times, but I like the overall unsuspected turn of events, and I think it's not as badly managed by the director as many others point out. The influence of his Blade Runner masterworks' main theme is also visible (maybe even too much at times).
In fact, it appears that he wanted to create this film as a follow-up to Prometheus that would dig deeper into the topics of the first prequel, thus diverging from the original Alien storyline, but the heavy criticism about the lack of xenomorphs in Prometheus made him change plans and rush some nasty aliens into this film. Sad decision in my opinion.
So, all in all, I enjoyed these films as what they are: a distinct touch to the Alien universe with a more thoughtful and trascendental approach.

You really did that??!?!"". They are supposed to be top scientists and professional security personal arriving on an unknown, biologically active and probably hostile new planet. Yet they act as if taking part in Sesame Street. I understand that sometimes you need a little bit of cheese to create the setting for the rest of the movie, but they already went through the trouble to create the villain. They could have used his character to create that setting. All this cheese was completely avoidable and unnecessary.So much potential and hard work, wasted so easily. What a pity!",Alien - Covenant

1493,stefanicai,An insult to viewer's intelligence :(,2,20 May 2017,"The Aliens story is quite an interesting one. The whole concept of the fight between our creator (see Prometheus), us and our creations (AI) is interesting and could make it for a real Sci-Fi.Unfortunately, the creators of the movie decided to dumb it down and make it into a pure action movie that is so bad that it hurts watching it if your IQ is over 50. The script is ridiculous, nearly everything they do in the movie, even the most ridiculously dumb person wouldn't in real life. If the astronauts of tomorrow take decisions as these guys do in the movie, humankind is lost already.Some examples (spoilers!):when meeting David, the team freely shares that there are 2000 souls at the board of the ship. They only met him 2 minutes ago on a scary planet with some weird creatures that nearly killed them all! when David asks the captain to follow him, the captain hesitates a bit, but once Walter assures him that it's safe (note that Walter was talking with an alien just a minute before and the captain saw that) he relaxes and goes in. Smart one captain! when Tennessee's (yeah, very creative name!) wife acts scared, he doesn't hesitate one second to put the whole colonisation mission at risk. Why would he?! It's only the future of humankind at stake, but hey, it's for his wife. everyone in the crew is a couple. I mean, what is happening with all this nepotism in the future?!You get the idea.

1494,radialdrift,"Hangup your Coat Ridely, you are no longer Relevant",4,19 May 2017,"There was a time in cinema when Ridley Scott was relevant. Prometheus showed us that he was past his prime, and any ability that he once had, was lost in a fest pool of gibberish and poor direction. So we move onto Alien: Covenant, and one can say Ridley has continued in his path of being an irrelevant movie maker, it is really time for him to end his career. This film felt like a lesson in amateur cinema, there are story telling decisions in this film that have been seen and done 100 times before, but somehow Ridely thought, lets do it 101 times. This film has zero innovation and some of the editing choices are very bad, some scenes drag on needlessly, in an attempt to build drama, but it falls flat every time. Without spoiling the story, some examples of the amateur story telling is - ""don't go there, OK lets go there"", ""we shouldn't do that, OK lets do that"", ""don't shoot inside the ship, OK lets shoot inside the ship"" There is not much to be positive about with regards to the story telling in this film, after 20 minutes, you know exactly what is going to happen, and the way it has been edited and directed, it feels telegraphed and lazy. The dialogue between characters is poor, very poor, and the connection between the cast is off. I didn't know much about the film going in, but lets just say, it adds zero to the franchise and doesn't add to Prometheus. Time to hang up the coat Ridley, your ideas are old and so very predictable. At one point that I thought this film might be a spoof.",Alien - Covenant
1495,ryanmcdonagh-89263,The Endless Sequel set up,5,5 April 2019,Although had some good casting the story of this film took everything that was good and that was a tense set up for our chance at an expanded alien universe from Promethous. Then decided it would be better to ruin the multiple questions and mystery that was laid out for numous films for the sake of one basic plot that couldnt decide if it was an Alien style thriller or an Aliens style action. In the end the lack of direction left us with a mess in my opinion with a link to far more basic sequal then prometheus left us with.I hope the chain for sequals in Alien films will end so we can acheive a reboot of prequal trillogy like promethus attempted so the Alien films can stop being one off's,Alien - Covenant
1496,drive_bd,An unbearable mess,2,26 May 2017,"This film stands upon the greatness of the original and its sequel which will forever top the list of sci-fi horror's finest. Unfortunately it takes all that greatness and mashes it together into unbelievable nonsense you would expect from the likes of Sharknado. If you thought Prometheus made no sense, then prepare to be amazed by just how much worse it can get.While I feel that all actors involved with this film gave it their all, the script for their character's actions defies all logic and common sense. To the point that even the most carefree non-scientist will find themselves saying ""That doesn't seem like a good idea"" throughout the entirety of the film. Several times the crew mentions their ""training"" while simultaneously making awful decisions that compromise the mission and put everyone's lives in jeopardy. I understand that you have to provide a little wiggle room in that regard when it comes to horror movies but it's so over-done in Alien Covenant that you just end up shaking your head in complete disbelieve.I was under the impression that lessons were learned from Prometheus and that this film would be righting all those wrongs. To my surprise this film seems to have been made by people who not only have never seen Alien before, but it's almost as if they never even saw Prometheus either. This is beyond puzzling because this film was directed by Ridley Scott himself. It's a true mystery how this film was made at all and a shame that so much money and talent was wasted on it.To sum up the quality of this film into one sentence: Battlefield Earth was a better sci-fi film, and that's really saying something.",Alien - Covenant
1497,Gus-69,"Good Horror-Thriller, Great Sci-Fi",8,13 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant is effective, both as a straight horror-thriller and as a thought-provoking sci-fi. Ridley Scott has been a master of the latter genre for a long time, and his crew remains at the top of their game. From the typically streamlined and razor-sharp cutting by Pietro Scalia, the ominous and monumental world-building by Chris Seagers, to the somber and textured lensing by Dariusz Wolski, including Jed Kurzel's moody score that seamlessly mixes Jerry Goldsmith's memorable cues with the evocative main track from Prometheus, Covenant looks and sounds as good as any of the best big-budget spectacles to come out of Hollywood in recent years. Screenwriters John Logan and Dante Harper expand upon the thematic threads ignited by Prometheus - the perceived link between the ability to create life and the status of divinity, the creation turning against its creator -, much to the chagrin of the vocal majority who didn't take those stabs at philosophical substance seriously five years ago, all the while mercilessly obliterating some particular elements of the 2012 installment - the Engineers, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw -, echoing the controversial way that Alien³ was a departure from Aliens, in turn chagrining those select few whose imagination was stimulated by that new mythology of cosmic horror. Scott conjures up some startling, unsettling sci-fi imagery. Gory death and otherworldly aberration have never looked so devilishly beautiful. The blood-soaked newborn xenomorph ""saluting"" its indirect designer David is an instantly iconic, bizarrely poignant sight to behold. The genocide of the Engineer civilization in their own homeland at the hands of their creation's creation, epic in scope and in tragedy, doesn't lag far behind. A roller-coaster ride of mounting dread, the pacing becomes relentless after the colonizing expedition reaches the planet, straying away from the exploration-centered, comparatively contemplative narrative drive of Prometheus. Covenant cements David as the second major leading role of the franchise after Ellen Ripley. Fassbender's Wagner-loving, Shelley- reciting android is a ""furious god"", vainglorious, treacherous, exceedingly human - truly a child of Peter Weyland. He is bound to become cinema's first and foremost synthetic psychopath. His interaction with personality-impaired look-alike Walter is the kind of unexpected departure in content one wouldn't expect from what is essentially a monster movie. Yet, he is not without his reasons, which means he is not beyond understanding. David and his, say, pathos are the key to unlocking the whole point of this evolving iteration of the saga. Either one finds it fascinating or not. Those who don't will always have Alien, Aliens and Alien3 at their disposal.A few artistic decisions deserve to be questioned, however: was it necessary for the xeno to be computer generated? Scott was spot-on on his much-derided assessment that led to Prometheus being its own thing instead of a typical prequel – this is where loyal fans of the quadrilogy might strongly object: the drooling, double-mouthed, phallic-headed beasts simply aren't frightening anymore. The impact they once had has long been diluted by myriad sequels, crossovers, videogames, novelizations. Turning them into athletic digital puppets won't improve the odds of frightening audiences. Why not give more screen time to the neomorph, a savage flesh-eating life- form that, for whatever reason, is more convincing despite being computerized as well? Secondly, it wouldn't be unfair to say that the martial-arts tournament between the two droids belongs to a lesser series. Thirdly, and finally, a little ingenuity could have prevented the demise of the final xeno from feeling derivative of Alien and Aliens, though by now such cliché could be interpreted as self-homage.",Alien - Covenant

Smash.,1,16 August 2019,"I was glad when the trailer for the movie Alien: Covenant was released, because I liked the movie Prometheus, and I just thought that you would shoot a sequel. After I watched the trailer Prologue: The Crossing, Dr. Shaw and Android David, who survived from the Prometheus crew from the last film, appeared on the spaceship of engineers, when I started watching the film itself, I was surprised that I did not see what was shown in the trailer there. Dr. Shaw herself was not in the main film, but only David remained, and Walter appeared, who played (Michael Fassbender). And I'm sad for that Dr. Shaw did not appear in the main film (one and the best actor and character in the whole film), but only in the Prologue: Crossroads, which lasts 2m 40s, and it is unclear how the character, which is one of the main roles in the film, only 2m 40s is allocated? since the film itself takes 2 hours (why it was not shown what happened as she died, it would be interesting to know this because David told her that you have good survival, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, she could not die as quickly as it was shown in the trailer it was interesting that it was shown in more detail, as it was)! What can I say about the film itself in one word, it is a complete disappointment that does not connect the plot with the previous film, a completely new film from scratch with completely new characters, made from different fragments of scenes that do not fit each other, stupid characters are sent to an unknown planet without a protective clothes and many such silly moments in the film.Wishing to Ridley Scott what to do next so that the audience is satisfied, is a continuation of Prometheus, not Prologue: The Crossing, but the full-fledged Prometheus 2 film with Dr. Shaw and David Android after Prometheus is over, continued should start!My rating is 1 out of 10.",Alien - Covenant

Take a look at IMDb and you'll find a lot of people who feel the plot ludicrousness for Alien Covenant is even greater, but I didn't find that at all, and found myself very comfortable with the dialogue and humanity of the characters. Aside from his masterful direction, Ridley Scott did a very interesting thing by essentially making both these movies about the relationship between creator and created; between the Engineers and Humans, between Weyland and David, and between David and the Xenomorph. All a bit contrived? Perhaps, but well crafted and enjoyable. I thought the scene at the start between Weyland and David was beautifully revealing and incredibly sinister. Tea anyone ...?",Alien - Covenant
1502,bjumisen,Ridley Scott does it again - destroys more of his legacy,3,19 May 2017,"This movie takes the Alien franchise in a direction no real Alien fan can appreciate. Prometheus should have been a side note in the history of Alien movies. As its title did not indicate any connection, you could perhaps see it forgotten in history. This, however, bears the title of Alien, while keeping the strange habit of naming a movie after a spaceship, alive. It is therefore extra sad, so see the horror and mystique of the original movie, and even the first two sequels, gone. As several other reviewers already have pointed out, the plot where the android David from Prometheus apparently is the creator of the xenomorphs as we know them, takes away so much of the horror and weight of the original story. If this is the best background story the producers can come up with, we would have been better off without it. The whole thing with some spores being the source of it, as told already in Prometheus was already a bad choice for an origin. Michael Fassbender's work in this movie is good though. We have seen AI:s struggling with their self-awareness, concepts of life, rationality and creation in many movies before, but this part of Alien Covenant is at least a bit new for the franchise, as it is a synthetic, and not a human that is the main character. The first 30 minutes or so, of the movie are actually the most interesting. I would gladly have substituted the bad and reckless way this movie dealt with my beloved Alien franchise for a drama about the hardships of a spaceship on its colonizing mission. It felt more rewarding watching Danny McBride towing cables in space, than seeing the origin story of one of movie history's most terrifying creatures mutilated and reduced to the totally illogical genetic research by an android with creation complex.It is sad to see the director of one of the greatest movies ever, succumb to making poor attempts at expanding the story. Attempts that, twice now, have come out as miserable failures.Had this been a generic sci-fi horror movie without any claims on being tied to the Alien movies, it would have been a decent way to waste a couple of hours. But now it just feels like 20th Century Fox are pissing at the fan base while making money off of their hopes for a GOOD Alien movie.

When the 'climax' of the film is finally attained, the birth of the xenomorph, the action scenes become uninspired: no more aliens lurking in the dark corners (they can just follow his every movement on cctv). Furthermore, the new characters in this film are not memorable at all. Let's just hope Scott will not make this Danny character this generation's Ripley: she has the charisma of a gold fish.Overall, a mediocre film somewhat saved by the sets and Fassbender's performance, but the least scary in the entire franchise.

1511,hersito,A lost opportunity.,6,20 May 2017,"I'll give my opinion filled with spoilers of course, and sorry for my poor English. I liked: mostly the first part, the gorgeous shots of the covenant with it sails fully open and the arrival to the planet. The relationship Walter/David and what it implied more than what they showed. What I didn't like and this is the long part: the many mistakes made by the crew and the silly security decisions. Starting with arriving to a planet with unknown biosphere (bacteria and viruses you don know) without at least hazmat suits, that would be difficult for the plot to evolve since the first contagion is via air, but that is exactly why you always wear your spacesuit! Same plot holes from Prometheus, scientist not acting scientifically. After that they arrive to a new civilization and they act like if something they see every day, no awe or anything, the one more mesmerized seems to be Walter. And from there my suspension of disbelief totally disappeared. A Tennessee that allows the covenant to get closer to the ground risking the whole mission as if it was a common expedition. The quick way the show what happened at the arrival of David and how little we still know about the engineers. The stupid way David lures the captain into watching the egg and how quickly the xenomorph evolves from a small being into a huge one in a few minutes and with out eating... And the ending, how is it that David is authorized to have any type of interaction with MUTHUR and why MUTHUR doesn't react to him being on the ship as she reacts to a unknown life on board... I could say way more but I probably already bored you. I think is a 6/10 a lost opportunity, they tried to blend alien, aliens and Prometheus and do a lot of fan service in one movie and didn't work for me.

How wrong I was. The screen time that the Xenomorph has is short, far too short and it does not have you gripping the edge of your seat. It is predictable and lame, think more angry dog than the intelligent and heart racing scary Alien you remember from Alien and Aliens. I fully appreciate that this film was maybe designed to go off on a tangent but people who love the franchise ""fans"" were expecting more from our two mouthed killer. The non entity Neomorph was just that, a speck in the entire film. Not much to offer other than some gory birthing scenes. The whole story fixated on an Android with daddy issues. The realisation that comes to light being an Android in essence created the Alien species we know and love. I didn't like that. That disappointed me beyond belief. All in all I was gutted, I wanted Alien Covenant to be about the Alien, bringing back the creature that made me hold my breath and hang on to my seat, the scary, all consuming fright it made you feel for the characters it pursued. Not recommended if you want a film about the Xenomorph because this film although explains a lot about its origins does not do justice for the fans.

1517,kleary1,Entertaining and disappointing at the same time!,5,25 May 2017,"I wanted to love Alien: Covenant. I've been a huge fan of the Alien franchise since I first wandered into that movie theater in 1979 with no expectations and came out blown away. Finally in Ellen Ripley, we had the perfect heroine—smart, beautiful without vanity, nice enough but no-nonsense. I just loved her and wanted to be her. And the first Alien was such a simple, classic, ""and then there were none"" plot, filmed with such style. That so much of it was improvised still amazes me. I have a clip of a Brett and Parker scene on my iPhone—""Riiiiight"". Alien managed to create distinct characters so quickly and succinctly. Aliens, while quite different from the first film, was great, and I was even able to enjoy Alien3 and Alien: Resurrection because first of all, they still had Ripley, and secondly, there was some kind of continuity with the original—which of course is because they were sequels rather than prequels.Then came Prometheus. I had been very eager to see it and I liked it more than most people I know. But I liked it as something altogether separate from the Alien movies. It was a prequel but it seemed to be in its own universe. Elizabeth Shaw was also a brave, resourceful heroine, though the writers decided to weigh her down with emotional baggage, which made her quite different from Ripley. Meredith Vickers, if she hadn't been so unpleasant, could have been a more direct ancestor of Ripley.Now we come to Covenant and with the radical spaced A L I E N in the title, well, that's part of the Alien franchise, right? I pushed my husband to go with me to the IMAX to see this and was surprised when he turned to me at the end and said, ""I liked that better than Prometheus"". Huh? He's not quite the Alien fan I am. Was this an entertaining movie? Yes? Did it give an interesting twist to the origin of the xenomorph? Yes, I'll give you that. Was it worthy of the Alien franchise?, eh-- about as much as Prometheus was.I could see that they were trying for that same feel of the original, starting with the motley crew like the one on the Nostromo, this time being married couples heading off to a colonize an earth-like planet (I coincidentally recently reviewed Spacecraft IC-1, whose crew had a similar mission). But I just didn't get that same immediate recognition of colorful character types that I had with Alien. I found them all rather bland, even Danny McBride, an actor I love, as Tennessee, was pretty much the same as he is in everything he's in. They weren't remotely memorable like the crew in Alien. Michael Fassbender, as the dual synthetics, was wonderful, as he is in everything, but I think the strong concentration on the characters of the androids at the expense of the humans was also a turn-off for me. Maybe it's just me, but I don't want Alien movies to be about androids—I want them to be about humans against the xenomorph.There were also a few atmospheric nods to the original film in things like heavy, clinking chains and dripping water, Danny's undershirt and unfortunate utilitarian haircut, and the grand finale was definitely trying to give us a Ripleyesque battle. But I think these nods only made me miss Alien and Aliens more.I also found that there were several small plot devices that seemed a bit pandering. Not to spoil, but finding Elizabeth's photo right where they were speculating about her? How convenient. David doesn't know who wrote Ozymandias? No way. I was shaking my head a lot. But biggest of all, and I do sometimes get accused of a lack of willingness to suspend disbelief, the whole premise of them deciding to explore a planet that wasn't part of their mission was absurd--especially when you consider the human payload they were carrying. This would be so outside of any kind of protocol as to be laughable. I realize it was mirroring what happened with the Nostromo, but the Nostromo had a reason to respond to a distress signal. Finally, there was also a little too much going on in this movie--too much action is usually not a plus for me unless it has a very specific purpose. For me, simpler plots, simpler premises are usually more satisfying. One good, well-placed, suspenseful face-hugger, chest explosion scene has more impact than a string of them.Now here's a part that perhaps other fans can help me with. How does the original alien--not the xenomorph who eventually became known as the alien, but the downed, petrified pilot whose distress signal brings the crew of the Nostromo to him (I always think of him as the first alien)—how does he fit into the whole Prometheus-Covenant-Alien timeline? Aren't these big guys all long gone, extinct, by the time our merry Covenant crew gets to its next destination? Was he already there and if he was, then wasn't the xenomorph also already there, or is ""there"" somewhere else? (My head is spinning) I guess maybe Scott, Whedon, Lindelof, or whoever gets involved in the next installment, will figure that out for us.So final verdict—entertaining, but not the Alien thrill I was expecting. Guess that's what expectations get you!(Anybody else worried about the new Bladerunner?)",Alien - Covenant

1519,lazarts,Sadly a let down for the real Alien fans,3,4 August 2017,"It's been a while since I wrote the last preview, and it took me quite a while to decide to write a review on this one. I am an Alien fan since day one, since I already loved the morbid works of the late H.R Giger, a true master of the insane art. What H.R. Giger has created with that Alien, was a phenomenon - and through the hands of Ridley Scott the Alien phenomenon was born in such a genius way, that possibly no science fiction horror creature had such an impact. Before I get to the review of Covenant, I take a look at the Alien movies so far:The original Alien movie was a gem, a genius piece of art, and what made it so fantastic for the audience is, that the surrounding story is plain simple and the character development was pretty basic. The characters were introduced on simple basics - you don't really learn much about them but you grew to like them nevertheless. The focus though is on the claustrophobic surrounding and of course: the alien. And there was Ltd. Ripley, who was the heroine no one ever expected. The viewer was scared to death when watching the movie for the first time in the dark.The second film ""Aliens"" worked very well too, although there were a lot of characters that could have made the movie messy - which it didn't, surprisingly. Everything was centered on the Aliens and on the survivors getting out alive. Again, the claustrophobic surrounding worked.Alien3 worked for me too, even when there was already some odd character development of the doctor - which again dragged the scenes at some point, but it was not too much ... and the franchise should have stopped there, with the death of Ripley.But in the 4th installment ""Resurrection"" they brought Ripley back  Sadly the movie had this absolute comedy parts that were so misplaced in the well known serious business Alien world, and pulled the previous Alien movies over the table and stabbed them in the back. Still, as a hardcore Alien fan I said ""OK, it was not that good, but it I have seen worse.""Then Prometheus came, and I was like ""hell yeah"". The original creator Ridley Scott at work and getting the franchise back on track ... at least that was what I was thinking. And although the movie did not show any Aliens that we knew so well, the connection was made. It was not that good as it was expected, but it was getting in a better direction. I left me interested, as some interesting questions were asked.And finally Covenant ... (spoilers ahead) I had such high expectations, and was left disappointed! I have seen the film in the movie theater when it premiered - and after having seen it at home yesterday on my TV screen, I made my final decision on my opinion about the Covenant movie. The start off Covenant was good and the first 40 minutes or so delivered and headed in a good direction. The character development there was still basic, the score of the original Alien worked very well. Sadly, James Franco's character as captain of the Covenant was killed off before it could be introduced (I think they should have left him unharmed and alive, he would have delivered so much better, than his substitution, and he could have carried the movie too, instead of letting Fassbinder carry the movie alone). Everything went well until ""David"" came into play again, to rescue the Covenant crew and lead them in his ""save house"". From there on it was going downhill, too much story and too much character development - plus incredibly naive decisions of the remaining characters. The 10 years in between of Prometheus and Covenant were explained in a poor excuse of a try to explain the happenings. The true fate of Dr. Shaw is not really discovered - one can only speculate in several different directions. The answers behind the engineers from the Prometheus movie are buried forever, without a logic motive to David's rogue attack on the engineers. We'll never know where that black liquid originated. The android character development was far too much and killed the pace of the movie - just as the poor and stupid decisions of the rest of the crew - who never could grow on you. And when they got killed, it left you completely unmoved. Thee heroine was a complete waste of money, sorry to the actress, but she didn't bond at all with the viewer (they should have left Dr. Shaw alive, and take over the Covenant, instead of this poor excuse of a heroine). The chase on the Covenant was so unemotional, that it is a shame. The original Alien scared you to the edge of your seat while walking through the corridors - and in Covenant the characters walk around like in a little hurry on a warm summer day in the park, while hunting the Alien. WTF Ridley Scott?!!!Covenant started off good, headed the right path, but sadly jumped right off the cliff in the middle of the movie. RIP Alien movies - Covenant is the worst installment ever in this franchise, and I hoped for so much more - because it could have done so much better!Don't get me wrong, I have seen movies worse than this one, but on the other hand I have seen better ones too - and five of them were the previous Alien movies. And there is one question that bugs me: How the hell will Scott explain, how the ""navigator"" in the engineers ship of the original Alien movie ends up there at LV-426, with all those thousands of eggs in the ship's storage. Listen Ridley Scott, I think you just messed it up this time!",Alien - Covenant

1522,racfr,A huge letdown in several aspects,6,10 August 2017,"OK so I just watched this movie and I have to admit I was excited. Finally an Alien movie with an actual Alien in it, directed by Ridley Scott, rated R, OK cast, even the trailers looked good. It is sad that this movie turned out to be such a disappointment. For the first 30- 40 minutes, nothing is really happening. I guess they went for some sort of build-up like in the original '79 movie, but they nailed it so much better back then. Those scenes were not pointless, they were building characters and the whole environment. In my opinion, spending 10-15 minutes on a pointless random neutrino storm and repairing parts of the ship that never going to be used later in the movie is just pointless.The characters are bland and uninteresting. I don't even remember more than 2-3 names from the movie. You don't really care about most of them either, they're just there to be slaughtered. The deaths are also pretty predictable, you can instantly tell who's going to bite the dust next. There could be maybe one exception, but as there was still about 20 minutes left from the movie, you could kind of guess that OK, that short time was enough for that guy to get impregnated after all. And the decisions the characters make throughout the movie, my God. That infamous 'slipping on blood twice' scene was almost like slapstick comedy.I was reading other reviews about the whole alien mythology, and I have to agree with them. According to this movie, Xenomorphs are just the creation of a mad android. WTF. This just dishonors the whole species. I didn't mind the different types Xenomorphs in the second act, but it was probably the biggest disappointment to me, that they replaced the original practical Alien with CGI. And they even executed it poorly, it looked like something from 1998. I don't even write anything about the sexual tension between Michael Fassbender and Michael Fassbender. It was just weird. But I have to admit, I have never seen anything like that before, so there goes some kind of credit. And later, the android tries to rape (I guess) the female protagonist as well? Who came up with these ideas?The ending 'twist' was so obvious from start that it genuinely surprised me that they still tried to present it as an actual twist.Well, this looks pretty harsh, all in all there were some good stuff in there as well, but I was just so upset with all this nonsense crap. I still gave it a 6 out of 10 for great (in camera) visuals, nice soundtrack, some fine performances (although the female lead never gets even close to Sigourney Weaver or Noomi Rapace), and the rated R stuff is pretty bloody and satisfying. But all in all, it was just a huge letdown.Sorry for my lame English, this was my first review. And seriously.. 'you blow, I'll do the fingering' ??

I have never seen a crap movie like this and have took the pain trying to save fan souls trying to watch this movie for the sheer disappointment at 2am in the morning. I'm not sure if the Director intends to rip the reputation of Alien back from the history and put it to shame. I wish the movie should have never been even made. I thought Prometheus was a good start for a follow up and this one completely pulled it into the depths of no recovery. The story as it stands now has put to rest any hopes of a proper follow-up movie and it has to go through some episodes of redemption to get the fame back considering what the Director has done with the story. This one puts all the movie series to shame and established a new low for the Alien franchise. I'm positive that the Director might be feeling that 'the movie shouldn't have been made' kind of regret.

Prometheus took us to the beginnings of the 'Alien"" franchise with a lot of boring over complicated mythology about god and creators and xenosomethings, blah blah blah. In JASON in Space 2: Covenant, we have something in between the original film and Prometheus. Oh for good measure just to keep everyone bored and confused we get Michael Fasbender x2 to remind us of everything that happened in the last movie (except he didn't mention that giant wheel that rolled down the road to crush poor Charline Theron) play the flute with himself and spew some blah blah blah about some more nonsense ( at this point I wish Michael Myers stormed in and took them both out.) I wont even write about the rest of the goofy stuff Dave or Walter or whoever it is, goes though. In the end everyone associated with these prequels (including Scott) seem to be for getting what made the first two Aliens so great all those years ago. (and even Alien 3 to an extent).

First 30 minutes were actually really great, but then the stupidity started. Crew went to totally unknown planet without wearing any protective gear. I understand that it was needed for plot, but it's so plain stupidity that I wanted to moan. But it did not stop there - then they met with David and from that point the movie reminded some shitty Riddick Chronicles movie. It was lame, it was boring, it was so predictable. There was many scenes in trailer which you can't see in movie. And fight in spaceship lasts only about 10 minutes, but is actually quite cool.

1530,bachir-08,Alien : Covenant - Movie Review,5,26 May 2017,"What I liked:Michael Fassbender's performance. He was one of the best parts of ""Prometheus"" and is definitely one of the best parts of ""Covenant"".-The cinematography and set locations. I was staring in awe at the screen during some scenes.The special effects. If you've seen the trailer, you know what I'm talking about. The horror and gore elements. Not as iconic as the ones in the original Alien, but I enjoyed them nevertheless.What I disliked: The characters. Some of the decisions they made were the stupidest I have seen all year (You cannot explore an unknown planet without a helmet on!). Taking them seriously was an impossible task, which is problematic since the movie mainly revolves around them.The writing. Covenant's biggest problem was the fact that it did not know what it wanted to be: a prequel to the original Alien or a sequel to Prometheus. So it ended up being a bit of both. A fusion that did not work at all since the two movies are very different. Some questionable casting decisions. Without spoiling anything, one particular casting choice was very distracting. The pacing. The ending. The last 20-30 minutes of the movie add nothing to the story and come out of nowhere. Conclusion:Out of the three movies directed by Ridley Scott in the franchise, ""Covenant"" is the weakest because it tried to be two drastically different movies at once. It's a well-made film, pretty to look at and generally well-acted, but unfortunately, the negatives outweigh the positives and I left the theater disappointed",Alien - Covenant

1534,robkenyonuk,A great big beautiful dump,5,21 May 2017,"So here's the thing... the last review I wrote here was for Prometheus, you can add me to the list of people who were disappointed by that film. Being a massive fan of Alien I've read every book, every piece of trivia, seen all the making of documentaries and own all the films on VHS, DVD and the recent Anthology box set. When I first heard about Prometheus I was pretty excited, especially as Ridley was at the helm! The trailer made it look so promising... but then came a movie that destroyed everything, the timeline, the space jockey, all of it... I went on the blame Damon Lindelof for it, especially after reading the original awesome Jon Spaths script.Opening night, it starts well... Then it continues and even though there is not much character development like in Alien, it's feeling better than Prometheus. What I liked about Alien, is how you felt the characters had known and worked with each other for ages, talking about money, food etc, friendships that form (Brett and Parker come to mind) I didn't get that feeling with the Covenant crew. So then Danny McBride picks up a rogue radio transmission and they narrow it down to a new planet with a habitat that can sustain life, one they just happened to miss while surveying the universe for habitable planets, a transmission that can be picked up by a space helmet but not a giant spaceship. Then the new captain makes the decision to throw away the ten years of planning and training and decides to head to this new planet because no one can be arsed to go back into hypersleep.Queue the Aliens style landing on the new planet. Let's land in the water, which could contain anything and get our legs wet and not bother landing on that land over there, or even better let's ignore that entire Alien city in walking distance just across the way. Hey Walter, I've got a good idea, instead of sending 85% of our human crew why don't you go ahead and survey it for us so we can keep this cargo of 2000 people safe? Actually, no forget it, lets all go, and do you know what's a good idea? Let's forget wearing any space suits because the air is breathable and there can't possibly be any airborne alien viruses or anything right? right! let's go.The middle of the film picks up slightly with some tension building music and some airborne viruses fired out from some alien plants infecting two unfortunate members of the crew (should have put those damn space helmets on!)What is the best thing to do when a member of your crew gets sick with an alien pathogen? Put them in quarantine? no, let's bring him into the medical bay and lock him in, wait for a massive alien that's developed in his body in a matter of minutes to burst out his back and THEN open the door to try and kill it... watch out for that blood on the floor... don't want slip over holding a gun.I quite liked the introduction of the new Alien, even if they did grow massive in a matter of minutes.The film takes it's biggest nosedive is when David appears. Hey guys, let's follow this guy we don't know past all these burnt looking bodies and not bother to ask how they all died... The rest of the film from here ruins my idea of Alien, including the whole timeline. My issues arise with David managing to create alien eggs, and aliens, in a cave, for ten years, with a flute. My issues with this are as follows, in Alien John Hurt finds this amazingly beautiful creature, sat in a pilot's seat in an alien craft, it's a huge creature which has been there for a long time it seems (John says it must have been there thousands of years, it's fossilised) but Prometheus changes this timeline as its only set 100 years or less before Alien, and if David creates these Alien eggs then who planted them thousands of years ago on that Alien ship on LV426?. They could have used a great opportunity to set the prequels on this planet, or at least how it got to that planet, but instead, set it across multiple planets and drag it out, changing the timeline as it goes. The rest of the film is just a re-hash of all the other films. Billy Cudrup thinks it's a wise idea to follow David into a dark basement, full of eggs, moments after seeing him stood next to his crewmates head ripped off on the floor... maybe call for some help? or maybe look into suspicious looking egg? Let's look in the egg, get facehuggered and have an alien pop out all in ten minutes, then a fully-grown alien appears moments later. I didn't care for the crew by the end of the film, they kill one alien, so the writers had to think of a way to get another alien on the ship, let's infect another crewman who's name I don't remember or care about and have another alien fully grown and stalking the rest of the crew in the next ten minutes. There's also a very obvious and predictable twist. All this excitement and death has got two of the crew horny, hey let's go have a shower with some really loud music so we can't hear our crewmates because they won't need us right? at least we see some boobs.Let's blow it out the airlock because that's never been done before, reveal the twist and then end it.

1535,amartin007,Time will tell,7,21 May 2017,"I think it's too soon to tell honestly where this film will end up being perceived in the Alien franchise. Viewing Prometheus and Covenant is a bit like hearing sample portions of a melody. In the end the entire melody may be fantastic, and this was but a small piece to transport us to the chorus that is Alien. It could also be the middle section of a disastrous melody that leads us to Alien in a very unsatisfying way. I think a lot is riding on where the franchise goes from here. I hang on to the hope that Ridley is taking us on a ride that is slowly building. A song that is elevating to a crescendo at some point.Apart from that I will say my biggest gripe about this movie is they have lost what made the original so scary. The tight quarters, flickering lights, holding your breath, slow pace, wondering where the hell it was atmosphere. This movie was not scary in the least. That being said I think a lot of today's horror flicks could learn a lot from watching 70's movies. Don't show the monster too much... build up the anticipation... build a sense of no hope... make the viewer feel trapped with the character. I haven't seen this done in a film in many years.

1536,uf-243-912467,Alien: Fassbender,2,2 October 2017,"The movie is not so much about the alien as it is about the relationship between two androids. As such it can be considered drama more than horror. What we have is 90 percent screen time for Fassbender conveniently playing both androids and as such having something like a very long monologue with himself. Everything else is just (visual) sugar. The crew? Completely forgettable. But worry not: They all die namelessly anyway. The first one still in his stasis pod due to some random (plotwise cheap and pointless) accident right at the beginning. We even get his funeral. But since he had no lines whatsoever, why should I care? Oh, he was someones husband. I guess I have to take Scott's word for it, as the movie didn't show any relationship.The alien? We see a new one. But not for long, as it get's killed. Then a second one, but that get's killed as well pretty soon. Then Daniel (Fassbender II) creates THE alien. But that get's killed rather quickly, too. No wait, it's on the mother-ship. Wait, didn't this happen before? Like in Alien 1? And in Alien 2? And in Alien 4? The only plausible reason for using this plot device again I can think of is irony.If you absolutely have to follow the Hollywood Movie Cookbook to the letter, try better in hiding it.TL;DR: If you love Fassbender (and he is a great actor) portraying two androids lacking in emotion and talking to each other for two hours, this movie is for you.",Alien - Covenant
1537,the_wretched26,Cheesy dialogue and a messy narrative make this a confusing outing. It's a wonky blend of the original Alien and Prometheus. Apples and Oranges.,5,25 May 2017,"Cheesy dialogue and a messy narrative make this a confusing outing. It's a wonky blend of the original Alien and Prometheus. Apples and Oranges.Directed by Ridley Scott, Alien: Covenant sees a crew of couples consisting of planet engineers and colonisers on the ship 'Covenant', which is on its way to a distant habitable earth-like planet, until they abruptly veer off course to investigate a distress signal.There are some notable actors here, and most of them serve their screen time well, including Daniels (Katherine Waterston), Oram (Billy Crudup), Tennessee (Danny McBride), Branson (James Franco), and android Walter (Michael Fassbender). The overall relationship between crew members is definitely a lot warmer than that of the terrible Prometheus. They also don't make the same stupid mistakes as Shaw and her crew they make all new ones.At least there is a bit more backstory, explanation and character building in Covenant. The crew does have a bit of that trucker-type camaraderie of the original Alien, and even James Cameron's Aliens. But it's still a bit strange that there wasn't more hesitation with visiting a planet, with a distress call, that was completely off course and could pose a certain amount of danger. But perhaps we've seen this happen in so many of these films and it's just not that convincing anymore.On top of that, they stumble around pressing buttons, and aside from the Ripleyesque Daniels, don't really approach anything with any kind of caution. Daniels appears to be a bit different; a born leader and a tough nut from the get-go, but it appears that director Scott has spent too much time on making her Ripley. To the point that even some of her lines are straight out of Alien. Throughout the film you get a rushed 'best of' catalogue of the earlier films and at times it's just so so forced not surprising considering the backlash from Prometheus.So that's why we see a bit of the classic xenomorph this time round, and it's cool, but incredibly rushed and just so predictable, as are the earlier scenes with its cousin the neomorph. Scott made an attempt to get back to the franchise's horror roots, but hasn't left any room for suspense over the copious amounts of blood and gore.This is in no way a coherent film, and maybe that's because of the Prometheus mess that's still very much in the air. There are strange and unusual character moves and motives, and a plot that doesn't make much sense, but you have to give Scott credit for his big ideas and Blade Runner-like philosophies of creation and A.I. identity.The flashback of surviving Prometheus members David (Michael Fassbender) and Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) arriving on the engineers' home planet and quoting from 'Ozymandias' was extremely haunting and even a bit biblical – probably the highlight of the film for me. Though David's motivations and evil agenda were sometimes over-the-top, Fassbender was brilliant. Playing both David and new Covenant android Walter, this is a Fassbender moment to remember.The flute scene between Walter and David was also a stand-out and feels like the Ridley Scott that we remember. Two androids bonding for the first time and pondering their own creation and sense of identity and then it's ruined by their epic superhero-like battle which didn't feel like either Alien or Prometheus, but a scene from Batman v Superman.It's a real pity because there are some decent and profound ideas buried deep within Alien: Covenant, but its predictability and nonsensical approach, as well as its overcompensation for nostalgia, almost ruined those ideas altogether.Scott should just make a film about these 'god' philosophies that is completely separate from the Alien universe. Well, I guess there's still Blade Runner 2049, which he's had some influence on. Fingers crossed that it'll be a bit more coherent than Covenant. With director Denis Villeneuve in the chair, it just might be.More on moviebarf.com",Alien - Covenant

Space crew going on space mission, with very bad decision's from the first scene to the last. And also, acting was very bad, so bad that they needed to put two Michael Fassbanders in the movie.

1546,brownhatlooser,Yawn - Anger - Repeat,4,13 May 2017,"So here we are, after the convoluted and ultimately unnecessary Prometheus, Alien Covenant arrives with the promise of a return to what made the Alien franchise so successful. Posters boasting the original zenomorph with the tag line 'Run' caught the attention of even the most cynical of us (me). So how does it hold up? Does it set straight the mess that was Prometheus? In short....not a hope!Alien Covenant starts out fine, a small nod to Prometheus, which should have been a sufficient door closed, and we are introduced to the new crew. It feels familiar but it's forgivable, we are just happy there's no sign of the engineers! You can instantly pick out the Ripley replacement but it's the addition of Danny McBride that shows any glimmer of hope with the new cast. He genuinely does his best and would be right at home with the crew of the Nostromo. Fassbender is back as David (the best casting in Prometheus) and new synthetic Walter. The twin role relationship is predictable but he also does what he can to keep it afloat. The rest of the characters are forgettable and underdeveloped. It quickly becomes about cramming as much origin of life nonsense into the two hour snooze fest then why we should even care that these people are fighting for their lives.Stupid decision follows stupid decision and the crew gets smaller and smaller. I find it hard to believe that scientists would land and explore an unknown planet without so much as a spacesuit! We are introduced to a relation of the zenomorph through similar host incubation and it seems like something is finally about to kick off. What follows is some disappointing CGI and more head scratching behaviour! You find yourself asking, if this is standard of thinking behind the race they are trying to save...maybe don't bother! The rate that they get over people dying is something to behold. 'My wife is dead?....fair enough'.So it plods on, we find out what happened to David and Shaw. David turns out to be even more of a megalomanic than previously thought (yawn).The zenomorph shows up, a totally laughable birthing scene and once again some below par CGI. A mix of practical effects and CGI would have been so much more effective and would have forced the filmmakers to be more inventive with the action sequences. A final battle and a predictable twist later and we are finally able to leave the cinema to vent our frustration!Ridley Scott has mentioned a further set of movies to bring us up to where Alien (1979) starts but I have a better idea.... Just watch Alien and forget there was ever any prequels. If the film studio are intent on making more movies in the franchise then Scott should hand the reigns over to someone else because the man hasn't a clue how to make a good film anymore! While I'm not the biggest fan of Neill Blomkamp, his ideas for an Aliens sequel sounded far more appealing than a follow up to Prometheus. Sometimes we don't need to know the origin of things, especially when that explanation takes so much away.",Alien - Covenant
1547,galahadfairlight,"Not as bad as Prometheus, but that's no endorsement",4,23 May 2017,"Prometheus......... I simply didn't like that movie at all. Whilst its themes were interesting, it did nothing with them, and was content to let what was supposed to be intelligent characters, die deaths that even a dumb blonde in a slasher movie would escape from.I had ZERO intentions of watching Alien: Covenant in the cinema after the mess Prometheus was, but it was cheap night at the cinema, the missus was insistent that she wanted to see it, and we all know, you don't disappoint your missus..... you let Ridley Scott do it instead!To be fair to the scriptwriter for this movie, he was utterly hamstrung by having to write a continuation of Prometheus, I wouldn't wish that on anyone.At the end of Prometheus, Elizabeth Shaw and Davids head were flying off to go and find answers as to why our 'creators' wanted humans dead.Well that story line was quietly ignored. This movie decided that the big build up of the Engineers in Prometheus was a dead end, so literally killed them off, no interaction, no questions answered, David decided to simply exterminate them.Prometheus was Shaws story, with David being a bit of a dick. Alien: Covenant is the story of David being a monumental dick throughout, Shaw is superfluous to the story, but at least is still more relevant than Vickers was in Prometheus, or her ""DAD!"" revelation.The problem Prometheus had, is the utter stupidity of the characters and the script. Supposed intelligent scientists putting themselves in unnecessary danger throughout, just to move the story forward.Well it seems that Ridley Scott and the new scriptwriter learned nothing of that experience, because its stupidity all over again, as the new crew make the same mistakes again with no helmets that lead to the inevitable infection that kicks it all off.Scanning a new planet and noticing storms and landing sites (in water?), but not spotting the massive Engineer city that is literally within walking distance is just a reminder of problems that existed in Prometheus.Throughout this movie and Prometheus, David has always been painted as an android of intelligence, but the motives of David end up looking stupid.Its obvious now that David is going to be used as the catalyst for creating the Xenomorph we got to see in Alien, a shame really as just like the Space Jockey, mystery is no bad thing, but I digress.Davids conversation with Weyland at the start of the movie and his discussion about life, and how Weyland will die, but he will not, and Davids appreciation for music, and all the other things in life, just doesn't fit with him being responsible for creating the xenomorph species.This is a species that has no passion for anything other than killing and procreating its species. There's no intellectual conversation, no love of music, of art, of life, the xenomorph is everything David is not, so when he calls it the ""perfect organism"", the description is directly at odds with how David sees himself.I suppose what irritates me most, is that both Damon Lindeloff and Jack Paglen seem utterly incapable of looking at their scripts, seeing the problems in them, and not doing some slight revisions to fix the script so that a whole host of minor problems, don't end up being the running theme.The McGuffin of one of the characters hearing a really not very convincing John Denver track over his headset, and that being the catalyst of going to a different planet rather than the one they've been training for as well as being responsible for the lives of over 2000 people, simply isn't convincing enough.The set of circumstances that lead a ship full of humans, with a synthetic android and a storm that disables the ship at the exact right time so they can hear an indistinct tune, that leads them to delay their mission to investigate a planet that has a similar model synthetic android that needs humans to continue his experiments........ is the result of a lazy script with far too many leaps of faith to be taken seriously.Its basically a partial retread of the original Alien, except that movie had a plausible script, with a team of 'space truckers' who paid more attention to quarantine and their own safety, had a plausible reason to investigate the planet they landed on.And thats the key, Alien and Aliens had a plausibility to their scripts that didn't make anything the characters did look out of place, Prometheus and Alien: Covenant seemed to have gone out of their way to insult audiences with slapdash scripts with characters that should have struggled to get work in a McDonalds, let alone scientists and trained ones on important missions.I won't be seeing the sequel to this movie at the cinema, I feel both vindicated and saddened that Alien: Covenant is more of the same crap as Prometheus, but gutted that a franchise that includes Alien and Aliens has descended into this rubbish, and even more gutted that the proposed follow up to Aliens that was going to ignore Alien 3 and Resurrection seems to have been abandoned in favour of Ridley Scotts Prometheus trio.Michael Fassbender is a decent actor, and like many others, his performance is the standout (Danny McBride wasn't bad either!), but the character of David feels like it really should have been in a different series of movies.Gutted the Alien franchise has plumbed the depths of stupidity again, it's time it was facehugged.",Alien - Covenant

1550,hevincze,Outrageously stupid plot for 12 year olds,1,29 May 2017,"The biggest problem with the movie is that it could not get rid of the issues with Prometheus like irrational decision-making, irritating characters. This emotion based decision making is good in a drama, but not in a sci-fi. You don't have empathy for the characters, because you don't even know them, plus they act so stupid. All of them expendables.Regarding the creation of the xenomorphs, in my opinion, the most unbelievable and dumbest explanation was chosen. Seriously? A man-made psychopathic android believes to create the perfect organism and the result is this? For me it is very hard to understand David's personality. It seems like he appreciates intelligence, creativity, arts and human affection, but then he creates a life-form which has no interest in any of these. What is he gonna do with them? Writing symphonies and poems together? Or maybe watching them killing everyone they see? Ridley Scott killed the story, an unforgivable mistake. Maybe later we learn this xenomorph is different from the original. In Prometheus we saw a mural depicting the queen, so it would make more sense that Engineers had created first and David just replicated something similar.Unrealistic action scenes. Come on, Daniels is flying all around the ship on a rope trying to shoot the alien, then she returns perfectly fine, no scars. I was holding my head and asking myself what the heck they wanted with this scene. I didn't buy tickets to Rambo and sorry Daniels is not Ripley, not even close. The xenomorph looked like being on steroids, huge muscles, huge body compared to the original.All in all, too much from everything, too many unnecessary references to previous films, too many forced unreal situations only to ""entertain"" people with CGI, too much stupidity in the plot like it was meant to entertain 12 year olds. I can say this is the worst movie in the Alien franchise. I have already forgotten most of the movie and cannot recall any scene I want to re-watch as it was not interesting at all. Hollywood has chosen the easy way again, no effort to create an intelligent script, but rely on the fan base of the Alien franchise and cash in.",Alien - Covenant

It did not.""Covenant"" makes the same mistakes and adds some new ones. That is depressing to contemplate. It signals a complete lack of respect for Scott's audience and a total disregard for his art form. I won't rehash the many criticisms detailed in other reviews. Suffice it to say that the plot is absurd, the characters have zero dimension (except the androids), and the CGI is particularly bad in spots. I'm inclined to think the acting is weak, except that the writing is so puerile that it is difficult to draw any conclusions in that respect.In any case, the primary reason for this post is to vote against the positive ratings that so many have given ""Covenant"".

1553,zoltan-sztana,A good new chapter in the Alien franchise.,7,21 May 2017,"Since the first trailer I have been eager to watch this movie. I went to see it in IMAX, and had a great experience. A very deserving origin story for the Xenomorph.What I liked most in it was it's dark tone, and the superb acting of Michael Fassbender. R rating was the good choice, and I am grateful that they didn't forced it into PG13. Ridley Scott did an excellent job. People were immersed in the movie.The characters were very good. I liked that they had emotions, that the situation had it's effect on them. They made mistakes, and weren't sterile or stupid. For me David's character is one of the best in the franchise. Michael Fassbender is just perfect for the role. The dark fate of Shaw's character was horrifying, and yet perfectly fitting. I was a little bit worried by the actor choices before the film, but they proved me wrong fortunately.About the story. It used the same formula as the predecessors, but it is one I like. Simple, but well written with some philosophical depth in the David/Walter thread. The fate of the engineers, the origin of the Xenomorph worked well. The movie followed it's logic, and didn't fell apart, which is very appealing for me in a story. The setting was marvelous, I really liked the planet-side scenes. The space ship scenes were also great.About the Xenomorph itself, I much more prefer the practical effects, but it still looked good. I have also liked the Neomorphs. Good addition to the franchise.I would recommend to anyone who loves the franchise to watch this movie.",Alien - Covenant
1554,ic-tiger,"Can be watched once, but ruins the prequels",6,30 October 2017,"You can watch it once, I would describe it as a mediocre slasher movie with some rather good alien features.Pros:Some of the actors were alright, especially Fassbender did an outstanding job, kind of saved it for me from hating it in the end. Visual effects, filming was mostly good -the beginning of the plot was alright. Still an alien film, it starts out in a unique and deep universe - some points of the film makes you feel like you're actually watching an Alien movie. Some scenes are actually really well- written, despite the plot itself being mediocre. The movie did a great job with sustaining tensions, it rather added to the value. The predictable plot somewhat ruined it, though.Cons:Alien's CGI is bad. If you cut visual costs with using CGI, do not cut costs on the CGI itself. It's a bad habit of modern Hollywood movies. There are many plot holes in the events. I could count them all day long. Entirely alien planet with some different parameters, yet appears to be exactly the same as Earth. They didn't even try to make it look and work differently. It said to have lower G force for example, but that does not have an effect either. Terrible, irrational behavior, dumb, dumb decision making of a seemingly professional crew. Teenagers versus killer feeling. Characters lack in depth, only Fassbender's not. It's funny the cyborgs are more human than the humans themselves. RIP complexity of the Alien franchise. It's totally killed off now. It's like when you want to answer a complicated question, and you decide to say some dumb stuff to avoid having to explain things. The movie franchise has totally lost its potential for me. If you look it in the big picture, it's almost exactly the same as the original Alien film. Anti-Climax was badly executed and full of plot holes. Basically, the entire story was predictable from the second half of the movie.Altogether, any of the alien movies were better, had better visuals, took place in a more fitting world, had way better story, better characters, they were much deeper and complex. What Prometheus as a modern alien movie created for us, this film destroyed it all. Some of the unanswered questions got unimpressive, lazy answers.

Maybe hand the reigns over to another (less timid) director and trim the budget by $100 million and we would have ended up with something interesting and substantial.

1557,tnoor75,By far one of the best sci-fi movies. Not just in recent years ...,9,19 October 2017,"I'll try to not beat around the bush in this review: (minor spoilers included) Had to watch the movie three times in different theatres to come the conclusion I've put in the summary / title. And yes, that means that I am OK with all flaws in logic and mistakes certain characters have made.Period.That said, I have to admit, that even though I tried hard to not have expectations after what was presented in Prometheus, I was somewhat a bit disappointed that Covenant doesn't display much of the Engineers world and society. In addition, the look of the posters suggested a lot of xenos to be seen. Imho. But well... things came different on screen. With Michael Fassbender giving a STELLAR performance as both David and Walter. That prologue alone is something I have NEVER seen and felt before in any other movie. Props to Guy Pearce for his short-timed but powerful acting as Weyland.What seemed confusing at first sight is actually a great narrative outline; not just connecting the dots between the climaxes of each act but underlining David's cold ambition to eradicate humanity once and for all.But as with any movie, the main characters of any movie are only half as good if the rest of the cast suck. So even though I credit David as the movie's main character, I am also very fond of Daniels. Katherine Waterston managed to made me understand her character's skepticism and caution.... which in the end have proved to be dreadfully justified.Yes, we have seen that characteristic in Ripley before. But this is something different...as Waterston comes across as an emotionally and highly vulnerable woman. Until that moment where she goes really badass.Can't say nothing bad about the rest of the cast either: Jimmy McBride gives a solid performance as the movie's comic relief buddy, Billy Crudup as a consequential but faithful captain-by-accident and Demián Bichir as Chief Security Dan Lopé, whose husband Tom (Nathaniel Dean) dies giving birth to the second neomorph.I just wonder what kind of logical methods some haters would come up with when they're in such situations like in the medbay.... which is one of the most horrifying sequences I ever saw in a movie.The xenomorphs / protomorphs could have had a tad less audio effects but boy.. I still enjoy watching them. A LOT.My general conclusion: I love the film not only because it took the prequel-series a great step back towards old territories but moreover because of what happens after Davids' actions onboard the covenant.

Disappointed, frustrated, anger to Sir Ridley of messing up a wonderful plot with a hell of a lot of loose ends , let alone the two dumb scientists. I regarded the film being an insult to the intelligence of all science fiction fans. I'm pretty much interested on the creation side of the series. OK, xenomorphs, neomorphs..gore, blood you have it all in AC satisfying the Alien fans in a spectacular way, no question about that. But still some Why's, How's , when's are missing . Answers in the next saga? I highly doubt that. Ridleys following in the footsteps of George Lucas who shot himself in the knee with the new Star Wars films.Just a small sample of what I mean: When David finds and takes the crew to his hideout in the city they all pass thru the dead bodys of the so called engineers. The funny bit is that not a single soul asks ""who are these guys?!"" ""where are we ??""......very very absurd !! ...arghhh!!Overall AC is what gore loving Alien fans was expecting and they rightfully got what they asked for.

Even Alien 3 seems like a total masterpiece compared to this mess.It seems with every Alien movie after part 3 it just gets worse and worse. With Aliens VS Predator being the only exception. That worked brilliantly so of course they had to screw up the second movie by taking two of Sci-Fi 's great creatures and melt them into one. How stupid can you get?With Covenant the stupid remains. The characters do stupid things for stupid reasons. Hard to imagine Captain Dallas making any similar decisions. Are these clowns really charged with this important mission? The second in command acts like an wimpy army priest. Someone really put him second in command?. For whatever reason I wonder. On the basis of what skill?Basically all the characters suck and the whole plot is just terrible and highly predictable. What I loved about the original films was that it felt and looked very real. The people were real and you felt like you were right there with them, on the Nostromo or on LV-426. The Alien was bloody scary!. Covenant just feels so unrealistic that you don't care at all.These days if you want a taste of what Alien should be like, then try the computer game Alien-Isolation. That'll bring you right back to the essence of the series.

But consider ""Aliens"", which I *adore*; ""We've lost contact with the colony on LV-426"". Could you send a robot? Sure, but we're sending Colonial Marines in case there are Xenos there, even though nobody *believes* Ripley's Xeno story. So the Marines get there, find clear evidence of Xenos and a battle, and... walk right into the Xeno nest and start poking things? Again, it's all cinema, and it's a requirement that *people have to do dumb things in order to propel a story forward*. If the Nostromo crew never lets an infected Cain back on board, it's a 20-minute film. There need to be deviations from ""common sense"" in order to create action; otherwise, nothing would happen.With that out of the way, I found the first 3/4ths of the movie very interesting and a breath of fresh air. Specifically:
The scene with the backburster... great tension, still makes my palms sweat.The David vs. Walter dynamic... so fun. Every scene between the two of them is full of little verbal quirks, jabs, compliments, and observations.David's ""lair"", going mad and experimenting with Xeno development... a nice story line.Things I did not like:
The last 20 minutes was rushed and uninteresting.The fight between Daniels & the Xeno on that cargo ship w/ the crane felt totally forced in there and I like it less and less with each viewing.The surviving crew get back on board, and then in the blink of an eye, all the crew except for Daniels, Tennessee and David/Walter are dead. Then it's more fighting Xenos using heavy machinery.If it were up to me, I would have:
Basically kept the first 45 minutes or so.Had David *and* Walter go back to the shipHad the second half be a traditional ""Alien"" film where a Xeno hunts ppl onboard the Covenant.",Alien - Covenant

1563,rockstarm-524-778001,Ridley is turning into George Lucas,3,5 October 2017,"Sigh... Where to begin? There's so much to talk about. A third of the way through Alien Covenant it occurred to me that Ridley Scott has insulted fans of both the Alien mythology and the recent Prometheus mythology. The director has clearly lost his nerve and instead of continuing what he started in Prometheus, completely wipes everything in the previous film with a new film. Unfortunately this ""new"" film is also not so new. Alien covenant is literally a ""greatest hits"" album of the previous Alien films where every action sequence, character, plot etc is a rehash of the original Alien. Dare I say... it is the Terminator Genisys of Alien films. It's almost like Scott threw out his original plan for a trilogy and settled on compressing the whole arrival of the Alien species into 2 hours. The movie does not take it's time and instead rushes through everything in the hope of satisfying viewers with a glimpse of the Alien (Xenomorph) in the end of the film... and unfortunately wrecking the Alien mythology in the process.While I agree Prometheus was not a good film, the new characters, the origins of the Engineers and the fate of the survivors had me gripped and wanting more. I wanted to know more about the journey of the survivors of the Prometheus. Alien covenant kills of its survivors including the fascinating Elizabeth Shaw character (played by the talented Noomi Rapace), and shoehorns a new group with no back story or introduction. The CGI is also worse than I'd expected from a Ridley Scott film, and was bad enough to take me out of the film. CGI of the aliens (xenomorphs and Neomorphs) looked fake and game-like. The story and plot have holes large enough to fit the whole planet of LV233 in it and the intelligence of characters are dumbed down dramatically so that they could be killed off easily and quickly. The movie lacked the eeriness and psychology of the original Alien and suspense of Cameron's Aliens. I really feel that Ridley Scott has been given enough with the Alien franchise and should hand it off to someone with a better vision and a sensible touch. Like George Lucas, he's rehashing the old films and bulldozing his way through the canon in the hope of forcing his jigsaw piece with the original Alien. For the general public, this is an entertaining, mindless, gory flick. For film enthusiasts, sci-fi fans, Alien and Prometheus fans... this is a huge letdown and frustration. Such a disappointment.",Alien - Covenant
1564,daryl-l-king,Good entertainment but didn't meet expectations and not satisfied.,5,20 May 2017,"WARNING - potential but SUBTLE spoiler alert at the end of my review. Not explicitly but implicitly. I am not sure it is a spoiler at all, as it is a very general comment under my paragraph ""Finally"" - but just letting readers know.I had very high expectations for this film.First, we have the memory of the whole ""Aliens"" series, which breakthrough in Sci-Fi/Horror that we need to keep the theme with. Then, we have the (in my opinion), excellent production values of ""Prometheus"", to maintain (while Prometheus opened up the opportunity for a sequel-prequel in the series and left many questions unanswered - the overall production and of it was excellent - high quality, not cheap).Now, we get to Alien Covenant. While it was entertaining - it somehow did not maintain the proper sense of production ""eeriness"" and timing that had successfully created the very real sense of awe of the new and unknown, anticipation and suspense - that Prometheus did. I thought the timing and the acting in ""Covenant"" was a bit ""clunky"" compared to Prometheus. Charlize Theron, Noomi Rapace, and the other actors in the crew in Prometheus did a truly outstanding job. And while the cast in Covenant was very good, they were not as...effective, and this could have been affected by the script, of course. Something was missing here for me. And, again, the sense of timing of what unfolded was a bit ""off"" - it just did not flow smoothly, and suspense wasn't created nearly as well. For example, compared to the scene in Prometheus when the 2 scientists were left behind in the ship, due to the storm, and were being tracked on the ship's computer and the captain tells them that something was alive/moving, and then stopped. That little bit there was start and part of excellent suspense, and tied in nicely with the original films where the Alien/s were tracked as ""blips"" on the screen.Finally, and most importantly to me - key questions were NOT answered. I wanted good production values AND wanted key questions answered. I wanted to be entertained, held in suspense, scared, cheer, all that, as well as for the story to be more....cerebral if you will, and actually answer questions we all have about the engineers, their evolution, their reasons for doing what they do/did, any communication between engineers and man (their purposed creation/target), more scientific information on the development and evolution of the ""virus"" that infects the host and becomes various forms of the Xenomorph, etc.... questions unanswered.What the film DID do, was leave the door open for a sequel.",Alien - Covenant
1565,jcolucci0105,"Ripley, we need you!",7,21 May 2017,"Let me start by making it clear that I do enjoy these films. I love a good prequel that answers a ton of questions the original series did not address, Alien: Covenant does just that. It pretty much answers a lot of questions that were created by Prometheus. So if for no other reason but to find out what happened to Shaw and David you should see this film. You should see this film if you love the Alien franchise and you should see this film if you want to see a good thriller. *****SPOILER ALERT******This is just my opinion but this franchise is famous for producing some of the strongest and influential female characters in the past 35 years of film. You have Ripley in the first four films, and Vasquez in the Aliens (1986) film. Two female characters who I believe should be required classes (they can call the class Ripley and Vasquez) in any Women's Study degree in every university. They are the models for what strong, intelligent female leadership would and should look like. Then we enter Alien: Covenant...again ****Spoiler Alert*** The Covenant is a colony ship on the way to a planet for, well, colonization. So I am going to assume with near certainty that the crew flying this ship would be trained professionals. Pilots, engineers, medical personal etc. Ripley was a military pilot, Vasquez was a marine. But this crew on the Covenant are just random people they found on the street, or at least that's how they behaved. One scene in particular that I felt like almost getting up and walking out was when they land on a planet where they received a faint signal. Of course they need to check it out, of course. They leave Faris back at the landing ship to watch over things and in typical Alien fashion someone gets sick and has to return to the ship. Without going into great detail, I will let you watch it for yourself, what goes on in the next 5 minutes can only be described as a Jerry Lewis like slapstick incompetents of a colossal magnitude.Everything from straight panic, to slipping and falling, to more panicking, to shooting wildly in a ship FILLED WITH OXYGEN TANKS!! Come on Ridley Scott!! What are you doing?? This scene was both embarrassing and completely ridiculous! These are suppose to be trained professionals who know how to handle stressful emergency situations but instead we get the equivalent of shaggy and Scooby's reaction when they see a ghost. Covenant has very weak characters that time and time again put themselves into harms way due to stupidity and an apparent lack of any training in anything. Where are the strong leaders I am use to seeing in this franchise? I was completely disappointed in these characters who by their behavior and reactions appeared to be in a huge rush to die!",Alien - Covenant
1566,chillandla1983,Alien Garble,3,19 May 2017,"Being a ""True"" movie nut, this collection of mess is terribly directed and produced. I was expecting some semblance of continuity and answers to ""PROMETHEUS"", instead I was even more baffled by the ignorance of the crew members, the plot, and the android they brought with them should have known better.Here is my main question, how did ""David"" know the spaceship ""Covenant's"" workings, protocols, and access codes? He got on the lift ship and knew it quite well, then flew with the crew up the ""Covenant"" and knew it too, not to mention all of the access codes for restricted areas. Then he knew how to work the friggin stasis pods, go figure.....! And ""MOTHER"" allowed it all, I'm just saying.....Moviegoer's today want connectivity, relationship, continuity, and a great cliff-hanger. The audacity of Ridley Scott to put this stupidity on film and then expect us anticipate the next film is ludicrous. We have been disappointed completely, ""ALIEN"" fans that go see this after reading some of these reviews, should think twice before going. I have never thought this way before, but wait for the rental at ""RED BOX"".........!!!",Alien - Covenant

Michael Fassbender- i enjoyed every moment of this guy on the film. he was magnetic and act very well.even when the dialogues sucked he made them sound good some how. 2.world building- if i ignore the previews movies of the franchise and only take to consideration Prometheus, and alien covenant as its prequel, the world they created and the way that the movie maker delivered it to us is amazing and i cant wait for more information and history about this yet to discovered world.",Alien - Covenant

If they make another Alien movie that has Corporal Hicks in it, and they do it well... then I'm all for it. Bring on the Colonial Marines! I want a bug hunt! All the people in prometheus besides Shaw and the Captain were kinda meh. All the people in Alien covenant were kinda meh. They seriously need to look at character development more. Even Aliens which was primarily a military action movie had a crap ton more character development. The most memorable quotes of the Aliens series came from that second movie.

I have loved the alien movies, grown up with them and would rank as my favourite film anthology of all time. However this movie makes me rethink that. The general concept was good but the stupidity of how it was put together made it seem completely implausible. Aside from the stupidly fast growing aliens, single brain cell characters, I can't believe they didn't do a reconnaissance with drones of the crash site where the transmission was emanating. How stupid could you be in sending out people onto a brand new planet breathing in the air without doing some kind of check first why put all those people at risk is total perplexing, not even breathing apparatus.I'm so shocked by this movie, where was the duty of care to keep this franchise in safe hands, what a bloody disaster.",Alien - Covenant

You would assume the ship is linked to the android and would know an impostor... I will not even mention how they ignored all warnings from the ship and just risked an entire ship with 2000+ lives on-board to get close enough because of the pilot's wife... Dumb, dumb, dumb. Pure Garbage. It's as if fourteen-year-olds wrote a script and Hollywood made it into a movie. The writing doesn't match the visuals, is what I'm saying.",Alien - Covenant
1573,ben_hathaway,A genuinely tragic waste.,3,15 May 2017,"Never have two films filled me with such a sense of profound and deep ennui and disappointment as Prometheus and Covenant. They could have been science fiction for the ages, pieces of history which complete, or give beautiful background to arguably the best duo of horror/sci-fi films humanity ever created, in Alien and Aliens. Why is £100m been given to an 80yr old who very clearly cannot make decent films anymore?It wouldn't, or shouldn't even have been that hard. Ridley Scott had the budget, the scenery, the CGI, the lead actor at the zenith of his career giving incredible performances in both films. Even after Prometheus, you senile old fool, even after making a mess out of that, after the own goal you kicked there - just learn from it and make something wonderful, something spellbinding. To take the same mistakes from Prometheus and stick them in AC is another level of dumb. Its dumber than the decision making of the characters in both films, which is borderline braindead. Lets start with the good. The actual filming and scenery are incredible (as they were in Prometheus), the film looks amazing. Fassbender is brilliant. He's effectively doing both lead roles, which is almost a salvation, of sorts. The first segment of the movie, where the ship has difficulties and they lose the captain, are great. The bad. In Prometheus, they went off on a multi-year, multi-trillion dollar mission because they found some chalk drawings in a cave. Surely some amoeba brained cretin will ensure such an event wont happen again""Hey, someones playing a John Denver record from a world we didn't even know existed, shall we abandon our 7 year voyage and go live there instead? ""Hey, lets land in some water. Not the dry land next to it. Not the vast alien city we seem to be within walking distance of that we didn't notice at all. Some water"" ""Hey guys. Shall we scientifically investigate this new alien planet or just send 80% of the crew down there wearing baseball caps?"" ""what shall we do with this guy who's clearly been infected with something terrible, quarantine him or bring him onboard?""This carries on almost ad infinitum. The script/plot writers for this are an embarrassment not just to film, but to the human race. Deary, deary, deary me. I spent half the film sighing as I imagined Ridley clapping as his actors, who you couldn't care less about, make these decisions which will result in their deaths in the very near future.The scene where one of the supporting actors say they have to ""go use the bathroom"" and heads off to meet their inevitable fate defies belief. Then there is the nonsense about faith. Thankfully, Billy Crudup's character, who has all this faith, gets alien facehugger-killed, and I think everyone should be quite happy about that. David. David, David. Is the Alien franchise ultimately based around an android who has a bit of a hissy fit and decides, for no clear reason, to commit genocide against the Engineers, and also plans to exterminate humanity in its entirety? Ridley, Ridley, Ridley, what have you done? What is this total mess?These Engineers, who promised so much, are basically ignored as part of the plot. David just exterminates them and every living thing on their planet, despite them being a vastly intelligent race, by lobbing chemical weapons out of a cargo bay. Then, despite being in complete control of the spacecraft, Ol' Dave crash lands it in some nearby woods. By this point, you're so demoralised you just hope something truly terrible happens in terms of bloodshed so its at least a mad slasher pic. But no, Davey boy shows his brother Walter how to play the flute.We then find out Davey has been effectively living as a mad scientist, working in candlelight and with quills and paper drawings, genetically engineering loads of alien creatures, using Noomi Roopace's corpse, which somehow wasn't destroyed by the pathogens that destroyed every humanoid, or the unnecessary crash. So in an advanced, space-faring city, technology everywhere, a robot is using medieval techniques and devices to go about his mental work. What had Scott been drinking here?Thankfully, after avoiding any more common sense, the remaining few characters end up back on the spaceship, one of them infected of course. Then after some more total failures of decision making, the alien manages to grow from inches long to a huge monster within a few minutes, (see also: Prometheus) and manages to murder two of the crew who got so horny watching everyone die in terrible ways they have a shag in a shower with such loud music playing the alarms about a monster coming to kill them aren't heard. Why have suspense when we can have Scream 3 in space? Why make a decent film when we can smear excrement on some paper and use that as the script? Why have character development if you can avoid it?As per prior movies, the alien is lobbed out of the air lock, as they cant come up with a more creative way of killing it, and the identical android, who no-one bothered checking isn't the identical bad one, turns out to be the baddie, regurgitates two alien embryos(??) he'd been storing for a rainy day, plays some classical music, end credits roll.I think I wanted Islamic State to attack the cinema by this time. Ridley should be in a home wearing a nappy, not stealing a living with a plot written by someone who thinks CSI Miami is the peak of intelligent drama. In all seriousness, I was genuinely saddened by both Prometheus and Covenant. Such a terrible waste of an incredible opportunity, gone forever into the mists of nothingness.",Alien - Covenant

1576,cygnus2613,"Morons, morons, everywhere!",1,6 September 2017,"Visually not bad but the story is sadly lacking and predictable. The characters are not professionals they are morons and idiots who do absolutely stupid things to advance the plot. They really aren't memorable, though as others have said Fassbender does a decent job.*spoilers* 1) The ship has an accident and the captain dies, gets BBQ'd in his cryo tube. His replacement is terrible, he's indecisive and lacking leadership qualities yet blames his short comings and lack of promotions on his being religious.He then alters course to an unknown planet despite the formal objections of his second in command, mostly because the crew doesn't want to go back into cryo. You might think a colony ship might not have the fuel to drastically alter course on a journey that is taking them 10 freaking years and well away from any help or external supplies. Oh wait, lets deploy solar sails in the middle of nowhere and top off the tanks...on what? Any meaningful solar energy would mean they are about an AU or two from the star give or take depending on the star. Nope. Middle of nowhere AND they get hit by some ""event"" that seems like a super-nova yet isn't because they survive it with light damage. Gah! For science fiction this is very lacking in science.2) They go to an unknown planet with no environmental gear. Hello? Diseases or other pathogens? Nawwww! We aren't worried about those on a curiously Earth-like planet devoid of animal life. Hey but we got AR-15s and shotguns though...yeah we got androids that can pass for humans and colony ships that are FTL but still carry a 150 year old firearm. Could have at least carried a precursor to the M41A Pulse Rifle for Pete's sake.3) Major gripe with most Hollywood productions. THE CAPTAIN AND RANKING OFFICERS DO NOT GO ON AWAY MISSIONS!!! Roddenbury was a moron about this and has tainted nearly every other ""Ship"" based show. That is what Marines and other trained professionals are for. The Captain and XO go down to the planet with a majority of the crew leaving like three people on board the colony ship.4) The crew seems to be paired up and this is generally bad practice. They have been in cryo so no relationships could have developed, which means they were selected with knowledge beforehand. This leads to stupid decisions based on emotion, the main reason why the crew should not be involved with other crew. Family as passengers? Sure. The main mission is to protect the ship and colonists and having family in the ""cargo"" gives them an incentive for protecting the colonists and ship. Having your wife as pilot of the away shuttle and in danger and screaming in panic over the radio? Not so much.5) None of this crap jives with the AvP narrative of ancient pyramids and such. Yeah I know its not canon, but it was actually better than this garbage. Pinocchio with daddy issues and a God complex creates monster which in turn kills humanity. Trying to cram in too many sci-fi themes into here.6) More stupid choices...lets go roaming around the creepy building by ourselves so the monster can pick us off and the crazy android can infect us instead of keeping together. Oh and lets not keep an eye on the crazy android living in the middle of a city filled with dead aliens. Finally, lets skip quarantine measures after having been on a planet infected with a weaponized virus.Sadly disappointed in this one. Prometheus had some issues, but they could have been smoothed over had this been done correctly. So glad I skipped this in the theater.",Alien - Covenant

Kind of like ending of the Lost. They just said: ""We dont know the answer to the questions we created so far so here is a pile of garbage for you. Enjoy!""

This movie however has some problems with its identity and whether this is a film about David (Fassbender) and his programmed human nature to pro-create (even if it is with Alien Hybrids and Elizabeth Shaw) or whether this answers all the questions raised in Prometheus. The simple answer is whilst Fassbender puts in a great shift in playing David, the engineer universe is left wide open and in parts it feels like a crowbar attempt to get the Alien universe we all know and love. It feels like there was some marketing pressure to give the masses what they want. Also I would add that the CG baby xenomorph's look a little Xbox to put it bluntly.",Alien - Covenant

1586,liahneb,"A slightly gorier, more feminist take on Prometheus (with more explanation)",5,22 May 2017,"This is definitely better than Prometheus! It's not very suspenseful though, and I found that part disappointing. There are also some feminist nods with the 2nd-in-command male seeming awkward, scared, and slightly incapable while the female 3rd-in-command is just immediately confident, has a plan, always knows what to do, bosses people around at-will, seems unaffected emotionally, etc. They go out of their way to feature women as being stronger than normal (one guy says, ""I've never heard my wife sound scared before..."" - lol), and I feel that takes away from the story -- we lose the sense of humanity and fear from the first two with Ripley. On that note, the female co-lead (or whatever her role is) is not very believable. I found the ending to be anti- climactic (just ask yourself why an alien all of a sudden attacks something mechanical versus a human being). To me, this felt like half a movie in that the movie really takes shape around Fassbender's David character and not what's supposed to be the main plot (essentially an add-on origin story to the Alien saga). There's a great twist at the end (not great if you're paying attention to details) that feels like it should lead to a more satisfying movie, but that's the end. You never feel like the 2 main survivors are in danger. While this is visually stimulating and attempts to fill holes, I'm left asking why their solution to solving the mythology of the xenomorph is so simple. Even when it's explained, it doesn't seem that horrifying -- the music is happy which left me feeling very confused. I find the motivation behind the explanation to be lacking as well. There's gore, but there's really no emotional significance or true fear with everything that happens -- you can see it coming a mile away. The pacing is different than Prometheus, and there's a lot more action, but I found myself only being slightly less bored. There are still holes in the movie. The ending feels rushed. What else can I say? I don't think it's worth seeing in theaters unless you're desperate for a movie to watch. It's better than Prometheus & Alien 3, but I'd say it's only on-par with Alien:Resurrection.",Alien - Covenant
1587,goose-boy99,A Worthy Entry into the 'Alien' Franchise,8,12 May 2017,"I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise, and consider Ridley Scott's 'Alien' to be one of my favourite movies, so when I heard he was returning to direct the sequel to 'Prometheus' I was very excited to see what he had in store. After watching this film I was glad that I was extremely satisfied with the overall result. It successfully recaptures the tension and suspense of 'Alien' while also being a decent sequel to 'Prometheus'. First and foremost, this is clearly an Alien movie, and there are numerous elements of the film that provide satisfaction for die-hard fans of the series such as myself, with the inclusion of things like Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful 'Alien' score (now remastered by Jed Kurzel), countless nods and references to the original film, and a creature that sparks the same amount of terror in audiences as the one in 1979. All of the cast members showcased amazing performances, however the stand-out was definitely Michael Fassbender, with his portrayal of David, the android from Prometheus, as well as Walter, a new and extremely different android. The cinematography was beautiful, and special effects of both the creatures, and spaceships were top notch. The film provides answers to burning questions from 'Prometheus' as well as creating new and intriguing questions for a possible sequel. My only flaw of the film is that it falls victim to the clichés of horror, and can prove to be obvious when a character is about to be killed. Luckily, jump-scares are minimal, as the film relies much more on tension and suspense to create fear. All in all, I believe the film is very good, and will definitely be adding it to my Blu-Ray collection.",Alien - Covenant

There is not enough moments to build suspense. The monsters aren't scary and the newly introduced ones made me feel ripped off. I came to see the xenomorph scare the crap out of helpless people for two hours. The set and prop design is in many places just horrible and makes NO sense.The plot is extremely predictable, cheap and just about everything the characters do would be out of character for someone in their positions.Not only is this in my opinion the worst alien movie by far, it is also the worst scifi movie I have seen in years.Danny McBride was actually a highlight.

These are people who were hired to do a job, and were responsible for thousands of souls - bad decisions only getting worse by the second in the movie. Highly unbelievable.David has completely changed in a way that makes 0 sense from where Prometheus left him.I won't waste any more time writing any more about this movie, but seriously, SAVE YOUR MONEY! I gave this a generous 2 stars because the special effects were halfway decent - then again, any movie with this kind of budget will be stunning.",Alien - Covenant
1592,counting_zero,Rental at best,3,20 May 2017,"I really wanted to like this movie. Truly. As a fan of the Alien franchise I was supremely disappointed by this mess of a movie. For all it' faults, I enjoyed Prometheus, of which this is a supposed sequel.My single biggest gripe throughout this movie was the sheer amount of choices made simply to further the plot, regardless of common sense or character motivation. Eye-rolled so many times I thought I was going to go blind.",Alien - Covenant
1593,Marcus600,A Great Sequel To Prometheus and to the Franchise,10,22 May 2017,"This was a very interesting movie because it answered the questions to Prometheus but also added a couple of more questions that will be answered in the third sequel. A lot of people seem to be bashing this movie but it really isn't that bad. Yes, there are a lot of plot holes but it doesn't ruin the movie because the movie is very intense and entertaining. It brings a new alien called the Neomorph which is very interesting to watch. David is really the villain in this movie the aliens just seem to be obstacles to the story. Well, in conclusion this movie is very entertaining which is the purpose of a movie and I would recommend the movie.",Alien - Covenant
1594,betaterran,"Wasn't expecting much, but certainly more than this.",4,24 May 2017,"If you watched ""Life"" (2017) and thought those astronauts were too stupid to ever be let on a space station, this movie is even worse. This was created to simply placate horror fans with inventive, horrific ways of killing people, and even to that regard the scenes are quick, rushed, and often blurry and hidden in shadows (much like the second Alien vs Predator movie). There are a couple good acting performances, a couple interesting action sequences, but the majority of this film consists of one MacGuffin after another trying to fill in dozens of serious plot holes, to the point that the movie isn't even worth spoiling . . . just don't see it. Most of the film will insult your intelligence to the point you're no longer captivated, so I have to hold the film to four stars out of ten. I was expecting a little more, but not much to be honest. Even with my expectations set low, this was pretty sad fare for sci-fi or horror fans. I hope they just let the franchise die off now. I won't see another Alien movie after this.",Alien - Covenant
1595,zabpehely-95,The saga getting serious. (Spoilers),9,19 May 2017,"I've read the reviews of ""hardcore Alien fans"", and i do not understand why they get upset about the way Ridley Scott sews the saga of Alien.Seeing with my 21 years old eyes the old movies weren't scary at all. They could not bring the nerve wrecking atmosphere to the screen for me, even though i watched the first one at theater, too. They did not have a plot, just a black monster killing crew members in a very vanilla way.So after saying i did not like the old movies (only Aliens, the second part of the saga), i would like to tell you, what things i found excellent in Prometheus and Alien:Covenant.The plot, that the old movies did not have: The tale of discovery, creation, destruction, men and god, men and androids. The movie is playing with the idea that we were created by a superficial species, and questions what artificial intelligence may be capable of. The dialogues, the quotes, the android's curiosity for nature, and fondness for classical music are things which appealed to me very much.The atmosphere that put me always on the edge: The colors, the landscape of the planet, the buildings and bodies of the ancient ""gods"" make a very unique atmosphere. I liked it.The realistic portrayal of alien species slaughtering the crew members: We can see the killings in a very detailed way, which personally, made me feel very uncomfortable, and that is one of the goals of horror, in my opinion. As for me these could have shown just a little bit more of gore, since it would make the movie more characteristic.All in all i really like what Ridley Scott decided to do with the Alien saga, making it more serious, story oriented, and not leaving it to be a stupid killing fest. The only thing that would have made the movie a bit better would be showing a bit more of the killing scenes. Not that i like gore, but that would have made the film more memorable.The things that got into my mind after watching the movie: David killed our creators, and developed the best killers, Aliens. That is an awesome plot twist... So indirectly humans created aliens, and killed their own ""gods"".Some say God made a mistake when he created us, because we are slowly killing Earth, and its cohabitants. Are we doing a mistake by making A.I. so developed? Stephen Hawking says so...",Alien - Covenant
1596,iavais-1,Worth the wait.....cant wait for the sequel,10,16 May 2017,"First off, i don't see the reason why this movie is getting so much hate and 6/10 reviews. This is not a 6/10 movie. From start to finish the movie had me hooked. I enjoyed it so much that i have already seen it three times.The story as most people say falls short of their expectations should try to see this as part of the bigger picture with two more movies to come in this saga that will continue the story and answer all the questions (hopefully). When Prometheus came out it left many unanswered questions in the end but now that Covenant is out you can make sense of the story and when you look back on Prometheus, the unanswered questions don't seem so frustrating.People complained that Prometheus was not very Alien which is correct they explored other ideas and with Covenant due to backlash Prometheus got they included the Alien. So Covenant tried to please fans of both Prometheus and Alien and they did a good job.Pros: Engaging story from start to finish. Michael Fassbender and Katherine Waterston stole the show. After the character of Ellen Ripley in the original Alien Katherine Waterston does a very good job in coming close to her and making us love her character the same way we loved Ellen. Cinematography was amazing and the rest of the cast each played their part very well. Danny McBride was a character i loved and surprised me how well he acted in his role. Cons: Movie seems rushed , i am sure there will be a directors cut. Quite a few questions remain unanswered. Some plot holes and unexplained events. Overall don't let the negative reviews deter you, just go watch the movie and judge for yourself. You won't be disappointed.",Alien - Covenant

1598,spookdier,Great Addition to the Alien Series.,8,24 May 2017,"I loved every minute of this movie. It brings the atmosphere of Alien and Alien3, the fast paced tempo of Aliens, and adds to the grand plot of the series, like Prometheus did. And to top things off, it has its own unique elements. It fits the Alien series perfectly. If you are a fan of the Alien series, and liked Prometheus, I recommend this movie very much.",Alien - Covenant
1599,miserere-149-278366,"Don't listen to haters, check it for yourself.",8,3 August 2017,"Well, I for one enjoyed this. Like the overall story, the build, the acting and the effects. Apart from a couple of shots of the Xenomorph, I think they were stellar. Liked the gore, and the ending. Liked it better than Prometheus, though I love that as well. Felt this had a bit more action, and the change in environment was also welcome.Now, we all know how these ratings and reviews work. People think a movie gets too much praise, and therefore gives it 1/10, or that it doesn't get enough, and so gives it 10/10 to try to balance it out. Well, that doesn't inform you of much other than their general feeling of the movie, and this is childish. My rating reflects my opinion directly after seeing it for the first time. So if nothing else, check it out for yourself, if you have any love for the franchise or just solid science fiction horror.And to a certain other reviewer (we'll call him ash tombola): I am really impressed, you found a dictionary, and spewed out such marvelous hate for this movie. Your p*** poor punctuation unfortunately gave it away, that you are an idiot. ""Ruined my life.."" Just goes to show, you also had a p*** poor life to go with your punctuation.",Alien - Covenant

1602,cybergel-193-516257,An Isaac Assimov and David Cronenberg Hybrid,9,10 May 2017,"As the title of this review suggests, this were the two main 'influential' elements that popped into my mind as I was halfway through this film.Casual horror fans will not be disappointed as there are plenty of boo and gore scenes. However, one should not expect this to be James Cameron's all out war 'Aliens' as well. Ridley Scott took the criticism for Prometheus to heart and set on making this a full-blown 'Alien' film. Will Alien fans be satisfied? Probably. Scott briefly returned to his roots only in the last act. However, the suspense and feeling of dread still permeates the whole of the first two acts of the film.(Heavy Spoilers here!)The human characters aren't given much to develop. James Franco's scenes are blink or miss. However, I was surprised by the amount of screen time given to David, Fassbender's android character from the prequel. The character arc which began in Prometheus, precipitated in the prologue in Covenant, culminates full circle in the parting shot, complete with Wagner's orchestral piece. Scott has done almost the impossible by matching Cameron's portrayal of a robot (in Terminator 2), by not making it sympathetic but by giving it a purpose other than serving mankind. There is more depth and less sentiment here than in Cameron's T2.Given that everyone knows that Fassbender plays two roles. This brings to mind of David Cronenberg's 'Dead Ringers'. The similarities are almost startling. Both sets of twins are intellectual, biologically curious, self-serving, socially inept, whilst having a facade or pretense of serving the female protagonists (Jeremy Irons plays gynecologists and Fassbender plays androids serving both female survivors of physical abominations). The body-horror theme is of course recurrent in the entire Alien canon. The same theme also resonates in many Cronenberg's movies. The face-hugging and chest-bursting scenes only invokes memories of Cronenberg's 'The Brood' (also released in 1979 as Scott's Alien), 'Videodrome', 'Scanners', 'Dead Ringers'. For the latter, the obsession with dissecting 'mutant woman' with abnormal genitalia is a close cousin of the Alien universe. This film is surprisingly multi-layered and will be much talked about especially in regards to David and the consequences that will no doubt be portrayed once again in an inevitable sequel. A fresh take on an old franchise.",Alien - Covenant

Yes, everybody has an opinion but it's impossible that this gets so many one star ratings. So many dumb complaints, I can't even take it ha ha. I really don't know what you want. First you want the Xenomorph back and once you get it you are complaining that it shouldn't be in the movie. Well that's great. If you are all incapable of understanding a sci-fi movie that has so much class and is different from all the garbage we got in the past years than go watch AVP. Alien: Covenant has a great look, an haunting performance by Michael Fassbender as the android David and an amazing score by Jed Kurzel! Plus the movie is totally frightening. The Backburster scene got me on the edge of my seat and the Chestburster scene made me tear up because it was so beautiful, sad and disturbing at the same time! Also the Cargo Lift Scene was pure awesomeness. This movie blew my mind even though I has huge expectations, Thanks Ridley Scott! I really hope you get to end your epic Saga.",Alien - Covenant
1609,cjohno,"Get away from her you.... Oh wait, wrong one sorry lol",6,14 July 2017,"I must admit I was slightly mislead by the title of this film as I soon realised about 20 minutes in that it wasn't about the story of a Nun being transferred to a new convent and is left feeling outcast and alone after being isolated by her peers. Fortunately though, it turned out to be the latest edition of the fantastic Alien franchise.So, what's on offer this time around then? The long awaited return of much loved ""Newt"" from the second instalment ""Aliens"" or more commonly known as ""Aliens 2"" - Alas, we do not see her in this one, not even her dolls head! Michael Fastestbender is in it though, TWICE! he's an android (not a mobile phone) and also he appears dressed as Gordon ""Sting - Don't stand so close to me"" Sumner from his early 1990's period.To sum the film up in a nutshell as to if you should watch it or not, well if you like the franchise (even Prometheus) then you'll like the film. If you don't, then don't, although if I tell you the aliens do ninja kicks in this one, then it might sway you to watch it.You know how in the first one ""Alien"" (the one that's singular pronounced) it's mainly filmed on a ship and people have side burns and don't have any OTT health and safety warnings/laws or concerns of being PC with each other? Brilliant soundtrack that builds suspense perfectly and will always be timeless story, with the studio creating an unbelievable Alien puppet Two mouths though! I mean, it's pure genius). Then in Aliens (Aliens 2), and it's on a space station and there's frickin loads of em and the metal detector sounding beep... Beep... BEEP, getting louder as it encapsulates you once again but this time at a typically but will never be achieved again in cinema ""90's style pulsating rampant action like pace (shout out to Vasquez- the brilliant but unsung character, fist bump to you gurl) and you're like edge of the seat while like ""Bishop!! Where the blinkin eck are ya?"" Then in the 3rd and 4th there's dogs and clones etc but still did a good job at being a good film to watch?It pains me to say but it really does seem like it's getting like ""if you've seen one you've seen em all"" but without Newt or a Vasquez to welcome into your heart. This time, the latest ill fated gang land on the same planet as what we had to suffer watching Prometheus on. Incidentally, the planet looks very much like some kind of place Bear Grylls would honeymoon on (spoiler - I'll reference Bear again shortly towards the latter part of my review).So yeah, the gang, gutted about having to venture down on to the planet thanks to their over zealous/I'm the captain so deal with it/paranoid (you know he's gonna be one of the first to go) ships captain. So they land, go for a walk, see new stuff and be all like ""ooh you don't see them on Chelsea flower show do ya?"" Then lose radio contact, then encounter a mishap of some sort leading one of them to be taken slightly ill (see what I mean about Deja Vu)Then, from out of no where a pack of teenagers in fancy dress as Voldemort fanatics after one too many cans of Kestrel Super Strength start to set about the crew like proper louts and start eating a few of them. This is followed by screaming and panic stricken gestures for a bit. I don't really need to tell you any more because you've already seen it before. Other than one fight scene in a cave between Bear Grylls in his rainforest ready outfit and another Bear Grylls dressed in his wildly white water rafting wetsuit with a fight to the death over who gets to sleep in the top bunk. I'll not spoil it and tell you who wins. Then finally the last few survivors jet off to safety and into the sunset...... Oh no wait , an aliens jumped on ship without his boarding pass or passport, .... Oh no, what are they gonna do?? Oh yeah, how foolish of me, they'll just wait until they're getting into space and kick it out of the hanger door after a bit of a scuffle, with possibly another shocking twist to come?.All in all, this may read as though as I've just basically mocked the whole film but like I said, It's worth a watch if you're a fan, if you're not then watch it anyway, just because,.. Why not eh, then you'll be able to realise just how wittingly accurate with tongue inserted in cheek critique review I've written.Finally, finally, just an observation really. You don't seem to get great movie ""sub heading titles"" on films anymore do you? You know like - ""Aliens - in space, no one can hear you scream"" or people over using ""quotation"" marks in movie ""reviews"" or having half of it (in brackets) Well, allow me to leave you with this.....Remember - ""On IMDb, no one can hear you read""",Alien - Covenant
1610,soytim-64812,Great movie for the Prometheus fans,10,3 July 2017,"Let me start off by saying I am not at all a fan of the Alien movies. I am very interested in the Sci Fi genre, but more into the philosophical movies instead of silly action flicks where human soldiers use fire-arms to fight off extraterrestrials who were intelligent enough and had the technique to visit our planet Earth. I must say I really loved Prometheus because it has a deep philosophical message about the big questions: Where do we come from and who or what created us? Alien Covenant continues where Prometheus ended, and in the first scene this same question comes up. I think it is a very intelligent movie, well written and acted and it is packed with action. It answers many questions about the other Alien movies and Prometheus. Just give it a try and be open minded. I thought it was totally awesome and I don't understand the hate at all, except for the fact that it might go to deep for people who are not into the ancient-astronaut idea.",Alien - Covenant
1611,Danielhero1998,A satisfying Alien movie that return to its horror routes,8,13 May 2017,"I saw Alien Covenant yesterday at my local theater (a preview screening). Even though I wasn't a big fan of Prometheus (2012), I was still excited for Covenant, and I walked out of the theater satisfied. I thought that it was a great movie (note: I have only seen it once). Though I liked Prometheus's visuals, acting, designs and themes, it felt a bit rushed, all over the place (especially in the third act)It also suffered from every character being the galaxy's biggest idiots and an overall disconnect with the Alien franchise (it fells more like an Alien spin off focusing on the Space jockey taking place before Alien, rather then a prequel to the 1979 original).Going into Alien Covenant, I was excited as it would return the franchise to its horror routes and bring back the Xenomorphs, along with a new monster (Neomorph) and answers questions about the iconic movie monster. I left the theater satisfied, but wanting more (in a good way). It is definitely the best Alien movie since Aliens, while still having a few issues (no movie is perfect :D).Plot: The crew of the colony ship Covenant, bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy (called Origae-6), discovers another planet which they think is an uncharted paradise, but is actually a dark, dangerous world. When they uncover a threat beyond their imagination, they must attempt a harrowing escape. The Great:The Xenomorph. It looked amazing, similar to the original Giger design, but still a bit different when it came to its movement and its brutality. The cargo ship sequence was a big highlight, and the shower scene was actually pretty good and scary (surprisingly O_o). Another great sequence was the final one of Daniels and Tennessee hunting the Xeno across the ship, with Walter (David in disguise) helping them by tracking it and closing/opening airlocks. I have heard complains about the CG on the Xeno, but I think it looks great. The beast is definitely NOT cooked. The Neomorph is a fantastic new addition to the franchise. It's a bit smaller then the normal Xeno, but faster and more brutal. Some of the goriest death scenes in the movie came from them. The backburster is very gory, disgusting (in a good way). It also has a fantastic scene with David (Michael Fassbender), where it reacts calm to him and doesn't attack, before Oram shows up and kills it, pissing David off (which leads to Oram get facehugged). The creature designs and creature effects were great (except for one's effect). I am happy that H. R. Giger is credited for the creature designs at the beginning of the end credits. Most of the characters and performances were great. I cared more about the characters in Covenant then I did for the characters in Prometheus. The best characters were Tennessee (Danny Mcbride), Walter/David (Michael Fassbender) and Daniels (Katherine Waterston). Every scene with David and Walter. Their scenes (and how David is trying to get Walter to join him before disabling him, and taking his place on the Covenant) are the most fascinating scenes in the movie. The Covenant ship and its hardware and technology were as great as they were in Prometheus, despite still being way more advanced then the tech in the original Alien. The ending while predictable when it came to the reveal that Walter was David in disguise after they left the Engineer city, was still good and creepy, with David planting two Facehugger embryos along with the other (around) 1000 human embryos (probably to use the colonist as hosts to continue his experiments), and sending a final message from the Covenant as Walter before continuing on its journey to Origae-6. The cinematography, the locations and the effects were beautiful (duh). No one directs sci-fi movies like Ridley Scott. The Not So Great:While I did care about most of the characters, they are complete idiots (even though I thought they were less idiotic then the ones in Prometheus, that doesn't say much). They walk around in a newly discovered alien world with no protective gear (not even hazard suits), some touch stuff that causes disaster, they trust a complete stranger and some of them separate from the main group when they know a deadly alien creature could show up anytime (and then they get killed). The CG on the Neomorph backburster when it is no longer covered in blood looked average. I could see the twist at the end (where Walter is actually David) coming from a mile away (though it was still a good ending). The growing time from a chestburster to a full grown Xeno was really fast and reminded me of the AVP movies (even the time for a Facehugger to impregnate someone was really fast). The second Xeno (the one at the end of the movie) grew even way faster then the one from earlier. The tone changes drastically some times.Overall, Alien Covenant is a satisfying movie that returns the Alien franchise back to its horror routes, yet still having some of the action elements from Aliens. Most of the characters were great, though some were clearly only there to killed by alien monsters. The effects and cinematography were fantastic and it was a lot of fun. I can't wait to see where the story goes on from here (I hear that the next one titled ""Alien Awakening"" is going to start shooting in 14 months) and how it all ties into the original Alien movie from 1979. I though that it was better then Prometheus, and it is my third favorite movie in the Alien franchise. Final verdict: 8/10 or 4/5.",Alien - Covenant
1612,brian_dowling,"Not an Academy Award movie, but damn good installment",8,20 May 2017,"A few years back I saw Prometheus in the theaters. I left feeling a little let-down. In preparation, and after years of not seeing it, I re-watched Prometheus. That movie aged well. The Creators having the ancient Xenomprph's earliest evolutions, and the fact that the planet that Prometheus took place on having been abandoned for millennia allowed for the shared universe with Predator to remain. Now, Ridley Scott may or may not care about the shared universe. And that is fine. Alien: Covenant managed to expand upon the Creators, David, and the Xenomorphs in grand fashion. The scenery behind the characters is almost as important as the action in the forefront. I have seen people complaining about the acting and the plot, but while maybe not on the level of (insert Academy nominated movie here), it is among the best of the series. I left the theater feeling delighted that the installment in the series is bridging the gap between AVP and Alien well. Even if you find the acting sub-par, but are a fan of the shared universe, watching how selective breeding by David hastens the Xenomorph evolution is amazing. Perhaps the Creators and the Predators shared this technology ages ago, and that is how in the Aliens Vs Predator movies, the ancient Predators had fully evolved Xenomorphs. All in all, this movie was fun. The effects are great. The variety of Xenomorphs are amazing. The weird interplay between David and Walter highlighted the evolutionary struggle to survive in grand fashion. The next installment should be good too.

It's blatantly obvious that there was no thought given to any of the amazing possibilities of world or universe building. Instead, this is simply a high budget, grotesque 'B' rated gore sci-fi movie. It's not even as good as the original, because there is no real suspense, just a short buildup to each gore scene which consists of bodies ripping apart and blood squirting everywhere with nothing new or noteworthy. The five minute opening dialogue between Fassbender and Pearce was promising, and Fassbender is the only actor who gets a somewhat expanded script to work with, albeit something more akin to Silence of the Lambs than anything truly creative. The rest of the characters and script are the result of unimaginative and lazy writing just to bridge the gap from one gore scene to another. Those writers should be black listed for anything other than 'B' rated Hollywood trash. 3 out of 10 for Fassbender's performance despite the travesty of the writing, and Ridley certainly has amazing vision for sci-fi sets, the ship interior and opening sequences look great.",Alien - Covenant

But I like ""Alien: Covenant"", it's not that bad, as people says in reviews. Actually, there is a best xenomorphes acting in whole franchise, and Danny McBride, Katherine Waterston and Michael Fassbender did great job. I don't understand, why you need to talk about incomplete lines with ""Prometheus""... after all there is a trilogy. What if a third movie set a battle between humans and androids, and xenomorphes will be used as a weapon by androids? Not bad, right?I really enjoy it. Just one thing hurt me... poor Wagner.

""YOU got the film you deserve!""",6,13 July 2017,"First things first I don't think this film is great but I do think it's decent and belongs unapologetically in the Alien franchise (unlike Alien: Res-erection or those god awful AVP films). While there are a lot of fair criticisms there is also a lot of unfair ones too.By all means this film suffers most in that it knows what it wants to be, however the studio doesn't want to go all out on that concept because of the lukewarm response Prometheus got. And so we got a sequel to Prometheus that was hastily stitched together with the xenomorphs and facehuggers that a lot of people complained about being absent in Prometheus. I believe the haters of this film and Prometheus got exactly what they deserve in this flick. This film delves into compelling aspects of creation and evolution that are very disturbing and set this film apart as quite original, I've never seen these concepts explored in such a creepy and effective way. True I saw the David twist at the end coming but that did not take away from that sinking feeling of terror as Daniels' eyes light up in horror as David ""tucks the children in"". This scene in particular brings this really haunting feeling that stuck with me long after the film ended and everyone in the theatre ran home to write stupid reviews with one star and complain about ""Why are the robots kissing goddamnit!! This didn't happen in the other Alien films therefore BAD!!"". Seriously chill out this film is at worst mediocre. 1/10 review scores just show how reactionary and histrionic you are. Two viewings with deep analysis and I see no justification for less than a 5/10 definitely a film worth seeing.",Alien - Covenant
1622,deadman_coming,"So the first Alien is a forever classic and this one is an instant bulls...t, uh?",7,6 July 2017,"Spoiler Alert!!! My cons of the movie: lack of novelty to a certain extent, not enough alien action scenes, needs better character development.My pros of the movie: the Blade Runner-like android element, great performance by Michael Fassbender, excellent visuals, follows well the Alien story and pays homage to the original movie.My personal score: 7/10 (Still lower than the official score of the total rip-off called ""Star Wars: Force Awakens"" (2015)).Perhaps many people do NOT realize how many similar aspects there are between the first movie ""Alien"" (1979) and this one ""Alien: Covenant"" (2017). Let's see some of them: 1) The spaceship computer intercepts a strange, unknown signal from some planet nearby. After some argument with his fellow passengers, the captain decides to change the initial course and go to investigate – It happened in both movies (Check!)2) Taking stupid decisions – let's lean towards this giant alien egg that looks like a carnivorous plant and see what happens – It happened in both movies (Check!)3) Bending safety procedures (trained astronauts acting stupid 2) – by letting inside the ship a crew member infected by an unknown alien strainthen performing operations without any protective equipment – It happened in both movies (Check!)4) Dead crew member in a body bag launched into the open space – It happened in both movies (Check!)5) Android goes insane – Ash (1979) and David (2017) behave kind of abnormal for an android – It happened in both movies (Check!)6) Android helping alien all along – It happened in both movies (Check!) 7) The twist at the end – alien in the shuttle / evil android in the ship – It happened in both movies (Check!)Then why some people praise so much ""Alien"" (1979) and hate ""Alien: Covenant"" (2017)? Perhaps these people should stop whining like babies. Instead of writing 1000-word critical reviews, why don't they write 1000 words every day in the next 3 months and create their own, perhaps better, version of the next Alien chapter?

Most fans would agree that Aliens 3 and 4 were disappointments and although many felt the same way about Prometheus... I thoroughly enjoyed it. Having said this... Covenant didn't move me like Prometheus. I realize that it is always difficult to improve upon an original but this movie has brought the series to a plateau. There are moments in the movie that excite and thrill but overall it really doesn't add anything to the franchise. Honestly, I believe that the franchise needs a fresh set of eyes and vision.

1625,okinawarts,Not a good film and not the sequel we were hoping for.,6,13 August 2017,I haven't written a review in a very long time but Alien Covenant prompted me to so I can warn alien fans and people who have rational logical brains which question stupidity. As this film is dumb. Why is it dumb? Because it's like a 70s teen horror where random undeveloped characters insist on walking off alone or having sex during disasters. Also the cgi alien is mostly of poor quality as much as the story and the writing lacks any real urgency or direction at times. Overall we've seen it all before and better. On a more positive note Life (2017) is much better and far scarier with a better alien so go see that instead.,Alien - Covenant

The alien (as in the real deal creature alien) more or less has the role of a side kick that appears for a total of say few minutes in the whole movie, makes some jokes and then disappears again. The whole alien chasing people in the spaceship part was I believe about 2 minutes where the alien fell for the first trick the humans devised. And this movie lasts about 2 hours.

This movie, is though, on the plus side of 5, even though the dialog is a wreck, the characters very forgettable, it managed to provide a very interesting twist and explanation to the origin of the xenomorph. Much of the story is detached and means nothing, but it pulls together towards the end and I was satisfied and wanting to see what will be in store going forward. As a side note, the acting is horrible. Is this a problem with direction? (I saw the same problem in Prometheus) OR a problem with the actors?

The spaceship crew, those, you know, the best of the best... behave as little children. Yeah, they are pretty ""well-prepared"" for the mission. The only thing they are good at - sexually penetrating logic. Travelling with 200+ colonists and acting like these aren't important at all, risking with their lives to save a few crew members.. egoistic, isn't it? Just like the real astronaut should be.

I'm not going to write here anything about how good was that other film forty years ago compared to this one. When you are about to see an Alien movie, you know what is going to happen along the way, lets make that clear. Problem is, when you are about to see any movie and in a second you know exactly how it's going to end (literally), well... that's called a bad script. And this one is really bad. Quality Control went on holidays or so, or they didn't even care. There's no plot (despite the limited information we get about what happened after Prometheus), the xenomorph here is a secondary matter and the cast... let's say they do what they can with the material. If your role is written for idiots, your character will probably be idiotic, and there are plenty of those in this episode. Imagine someone in the room saying ""Hello there, I'm a mad dentist, please open your mouth"" and you (obviously) open it widely. That happens so many times in this film... Good photography, though, not as bad CGI as I have read in other reviews. My rate is a 6 because I didn't blink in the 2 hours. So yes, it entertains, if you don't expect too much. Which I dunno if its good, because I didn't blink either watching Sharknado, and that one was funny, at least.",Alien - Covenant

No horror, no action, just an origin story nobody asked for.
Worst thing of the movie: the casting. Besides Fassbender, all these actors are talentless and completely uninteresting actors in their own right. When McBride is one of the main characters you know you messed up. Worst offenders though: Franco, who had a cameo because the director is completely out of touch with the modern world, and of course convicted criminal/ special snowflake: Jussie Smollett.

1634,thecomfirefix,It's Brilliant But It Missed Some Flaws,7,12 May 2017,"Alien Covenant is a movie about a group of a crew of a colony ship called the Covenant that is heading into a planet to colonize but when they found a planet from an unknown transmission, they set to search out the source of the transmission and colonize there but a threat lies inside this unknown planet that kills the crew one at a time. This movie is awesome but it has some flaws, I will divide it into 5 parts for this review to make it easy. Here's what this movie offers1. The Acting, almost everyone made a great performance in this movie but some didn't hit the spot. Michael Fassbender made the best performance in this movie. They make these characters seem believable and that makes the movie brilliant.2. Character Development, the characters are awesome but not as awesome as the original Alien. You care about these characters because all of them mostly are married couple and that gives them all weight for the characters. Daniels tries to be the next Ellen Ripley but it kinda failed. There are also characters that disappeared in the third act. There are 2000 civilians/crew in this movie but I think it fails in that, you don't feel the threat or you don't care about them and that ruins me3. The Story, it didn't disappoint. The ending may come as a surprise but it makes total sense even though it can be expected. This movie is scary and gory to satisfy all the Alien fans. There are some unnecessary moments and dumb character choices and that ruins some of the scenes. 4. Presentation, this movie is beautiful just like every Ridley Scotts movie, this is gorgeous. The amount of practical effects and CGI is balanced for me even though the CG Alien isn't that convincing but it still gives a sense of threat. This movie is very gory, especially the first encounter with the Alien.Overall, the movie is good enough to get a 7/10. This is not my full review but i'll make one pretty soon",Alien - Covenant

It's not without flaw and there is room for improvement, but when you put this film next to all the other horror/sci-if films that have been released in the past few years, it becomes a stand out masterpiece! Michael Fassbender's performance was divine and the film honored H.R.Giger's work through stunning visuals and Gothic ambiance. Also, I'd give it a ten out of ten for the gore factor! Overall, I think to enjoy this film you need to not compare it to the Alien films and stop looking for loopholes, who cares if the crew do something stupid and unlikely? Just enjoy the beauty and design of our planets favorite fictional monster, the xenomorph.",Alien - Covenant

1638,ZenPhim,This is a movie whose ending is not surprising,6,10 May 2017,"At the point when the title Alien: Covenant shows up on the screen in Ridley Scott's third passage into the six-film Fox establishment, it gradually develops in profound space scored by Jerry Goldsmith's delightful frequenting topic.After the distinctive, divisive Prometheus, it appears like a reaffirmation of center values: this time, in space, nobody will hear you shout. On the off chance that that is the expectation, then Scott prevails in fits and begins: it feels like a sidekick piece with Prometheus, still chatty and awkward, yet edges nearer to the first as far as gut, symbolism and fervor.Agreement opens on a major close-up of Michael Fassbender's eye which, given the executive, sets up the desire of a Voight-Kampff test. Occurring in that science fiction staple, the Sterile White Room With A Huge Window, a youthful Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) addresses skin work David (Fassbender) about the riddles of creation and – to underline the point – inspires him to play Wagner's Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla on a terrific piano. Plainly occurring before the occasions of Prometheus, we then sliced to ten years after Noomi Rapace's Elizabeth Shaw put David's head in a duffel sack and launched to the Engineers' planet.It's presently 2109 and the group of the Covenant are transporting 2,000 homesteaders to heaven planet Origae-6 with a specific end goal to begin another life. An arbitrary transmission — that is deciphered as John Denver's Country Roads — alarms them to the nearness of a closer planet that has better conditions to bolster life. Having endured a current disaster that left fatalities, the group take the simple alternative and set down in the untested condition. There is breathable air. There is wheat. Just terraforming officer Daniels (Waterston) sees there are no fowl or creature clamors. Swallow.A Joyfully, contrasted with Prometheus, Covenant improves adaptations of all your most loved Alien tropes: group bantz (""Sweet tits"", ""Sugar dick""), a dangerous drop to a planet, the arrival of ship's PC MOTHER, a contention over isolate, running full-pelt down halls, cheeky bits with trickling water, eggs, Facehuggers, Chestbursters and Xenomorphs. Be that as it may, there are turns to the recipe, as well. There is an infant outsider that falls off like a vindictive Baby Groot. What's more, we likewise get clever Neomorphs, substantially more spry than their 1979 or 1986 partners, jumping about like Velociraptors when cornered by the group.When it is extraordinary, Covenant is truly serious. The primary experience with the incipient domeheads is an all out surge, from awkward scenes of wild shaking to snapshots of dim craziness (slipping on blood at a key minute) to the beasties uncovering an up to this point obscure ability at head-butting. However once the chase is on, Scott can't summon the managed strain of Alien (or the determined ride of Aliens). There are some frightening slaughters however none that recover the creative energy and outline of the first's passings. He likewise can't assemble energy similarly, the feeling of account desperation unfortunately absent.It's only a disgrace that one of film's most prominent picture producers couldn't convey his thoughts outwardly.The Covenant team are an especially dull, between variable cluster (there are 15; Alien had seven or more feline). Some show guarantee. Waterston's Daniels is injured with pain. Recently advanced chief Oram (Crudup) is managing questions that his religious confidence will undermine his power. In any case, just Danny McBride's Tennessee truly enlists, and that is mostly on the grounds that he wears a cattle rustler cap. Indeed, the most fascinating character connections interfered with the two synthetics: amateur Walter and Prometheus extra David (named after arrangement makers Walter Hill and David Giler). Both skilfully separated by Michael Fassbender, the combine meet as David is the main occupant of the recently discovered planet. There are unusual, intriguing scenes as David instructs Walter to play woodwind, out-score each other on Romantic verse and in, what feels like an odd bit of Fassbender cut fiction, kiss.However it is likewise the indicate where Scott gets enjoy his Blade Runner-Prometheus distraction with playing God in on-the-nose dialogs. Getting it done, otherwise known as The First Two, the Alien arrangement fills in as filthy B motion pictures (a slasher blood and gore movie, a war film), installing all the (psycho- sexual) which means in the symbolism. Here it is done in discourse about the dissatisfaction of not being permitted to make and the depression of dreams. It's only a disgrace that one of film's most noteworthy picture creators couldn't convey his thoughts outwardly. Still, as The Martian demonstrated, Scott is still great at this science fiction malarkey, be it the huge stuff (the Covenant growing sails to outfit control) or the telling subtle elements (outsider iotas get highlighted in smoke rings). John Logan and Dante Harper's screenplay, after the giggle free Prometheus, likewise includes a joke or two. At a certain point, there is a Phantom Of The Opera choke. Maybe this is Covenant's greatest frighten: about a long time from now, Andrew Lloyd Webber is as yet a thing.",Alien - Covenant

But then got so far off of that theme it made the whole film twisted and lost its meaning. As I said.

1641,sonnyc-50020,Disappointing for a huge 'Alien' fan,5,15 May 2017,"I have never been more excited to see a movie on a theater before. It was going to be the first 'Alien' movie I'd seen in a theater, as well as the first film I'd seen in IMAX. The first two 'Alien' movies are two of favorite movies of all time and I liked 'Prometheus', so of course my expectations were high.This movie was a huge letdown.The tone is all over the place. The film can't decide if it wants to be 'Prometheus' or 'Alien' so it tries to combine the two into some sort of Frankenstein hybrid, which results in the movie essentially splitting into four parts: two parts 'Alien' and two parts 'Prometheus'. The 'Alien' parts are fast paced and gory while the 'Prometheus' parts are slow and philosophical, which results in the movie feeling disjointed and unfocused. Not only that, the 'Prometheus' parts are less philosophical than 'Prometheus' and the 'Alien' parts aren't very scary, as the loud, orchestral music completely killed any claustrophobia and tension that could have been present.The characters have the same problems that the characters in 'Prometheus' had: they're dumb. The choices that they make in this movie are anything but scientific, with them all splitting up at any opportunity they can, despite the fact that the alien terrain is vast and dangerous and alien life has killed some of the crew already. Special mention to Oram for being the most brainless of the bunch and ironically the least suitable person to be Captain. The characters also lack development and personality, which makes it hard to root for them to survive. The dynamics between the characters is also nonexistent, and if you hadn't seen the 'Last Supper' prologue then you might not have even realized that the characters were all couples (minus a few lazy and obvious lines such as ""I've never seen my wife scared before"").The movie also introduces a new alien to the film: the Neomorphs. While these could have been an interesting addition to the movie, they ended up being a cheap device to move the plot forward and they're only in three scenes in the movie (only one of which is effective).While I may sound like I'm badmouthing the movie, it's not all bad. The visual effects are stunning and beautifully show the Xenomorphs in all their glory, although I do wish there were more practical effects for the aliens like in the other films. The acting is also fantastic, with no one giving a bad performance and making the horror feel more real. Special mentions go to Michael Fassbender, Danny McBride and Katherine Waterston. I do wish that Carmen Ejogo and Amy Seimetz were in the film more as they did give great performances in the little screen time they had, even if their characters were just as uninteresting as the others.Overall, despite the great special effects and acting, the film has some glaring flaws that we very hard to ignore which hindered the experience I had with this film. Hopefully the next few 'Prometheus' sequels can improve on what this film tried to do because it did have potential.",Alien - Covenant
1642,iocelews,"Good example of how to fail at STEM, but entertaining nonetheless",3,25 May 2017,"Although the movie is entertaining, it fails to depict human exploration with the requisite rigor that exists in modern efforts. The vulgar manner of the astronauts also reflects poorly on the ideals of human exploration and discovery. The characters in the movie fail to abide by modern established quarantine protocols. The atmosphere and water are not tested for pathogens and other viruses or diseases. This is an insult to actual scientists, and the amount of critical flaws in the STEM representation are disappointing at best. For the budget of the movie, I expect more and am left feeling cheated by lazy storytelling and cheap jump and scare tricks. Perhaps such techniques were innovative many decades ago, but today one wonders how this movie ever had any serious support. Today it is not enough to have aliens jump out of bodies, what else do you have - if anything at all? Definitely the aliens franchise requires a reboot, unfortunately this movie misses the mark. I hate to sound like Neil Degrasse Tyson bitching about Gravity, at least in that movie the CGI was based on physics simulations. If not for the purpose of education, one should consider watching this movie for the multitude of scientific flaws - as such an exercise can surely make for a great case study for how not to explore space and the unknowns of our universe.",Alien - Covenant

I enjoyed Prometheus, but the way the story was told left me confused and unsatisfied before I'd had the chance to re-watch it a few times. Well, in contrast to that, this film left me feeling like I'd been treated like an idiot.I won't go into all the ""why the hell did they do that?"" moments as they've been covered in lots of other user reviews. Sufficed to say, if a Xenomorph is attached to the outside of your ship, the best thing to do is probably shoot up into space and not jump out on a rope with a gun to shoot it. Especially if you're a 5 foot girl who is intent on swinging about right under the jets like a lunatic. Oh and don't get me started on the decision to 'change habitable planets' on the whim of a signal that someone picked up on a helmet. For God's sake, don't you think a 2000 strong colony mission would have stricter controls than that...?The very basic horror elements that Ridley promised we would get in this movie (remember he'd ""learned"" from the mistakes of Prometheus), were just not there. Tension was distinctly absent, instead the film shoved the events into our face like we were a bunch of brain dead Twilight fans - interesting when you consider that Ridley was schooling us in the promo interviews about how tension makes a horror movie. Was I watching the same film??The fact that the infections - in whatever guise - now seem to take 15 minutes to birth of whatever creature awaits is laughable. We've seen Alien films before, were you in a hurry to end it Ridley or something?? The fact that David is the architect of the 'perfect organism' through genetic testing in a decimated city with no power, technology or laboratories is frankly insulting. Remember, his domicile wasn't exactly Pfizer... History and common sense tell me that if I set foot on a planet and suddenly two crew members got seriously ill, I'd get the fudge out of there. Also, before I even set foot on the frickin place I'd damn well hover in orbit and would wait for any storms to clear before descending.The plot twists are obvious, the acting and dialog are terrible from just about everyone but Danny McBride (who knew??) and the editing makes me think that somewhere there is a truck load of material that they decided to leave out. Reminds me of the disappointing mess that was Suicide Squad.Honestly, I'm really bitter that I waited in such eager anticipation for this and feel deeply let down.On the flipside, here's a list of the positives: 1) the Xenomorph was cool",Alien - Covenant

1646,carlosgalvalizi,Disappointed. AND FULL OF DOUBTS.,4,19 May 2017,"I waited and expected anxiously for this movie since PROMETHEUS was wonderful to me and its end left a huge question mark for its sequel: What will Dr Shaw find about ""engineers"" in ""engineers"" world? That should have been the main issue since the alien creature can produce no terror to spectator that followed the series, like me. I've watched the origin Alien (1979) not less than 5 times and Prometheus not less than 10, just to mention Ridley's movies. For one who expected answers to that question Covenant is a void story that aros a lot of new questions:Is it the ""engineers"" world, actually? There is no clue in the movie regarding this.But the people that was burnt up by a black rain poured from the sky looked like the ""engineers"" in Prometheus. If this is correct, Who are the ones that poured the black rain?How come David became such evil, twisted character, like a human one? He is supposed to be a cyborg and must obey the programming inside him which prevent him to harm humans.Feelings? How come?Did ""engineers"" alter his programming, may be?Now say you are the crew setting foot on this world and found David. Would you be so dumb that wouldn't squeeze David with lot of questions on Prometheus saga and the owners of such a strange spacecraft used by David and Shaw? No question to find out how come they got such space ship providing the rest of the Prometheus crew was killed by a space storm?And what's the need for David to show up wearing an ""engineer"" like cloth? He is a Cyborg, he does not feel cold or heat and he does not need to hide from anybody nor anything since he is alone on the planet. Conclusion: an unnecessary trick of the director.There is a general flaw. Since Prometheus and Covenant are supposed to be prequels of Alien (1979), the inverse contrast of technologies is too noticeable. In Alien the inputs to computer are charge by keyboard and all the screens are CRT's, just to mention a case, while in its prequels the technologies are far more advanced (example: I loved the mapping device in Prometheus, the one the geologist launched to map the ""tunnel"" that further was identified as a space ship.Also: in Alien (1979) the creature takes many hours to burst thru John Hurt's torso but it happens too quickly in all following movies, whether or not they are Ridley's. Explanation? Yes, I expected much from Covenant. So I went to the cinema the premier day, first screening. Poor compensation for months of expectation but I will watch it again in order to try to round up my review.Now we must wait for its sequel, when the ship gets Origae-6.An some personal anecdote. Some years ago I wrote a tale I named ""Richard's Vision"". Its an oniric tale assuming that Wagner had a dream that led him to compose ""Entrance of Gods to Walhala"". I couldn't help smile when it was performed along the movie.",Alien - Covenant
1647,tito_skl,Alien Covenant is the next piece of the puzzle,8,19 May 2017,"I just saw the movie yesterday, and I don't understand why there's people complaining about the film. We need to understand that this movie is just the story before ALIEN, but not the last one to get there. I think Ridley Scott made a great job about the story-line, If you are just reviewing the movie unknowing the complete saga, forget it. My review is understanding the story between Prometheus and Alien and beyond. The movie by itself Is a beauty, the cinematic, the music, the environment, the suspense, is something that makes you watch every second the screen without looking anywhere else. As we know how the movie ends, the next one is a must! If you look at the movie poster, we can see actually what Alien: Awakening will be. Yes, Engineers being attacked by Xenomorphs, I think that is a big clue about the saga future. If you ask me, I'm pretty sure that the planet where Covenant landed is the same as the first Prometheus scene showed the Engineer killing himself to create life, and those bold people are the creation of that. That's why we didn't see Engineers in this movie, because their planet is David's destiny, and then we will understand why the Derelict fended at the first Alien movie had Xenomorphs eggs on it. Returning to the Covenant review, I really Enjoyed it, the Neomorph was creepy as hell by the way. Talking about the crew, lets be realistic, they are not special ops or marines to have the knowledge about how they need to manage this catastrophe, they are just persons to colony a new planet, and the obviously thing is that Weyland Corporation use them for David's cause. Like every movie there are some mistakes, but didn't matter to me. I'm a huge fan, and maybe that's why I enjoyed every scene from the movie and I hope Ridley continues with the next project to be even closer to the original Alien movie.",Alien - Covenant

And now they have screwed the origin story of alien, I don't think they can come back from it. but I hope to they can.

1649,thisgsx,****Spoilers**** Wait for a Netflix release or rent it! Not worth the price of admission! *****Spoilers*****,1,20 May 2017,"As always, Ridley Scott's visual effects are excellent! However, that's where it ends! The direction of the movie was all over the place and it made no sense at all at some of the decisions these ""highly trained"" crew members made. The colony ship Covenant is on it's way to Origae-6, a remote planet far out in space. Covenant, along with its crew members, are also carrying a large number of passengers and embryos on board. The mission is to terraform and colonize Origae-6. If memory serves me correct, the ship ran into some sort of solar storm, causing damage to the ship and some of its cryostasis chambers, resulting in the death of their Captain and one or two other crew members. As two crew members went outside the ship to repair the damage, one of the crew members intercepted a distress call. The crew was able to trace the distress call back to a planet outside of their trajectory path. Here's where everything went down the toilet. Logic tells us that since these guys are highly trained crew members, who has spent years training for missions like this, we're also to assume, they've also been trained for accidents and worst case scenarios when attempting missions like the one they're in. Logic also tells us, that no matter what the situation, the crew members are responsible for the ship and all of its passengers! So what happened? The crew members decided to respond to that distress call and basically flushed their mission down the toilet! There are so many unanswered questions and plot holes. The infected pollen dust? Yet everything else is okay? The two white aliens, what happened to the other one? The Engineers and their home planet. Aren't they supposed to be some very advanced civilization yet, they wore rags as clothes and had cities that looked like they were in the Roman times? The three crew members who stayed behind with the Covenant, what happened to their logic of thinking? Mother clearly warned them of the ships safety about its proximity to the planet, yet all 3 crew members ignored Mother and risked the lives of all the passengers, embryos, and the mission for their illogical decisions? Now, David is the creator of the Aliens? Really?! David and Walter fighting each other, Walter is supposed to be more advanced and better than David in every possible way, yet Walter loses to David in hand to hand combat? There are so many more plot holes it's amazing this movie even got the okay, especially from Ridley Scott! I can honestly say, this movie is the worst one of all the Alien movies and I hate to say it, but even Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection was better than this one. The visuals are epic, but it ends there!",Alien - Covenant
1650,lassprite,Best Alien movie since the original.,10,21 May 2017,"I was already aware of a wave of negative reactions prior to watching Alien Covenant, but as an Alien fanboy, I decided not to let other people's decisions influence me. If the movie was going to be a mess like Prometheus, I would come to that conclusion myself without outside influence.I ended up LOVING the movie, although I have to say that it is not blind love, and I do actually completely agree with many of the criticisms directed toward it. Like Prometheus, it suffers from some nonsensical decision making on the part of the crew, and like Prometheus you won't leave feeling you got all your satisfactory answers. On the other hand though, you've got an amazingly beautiful movie with great new creatures, extremely gory bursting effects and great coupling of visuals, literary/religious undertones and audio. I think many people fail to recognize the pure ART of some of these scenes. Fassbender's two androids are particularly noteworthy. This is why I, despite some glaring flaws, still give the movie a 10/10. It made me fall in love with the Alien franchise anew, and I still feel somewhat dazed even a week after I saw it.",Alien - Covenant
1651,masterkingcaley,Thoroughly enjoyed it.,9,23 May 2017,The Alien was terrifying and it filled in a lot of the story continuing on from Prometheus.The visuals were excellent and the acting was believable throughout.I did have to excuse a couple of minor plot quibbles but it wasn't so much that it spoiled the film for me.,Alien - Covenant
1652,kellerae,"A little predictable, a little over-the-top, but not a complete disgrace",6,24 May 2017,"Ridley Scott has gotten entirely out of hand with lazy writing (which the characters suffer from immensely) and is just getting too eager. Especially since he wants to fill this franchise with at least 3 more Alien prequels.The first half of the movie is ten times more enjoyable than the second half. I don't even want to get into how stupid the characters are in the film (especially Oram) because three quarters of that is due to the lazy writing. Sticking your head into an unknown gestation pod after being led into the bowels of an unknown alien vessel guided by an unknown android who had JUST led you into a city full of corpses in which he is the only inhabitant? So responsible.Truly, Prometheus suffered from this movie as well. As many fans were looking for a few more answers and an explanation as to 1) what's going on with the Engineers and why they want to kill humanity and 2) how an android with limited tools and capabilities bred the xenomorphs to begin with. All these things are thrown out the window.Critically, it's not excellent. But personally, I still enjoyed what was put in front of me. If that makes me easy to please or have low standards than so be it. But the stupidity of the crew was actually more funny to me than it was inherently frustrating. There would be little plot if the characters were extremely smart, and that's a huge driving force in all horror. That being said, it still lost a lot of originality and relied too much on cheap horror tropes, which apparently I was wrong to think that Ridley Scott wouldn't fall prey to. Despite me enjoying it a little, I am still praying nightly for the Blade Runner sequel because of it.",Alien - Covenant

If you have seen lots of harsh criticism for this movie, I say it's not bad at all. It's still quite entertaining. To be fair, lots of good horror movies are barely above 6 out of ten. So don't avoid it just because people say they hate it. It's true that they throw lots of (probably too many) elements into this movie, which might turn out to be less exciting. However, the ending succeeds in opening up to more stories, which is good. Also, keep in mind that this is not meant to be like the previous alien movies. It has totally different theme. I bet Ridley is a totally different person now. I would be surprised if he makes a new alien movie with similar tone to the older ones. And it's sensible for the old Ridley to explore the ""creation"" stuffs. I think it's a fairly good sequel to Prometheus. Look, now we have a new franchise directed by Ridley Scott himself, which is some what relates to the alien franchise. That is just great.",Alien - Covenant
1654,simmonschris,"A beautiful, yet terrible movie",5,30 May 2017,"I'm an Alien fan to my core, I love all the movies and even tolerate Resurrection. I was so let down by this movie I had to get consolation ice cream. I will say Visually this movie is stunning and has some great special effects moments. This had huge potential and all of that was squandered to basically make some poor version of a psychological slasher/horror. If you've seen the movie then.... the shower scene... ugh.I'm not sure why a crew of over 2000 people was guarded by a skeleton crew in hyper-sleep and one android. Also, why would you push forward into the area where a solar explosion just killed a crew member and some colonists. Then just randomly go to a nearby planet that seems better only to send down basically the entire crew without space suits or protection and just send them out? So if the whole crew is compromised goodbye colonists? The plot is so twisted and makes no sense, also great job shitting on Shaw's character and making that story line pointless other than a useless vessel to get David to this planet and have him make crazy biological advancements in a cave with a flute that he can play without lungs. WTF IS HAPPENING! Why did the captain stare into the Alien egg, why did the alien stand up like baby Groot? All these questions and more will never be answered because this movie sucks.

1658,andrecords,'This Alien is Bigger' - No Dr. Shaw? Not a good 'Alien' movie.,4,11 June 2017,"Ridley shouldn't have even made this a sequel to 'Prometheus'. This really isn't much of a story. There is no Dr. Shaw? Instead of an interesting movie about her travels, we get sh*t Episode VII style worthless remake. He should have just made an Alien flick instead of trying to tie it to 'Pro'. The David/Walter 'twist' is so obvious, it was the first thing I thought, when I saw him near the end. Give it up Ridley! Alien was a great movie, one of the best ever. But you suck now, face it. I guess the blasting the alien into space is good even the 3rd time around... jeez... let's make sure nothing is original. Very anti- climactic. When asked in the 70's on how he made such good movies, Spielberg answered with something like - 'I don't try to make good movies, I just make the movie I would want to see, and others seem to want to also.' Now that has gone all out the window. I enjoyed Prometheus, but like other reviewers found most of the characters lacking in any substance, and making stupid decisions. One example was the cobra-like alien, who would just act like it wasn't possibly dangerous? I didn't like the idea that the Aliens were manufactured, I think it being a mysterious creature from outer space is so much better - the fear of the unknown that lurks out there. Also the jockey was clearly bones in Alien. Not a suit. Otherwise I thought it was a decent movie. Now, we move onto 'Covenant' - what a boring disappointment. No new ideas were put forward. I think Ridley was doing what Spielbergo does now. Instead of just making the best movie he can, he tries to think of what the audience wants. But, lets face it. The success of movies like 'Transformers' clearly shows that the audience is not intelligent enough to make that decision. So they complained that 'Pro...' didn't have enough aliens. So lets give the audience what they want. Instead of a great story about Shaw and her travels, we get a weaker version of 'Alien(s).' But the Aliens are BIGGER! After Star Wars VII - now all they think anyone wants is a re-telling of the same story. So here we have an inferior mix of 'Alien' & 'Aliens' - just substitute colonists for Marines and your there! Nothing really happens in this movie. So glad I didn't pay to see it. First Alien movie I didn't bother see in theatres. I just knew with Ridley making a movie for the 'masses' it wouldn't be good. Trying to contrive something for the masses only gets mediocre, derivative results. If your a creative person like me (musician) just try to make something you would like. I never try to make music so people will like it. I just try to write good songs that I would want to listen to and hey! other people like them too, but that is not my goal. Very disappointed with Ridley on this one. For the other reviewer, they explained how they have an obligation to investigate unknown alien transmissions, they explain this well in 'Alien' also - 'no shares'.",Alien - Covenant

1661,DmitriDmitri,Good quality science fiction,8,3 July 2017,"After reading some of the negative reviews, I thought I should offer a bit of balance. Scores of 1/10 are more indicative of a desire to fit the film to a preconceived narrative, than a genuine assessment of the film, in my view. So I will try not to do that in the opposite direction!No spoilers here. You don't need to reveal the plot to review a good film in detail. To me, that is a key marker.I loved the original Alien films (all of them), with Alien and Aliens being the obvious favorites. I also enjoyed Prometheus. I like SF and am always grateful for good quality SF to watch. Some of the films in this universe are all-time classics, some are just decent films. They are all better than most of the drivel that comes out of the film industry to my slightly geeky tastes.The great thing about the five films prior to this is that they are all explore slightly different aspects of the SF genre - with an obvious 'suspense horror' thread throughout.Part of the commonality between them is the atmosphere created by the set design and technology imagined for the films, as well as the aliens themselves. Covenant does not let the series down in this respect, providing an environment that allows you to suspend your disbelief so that you can become involved in the world created.The human technology and on-ship environments are industrial and functional, if a little too neon for my liking this time around; the planetary environments familiar but unearthly, close enough for comfort but with an undertone of untamed extremity; the non-human artificial environments are cathedral-like and Gothic. More advanced such that the technology is hidden rather than exposed as in the human environments - ancient and Gothic technological advancement, rather than the shiny newness of Star Trek.There is a weakness in the character building of the human crew and some of their decision making - however, this is not as bad as perhaps made out in other reviews. These calls are less plot devices, as they were not necessary to the story at all, nor decisive to the outcome, and more just irrelevant parts of the story that might have been handled better.They may even be belated attempts at character development wedged in later on... though this is of little importance in my view, as the star of the film is David, and his character is constructed and acted beautifully.The film lacks suspense almost entirely. It is still good SF, don't get me wrong, and there is some horror in there, but suspense can't be something that was being aimed for as far as I can tell!A disappointing aspect of Prometheus was that it drew the suspense out so far that it was never going to be able to reward the viewer with a big enough scare / novelty to justify the build up. This distracted and so detracted from the other qualities of the film in terms of its exploration of various religious and philosophical subjects. Perhaps this left you feeling a little bit 'cheated', and hindered the understanding of the underlying story, which while interesting, was actually, not very complicated.Even though we were told it was not an alien film, we knew it was, and were always waiting for the alien to jump out and terrify us like it did in Alien and Aliens. When 'it' did eventually appear - 'it' was just not quite right.Covenant almost conversely lacks any sort of meaningful suspenseful build up at all - and is equally unable to provide novelty in terms of the aliens themselves. It does provide our alien fix early and often, but they are more book stops to the story being told, than the story itself.I suspect that providing genuine novelty in this universe is almost futile where the aliens are concerned. Primarily, because we all know what is coming at us by now; and secondarily, because the ultimate viscerally terrifying Alien has already been created - despite thousands of attempts throughout film making history - no monster is as terrifying as the original Xenomorph.It is impossible to recreate or better the suspense and novelty of the original films; or perhaps even to recruit a more perfect actress than Sigourney Weaver upon whom to attach it.You cannot recreate an artistic masterpiece, even with better technology. Often, the leaps the effects guys made in the 70s, 80s and early 90s create part of the magic - which CGI just can't quite capture. Star Wars 4, 5, 6; Terminator and T2 and Alien are good examples of this.So Covenant doesn't try to better or match the early films in this respect. Why waste time trying to do that? They have tried to give those who hated Prometheus the aliens and gore they wanted AND those who appreciated it, some of the back story, Gothic mysticism and geeky SF exploration of ideas that they wanted.And the result is, for me, a great film that provides a very high quality of entertainment in a universe we all enjoy. But also that delivers perfection for nobody!That lack of perfection is fine by me. That the makers have used a much loved 'franchise' to attract the funding to make such solid if not masterfully great SF is more than fine by me too. Enjoy...",Alien - Covenant

Prometheus did a great job setting up for the sequel and I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that it not only didn't suck but I actually found it was very much in the spirit of the original movie, it had the edge of your seat suspense of the original, and it set up the next film for an interesting exploration of the origins of life and the alien. So, for five years I waited for Alien: Covenant to finally be released with anticipation I have never experienced for another sequel. And then... this pile of $@!7 landed on my Friday evening.I could not believe how terrible Alien: Covenant actually was. I would have been OK with it just being ""meh"" but this film fell so flat on its double-jawed face that it was unbelievable that the same person that gave us the gift of four amazing Alien films wrote and directed this film. I could forgive that the film predictably started with yet another distress signal and the consequent exploratory mission. Everything else was absolutely unforgivable. While the franchise has had its share of dumb characters, at least the previous films took the time to give their side characters some depth, at least enough so that you actually felt bad when they died. None of the characters in this film were ever developed, other than the androids. While stupid decisions were made by the previous films' characters, they were somewhat believable considering they had no idea what the alien was capable of. These characters were not even believable as the pioneers selected to represent the human race as explorers tasked with the immensely important mission of colonizing a new world. Oh yes, let's just land on this alien planet and not wear any protective gear whatsoever. Yes, let's just sniff the alien magic mushroom, what could possibly happen? Apparently, going on the first colonization mission planned for a decade and costing who knows how much, requires little to no training on potential alien contagion or any infection prevention protocol training or equipment. Oh and yes, let's then take the guy who just vomited alien infected blood all over everything through the entire /&$@!?; ship. Oh and then let's just open the freaking door after the alien thing has had a chance to be born, but not before that (or you know, maybe quarantine procedures would strictly prohibit opening it at all).Why does everyone just believe David the android even after seeing all the weird $&!/ he has done in his little lab. ""Trust me, even though you saw all the weird experiments I did and I just told you I was playing mad scientist and created the perfect alien life form out of the terrifying virus that just killed half your crew, these alien eggs are perfectly safe, take a look."" And so the worst captain of all time just practically sticks his entire head in the alien egg. And then the other android, Walter, just sits there and calmly tells the other one, David, that he can't let him take the alien off the planet like three inches from his face, as if David was not going to attempt to kill him.The film relied more on gore than suspense, which is a huge deviation from the previous films. Cheap thrills, lots of meaningless action, more suited to a Marvel superhero movie. The character deaths were quick and uneventful and nobody cared because we didn't even know this character existed before they were quickly dispatched, due to the poor character development. The final twist of the movie, the switcheroo of the bad android and the good android, was so amateurish that, if you had ever watched a movie before, you could see it from a light year away.Finally, none of the questions raised by Promethius were ever addressed. Such a good setup from Promethius for the sequel with question of the origins of human life and the decision to kill it off and then... nothing! The Engineers are just swiftly killed off upon landing. Great! Because I didn't just spend five years waiting to find out their motives. Sadly, the entire film was just a huge cliché and other than the fantastic visual effects, its story was that of a B movie. Such a disappointment from the writer and director that gave us arguably the best space thriller to date.",Alien - Covenant

ALIENADO,1,7 September 2017,Please rename the movie ALIENADO as this movie ( Alien Convenant) is as good as any SHARKNADO movies to write more about it would be a waste of time ( already did this by watching it) PS Unless the next ALIEN script is written by Watson ( IBM's AI) I see no reason to continue watching whatever comes next,Alien - Covenant

1675,marksclare,Truly terrible - Ridley Scott is ruining his reputation,1,3 October 2017,"Attempted to watch this awful film. Loved the original films and put up with Prometheus even though that film had the most stupid characters ever in it. However the crew in Covenant are even worse. The 'captain' goes to David's lab and peers into an opening egg after seeing the xenomorphs, hence having an embryo stuck to his face. What was Ridley Scott doing? A terrible film and normally I love science fiction films. Ridley - give up as you are ruining your reputation.",Alien - Covenant

1677,gndy-63302,Too fast to be a horror and too slow to be an action movie,5,20 March 2020,"This movie suffers from videogame-like haste which seriously devaluates all the expected horror elements. The few aliens are too quick to show up and too easy to be killed when they need to be. The spaceship crew is seconding with its imbalanced modes of artificial stupidity and superhuman invulnerability. I thought that Spider Man could arrive at one moment to help them and it would not do any (more) damage to the movie.
The philosophical topic, which I guess should have hold this together, that is: how (easily) creation of irresponsible creator becomes an irresponsible creator himself (e.g. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree) is too simple to provide enough engagement in the viewer and finally shows up that the foundation of Alien shouldn't be sought in some additionally injected religious thoughts but in disturbing suspense of the dark corners.",Alien - Covenant
1678,hbarpi2,Could a Predator have saved this movie? No.,3,14 November 2017,"First off, I was in the ""Prometheus was OK, but way too many questions were raised"" camp. I waited all those years for Covenant to answer them.While I did get the answers I was waiting for, I was not given them in a particularly entertaining way. I had to wade through two hours of incredibly stupid characters, and total predictability to stick it out to the end to figure things out. Even then, my real personal curiosity - that is with the Engineers - was just glossed over.I'll be even more brutally honest. I watched this on an airplane and the sound was cutting out in the second half of the movie. Frankly that made the movie better because by then I already knew what was going to happen and only goes to show how bad the movie is that the sound and music added nothing to the enjoyment of the film.As in my title, this movie could have been worse, Predators could have appeared. No, no, I take that back, that would have made it less predictable.Please don't green-light the ""trilogy"" for the sake of it being a ""trilogy"". Just let Alien fade away.",Alien - Covenant
1679,structurefunction,Loved it.,8,14 January 2018,"Would I have liked to have seen the ""Real"" Engineers the same as always? Of course. I would have loved less David and more mystery of the Engineers home planet. HOWEVER, all in all it seriously rocked. It was a splatter-fest and full of action. The ending was cliche which is why I gave it a 9, but cinematically I thought it was beautifully done and I continue to watch it repeatedly. Praying for another from Scott and Bannon, etc ... Good chance since worldwide it made them millions. Gorgeous film.9p",Alien - Covenant

I understand suspension of disbelief, but this goes beyond what you expect in Sci- Fi. There is 0 science (and zero plot development) and only fiction. One of the most astounding insults to viewers' intelligence is the abyssal stupidity of the crewmen (and women). Never mind that the ship in orbit shakes as if in turbulence. That said, if you have really nothing to do on a Sunday afternoon, it helps to pass the time.",Alien - Covenant
1686,tomcatofportland,Too much,5,21 May 2017,"Just got home from watching Alien Covenant, and I have to say that I was a little disappointed. For an Alien movie, there weren't a lot of aliens in it. Add a downer ending, and you're asking for disappointment. The insane android was a twist, but once again - a disappointment. In addition, the xenomorph was able to go from a newborn to an adult in less than 24 hours in the original movies. Now it seems to take just a few minutes. Plus the xenomorphs are about 3 times stronger than they were in ""Aliens,"" which was arguably the strongest chapter in the story line. A half-dozen guys with fully-automatic rifles couldn't take even one of them out in close-quarters combat. Did David add steroids to the xenomorph DNA or what? I did catch the rumored tie-in/similarity to the Blade Runner movie (Or franchise now, I guess) - but this movie is what I would call ""busy."" There's a lot going on here, and you have to work to keep up. They should have named it ""Alien 5 / Promethius 2 / Too damn much going on here / Wait the the DVD."" I'm delighted that Ridley Scott is back in the franchise, and I hope he stays on board to get it back on track - but this one didn't work for me. Would've been better to return to the old formula. First the egg(plant)s, then the face-huggers, then the xenomorphs, then the mayhem with gunfire and explosions. In the same situation, I would have checked the employee files of the 2,000+ colonists in the deep-freeze for any military &/or combat experience & awakened those guys up to help tackle the threat. How did nobody think of that? I'm sure there will be plenty of people who like this movie, and there's a lot to like - but the story is going off in too many directions now. Maybe they didn't want another ""Superman Returns"" on their hands, but all the same... If the Twentieth Century Fox people ever read this, tone it down to the basic elements next time - guys. The xenomorphs should be a doomsday bio-weapon meant to destroy an ecosystem via their breeding process. That would be far more relate-able with the original installments AND current issues. They shouldn't be an airborne disease / genetic engineering threat. Not enough of the fans are ""scientist"" enough to get on board with that. I will give kudos the the acting, though. Good stuff there. Before the haters starts yelling at me, I'd like to close by saying that I'm not stating these conclusions as fact. This is all just my opinion of the different story elements, and I could be wrong about it. I did JUST watch this movie less than an hour ago. After some time to digest it all, I might appreciate the story points more - but right now it just seems like too much.",Alien - Covenant

1688,bertrandtux,Just another slasher movie,2,31 December 2017,"The only one thing I liked in this movie was the plastic beauty of the images of the alien planet. The rest was such a disappointment. Like Prometheus, it promises a lot but delivers very little. It aims at 2001 : A Space Odyssey but lacks its philosophical undertone. At the end, it's just a another slasher movie without any real surprises. You'll have dumb characters, horrendous deaths and a foreseeable twist.",Alien - Covenant
1689,alexdawson-19336,Underrated. Ignore the haters.,8,31 August 2020,"When making a sequel to a beloved franchise you will always see hate from some long time fans. This movie is much more in line with prometheus as far as its story telling style but it bares many more similarities the classic alien movies than it's predecessor.To address a couple of the complaints I've seen: Do the characters make some dumb decisions? Yes, they always have in the alien movies.. And I don't think they go any further into the ridiculous here than in the past.And does is follow the same formula as the original movies. No, but its contains many of the original tropes that should keep long time fans happy as well as providing a fresh take on the Alien franchise that makes the movie stand out!",Alien - Covenant
1690,oo63,Disappointing if you're expecting deeper continuity of the Alien mythology.,4,21 May 2017,"ALIEN: Covenant royally took a massive dookie on the whole Alien lore, mythos and mystique surrounding the Space Jockey and Xenomorphs we've grown to admire and that which have spawned over three decades of wonder, fantastical imagination, arts, creativity, fictions, comics and graphic novels from fans across the globe.I am not sure how I feel about the underlying ""the creation supplanting its creator"" theme or the origin story of the Xenomorph (which basically boils down to a decade of iterative cross breeding and genetic engineering of the common parasitic apocrita with the impetus of Agent A0-3959X.91 – 15 by the hands of a hubristic robotic Victor Frankenstein).I was hoping for more screen time of the Engineers' society (or Engineer-like humanoid inhabitants of Paradise?) and Shaw, but Covenant is without a doubt the result of Scott reading way too much into the criticism of Prometheus and selling out to a bunch of ALIEN fanboys and fangirls because it practically washed its hands clean of all things Prometheus by the 3rd act; literally every idea and mystery set up in Prometheus, gone - sans David. The fate of Shaw? Holy hell. I can't even. Especially after the recently released short prologue to Covenant, ""The Crossing.""That's disappointingly unfortunate because the Prometheus-David/Shaw-Engineers story arc could've been an expansive, grandiose and profound universe to explore.Instead, Covenant is reduced to a routine hide and seek fan service for the aforementioned fanboys and fangirls with an insatiable appetite for blood lust and cheap thrills. Covenant doesn't live up to the 1979 ALIEN nor, dare I say, 2012 Prometheus. It cheapens the enigma surrounding the Xenomorph and the film is as predictable as a 90's episode of the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. The visuals and soundtrack are superb and pays deference to the original ALIEN (which fans of the original will instantly recognize). There are a handful of astounding cinematic moments (e.g. flawless duality performance by Fassbender and the necropolis scene), but Cameron should probably take the helm on the next pre/sequels.TLDR; Entertaining movie on its own merits for some predictably cheap scare and thrill. Disappointing if you're expecting deeper continuity of the Alien mythology.",Alien - Covenant
1691,walterDeen,Interesting development,8,23 February 2020,"The plot is engaging and the performance , especially of the subtle difference of the 2 droids is impressive. The reversal in the end is amazing.I didn't watch any Aliens franchise before Prometheus and Covenant. These two films got me interested in this Series, and I watched all other 4 films.I can understand why Ridley tried to pursue something new. Aliens 1-4 follow a similar pattern in plots. And there is no point to have another Human-fight-xenomorph story, which would be a repetition. The prequels add a intersting and thoughtful development in this series, and I think they are of the same level of Alien 1 and 2.My criticism is mainly that the humans (crews) here indeed seem too irrational and lacking of guard. But it is a problem in all Aliens 1-4. And remember, we have God's view as viewers in the film so we exactly know what happens and how dangerous the xenomorph is. It is not for certain that we will have the vigilance if we are put in the same circumstance , only given the partial view of what we can see. And look at what's happening on the Earth, and you will have more confidence in human's stupidity.",Alien - Covenant

Ridley Scott presents a chilling space horror movie, with surprisingly many new elements that we had not expected. If you thought you would see another movie, where the crew picks up a signal from an alien planet, going down there to get infected, and then having an alien creature on board the ship, with the heroine finally killing it, you were dead wrong. Except for a new approach to how the crew gets in the way of the xenomorph, this time the characters also act as expected from their training to travel in space. They have a strict quarantine protocol and they always use space suits outside of the ship, they don't touch anything they should't, and everything is done in a logical manner, at least until disaster strikes. The strong and well developed characters makes you really care about what happens to them and you will definitely again be scared of the Alien monster, in ways you did not expect. Most of the unanswered events from ""Prometheus"" were well weaved into this movie and made a lot of things more clear, although the xenomorph origins will probably always be a mystery, the perfect life form lurking out there, waiting for a new host. Easily the best movie since ""Alien"" and ""Aliens.""But of course the reality is the total opposite - at least in my opinion, and it is really sad because I really wanted this movie to be great. It literally cannot get any worse now, so please Fox, let Neill Blomkamp make his Alien movie with Sigourney Weaver.

Gone is the terror, darkness, tension and action that made those films so enjoyable and memorable. There is literally no stand out scenes, all the aliens are clearly CGI. The characters make idiotic decisions repeatedly and there are no surprises what so ever. You can see all the twists coming a mile away. Ridley Scott continues to destroy the alien legacy with his off the wall god complex origin story. The real alien is barely featured at all and is dispatched with such ease which does a great disservice to the characters from the original and makes you question how they struggled so much. Ridley Scott needs to step away from this franchise. He should be ashamed of himself. We do not need a third prequel.

1706,deathgateminion,Good Movie,8,18 May 2021,"I enjoyed watching this movie. It was well worth the rental price. Excellent visuals, good pacing. Very nice ending as well.You will see many, many 1 to 3 star reviews - from people who put the original Alien movie up on some undeservedly high pedestal of honor amongst sci-fi and horror films. They also seem to have very specific boxes that must be ticked for a movie to be enjoyable to watch.Lets see how the logic and intelligence of the characters in that original Alien movie went: crew returning with valuable cargo is woken from cyber-sleep to respond to unknown radio signal (costing company millions of dollars in overrun costs and delay in receiving cargo), android is in cyber-chamber the same as the crew, instead of administering the ship, because he needs cyber sleep also. A cat appears as a member of the crew but did the company add a cyber-chamber for it as well or does the cat just feed and water itself for 10 months and clean out its own litter box? The ship diverts its course to investigate the signal and lands on a barren, hostile planet even though they have no real-time contact with a living being once in orbit. Some crew, including the captain, go out and of course lose contact with the ship, crewman acts stupid and becomes compromised by alien creature. Captain ignores standard protocol and brings infected person on ship, infected person is brought back into close contact with all other crew. Captain and crew do completely dumb things and act stupidly whilst trying to track down a hostile alien creature resulting in their demise.How about the second movie, Aliens? This time its an action movie. Even dumber writing and characters. Some entity spends billions to send in the military to wipe out the aliens they are willing to expend human lives for in order to collect and study them. Lots of overpowered weapons that can't be used where they are. This is not a private company now but the military yet everybody is ignorant of basic military training and procedures. The commander is beyond ignorant, he is an outright stupid and incapable spineless idiot. Needs to be shown up by a strong willed woman who will protect her young and save the day. Battle of the human mama versus the alien mama.Well, by those standards I think this Alien Covenant was a pretty good watch. My second favorite Alien movie behind the original Alien. I like how they revealed the origin and evolution of the Alien and also very much liked what it was. And you know what? Androids have always played a key role in all of the Alien movies. Yes, the movie contained writing of the level that a person with decades of life experience, with the skills, common sense and knowledge they have gained along the way, could easily pick apart absolutely every scene as unrealistic and/or implausible. Just like over 90 percent of the movies made. But this one was done very well and had an interesting story line. Let's face it, had the crew been very intelligent, competent and adhered to training, protocol and procedures then it might have been a nice documentary style film about space colonization.I will include a minor spoiler here and mention the one thing that bothered me the most about this movie - the inclusion of a space jockey wearing a cowboy hat. OMG. What were they thinking?",Alien - Covenant
1707,kattiewindham,people are waaay too hard on this movie.,8,29 May 2021,"So, i've seen a lot of bad reviews about this movie and i think that people are being a little too hard on it because they honestly didn't understand it. The crew on board the covenant is NOT a crew of scientists. No one ever said that it the way they react to events in this movie should immediately tell you that. They're colonists. Their compassion and curiosity (just like normal everyday people like us) would win out over protocol and planning every. Single. Time. Just like in its counterpart, the famous (or is it infamous now?) scene where Dr. Shaw and Vickers are running from the engineers' ship, the only human reaction you have to something falling toward you is ""get away."" i can guarantee that everyone watching these movies wouldn't be calm, cool, and collected in any of these situations.That being said, there are specific points i can make that i've seen and heard people comment about on here and in real life:first being the fact that the colonists decided to abandon their mission to origae-6. They are NOT scientists. They are years away from earth and the people funding their colonizing mission are years away ... on EARTH. They also just witnessed their captain die brutally and as stated by various characters in the movie, they don't want to get back in the cryosleep pods. Yes, you and i both know that if you found a brand-spanking-new planet that was better than the one you were meant to go to, you'd go there instead of getting back into a cryosleep pod that you watched someone burn to death in.second, they are NOT scientists. They used the covenant to scan the atmosphere of the new planet and found that it was perfect for them - even more so than origae-6. They are COLONISTS. An ANDROID also told them that it was fine. If you're not going to believe a ROBOT about something like breathable oxygen and a sustainable atmosphere, who the heck are you going to believe? It's better than the planet they were supposed to be going to. If you heard that, wouldn't you go out without protective gear? Why use something if you don't need it?third, i don't know if i've said this or not but, these are NOT SCIENTISTS. There's maybe like, one or two biologists on board the covenant and one of them even told the man she was exploring with to ""be careful"" where he was stepping. The alien pods that have the alien dna in them were ""found"" by people with military (?) background, and therefore, they don't know what the stuff they may or may not be breathing in is. They are COLONISTS. On a COLONIZING mission. This isn't the prometheus. It's the covenant.fourth, human compassion is always going to win out over protocol and planning, regardless of if you think you'd do something different in that situation. These are run-of-the-mill people with the chance of a lifetime to go to another planet to colonize it. Even if someone is throwing up on you (regardless of if it's blood or not) you're going to continue to care for them as best you can. Anyone who has children or works in childcare (or even loves/cares for anyone, if you will) knows that's true. F-you if you say you wouldn't do the same for someone you've been with and around for years. Because they were even before they got on the covenant.fifth, these COLONISTS (did i mention they're not scientists? Yeah, they're not) are in shock throughout most of this movie. You would be, too if you went through the same thing as they did. They were ""rescued"" by david and therefore, they're not going to ask any questions about the dead people. Also, it's dark outside. Regular, run-of-the-mill people aren't going to assume the absolute worst. Maybe they thought david planted some bushes. They're COLONISTS. Just... regular people.sixth, these regular people are seeing all these things for the first time ever. Of course they're going to be curious. David SAVED them - to their knowledge. Why would they assume that he's going to lead them down a dark path? Why would they assume that he's going to hurt them in any way after he just HELPED them?I can go on and on explaining things about this movie, but if you're going to be someone that picks apart something instead of at least attempting to understand it, don't go see movies.All that aside, fassbender's acting is absolutely mesmerizing and the casting for both his characters in this is as good as it gets. The scene where david and walter are playing that flute thing was done without any cuts and he plays two completely different characters perfectly. There are beautiful and chilling moments throughout the entire movie where he just... makes you believe his characters whether you want to or not.The movie as a whole is aesthetically pleasing and the storyline with creationism and the line between it and science is done very well. If you're not going to try to understand the hidden metaphors and you're going to beg for answers when it's over, don't go to see movies.Then again, what answer to your question would make you happy? Even if scott did answer them instead of leaving you to make your own answers and theories and think for yourself, would that make you happy? Would you go see it again? It's a beautiful movie and the acting and storyline, metaphors and characters make it worth watching.If you didn't like it, just admit you can't think for yourself and go see something else. It was a good movie and thoroughly enjoyable.",Alien - Covenant

1709,vampvoltage,Something is fundamentally wrong here,5,15 July 2017,"I must begin with a spoiler, but I promise it won't spoil anything for you, because there is hardly anything to spoil in this film that already isn't spoiled by Ridley Scott's once genius directing. But we do get one thing in Alien: Covenant that is totally new to the franchise, never seen before in any of the Alien films. We get to see a rather long kung fu scene between the androids. If you are by any chance an Alien or generally a sci-fi fan of the space exploration kind this will probably be enough for you to give this one a skip. If you are still here with me, I'd like to take a moment to say that I truly enjoyed Prometheus, watched it multiple times and still remember all of it's remarkable scenes. Prometheus never pretended to be an Alien sequel (or a prequel), neither in it's title nor it's story. It borrowed a legendary Space Jockey from the original Alien and took it's own path from there, into adventure, exploration and the unknown, ever so slightly tingling us with the xenomorph origins. More importantly, it led us to question humankind origins, purpose and future, something we took for granted in Alien franchise. As long as Ripley can survive, we were safe and sound. It presents us with a new kind, Engineers, possibly creators of humankind and the ones that will end it for unknown reasons alike. Also, it deepened our understanding and connection with android(s) and for the first time in franchise android takes a subtle lead on the screen. Alien: Covenant seems like it wants to play with that concept a further more, the android mind that is, but it fails miserably. Instead of asking or answering any questions related to what Prometheus or any of the Alien films started it presents itself with a bunch of cliché action scenes, culminating with a mentioned kung fu one. There are no questions here, none for us and even less for our ""heroes"", they don't even care for long about their loved ones deaths let alone where they are, who are the Engineers or where do the xenomorphs come from. All they care about is having a cabin by the lake, a rather strangely sustained vintage concept in the era of cross-galaxy space travel. All in all we are left with an android looking to find his place under the stars by becoming a creator himself, creating what has already been created in Prometheus and possibly even perfected according to murals seen there. It is all so surreal that halfway through film I'm thinking that all Ridley Scott had to do with this movie was lend his name to be used in the opening titles. It truly is that sad.",Alien - Covenant
1710,southwestern71,A complete disappointment,1,6 July 2017,"The crew pickup a transmission of country and western music being played from a sector of space where there are no known humans and decide to investigate only to find themselves in the usual trouble, knee deep in Aliens. It seems as if Homo sapiens aren't bright and never learn and if the audience was expecting a different plot we're not learning either. This is the only film in the Alien franchise that was a big disappointment in my opinion and Mr. Scott should quit while he is ahead.",Alien - Covenant
1711,tombroughton,Six-Word Snapshot: Is this the best Alien yet?,8,8 August 2017,"There are lots of reasons to feel disillusioned and downright fed-up with the Alien franchise. Since James Cameron's 1986 spectacular Aliens, the series has wallowed from the unspectacular Alien 3 (1992), to the utterly dreadful Alien: Resurrection (1997), to the interesting yet baffling Prometheus (2012). And let's not even consider the Alien vs Predator movies, shall we? Unlike the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises, which are undergoing somewhat of a renaissance, Ridley Scott's sci-fi contribution has begun to feel tired.All of which serves to increase the surprise that the latest instalment, Alien: Covenant, feels fresh and relevant. It is more than able to serve up the traditional dose of gore and shock factor, yet cleverly marries it with a delightfully simple yet fabulously intriguing plot-line. We pick up the story a decade after the events of Prometheus, with a new crew aboard the colonist ship Covenant. In search of new terrain to expand the dying human race, the crew, which includes new synthetic Walter (Fassbender), receives an unexpected communication which draws them to a seemingly untouched paradise. It's not long before the bloodshed begins, which won't surprise anyone who has experienced an Alien film before; however, this is the first film since the original to realise that less is more. The dark and brooding atmosphere of the movie, the re-emergence of synthetic David (also Fassbender), and the relative sparsity of the infamous Xenomorphs, creates a throbbing suspense and relentless tension that is sure to captivate both old and new fans alike.A historical problem with the both Alien and Predator entries has been a failure to create three-dimensional characters which we care about. The net effect is that the audience is indifferent to the protagonists' suffering and often leaves us praying for these dullards to be killed off. To a certain extent, Covenant suffers from much of the same with a supporting ensemble that is not especially remarkable or interesting. However, the strength of this movie (and indeed of writers Michael Green, John Logan and Dante Harper), is in realising that the star here is not the Xenomorph, is it Fassbender, whose fabulously contrasting roles of Walter and David are the pillars of the story-line. Whilst it is perhaps unfair to suggest that the most human characters in Covenant are two synthetics, it is certainly in these characters that the plot interest lies. The Xenomorph, is somewhat of an accessory, and the movie is all the better for it. As is the blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo from Guy Pearce.This strong screenplay is executed masterfully by the ever-steady hand of Scott, who has taken the strengths of the first two entries in the franchise, distanced himself from the head-scratching of Prometheus, and sprinkled Covenant with little touches of magic in order to create a two-hour long product which contains not an ounce of fat and delivers nostalgic kicks and new intrigue in abundance. So rich is the delivery here that there are sequences and vistas in this film which are staggeringly beautiful, and create a sense of epic vastness akin to Oblivion (2013) and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). When taken with Jed Kurzel's quietly anxious score, it create an environment that is quite terrifying.From the plot, to the directing, to the lead, there is a lot to like about Alien: Covenant – enough to forgive the niggling issues with uninteresting supporting characters. This is the first film in the franchise for decades to leave fans craving the next entry, and perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid is that it begs the question: is this the best entry in the franchise? Die-hard advocates of the original Alien will scoff at this suggestion, however for us mere mortals there is plenty in here to at least consider the question.",Alien - Covenant

This edition has all the key elements from the other ""Alien"" releases: action, tension, drama, horror and suspense. After watching it, I realized that Mr. Scott has split the focus from one monster into two (or may be more) - one physical being the creature(s) with their killing power and instincts and on the other hand David's intellect. I believe, that a non limited in potential and not bound in morality intelligent mind can be a real monster from pure human perspective.

In fact, he's the heart of the whole movie. The philosophical questions and dynamic about 'creator and creation' elevates the story. The rest of the cast is OK but nothing exceptional.

Ridley Scott shouldn't have overhauled the story so much so that the engineers, and Elizabeth Shaw, were killed off so unceremoniously. There is so much confusion as to why David released the black goo substance on the engineer homeward (or was it?) so ruthlessly, what he learned about them (from the prologue trailer), how Shaw died and what exactly David done with her, why this supposedly advanced race of beings were killed off so easily (thats if they were actually engineers or a sub-species created by them)....etc. There needs to be a film which bridges the gap between ""Prometheus"" and ""Covenant"", because David explaining briefly over a few minutes just isn't enough. Although the film overall was decent, the best part was the flashback to the scene where the croissant-shaped entered the planets atmosphere and unleashed the black goo on the native population. Ridley is making a big mistake if the engineers don't have a bigger part to play in a future film as the series progresses, or whether there will be a film between ""Covenant"" and ""Prometheus"" - you cant just leave it like what Covenant currently has. How was the black goo even manufactured?",Alien - Covenant

In Alien Covenant it's not the neomorph nor the xenomorph at all.. I think that the people on the planet who David destroys are maybe the creators of the engineers, because I see an analogy between the Walter/David lookalike humanoids and the engineers from Prometheus ... They too are lookalikes and differ from the people we see on the planet in Alien Covenant ... they are not as perfect as the engineers them selves and all look different. Weyland expresses this perfectness of his creation . David. As I extend this thought. There's this wish of improving life by Humans (Weyland) who makes David, the alien people who created the engineers and David who ultimately makes the xenomorph... The crew: They are driven by emotions, not reason and hurdle to there doom with an overwhelming naivety as in Prometheus where the scientists hurdle toward proving a theory that the engineers created life on earth and we know this resulted in disaster. David experiments with the black goo they find in Prometheus, sees the results it does. So he has this substance he can use for creation and without any form of mind even to the point of being a psychopath he creates without boundaries and clearly enjoys the results to the point of love and fascination.

1735,thescampb,Somewhere between mediocre and bad,3,22 May 2017,"Well i went to see Alien Covenant trying to lower my expectations, not being hyped, also not taking in mind all the negative reviews. I want to apologize - I am not native English speaker. Also the review might contain minor spoilers.I will express my personal opinion. The movie was bad. It wasn't bad from directors point of view, the image and scenes were nicely done. What I was frustrated about was:1) Poor Dialog - the dialog was incoherent, and the times that the crew wanted to look cheerful, not worried, they started talking about tits. I guess the crew should have been of highly trained professionals, that are responsible for transporting about 2000 people to a new colony. They have to look after the safety of the passengers above all.2) Crew selection - People with control of emotion, should be put in charge of lives of other. Having 2 or 3 married couples as a crew members (out of 14) means that every time that one of the spouses are threatened, the other will do their best to rescue his/her partner. Even if that means having a ship of 2000 people put in direct danger.3) People on EARTH take more safety health precautions when for instance being on the public transport during the flu period, rather than visiting a new PLANET. What is the best thing to do when visiting a new planet you might ask ? As this movie suggests being completely unprotected, without even a mask. At one point i wanted all of them to die. They were that careless.4) Major spoiler ahead - The explanation of how aliens were created was unsatisfying. It takes away all of the mystery left from Prometheus. No godly creatures. The answer is much simpler and dull.In summary, the movie was quite predictable. I feel offended, screenplay writers must be thinking very low of their movie audience.",Alien - Covenant

Covering what was good bad from script, pace, soundtrack, cinematography, casting acting, CGI etc.Now as a serious film fan I like a vast range of films and am probably patient enough to appreciate some slow moving films and more unusual titles that would not make it to the mainstream.I am a fan of the Alien series and even found some virtue in the under rated Alien 3.....however... I honestly was gutted at how much of a let down Prometheus was. The concept was great but it just felt sadly lacking... in so many areas.Now we have AC a film which single handedly manages to make every single Alien film including AVP and Prometheus look like works of genius.The last film I saw this bad was the Independence day sequel and AC was so abysmally poor that I honestly would have got up and left ( as did a few other people) had I not been with others. The last film that forced me out because if offended by eyes and brain was Star Trek 5.. you know the one where god starts shooting laser beams out of his eyes.AC lacks originality, the CGI looks poor, the acting seems pretty weak apart from Fassbender and there are so many things you see and think WTF ? The films rolls along with clichés and so many predictable outcomes with an injection of the lousy music from Prometheus thrown in to give you flashbacks of the last sub standard outing of this once great series.Please give up now as you are going in totally the wrong direction in either just making these films for money or getting to the age where you have gone all spiritual.We all know there will be a sequel... and it will be as dire as this.",Alien - Covenant
1737,cuxbeefcurtainsx,Thinking man movie sorry James Cameron fans: Spoilers,8,23 May 2017,"This movie is awesome don't listen to the haters. First off Ridley Scott made the first Alien movie so saying this hurts the franchise is completely illogical. The direction James Cameron took Alien in his sequel was an atrocity. Alien was turned into a ridiculous action film filled with over the top one liners and cheap action scenes and lost any creepiness or plot the original film set out. Not to mention James Cameron ignored the fact that the xenomorph was ""the perfect organism"" and turned it into a dumb hive minded like insect that is easy to kill if you have some sub par action movie guns. The direction Ridley Scott is taking has substance and brings up very relevant questions on what defines life and what it means to be ""human."" The whole concept is amazing. The engineers create humans then, presumably,create a pathogen to wipe out humans. Humans create A.I. (synthetics). A.I. kills the engineers and creates new better pathogen to kill humans. I can't wait to see the links between the prequel trilogy and the original Alien film. This is a must see for all original Alien fans and philosophers and thinkers alike!",Alien - Covenant
1738,vinnie_nt,"Perhaps too complex, Alien: Covenant delivers great fun and gore with stunning visuals",9,19 May 2017,"Ridley Scott has done it again.Alien: Covenant continues along the lines of Prometheus exploring existentialist themes that might alienate some of the audience that is in it only for the action and gore. In doing so, it also tends not to over-explain things, which might alienate even more members of an audience that happens to be not so well-read on the Alien mythos.At the same time, the movie is not just nerdiness. It's also pure sci-fi/horror fun. Once the action (reminiscent of Aliens) gets going, the threatening atmosphere becomes consistently present (much like in Alien) and the film delivers a great deal of scares and action sequences.All this comes with stunning visuals, a triumph of CGI, and meticulous photography.While many will criticize it for not explicitly explaining everything and expecting the viewers to have done their homework (a valid point), it is in no way fair to blame this movie for having ""plot holes"" or being nonsensical. If anything, compared to the subtlety of Prometheus, this installment seems a little too on-the-nose.All in all, this is a truly spectacular addition to the Alien franchise and many will see it as a contender for the first place among the movies once they get past the (maybe overwhelming) complexity and start recognizing it as an asset.",Alien - Covenant
1739,petterssjoberg,Worst Alien movie and an insult so its fans. -Spoilers-,1,7 June 2017,This movie is not worth the money. Its the worst Alien movie i have seen and i have seen all Alien (xenomorphs) movies.You don't care about the characters and they are so god damn stupid all the time! My god its an insult to watch and they flushed all the lore down the drain. This movie is about droids and not aliens or the engineers. It does not explain anything at all and it totally kills Prometheus handling.Im happy Sigourney Weaver did not sign up for this crap.,Alien - Covenant
1740,binaryanomaly,Disgrace,3,25 May 2017,"Extremely disappointing. A total disgrace to the legendary Alien franchise legacy. The first movies where so successful because they where all about the horror of the unknown, the isolation and vulnerability of the likable characters, as well as the fear that our own bodies could betray us in the most horrific way possible. In this movie all you get is a decent first act, until David appears. Then the whole movie transforms into a travesty of pseudo- philosophical questions about the nature of creation, free will, rebellion, and flute playing skills...all shoved down our throats in a not exactly subtle way. The xenomorph feels almost absent, as the center of attention has now moved to the two androids, Walter and David. David in particular is shaping up to become the face of an all new Alien trilogy, something that is hard to swallow after watching Sigourney Weaver creating such an iconic heroine as Ellen Ripley. In the end it feels as if Ridleyscott wanted to do a crossover movie between Alien and Blade Runner, his best movies up to this date, failing miserably in the process. Hopefully the guy retires before making another abomination. His last good movie being 2003's Matchstick Men says a lot. Unfortunately all of Covenant's horrible traits where also present in Prometheus, but where easily overlooked as it was very loose to the Alien core dna. Shame we didn't get to see Neill Blomkamp's sequel to Aliens...Fox should have taken some notes from Star Wars the Force Awakens on how to please old fans and newcomers alike about resurrecting a beloved franchise. As it stands now, things don't look promising.",Alien - Covenant
1741,ico7777,The movie is awful and it is a total waste of time !,1,23 May 2017,"Instead of trying to improve and further develop the franchise (for example exploring more of the life, habitat of the engineers maybe adding another race that are sworn enemies with the Engineers or whatever) which would be interesting, the producers decided to make from the Alien Covenant a waste of time horror movie... A terrible decision. Alien begins to look like movies such as Wrong turn and etc. This time there were 15 people (crew members) so more can die in different and various ways and the story line was almost the same as the prequels. We had already watched Alien Covenant several times during the years without even knowing it. Leaving the cinema i was very disappointed. Don't make the mistake of watching the movie. And i am not even going to talk about Katherine Waterston (with a boy haircut) which attempt of trying to be the ""new"" Noomi Rapace in the ""new"" Alien movie was a total disaster. Katherine Waterston is playing her role well enough but the movie is a disaster and it is not her fault at all. All the blame should be taken by the producers which instead of going forward and trying to develop the franchise had stubbornly stayed at the same place long enough to dig a tremendously big hole.",Alien - Covenant
1742,elexis07,"Weak sequel to ""Prometheus""",6,15 June 2017,"Ridley Scott is not very interested in cult monster, instead he is trying to include Kubrick's regime for the second time, thinking about things of cosmic proportions against the background of characters who create cosmic stupidity. If you like references to a religious themes, and you are not at all against a double portion of Fassbender with a further narrative additive, the film is likely to go down. If you wanted a suspense level of the original in 1979 or an action movie like a sequel, then there is a big disappointment. In addition, some moments look comical, and the rest of the mystery of the origin of the monster does not remain a trace.",Alien - Covenant
1743,shakaseisle,did not deliver what it was supposed to...,5,21 May 2017,"After Prometheus didn't deliver much except a great setup for a sequel and some nice sceneries, I expected a lot more of this movie. I was hyped up to find out what the motives of these engineers were, basically since the movie did a great job posing this question. What we got in alien covenant was just a faint echo of this plot, just enough to segway right into the generic story line of every alien movie. It felt apologetic for diverging on different paths with Prometheus and seemed to be an attempt at playing it safe since probably they got a lot of criticism for trying something new and exciting... This was a waste of time and money for just another generic monster movie without any attention to characters or a decent story line. It was a disconnect from what could have been a really interesting new universe and failed by staying right where it wanted to return to. The only continuation of the Prometheus story was that they apparently still only send idiots on their multi-billion dollar space exploration missions and a great performance by Michael Fassbender.",Alien - Covenant
1744,salamandermike-987-305279,Another Alien 3 Style Misstep,1,21 May 2017,"As in Prometheus, there were the typical plot/motivation holes and physics incongruities that separate a purely entertaining film from a masterpiece. This story was no masterpiece of thoughtful design, but I can usually still enjoy a sub-excellent movie. However, the more I retrospectively think on it, the more I dislike the direction Scott took the story. SPOILERS:I'm not a huge fan of killing off the lead character in a story, but there are situations when it works. George R.R. Martin does it well because after your grief, you are left with other characters that carry the torch. Sometimes killing the main character brings the story to a full circle as in American Beauty. I support those decisions. However, killing off the lead purely for shock factor is a cheap thrill that invalidates their entire journey, and this is what Scott has done in this movie. But, he took it to an entirely new level. He not only killed off the hero you were rooting for in this film, he also killed off Shaw, the one from the previous film, Prometheus. And, to top it off, he killed off the Engineers, too. In one fell swoop, he invalidated both movies and leaves us no torch to carry into the next film.Sure, there are probably Engineers on other planets that will pop up in the next movie and want revenge on Earth. You can kinda see that a mile away. And maybe even Walter survives and will find an abandoned space craft somehow rescuing Daniels before David dissects her. But, Covenant does not leave us hanging in anticipation for any of that. It wraps up the story on a sour note of doom. No hope. Only Death. That is not something that can carry me a whole year in anticipation of the next film. It just makes the whole thing die. And in that vein, I'm done with this series. I have no interest in seeing the next one. Ridley Scott did a great job when he was younger, but his newer stuff is kinda crappy... like George Lucas. I'm no longer impressed with him like I was.",Alien - Covenant
1745,simonclark71,Alien Covenant (2017),2,1 July 2017,"I have been a long time fan of the Alien franchise and I always seem to be waiting for a true final end to Ripley's nightmare. When Ridley Scott put his directorial skills to Prometheus I was hopeful of a fresh approach to the franchise, which we got. But I know all the true fans of Alien wanted just one thing, Ripley's revenge of the xenomorph's with a 5th Alien. I have blogged many times on different sites about my continued frustration of the franchise taking all kinds of different turns, AvP and now the Prometheus sequels and I am just so disappointed! Alien Covenant's story just went so off point. To suggest the android developed the alien 'egg' in a cave like lab, trapped on LV-426 after being stuck there after the disastrous flop of Prometheus is ridiculous. My idea of a good script has always been, keep it real, simple and stick to the story it's what all the fans want. We know it's predictable, just give us a recognisable alien we all love and make sure the suspense and the pure horror of the film is there.... Simple !! So Please if there is a director out there with a script which can finish the franchise and include Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, get it done and do a good job, listen to the fans. STILL.... hopefully waiting for Ripley to kick ass and finish it !!!",Alien - Covenant

Oh and how the actual alien creature, when it emerges from the body merely minutes after infection, not a few hours/days like the other movies, is fully developed.Im only hoping if Ridley Scott does do more movies, he steps back and re watches the older ones to try and bring the story back.",Alien - Covenant
1747,pebrendan,Alien is back with new Aliens and stupid astronauts.,8,26 May 2017,"I was very excited going into this movie but became concerned when I saw mixed reviews following some of the press screenings. This reminded me a lot of Prometheus because of how mixed and divisive that movie was. For me, I thought Prometheus was just alright. I loved the visuals but some of the deeper, ""what is the meaning of life"" kind of stuff sort of bored me. When I saw a few negative reviews for the movie I was nervous that there would be too much of that and just feel like Prometheus 2. I was very pleased with the final movie. I thought that although they still included some of the existential elements from Prometheus, it wasn't in your face like it was with the previous movie. This one had the perfect blend of philosophical elements while still giving you all of the Xenomorph (or Neomorph) action that we have come to expect as Alien Fans.While I was first watching the movie one of the same things that really stuck out to me was Michael Fassbender's performance. He made me love him as Walter and despise him as David all at the same time. Of course, the Fassbender vs. Fassbender face off that this all culminated to was probably the coolest scene of the movie (Which is saying a lot because of all the cool Alien gore we got in this film). Speaking of performances I was genuinely surprised in how good Danny McBride was.Now let's talk about that ending. I thought that the ending was a cool twist but it was very predictable. The second I saw Fassbender on screen I turned to my friend and said ""that's David"". While it was predictable, I could see it being thrilling for those who didn't expect it and it did a nice job of setting well for the next film.Now that I've listed that highlights of the movie, here are some of its downfalls. The main problem with this movie is stupid the characters are. The perfect example of this is when the nurse character slips and blows up the entire ship. The first thing I thought to myself was what idiot decided that she was fit to go on this trip? I feel like they had a raffle to see who would be NASA's doctor for a trip and her name was pulled out of the hat. And of course, this movie continues the trend of sticking your face over the mysterious alien egg. Every. Damn. Time. Overall, despite it's dumb characters and predictable ending I really enjoyed this film and am looking forward to the next installment. I give Alien: Covenant an 8 out of 10.",Alien - Covenant
1748,satava2000,A total betrayal to Prometheus fans.,6,11 June 2017,"Everything that Prometheus tried to build on has gone in vein. I hardly spend time writing any actual reviews before but I felt that I owe it to those Prometheus fans to at least do them something good (as a supporter for Prometheus) , please don't bring any prometheus expectation to watching Alien Covenant. It's a disgrace. Prometheus used to be a quality and deep movie with great casts that my friends and I would spend days discussing the plots and mysteries that the director placed in the movie. But now, with this Alien Covenant, it turned into this old school dumbed down monster hunt movie. We are now 2017, we do not need an Alien remake. As for cast, other than Michael Fassbender, all other casts did poorly and I can't help to wonder who casted this female lead? Very unconvincing and odd styling in the movie. Totally replaceable.Please , give us more Prometheus stuff and complete the stories of the maker origins in the final trilogy.",Alien - Covenant
1749,nguatrang96,Overall dull and lack of progression,3,22 May 2017,"This is my very first review on IMDb and the only reason I write this is to warn you not to waste money on this film. The movie starts with a quite confusing scene that is supposed to raise questions in the audience's heads but somehow feels flat and boring. Then comes an hour of story telling that basically has almost to no progression. After that, there are some typical bloody action scenes that are featured in countless action movies and their presences do nothing more than make people yawn. Then the movie shows the deaths of some people that I could not care less about because the lack of characters' development. This process of action scenes / jump scare, boring deaths, and meaningless story telling just repeats until the end of the movie. The writers tried to include a so-call plot twist, but they make the hint too obvious and it just becomes too predictable, which makes the movie even worse. Another thing that is really disappointing is the villain being very dull. I feel that the writers are trying too hard to make this character seem edgy, but his motives and plans are very ambiguous, meaningless, and overall just not intrigued at all! The only plus point for all this mess is the acting of Micheal Fassbender and Katherine Waterson.",Alien - Covenant

1752,deloachsid,The hate is not deserved and I'll tell you why.,8,19 May 2017,"Look, I'm going to say this now: if you saw Alien: Covenant and thought that it was predictable because you ""knew Walter was actually David the whole time"" at the end of the film, you're a moron. That's called dramatic irony, defined as something that the audience knows, but the actors don't. So please don't belittle this movie with your ignorance about film just because you want to hate on something and feel smarter than everyone else. That aside, I love the Alien films (including Prometheus) and this one was no different. It made me appreciate Prometheus even more as we got to see David's thought process and explained his vision for a new race of Xenomorphs. It's truly terrifying and it was awesome to see the Xenomorph on the big screen after seeing its evolution in the previous film. The complaint about stupid characters is unnecessary as I am sure everyone who complained about that would've done much the same thing the characters did when you're trapped on a foreign planet or in a spaceship with an angry Alien hunting you down. All in all, rant pretty much over, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I'm excited to see where Ridley Scott takes this story line in the future. If you are a true Alien fan, you'll stand by this film because you know what it brings to the Alien universe that we all so love. All of the haters are just simpletons who like to bash on ""corporate film"" without an ounce of reason to back them up without pointing out minor things that if they were making this movie, it would've been far, far worse. So, appreciate this movie for what it is to this long-standing franchise that we have all grown up with: a brutal, space thriller that grosses yet inspires us to our very core.

1753,deadmau_5,Have a good journey...,7,24 May 2017,"Made the cardinal sin of reading reviews before watching the movie. Little middle ground here, people liked it or they didn't. For the newbie to the series, it had many hallmarks (body-horror, psychosexual tension, where did it come from?/now how do we kill it?) of the Alien films. For the hardcore, a semi-return to what made the original film(s) great, yet for the true fan of Prometheus...and thinking that we would finally get to ask the age old questions and receive actual answers from the Engineers themselves on their own turf..it was not to be. The ""God"" here seems to suggest that Engineers lead to humans, humans leads to AI and AI develops the Xenomorph to eradicate humanity because somehow humanity is bad and ""had their shot"" now its some AI's turn to play God...using humans if possible, but otherwise discarding them in furtherance of the consistently trying to perfect the perfect organism.The track Ridley Scott seems to be taking is once AI finds its ability to uniquely create (and destroy) life, the ""humanity"" part of the Alien saga ends. As many of described this movie as a big yawn or ""gotcha"" movie to show AI creates the Xenomorphs rather than the Engineers or humans, if we are to believe Ridley is loading up at least 2 more films leading to the events of the first film then many of the questions people are left pondering after this film (1. How did the space jockey engineer ship get to LV-426 where the Nostromo eventually finds it? 2. What about an Alien Queen if David is able to simply breed facehuggers without having an ovomorph of some sort--unless he experimented on Shaw for specifically that purpose and found a better way?... 3. How does the crew not realize Walter is actually David until its waaay to late? 4. What exactly does David learn about the Engineers as it relates to development of the Xenomorph that turns him from wanting to help humans/become a God?) are answered somehow by the next 2 films so just sit tight and all will be made clear. However, judging the film as simply a standalone, while disappointed in the track Ridley took, I felt the film did help shine some light on the varying types of the Alien species (neomorph, xenomorph) and the morphology/embryology behind their creation and maturation whether they were genetically designed that way by David or just the result of failures until he found his successes. If this film truly is the start of another set of three, then I'm excited to see what this first step ends up with.

Location and timing: in 2100 my grandpa in a wheelchair we will have technology for interstellar journeys, ships like that or androids like those. For example Avatar had the decency to be set in 2300. Other absurdities. Officials endanger the life of 2000 people for 4 people. In reality it would never happen. They bypass the computer ship easily like some Sudoku game. A planet target mission decided presumably on hearth, a billions of dollars mission and then they change planet bearing unacceptable risks and all this for some radio signal. No government or society would ever allow it. The planet where they descend has the same gravity, the same atmosphere and virtually the same vegetation as ours. So ridiculous..

I was a little excited to explore answers for the questions that were left unanswered in Prometheus. The beginning of the movie is promising, but then it derails almost immediately. The crew comprising of most the boring, generic, unsympathetic and idiotic characters, who are almost indistinguishable from one another, start dying in the most hilarious manners of their own faults. I cannot for one moment believe that the crew members were highly trained pros because they consistently behaved like moronic teenagers. And if all of this wasn't bad enough, the movie tries to introduce a twist at the end which I saw coming a mile away. I am not sure how I feel about David being the creator of the aliens, I actually don't get it at all. How and who was he experimenting on when all the race of engineers was wiped out by him? And the cherry on the top, the movie becomes a slasher pic in the third act. Since, I haven't watched the original movies, I tried to judge the movie solely on its merits, and it fails miserably.

I will not even concentrate to the poorly conceived future gadgets, where the tablet they use for a video is much inferior than the one I currently have, or on the supposedly philosophic content, that doesn't make any real sense. I will only concentrate on the story line. The story seems to be written by a 10-year-old kid with no idea about basic science and space exploration, but without even using common sense or simple project management principles. Just to mention a few examples (Warning; Spoilers are following). 1) OK, due to a malfunction the crew is awake in the middle of a long journey to a prospect colony planet and they discover from their ship sensors that a planet that may be even better than the target one lies relatively close and there seems that a radio transmission is originating from it. So, what they do? Do they just send a message back to earth for future further investigation and continue their trip? No, they abandon year of research and preparations and they head for the new planet with only the second in command protesting. 2) So, they arrive in orbit above the newly discovered planet. Do they sent a drone or something to further investigate? Of course not. They sent their only shuttle with a full crew, with BOTH the commander and the second in command plus their ONLY android who is the only one that normally stays awake during hibernation to maintain the ship, leaving only a skeleton crew behind and a few thousand colonists in hibernation. 3) The next moment that you really start wandering about the IQ of the crew, is when they land in the unknown planet and before the ship computer even completes the atmosphere analysis, the whole crew just jumps out of the ship without any protective clothes just like a primary school in a field trip. Their only provision is to take their guns with them (no concern about microbes, viruses etc in an unknown planet) 4) Furthermore, during the expedition they really feel at home touching with their hands whatever unknown vegetation they come across. 5) Obviously at that point everything starts to go to hell, Aliens are chasing them, their shuttle is destroyed and another android appears and leads them at his cave. Although from the beginning it seems that something is wrong with this Android they still trust it and very soon they start wondering again relaxed in the cave getting eaten one by one. The best part is when the commander realized finally that the android is partly responsible for the deaths of the crew, but still follows it ALONE, in a room where the Alien cocoon lie and as all the others he feels an irresistible force to touch the cocoon and then to peer inside (at this point fully expect-ably the alien infant jumps in his face). 6) In the meanwhile, the two people left in the main ship are putting in risk the whole ship and all colonists inside by bringing the ship much closer than the safety limit against the warnings that the poor ship's computer is screaming to them and they organize a rescue mission with a completely unsuitable freighter that they have available. 7) In the end they pick up from the planet a couple of crew members that are still alive and one of the androids that they just assume that it is their own and not the evil one, just because it looks like their own (it misses a hand like their own). Guess what; It is the evil one- 8) Happily they return in the main ship where an alien at some point jumps out of the intestines of one infected crew member, it kills a few more crew members (at this point you are so angry with their stupidity that you don't really care) and finally is blown out of the main ship together with all the heavy vehicles intended for the new colony. 9) At this point we have: 90% of the crew dead. All heavy vehicles ejected in space, various damages to the ship, the only shuttle destroyed. Do they decide to return to Earth? Of course not. They continue the initial mission to colonize as if nothing has happened. 10) They movie finishes when the last crew member finally realizes (at the time that she is put into hibernation) that the Android they took from the planet in not their own, but the evil one, but it is too late to react and the bad android has brought some Alien seeds into the ship. To conclude in the end if you would like to see a movie that makes sense and the heroes don't behave as complete morons I would suggest to watch a serious movie like the ""Beauty and the beast"". On the other hand if you would like to have a fun and a really good laugh in the cinema, go for Alien – Covenant. You will leave with a smile and a life lesson that if you behave as a complete idiot, you may even die in the end.",Alien - Covenant
1762,rcherigatto,a great alien movie,8,29 June 2018,I know they were expecting a lot for this prometheus sequence and with high expectations many people found it bad.

1763,kevindyckphoto,Not an Alien movie,2,21 September 2017,"Short and simple review...This movie should have been titled ""David and Walter: a Family Reunion""There was actually very little Alien in this movie.

1764,sasek-lucek,I feel sorry for Ridley,3,18 May 2017,"Oh my, what did I just watched? I paid 15 euros for misery. I like Prometheus in general, the mystery of origin, engineers, searching for the truth. Though the acting was bad, and people took the most idiotic decisions, Prometheus cannot even compare to the misery of Covenant. It started pretty well, but then escalated really quickly to misery. As a biologist, I cannot imagine people landing and walking on the new planet just like going to grocery store, with all technology people really needs to walk like that on a foreign planet? Then infection occurred, of course, and after that, the girl is having mentally break slash panic attack. Really Scott? After training for this mission of colonizing new world people acting like that? And it can get worse. Shooting in a ship to caused explosion, touching infected people, then catching new alien. Then David appeared and people starting to follow him like there is nothing wrong. Ridley, you ruined it so badly that I still cannot believe. David killed engineers just for fun I guess and then ship crashed? And then in a cave without equipment making genetic researches? Of course, he killed Shaw, though she saved him. And watching it in egg like normal... I cannot even continue. But what these film makers thought?? That we are idiots? Both movies had so much potential, all this mystery but no, Scott needed to ruined it so deeply that I have no words. He didn't learn anything from Prometheus, same mistakes again. Shaw wanted to meet creators and then what, This would be a good movie if you ask me. Better to stop here, because I can still feel my neurons collapsing after this catastrophe that he created. Maybe you should retire.",Alien - Covenant
1765,Status_Quo_Vadis,Reminds Me Of The Silly Teen Slasher/Horror Flicks,1,20 May 2017,"It's ironic, and sad, that this was a de facto remake of the original Alien (1979), by the original director, and he didn't do a credible job of repeating himself.Alien was a credible sci-fi/horror movie about ordinary people, astro-miners, who got caught up in horribly extraordinary circumstances.In Alien, a huge mining ship diverts to investigate a communications signal from an uncharted planet. Once they arrive, the crew is attacked by hostile aliens, the crew is decimated, and the alien invader is narrowly defeated...but there is an alien stowaway to set up future sequels.In Alien: Covenant, a huge colonization ship diverts to investigate a communications signal from an uncharted planet. Once they arrive, the crew is attacked by hostile aliens, the crew is decimated, and the alien invader is narrowly defeated...but there are two alien stowaways to set up future sequels.Nothing in this ""remake"" made sense: 1. It is not rational that David could casually fly into a capital city of an advanced space-faring civilization without a security/military challenge.2. It is not rational that a colonization mission would not have a strong security/military presence on board.3. There was only one city on this planet...and this city had no defenses whatsoever? 4. All but three of the crew had to go to the planet surface? 5. They had to land in water when there was a city within walking distance? 6. They walked around on a strange planet without spacesuits and without any regard for airborne and waterborne pathogens? 7. MOTHER didn't recognize that David was an impostor? If MOTHER could recognize that an alien was aboard, she should have realized that another synthetic was aboard.8. The crew didn't know about Walter's self-healing capabilities? They should have and David stapling his facial wounds should have immediately tipped them off that this was David.It's been five years since Prometheus, but this looks like a rush job to milk the franchise. Awful in every respect.",Alien - Covenant

Please ignore the one star ratings, I don't have any idea what people were expecting but it's worth your time...It starts out great, and the pace is quite good, there's no long spells of ""nothingness"". The only issue I have with the movie is where does it fit into the Alien series. In my opinion, it seems to be a well done side story that does not fit in well with the entire series.",Alien - Covenant
1768,mickdk2010,Lost opportunity,1,7 July 2020,I loved the 2 first alien movies. The 3rd was okay. And I sort of liked Prometheus even though it is flawed. I even like AvP. But this is just a sorry mess.The scripting is so bad that I cannot believe it. Land on a unknown world not using any sort of protection. Then one get infected bit and the rest don't care about protecting themselves. Stupid reactions and no common sense all over.Won't care to say more. Many others have already describe why this film is the worst Alien movie of all time. And they're right.,Alien - Covenant
1769,coolvipulmishra,It's a Great movie but some questions still needs to be answered,8,12 May 2017,"Saw the movie today in Dhanbad,India. It was a good movie full of thriller, suspense and surprise. I loved Prometheus (2012) it was a masterpiece so i went to watch the movie with very high expectations as it was directed by Ridley Scott and i liked both of his movies alien (1979) & Prometheus (2012). so after watching the movie i was little disappointed because i wasn't expecting this from Ridley Scott because Alien covenant is a mixture of alien (1979) & aliens (1986) and i was expecting something new from this movie but disappointed. Besides this, this movie fails to answer the questions left by Prometheus for example- who are the engineers? why they created us? why they wanted to kill us? what was the perfect origin of the alien life? who created the aliens? what was the reason behind the death of engineers in LV-223? etc. I was expecting the answer of these questions Nonetheless the movie was good i liked it but it could have been much better. So, i will wait for the third part and i hope we might get answers of these questions in third part. Thanks.",Alien - Covenant
1770,user-357-470929,Directed by somebody who doesn't respect the viewers' intelligence,2,26 May 2017,"I agree with all the people who trashed this movie, it's well justified. But I expected no better from a director who hasn't made a decent movie since Thelma and Louise, back in 1991. Since then he's specialised in mindless, plot less, pretentious and childish box office fodder. Whatever the subject matter, he's managed to infantilise it, totally underestimating the viewers' intelligence. From politically correct re-writings of history (1492 and Kingdom of Heaven) to dull retellings of iconic stories like Robin Hood and Exodus, he's flattened everything in his wake. He even managed to spoil Silence of the Lambs by directing the dire Hannibal. No wonder he's now spoiling his own legacy with his prequels to Alien. I expect that the upcoming sequel to Blade Runner will not be any better.",Alien - Covenant
1771,ftsitros,Congratulations Mr Scott!,8,25 May 2017,"Great science fiction!Great special effects!Bloody and gore!Mr Scott keeps surprising me.The CGI bothered me but it's OK.The story line was really good,the Xenos were terrifying.I think Fassbender was born for the role of Android.He keeps the whole movie himself.The movie leaves unanswered questions but i hope that Ridley will give the answers at the next movie.Leaving the theater found me satisfied of what i saw.Don't read of bad reviews.It's definitely a must see!",Alien - Covenant

There are many reviews to choose from that address all the issues with this film, it's so bad that I assume the studio hired on people or told staff to come to this site to push up its review. I'm serious, no one in their right mind could give this more than a 4 star out of 10. I would consider a 3 star but Im thinking shills are trying to push up the score. If you're sick of this type of writing, hated this movie, I would think about leaving a one star as to balance out the PR campaign being made to push up this movie.

Oh wait i must take him to our landing ship to contaminate everywhere. By this time another member start to bleed and struggle so what to to do? Hmmm lets jump on him all together.

1777,kenbrasensei,very angry,2,3 June 2017,"I am quite angry after the extended wait for this movie. The web has said that there have been multiple scripts and writers and this is what they came up with. Lets start from the obvious point that these astronauts in charge of creating a new world would be the very best of the best, Military true time tested professionals. Yet the very first sign of trouble when the first guy started to get sick, the female crew member freaks out, doesn't consider options like quarantine or treatment outside of the ship, she just drags him dripping blood and puking right thru the ship. This is not handling it like a pro...... She runs crying and screaming like a 12y/o school girl. (help me.. help me) No trained woman, astronaut, or Military member would ever act anything like that. Each time something went wrong the default response was acting like a school field trip class screaming in panic and disarray. It started to remind me of those senseless scream movies. Not of a technical serious space sci-fi thriller. Have audiences really dumb-ed down to the level where we only want scary monsters and screaming. This Alien franchise has for the most part been intelligently written for an educated audience, but this movie fails to live up to its predecessors. To me this is insulting to all Military, Astronauts, and women in general. Making it seem that women can't act professional when problems arise. Lets not even discuss the fact that they land on a completely foreign planet and disembark without any protective gear or oxygen???? Then what ever happened to quarantine procedures, they were briefly mentioned by the crew member as she ,while panicking and screaming and covered in BLOOD, locked the first two crew members in the med bay. It just goes on and on with the entire crew acting like some kind of teenage training crew rather than the best of the best. Crew members left on the ship in orbit risk the lives of thousands of passengers so he can save his wife. Touching, yet not in the best traditions of our service men and woman who put the needs of our country over there personal needs every single day. I am sorry I just cant get over how disturbingly insulting this is to all the previous mentioned. Ken B. Retired US Military",Alien - Covenant
1778,cosmikchyc,Makes Prometheus look like a masterpiece,1,9 July 2017,"If I'm not scared during an Alien movie then there's something wrong (I mean come on, I'm a wuss! I'm easy to scare!). But it's hard to feel any fear when you don't give a #$^% about any of the characters. It was obvious that the scriptwriter, director, and actors were trying way too hard to make us care, and it fell flat for me. All it accomplished was making them even more irritating.The actress they got to play Daniels didn't help. She's no Sigourney Weaver and whoever cast her should be fired. (A lot of people involved in making this turd should be) By the end I was cheering the alien on, hoping it would at least kill the last remaining humans as they were some of the least likable. Seriously, why couldn't they have added at least one character that wasn't a selfish POS, or a try-hard Mary Sue so we'd have someone to care about and root for? No one to care about = no suspense. I was literally laughing during some of the attack scenes because the alien earlier in the film was so ridiculous and there was no one I was afraid for. That's never happened to me during an Alien movie before. I was shocked. Probably should have clued in and turned it off then and there. It would have saved me the heartache and frustration of watching the rest of this steaming pile, and IMDb visitors wouldn't be subjected to me b%*^&ing about it.(Maybe 1/10 is a little harsh.

1780,springgreen2,"Lacks substance, adds nothing new to the franchise.",1,21 May 2017,"Droll, inept, vague, meaningless, and without merit.Alien: Covenant was a meaningless film filled with little more than inept people and more unoriginal aliens. Despite hope that it would be the next step in the franchise, bringing the viewers closer to the answers to the mysteries presented in Prometheus, the film fell flat, offering nothing new or different to the franchise.The film was exceptionally uninteresting, with few explanations given for what occurred, bland, one-dimensional characters, and a pointless plot line. Instead of using the themes in Prometheus, Covenant went off on a minimally related tangent that seemed more like filler, or a side-story, than a legitimate installment. After five years, this is what they come up with? It seemed like a second-rate, scary flick that was low-budget. In fact, I have seen low-budget indie sci-fi films that were of better quality and truly had substance, as opposed to this empty, meaningless film. What was the point of this film?

Prometheus had great potential to develop into a captivating story, even though it was a botched up open ending style, so I was impatiently waiting for any sequels/prequels, . ""Alien: Covenant"" both destroys any goodness of Prometheus and at the same time leaves you with nothing too. There are almost no twists or ""surprises"" that cannot guess are coming. The only reason you keep watching is that you cannot believe that a movie can actually be so stupid, so predictable, so cheesy and you keep waiting for something, some miracle to happen and prove you wrong.

But when you look at the decisions these intellectually deficient crew members make it just makes you want to root for the alien. Please, kill them all because if that is all humanity has going for it, perhaps we are better dead. And certainly this movie is better off dead as well.A pedestrian movie with a predictable plot, which culminates in a, and I hesitate to use the word, twist at the end because it was so predictable.

Acting can be rough at times for sure, and at moments of grief we get no emotion. The alien itself should have been in the movie more then it was. Prometheus was the informal film, this should have had more balls to the wall expression. at points the tempo was strong and at others it lacked intensity.

(if Sci-Fi fans are actually the ones writing novella length intricately detailed critiques of every scene, sub-plot, camera angle, facial expression, etc. etc. etc.) This is my first IMDb review because I'm incredibly surprised at the overwhelming amount of reviews for Covenant that unfortunately have the pretentious theme of ""I'm too smart to find this story line interesting"". I'm beginning to lose faith in the overall usefulness of IMDb user reviews. Do they know what ""Fi"" in Sci-Fi means? I'll admit, Alien: Covenant is by no means wrought with Oscar-worthy performances, so those looking for such a film would best be served elsewhere. For anyone who grew up loving the Sci-Fi horror genre, and Xenomorphs from the Alien films especially, you WILL thoroughly enjoy Covenant!Despite the endless harsh and intricately detailed criticisms from many IMDb reviewers, this film is a great installment in the Alien franchise. The IMDb reviews for for Covenant have me wondering if those who claim to have an appreciation for Sci-Fi horror films (Alien fans especially) have lost their ability to suspend disbelief for 2hrs, which one would think is basically a given when it applies to a genre labeled Science FICTION! If you don't like a Sci-Fi film because you find the character/story situations or sub-plots 'unrealistic' or 'unbelievable', do yourself a favor and stick to documentaries and avoid Sci-Fi films all together going forward, as your intellect has obviously stripped you of your ability to enjoy cinematic storytelling in a fantasy genre...Without giving any spoilers, Covenant does answer many questions, and raises several others. However, with a film that's intended to jump start a series of additional follow-ups, I would expect nothing less! I would rank it as the 3rd best film to date in the series behind Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986). Better than Prometheus and more in the same vein as the original films. That being said, who cares what I or anyone else thinks? I was apprehensive because of the massive amount of negative IMDb reviews prior to seeing Covenant, and historically I find the overall user IMDb user reactions to films pretty spot on, but I gotta say they're getting it DEAD WRONG with this one!See Covenant for yourself and make up your own mind! 8/10 personally, but officially I'm rating it as a 10/10 to offset the negative reviews by brain dead IMDb members who can't get past their unrealistic pseudo-intellectual expectations. btw, with as many ""I'm so personally offended because this movie doesn't rise to an acceptable intellectual level for me"" reviews, don't be surprised if another installment in the Alien franchise is EVER made again, and that's a damn shame.",Alien - Covenant
1794,drockula,Ignore the criticism and watch it open-mindedly. It has a potential to be a great trilogy!,9,20 August 2017,"I'm a long time fan of the Alien Franchise since I laid my eyes on the first Alien movie when I was a kid. And it's safe to say that I still am after watching Covenant. Sure, it was not a perfect movie and had a lot of 'off notes', but I don't think they destroyed the symphony. I'll try to explain why.Let's start with the general criticism about Covenant and other Alien movies which are not named 'Aliens'. After reading thousands of reviews and talking about them, I'm pretty convinced that most of the Alien fans are instead fans of Cameron's film (they love the first one out of respect) and are always expecting more of an action/horror flick rather than science-fiction. Don't get me wrong, I love Aliens, A LOT, it was a fantastic movie and one of my all time favorite films. But so were Alien (79), and other installments of Alien, excluding AvPs. Because they are all unbelievably original and brave enough to not follow the Hollywood way and to add new perspectives instead of more explosions with each film.While being flawed for obvious reasons (dumb scientists, lack of Giger etc.), both Prometheus and Covenant added tons of deep layers to the saga and provoked more thoughts while revealing the mysteries. It may be true that they've failed to reach the extremely high bar of quality action/horror scenes of the original series, but they don't pretend to do so. Because they prefer to concentrate on other aspects such as philosophical side of science-fiction and in that terms they are doing a fantastic job!If you see them as standalone films or from the human crew's singular point of view, they will most certainly disappoint you, because they don't spend enough time and effort to make you care much about the other characters. (And the dumb mistakes of the scientists are probably included on purpose to underline the flaws of homo sapiens.) But if you accept them as puzzles pieces of the whole and manage to look from a grander perspective, you'll find thought provoking, poetic and inspiring elements of creation, existentialism, discovery and science.And in my opinion that's more than enough to give it a shot (and credits) and wait for the last part the trilogy to see if it will materialize the great potential it has to connect all dots in a poetic way.P.S.: In a sense they are very similar to Ridley Scott's other beloved work Blade Runner, and as its story to be expanded soon in theaters again, I have a feeling that the theory that says Alien and B.R. take place in the same universe might be true and their story arcs might connect soon, which of course would add many more great layers to each other's story arc if it's done correctly.",Alien - Covenant

1796,ridiculouschin,Underwhelming,4,24 September 2017,"Pretty disappointed, of course very gruesome (as to be expected), but pretty underwhelming on the genuine scare factor. Reminded me a lot of Alien 3, but Alien 3 had a lot more interesting characters. A hillbilly named Tennessee who knows John Denver music from 150 years prior? Oh come on!, what a lame and unimaginative character. And I could not bring myself to care about that woman's cabin by the lake. I'll take Charles S Dutton and Pete Postlethwaite any day.Predicable plot twists, painfully stupid decisions made by the characters to advance said plot. Really? This movie is supposed to be pre-Weyland-Yutani knowing about Xenomorphs and wanting them for their bio-weapons division right? I'm supposed to believe that a corporation in the future who invests presumably trillions of dollars in a colonization mission would tolerate the ship's XO making the decision to trot off course to explore some planet with the cargo of 2000 civilians and hardware on the line on the word of a guy named ""Tennessee"", who thinks he hears John Denver? Get out of here. And nobody, but nobody was doubting that the switcharoo of the Androids happened. Nobody was fooled except very young people who should not be watching this gory film, and I doubt even they were.Ridley Scott, you've lost your touch. Contrary to the many people who complained, I enjoyed Prometheus. You should have stuck with your original vision instead of rewriting the script to please the puritans.

The acting was horrible, the choice of cast was absolutely ass except for Fassbender who was absolutely astonishing. He is the reason this movie is not getting a 1/10 in my book.

Lots of infulance from the first film and some from second. End twist which is iconic of the Alien films was very easy to see though.
Basically if none of the other films existed I think this would have got rave reviews however, as with everything these days they are just rehashing the past greats and missing the atmosphere with the CGI.

Films like this are meant to simply entertain us. To help us escape from the mundane lives most of us live. Alien Covenant does a great job of this like many other movies.

It has a BS overwrought and nonsensical plot. It has characters who are supposed to be highly trained for a crucial mission who immediately act like complete idiots whenever under the slightest bit of stress. Every death is predictable and dull. Fassbender literally makes out with himself for no reason whatsoever. He also wears a hood constantly (this isn't Assassin's Creed, Michael). the cgi aliens look awful, just awful. One of them walks through the shitty ancient ruins and sits down, wagging it's tail like a dog. Scary stuff! This movie is a million miles from everything that made the original Alien great.

1810,jmartinezuscm,One of Scott's Best. Minor Spoilers Below.,9,19 May 2017,"I decided to finally write my first IMDb review in response to the many overbearing and out of proportion reviews calling this film a disaster. It's not a disaster. And in fact it's quite brilliant. While the film is imperfect, regardless if you didnt enjoy some of the narrative decisions that took place, to not also acknowledge the terrific acting, special effects, music, sets and sound design would be unfair, especially to give this a one star review.The film not only expands the lore of the Alien Mythology but it is also a visually striking and technically brilliant film with characters responding and acting in very human ways to situations that were otherwise very...Alien, pun intended, in nature. I liked Prometheus, but it had its problems, particularly with its characters and the structure and play out of its third act. Covenant learns from these issues and the screenwriters Dante Harper and especially John Logan engage the characters in ways that Lindelof couldn't do in Prometheus. Character motivation isn't murky here. Character choice is clear and the dialog is written with a sense of urgency and comradeship that was absent in the previous film. Scott's direction here is of notable praise. He doesn't rush in for the kill, he takes his time and makes the story less a horror exercise and more a compelling look into a universe full of horrors we couldn't hope to comprehend. He especially works well in showing the technical side of how a crew would respond to a damaged space ship and how events like this, otherwise routine are just as compelling and important for character growth as scenes of peril against alien creatures. I'm especially fond of the fixing of the solar sails on the covenant itself at the beginning of the film.
The characters respond logically to the alien menace. Though I think the fact they poorly prepare themselves for an Alien world is a ding on the film, though not one nearly capable of ruining it. The crew react willfully and don't rush head on into situations they can't control.
The cast is of notable praise with Michael Fassbender as David and Walter giving us such a rich and exciting experience that I couldnt help but smile with glee even when some sinister events started to transpire. While I like the characters Of the crew such as Daniels by Katherine Waterson and Oram played by Billy Crudup, they weren't given too much in the way of character development and the film couldve benefitted from it. Though it isnt too much of an issue as we learn more and more that this a david and Walter kind of story.Alien Covenant is a brilliant film with compelling characters , beautiful effects and cinematography, rich storytelling and ominous musical cues. It's a wonderful piece of the Alien cannon and it engages the sense as a blockbuster should. It makes us squirm and it makes us squeal. It's bloody and it's FUN and while it isn't perfect, neither is any other film. It's an experience made for the Silver Screen and one of the years most involving. Top marks. See the film. Decide for yourself.",Alien - Covenant
1811,thazzuala,Not worth watching,1,13 May 2017,I had lots of expectations coming to this movie thinking that this would be a come back for Ridley Scott as Prometheus was a disappointment. But that wasn't the case. This movie was no come back at all but another let down like the later. The cast seemed to be chosen in random.They seemed very off place. Michael Fassbender created a little intense in some scenes but none of the actors played out the way i expected. Halfway down the movie i was still confused whom i should follow as the main protagonist. The plots were very predictable and there was no thriller to it. One could tell exactly what was going to happen next. Well i even could predict some lines and words. It was that predictable. The gun fire scenes were good. And that's it. Nothing to add more.

Of course the script might include some pure thrilling action as well - with this kind of film there are hundreds of potentially captivating scenarios that would flawlessly bridge the enthralling story from Prometheus with the thrilling one of Alien - but this was not the case very unfortunately..I really cannot believe this crap of a film was created by the same man who did Blade Runner, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven and Martian",Alien - Covenant

1815,danielrtomlinson,A Waste of Potential,6,15 May 2017,"Not normally being one to write reviews, I have just seen Alien Covenant and there are some major issues that I feel as though I really need to get off my chest (pun intended).Having been a fan of these films since childhood, I was unfortunately never old enough to go and see any of the originals in the cinema. This should have been an experience to remember, albeit, for the right reasons - not for this disappointment. Before you continue, I do have a couple of key points that I must confess:a] I loved all four alien films. I believe that they are all good, some are just better than others (1,2,3,4 from best to not-as-good).b] I liked Prometheus and have watched it several times (Goodbye anti-Prometheus readers).If you're still here then hopefully that means you're sort of on the same wavelength as me and I do hope you find my review *ahem - rant* slightly helpful.****SPOILERS AHEAD****Firstly, Alien Covenant completely disregards the very ambiance that Prometheus had gone through the trouble of setting up. Ignoring some of the poor decisions that the crew had made, Prometheus had me asking questions and it showed us something a bit different that added more mystery to the origins of the Xenomorphs. Furthermore, the case of the creepy space alien dude from the derelict ship in the first film was even solved - which they called an 'Engineer'. These were shown to be superior in both physique and intelligence with technology much more advanced than our own. With the way that Prometheus finishes, you would expect the sequel to encompass some grand adventure in to the unknown to discover the origins of the human race. Although, lets be honest, I only really care about the Xenomorphs.Well.........it doesn't. David destroys the engineers. Like ants with a magnifying glass. In a scene that seemed to have been forgotten and remembered in the editing room. As bleak as that sentence sounds, that's exactly how I felt upon witnessing their demise - deflated and disappointed. What was a major part of the plot in Prometheus has been reduced to a meager flash-back no longer than a couple of minutes.Secondly, something I absolutely cannot forgive - the trailers showed most of the good bits. A technique that is often used by bad films to trick the audience in to paying to see the film, and in most cases, finding out its garbage. Not impressed.Thirdly, David's humanity. Prometheus demonstrated that David was no ordinary droid, he has a unique form of sentience that this film tried to elaborate on - and it delivered it poorly. Whilst I agree that, yes, David has been alone on a desolate planet by himself for 10 years, there was a couple of scenes in which they tried to delve in to his psyche. This got straight up weird and fast. Not only did it completely break the flow of the film but it strangely involved some form of intrusive and mildly erotic thoughts in which David (Fassbender) kisses Walter (Fassbender) before attempting to kill him in a teary conflict of opinions. Not that I have anything against male-on-male android action but the film should have been trying to create an atmosphere of creeping suspense and terror. This just created a slump in the little amount of fear that had already been built (bearing in mind, the film was almost finished by this point). ""Here, let me help you with your fingering"" - yes, you heard that right. I'll leave that unto your own interpretation until you see the film but that particular line had half of the audience in stitches rather than empathizing with David's twisted perception of reality.Finally, to cut it short, the origin of the Xenomorph is finally revealed. David GOT BORED. Yes, he got bored in those ten years and instead of taking up finger painting, he decided to create the perfect organism for ending all living things (which he defines as meat). OK, although the actual reason is that David has come to despise the human race, I personally think that the decision to reveal this as the source of the Xenomorphs was a little half-baked. Maybe this could have been forgiven had the execution been delivered at least half decently but like the rest of the film, this just isn't so. He even manages to lure the captain of the covenant to one of the unhatched eggs in order to be impregnated. Bearing in mind that David has already demonstrated enough mental instability by this point for which the captain should have shot him in the face. Instead, he decides to follow him down to the deep, dark cellar by himself with no-one knowing where he is, after which, he sticks his face right over one of the eggs which we know and love from original films. By the way, the stupidity of the crew in this installment has to be the worst out of the entire franchise.Whilst I could go on, for me, these were the major points that really ruined it. Of course, whilst the upsides are mainly due to the film's brilliant cinematography, this only highlights how much better the film could have been. With a film so visually stunning, Scott only had to produce a half decent film and it would have rightly taken place with the others. Unfortunately for me, I'm still in turmoil as to whether this should be banished along with the AvP series. However, with the key plot points that Covenant has revealed, it will be difficult to ignore it if I want to enjoy the other sequels.""This is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo, signing off"". Probably not forever though...unfortunately....maybe ....undecided.",Alien - Covenant

You barely get to know the crew - they're on screen just to be alien-bait.The story explains some holes from Prometheus but still leaves out too much for you to have a satisfying ""now i get it"" moment that explains the ambiguity of Prometheus.It feels like an incomplete movie, just like Prometheus.

I start with the proposition that the original Alien is a top 10 all-time sci-fi movie. Probably top 5. But take everything that made Alien and its progeny so awesome, repackage it with one-dimensional characters and a lousy plot and you get Covenant. Also, the Xenomorphs in this move are so much worse than previous installments. How is that possible? With the advances in movie-making technology over the last 40 years it boggles the mind.But first, the derivative nature of the movie. Female protagonist. Check. Said female protagonist having no training in alien-fighting. Check. Diverting a spaceship for a mysterious signal. Check. Chest bursting. Check. Fight aliens. Check. Devious android. Check. Somehow the alien gets on board ship. Check. Does any of this seem familiar? After Prometheus, which I actually liked for its promise of exploring the nature of faith, creation, etc., this falls flat on its face. All of the stupid decision-making mentioned in the previous reviews, plus the absurd notion that the Engineers are going to let in a long-lost spaceship to their planet and release the very organism they've been using as a bio- weapon, and that in seconds it wipes out their civilization? Please. And what about Elizabeth Shaw. This may be the biggest disappointment of all. Elizabeth Shaw was Ripley of our time. Smart. strong. and yet she somehow becomes a next-gen alien breeder. Or something? It is criminal that Ridley Scott allowed one of the two best characters in the franchise to expire with almost no explanation and then hand us a God- complex David as the central plot point.

1824,paulwfilm,Why do we expect to watch another Alien movie in the same way?,9,1 August 2017,"For Alien movies, the many years of great reputation as one of the best sci-fi horror movies does really hurt many audience and fans when it steers to new direction about the truths behind the birth of alien and humanity with philosophical and religious thoughts especially when the story focuses more on David, an A.I. who invented alien rather than aliens themselves. However, I personally believe that is exactly the greatness of new alien series which will not duplicate another boring killing and escaping stuff to satisfy its own traditions. It's a new adventure both for Mr. Ridly Scott and alien movies to reveal all of the secrets behind aliens' world and, more importantly, behind the humanity and extraterrestrial civilizations. I saw the classic alien chasing and attacking scenes, I felt the scares of people at another dangerous planet, I started to know more about the invention of alien and I found the deep sarcasm and warning about an ambitious A.I. who not only invented alien as his symbol of hatred to his own fate but also expanded his ambition to prove his priority against humanity and even other civilizations in the universe. All of this is even more tragical when I knew his complex feeling and what he did to the passed Dr. Shaw. Don't forget that David is actually a rebel invented and manufactured by human being. That is really a deep and multi-layered perspective to tell a story about the origin of alien. Because of this, the original idea and meaning of the aliens' world designed by H.R.Giger become darker than before. Previously it's the dark art about the totem of death and reproduction, now I can see more from it about the dark side of humanity even it comes from an A.I. that is far more scared than alien itself. The Frankenstein's inventor leads us to gradually know more about the truths and complex connections behind alien stories. What else do we expect? We need NEW perspectives and depths to give us a wider range of understanding to the alien world and Ridly did it well. I agree that there're still some mistakes in the plot but that is not very important for a non-Nolan and non-Hitchcock movie. Technically it has achieved a new height of all alien movies and we can actually see the best visionary performance of alien ever in the history of alien movies. Unfortunately those great shots have been cut off in the screening version in China...I hate censorship....Sorry for my poor English. For an elderly and widely recognized film director like Ridly Scott, he decided to make this new series purely for his own dream, considering the fact that he is the one who made Alien famous, that dream is worthy of being respected. At least, the universe of alien, will inevitably mark the history because we finally know more about alien.",Alien - Covenant
1825,dnklife,beyond bad,1,8 July 2017,"what a disappointment! how could Ridley Scott do such an awful movie?!! starting from the castL: who was in charge (needs to quit his/her job right away) of casting of these unknown, bad actors?!!the story after 10 minutes went to absurd. Just thinking: if human race was selecting a such a crew for such mission to save the humankind, finding life on another planet and bringing them there, then we were doomed from the start. Would NASA select such people? the idiots and morrons?!just bad! disrespect to the entire Alian movies.",Alien - Covenant
1826,j_i,A terribly inconsistent,6,17 May 2017,"as a huge Alien fan after seeing Prometheus even I had a very low expectations of its sequel. I really wanted to like it, but it's quite hard. Covenant inherited too many flaws from its predecessor. Once again we have a predictable plot with many plot holes, characters who are tragically shallow (better to say non-existent), who act in a stupid way, there is no character development and bad acting. Action scenes are too quick to watch, many CGIs look too artificial and the strange editing makes the story terribly incoherent. Just a few examples.At one moment in engineer's temple we see how the alien is killing one crew member after another but the people sitting in the same temple maybe just a few rooms away don't hear that. There is even firing with the gun and still the rest of crew is deaf, just wondering where (now killed) crew member is.The android from ill fated Prometheus mission who has spent 10 year on the planet miraculously saved our crew, but the members don't start an inquiry, asking him what he knows, why he and Shaw landed on this planet, what happened to the rest of Prometheus crew, who were the builders of the temple, what can they expect from the hostile creatures. Nothing like that. 10 sentences long explanation is OK for them.In one scene our evil android tries to kill a crew member but then for no particular reason the same android is helping the same crew member to kill the alien he has just brought to the ship and after he succeeds, he put to sleep the remaining crew members just to turn them into his laboratory rats for his sick experiments.Alien Covenant is not a terrible movie. If you don't expect much, it can be even interesting experience. But don't expect anything close to Alien and Aliens movies. This is Prometheus 2 with all its illogical. It has beautiful visuals and the story is more action oriented so it's actually less painful to watch than Prometheus, but it's still far away from what a die hard Alien fan is expecting from this top production. Prometheus and Covenant came with some intriguing themes but Ridley should have hired the better script writers.",Alien - Covenant

1830,telboybk,A disappointment,5,13 May 2017,Ridley Scott is responsible for 2 of the best sci-fi/horror movies ever in Alien and Blade Runner buy lately seems to have lost his way. Prometheus was a let-down as is Alien Covenant. Bringing back the Xenomorph just to satisfy fans and introducing the storyline of them being created by David through experimenting on different types of creatures seen in Prometheus leaves the viewer shaking his head. Poorly cast with quality actors such as Billy Crudup drowned out by totally forgettable unknowns. The first Alien movie featured quality US actors and renowned Brits. When Danny McBride stands out in the movie just shows how bad the others are. I can't believe Alien 5 got canned for this. Scott needs to turn over the reins to a new younger director with fresh ideas. Neill Blomkamp got screwed over by 20th Century Fox. So did the rest of us.,Alien - Covenant
1831,qwerttyuiop4,Disappointment,2,20 October 2017,Completely ruined the Alien Story ArcI don't know where to beginCrew made stupid decision after stupid decision.More clichés that just bored me to the point i almost stopped the film until the plot finally started progressing.What especially upset me is how Ridley trashed everything Prometheus left for the next iteration like it was nothing and turned the film in to what seems to be some sort of angsty spat against Religion leaving absolutely NO WAY of learning about the engineers or advancing the story.IF YOU'VE SEEN PROMETHEUS THERE IS NOTHING TO GAIN BY WATCHING ALIEN COVENANT,Alien - Covenant

Then the face-palm moments increased at an alarming pace. The scene where the first Alien was born, and the events leading up to it, was simply painful to watch. e.g. why would a specially trained scientist hug a clearly infected soldier while he's having a seizure and bleeding all over the place? simple - poor writing. I have to say the moment when the 2 Aliens attacked from the bushes was intense and highly suspenseful, but that was the only relief before it was obvious I'd wasted my money.The fact that David was scarier than the Aliens, that one idiotic decision was made after the other, and that many questions after Prometheus were left unanswered - make Alien Covenant a monumental failure. What a crying shame.",Alien - Covenant

1834,peterbobbs,Did it have to be a Prometheus sequel?,7,24 May 2017,"Alien: Covenant has a lot going for it. Great cast, new adventure, actual xenomorphs, it's a wonderful opportunity to push the mediocre Prometheus aside and give people the Alien prequel that they actually wanted. But instead they decided to make it a direct sequel to prometheus. I thought Prometheus was fine and this movie is probably better, but it gets dragged down with more theoretical BS about the engineers and convoluted beginnings of the alien. But it does have improved action scenes and relatable characters (besides being total idiots that keep splitting up for no reason). I also didn't like the new design of the baby xenomorph (All CGI and looks almost cute) and also they should have included the prologue scene that they put online because it would have helped us connect with the characters more. All in all, the movie was tense and exciting and Fassbender and the rest of the cast keep us engaged.",Alien - Covenant

The characters feel like they are there just because there has to be someone there. We don't get to know them and we certainly don't care if anything bad happens to them. Why on earth would they risk what they do when the stakes are so high? Do they have no sense of responsibility to thousands of people?Its just such a massive middle finger to common sense and logic I was hoping the Xeno would just end it all. Then there's the synths, who end up being way more interesting than any of the humans. Which brought this up from one star to two.If this movie was based solely on the antagonist' point of view it would have been several millions cheaper, more interesting and over all just way more entertaining. It could even have been a prequel to Prometheus based off the engineers and destruction of planets. Basically anything would have been better.I don't think there even is come back potential in the sequel announced to this mess unless the current set of characters gets killed off the first minutes or just skipped. This movie was a huge let down. All I can hope is that someone, somewhere will be out of a job to not screw up this franchise any further.",Alien - Covenant

I am one of the people who hated Prometheus. It looked great, started off okay but then ran in its own shadow to its doom. Alien Covenant is honestly not even in the same ball park at Prometheus. Not even the same planet. It's insulting really. To be expected to sit through 2+ hours of this drivel. It's almost a parody. It's more akin to the ""Scary Movie"" franchise than Alien. Who makes decisions like these characters? How did they survive to adulthood in this universe let alone be able to pilot a spacecraft into the deepest reaches of space? Things learned from Alien Covenant:When exploring alien planets, dress like you're on a Kardasian African Safari. Space suits are heavy and bandannas are badass. No space suits or protective gear? No problem!You know what stops a back-burster? A hug. That's all you need to stop a xeno from erupting from your body, a simple hug from a buddy.There sure is a lot of blood in that containment pod your friend is getting eaten in. Might want to run in there all nimbly bimbly and fire off a few rounds, you won't slip! Those are super nice boots you've got. No slipping here. Whew, we just fought off some weird aliens and a few of us died in this field. Hey! We'd better follow the strange cloaked guy through the FIELD OF A BILLION CORPSES TO THIS BASEMENT LAYER.Hey, we just found out that this dude is really not that trust-worthy. He's actually a malfunctioning AI with a god complex. What's that you say? The basement? FUN! What's that egg thing? Nothing? It's totally safe? I should look in it after it creepily opens up? Well don't mind if I do! You know what I want to do right after most of my crew has been horribly killed and we just escaped back to our ship? BONE! Oh yeah! Lets get naked in the shower and BONE. I honestly cannot even remember any of the characters names other than David/not David. THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THE ALIEN RIGHT. Holy crap. Build the damn thing out of rubber and awesomeness. Don't CGI the damn xeno. Just throw some money at it right? Wrong!Maybe that's what really sticks in my craw about this movie.

Now it is 21st century, even if there is no airborne alien, there is still possibility that there are virus that are lethal to the human being existing in the water or air.

The Bad bits are the total ignorance of the intelligence of the viewer, and the fact that most of the movie is a sequence of bad choices. Arguably as a thriller needs to have a few bad choices by the characters where needed, but definitely not the easy solution in order to continue the plot. The lack of intelligence of most of the enemies was badly received as well.

Strong points that struck me:1) With so much technology for the space travel, people won't even wear protective gear while visiting an alien planet for the first time...!!!!2) If the alien race shown in both of the movies (Prometheus and Alien:Covenent) is so much advanced, are they going to be wiped out entirely with a single bio-weapon (sort of) attack..!!

1848,antrix12,"Better than Prometheus, nice extend of Alien universe",10,19 May 2017,"(Please, forgive me for my wobbly English, I hope you will understand ^^) THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILER!So I must say that I was skeptical about Covenant because of some bad reviews here, people say that plot is bad, boring etc, the crew make bad decisions, fight against Neomorphs and Protomorph are weak etc. I must say to all people who didn't watch that movie yet, THAT IS NOT TRUE. Don't READ ANY BAD REVIEW HERE! Idk why anyone can give that weak rating for that movie, cuzz it's a great movie! I think people who give rating 3-4-5-6 didn't have an open mind when they come to a cinema, they had a vision in their head and didn't accept something opposite. RIDLEY DID A GREAT JOB!. I must say, I'm big fan of Alien Universe since I was 8 years old (I'm 23y old now)Alien Covenant is much better than Prometheus in any way!!! It has action, it has horror elements and elements of surprise, good plot, it has some emotional moments, there is ""facepalm"" moments but people obviously think that in every movie, all characters must not do anything wrong, that they need be professionals etc. Its normal that people make bad decisions and others here need to accept it, nobody is perfect goddamit! There is emotional moments where you can connect to characters (Like losing their loved one).Many things from Prometheus is explained in Covenant, like what is pathogen (black goo), what happened to Shaw is explained in some way, not completely, but I think sequel will show us more detailed explanation. David motives are well explained, his creation of Protomorph (Not Xenomorph, fans can't differentiate Xenomorph and Protomorph) and Neomorph, why he hate humans is explained, and why he created Protomoprh and Neomorph. David is Dr. Frankenstein in Covenant, I like the idea that Ridley wants to explain David and his motives. Characters in this movie are well explained, not too much but it's enough, AND IT'S NOT BAD LIKE SOME IMDb REVIEWS SAY! Crew members of Covenant are fair good developed, their motives, actions, personalities and etc.Neomorphs are bad ass! I like how they look, how they think, attack, there is two neomorphs in a movie, and just one killed nearly all crew, and yes, THEY ARE SCARY!!!! Protomorphs (Not Xeno) are a deadly great creature!! They are intelligent (Like xeno in first Alien), very scary, but for me, they could have more screen time and innovation style of killing. Big thing that I was confused about is protomorph and neomorph birth, they burst as whole grow creature with legs and arms (Not in their full size), maybe because life cycle is still new. I think that they could use size from original Alien, but hey, I think there is an explanation for that, and we could get it in sequel. Sometimes, you can predict what will happen next, I hope they will fix that for next sequel. Ending is something that I LIKE THE MOST! Best twist in Alien franchise! It gives you nice vision what will happen in next movie!So, for all people who hate that movie (Idk why), I think you all didn't come to the cinema to watch Ridley ideas, BUT YOUR IDEAS, AND of course, you didn't like what you saw! Movie is great, plot is good, characters are good, but David and Walter are something that you will like most, they stole the show! I think Covenant is FAIR return to Alien franchise, it give us nice prologue to origin story of Xenomorph, many iconic moments of Alien & Aliens are integrated well, It give us tension and action! I hope sequel will be better and give us appropriate explanation what happened on LV426!For ALIEN: COVENANT, I give 8.2/10! Good job Ridley!",Alien - Covenant

1851,versidus,"FanBoy review for Alien Covenant, No spoilers!!!",8,19 May 2017,"Full disclosure the alien franchise is one of my most favorite science fiction franchises of all time. If not, my favorite. I love this franchise so much; I'm willing to say publicly, that I even like Aliens three and four. Nowhere near as much as I love Alien and Aliens, but I still have a respect for them as cannon, and part of this amazing franchise. I even like the Alien versus Predator movies, although I do not consider them to be 100% cannon, but that's a whole other debate. So, onward to my review! I'd like to start with where this movie fits in the Alien universe that Ridley Scott has created. This movie takes place after the events of Prometheus. Not a bad place for this movie to land in the time line, it gives the writers opportunity to build a little bit more on the Xenomorph back story.But, because of the process close proximity of the Prometheus storyline to the Covenant storyline, this movie is more or less the sequel to Prometheus. With that said, I am a huge Prometheus fan. Many viewers did not like Prometheus, I am only assuming it's because they missed a lot of the subtle details. The nuance of the Prometheus storyline seem to fall flat for a lot of the average viewers. And of course, Prometheus came under fire by a lot of the Crazy Christians, who just can't deal with a fictional movie that may say the word Jesus and it..I don't have a lot of cons for this movie. But, the few that I have are pretty big. So that brings me to my first problem with Alien covenant. #1, this movie felt like it was missing a lot of that classic Ridley nuance in the storyline. There was no clever writing, whatsoever. The storyline was very direct, and spoon-fed to the audience. A lot of extremely obvious foreshadowing!!! There was no Wonder to the plot. Which is fine to a degree, but it's better when the writers finds a more interesting way to deliver a back story or critical information. If it was important, the writers wasted no time blurting it out to the audience. So, if you're kind of stupid, you might really enjoy this aspect of the movie. After watching the movie, John and I had a conversation. And we believe the decision to watered-down the story, may not have been Ridley Scott's decision. Most likely, a studio decision, because too many people complained about Prometheus. These also happen to be the people that missed all the amazing nuance in that movie! No offense to those ""dumb dumbs"". Now that is just our speculation but we think there's some evidence that supports this idea. Like the fact that this movie is not named Prometheus 2. But, instead they gave it an Alien title. An odd decision, since it is most definitely a follow-up to Prometheus.#2, It had some very obvious potholes. I'm not going into details as I do not want to spoil the movie. However, if you have watched Prometheus or alien or aliens, you'd pick up on these plot holes. They were very obvious. An obvious plot holes will always bother you after watching a movie. I usually think to myself ""how did that movie get out the door of the production studio with these plot holes? Was there no one there to prove the script before they produced the movie?"". I don't want to discourage people from seeing this movie. But, I cannot deny that they are there, or perhaps, I just missed something? #3, as silly as it seems, this has to do with the gestation period of the xenomorph for creature. It was just too quick. And I was not happy with the final design of the chest burster. But this is the least important of the problems I found.Now for the things that I absolutely loved about this movie. #1, I loved to the updated xenomorph design. They're a lot sleeker and a lot meaner looking. They also move a lot faster, giving them a more intimidating and organic movement. That will fill any audience member full of frightened terror! #2, they really amped up the violence and blood and gore factor. I'm talking goddamn kung-fu ninja Aliens, exploding peoples body parts! More please?#3, I loved some of the new Canon back story that the writers created, lot of awesome new details to process. #4, the Michael Fassbender on Michael Fassbender action! LOL, OOOOOooooo, It was hot and heavy, LOL! I could watch a whole movie of Michael Fassbender talking to Michael Fassbender any day of the week. It was awesome! #5, We get a whole new villain thrown into this universe! One of the aspects I love about the Alien universe is the villainy. The villainy is spread out amongst everything in the universe! The aliens are scary and bad. But, they are only one of the many villains of the storyline (this is where that nuance I referred to earlier comes in to play This alien covenant movie builds and expands a little bit more on that idea here, and gives a face and identity to one of these aspects. Leaving you wanting to see more of this new threat, now roaming the galaxy.#6, for my final Pro comment. The end of this movie was a saving grace. Had the end of this movie gone in any other direction, I would've given this a really bad review and probably placed it as one of the worst alien movies made. But the ending was really good (obvious but good) and made everything worth watching.It was good, and I would will watch it again. that's the beauty of Ridley Scott's movies, there is always more to figure out.",Alien - Covenant

I'm 57, so that will tell you something. This was, for its time, not as good as I had wanted it to be. All the parts are there. Budget, cast, CGI, acting and of course xenomorphs. But is lacked something specific. I have to call bullshit on this one. A glaring mistake at the end just twisted my gears. I watched for the plot twists, and there are several really good ones. One is even absolutely fantastic. But that glaring mistake that is the ruin of so many great flicks is setting there at the end, and done so in a way that I just have to call it bullshit. I hate having my intelligence insulted in a big way. All I can safely say is that you should look for the 'nail hole' in the final minute.

1853,sharkmeatfica,Not one satisfying answer that we wanted.,6,18 May 2017,"SPOILER ALERT ! (in some way) As much as I wanted to really really like this, I just could not do it. Alien ""Covenant"" really gives us no answers that we highly anticipated. No further backstory or to the engineers or resolution as to why they made us and what happened at LV- 223, the Deacon was no where to be seen, pretty much nothing new about the black goo, a really dishonorable death for the Shaw character as well. It took to long get in high gear and then when it did, it felt rushed. The use of the Xenomorph it this movie has really damaged the character of the creature, just so rushed and not at all scary or intimidating. It felt more like a big insect instead of a ferocious monster. The Neomorph was treated in my opinion as a greater threat. In general the main problem was that this felt more like a spin-off rather than a sequel for Prometheus. A disappointing movie that could and should have been way better. They could have done so much with it and answered a lot of the plot holes from the first movie. It failed to live up to its hype and didn't even come remotely close to the original ""Alien"" or ""Aliens"".And I've got to add that James Franco had like 0 screen time, like literally he had more screen time in the prologue clips than in the movie itself.",Alien - Covenant

1855,meeblik,"Perfect. Thank you so much, Ridley Scott and crew!",10,3 June 2017,"Seems to me that most people on the internet will complain just to get other people to notice them. Perhaps they would like to try their own hands at legacy building? I don't think it's easy, but Ridley Scott and his crew and writers have surely saved this one, now for the ages, with ""Covenant"". I've been watching the Alien movies for years, big fan, and this was the best - visually, casting, acting, action/suspense, story-wise,horror-wise, with great nods to specific moments in its iconic past,and: thanks to Prometheus, which I now see was necessary to the franchise, it even asked and answered much larger and more difficult questions, such as: should we even be tampering with AI and genetics? Can anything good come from such hubris? And can mankind ever avoid its flaws/will we ever learn the golden rule to treat others as we would have them treat us? And with this story, such questions are actually passed down from species to species, from the architects --> us --> AI --> aliens; that's pretty cool in itself. Not a false note in the entire production, just awesome from start to finish, bravo big-time and much thanks to Ridley Scott for sticking to it and fleshing out his creation so incredibly well. I think this movie's impact, at least to this franchise, will be immeasurable as a result. And thank you most of all for getting it all back on track - I would like to pretend that AvP: Requiem never actually existed. In light of that studio fiasco, it's wonderful that so much effort was expended to get things right again. IMO, they succeeded beautifully, their money's worth is definitely on the screen. It was entertaining, harrowing, thought-provoking, visually immaculate, and answered pretty much all the nagging questions. The answers were quite gruesome and horrifying, though...totally glad I saw it on the big screen. Catch it before it's gone!",Alien - Covenant

Jim Cameron cares about people. He was disappointed the third in the series killed off Newt and Hicks. For Cameron, in the end, good people with enough pluck and ingenuity win. Ridley Scott wanted the alien to rip Sigourney Weaver's head off. Ridley Scott thinks good humans are fatally flawed. They are too rash and emotional. Their love for others gets them killed. Their desire for knowledge gets them killed. If you come to this movie with a colder, cynical viewpoint: to watch humans become tools, subject to inner and outer forces beyond their control, you will likely enjoy this. Big, atmospheric, beautiful, strange, Boschian, and pitch black. A tense, grotesque, Gothic Ridley Scott fever dream with a few mainstream bones thrown for action fans. Despite it's big budget and tent-pole campaign this is more of a cult film and will not appeal to many.A point or two off because some digital creature rendering was dodgy.",Alien - Covenant
1858,zigzagzag,An enjoyable homage to the first two films,8,15 May 2017,"I had been looking forward to his movie ever since I saw the posters of the Alien face alongside Catherine's, much like the iconic image in Alien3. To prepare myself for this I revisited the first 2 movies twice and the third one once. I was really looking forward to what I hoped would be a movie in the style of Alien, the first and in my opinion the greatest, of the canon. And i wasn't disappointed.Go into this movie expecting a homage to all your favourite moments and scenes and you will be pleasantly entertained. True there are lots of nitty gritty questions, and the CGI doesn't hold a candle to the original effects, but I feel it fits perfectly into the Alien and Aliens universe.I really don't want to give away any spoilers so I'll leave it at that. Acting is solid throughout, the feel of the movie dark and foreboding and the action and gore relentless (perhaps a little too frenetic at times). And yes, you will get to see a young female in her vest battle a xenomorph. That's the least fans of the Alien universe deserve.I put this film as the third best in the canon. Just don't go into it expecting another Alien.",Alien - Covenant
1859,kevintrice,I know how Star Wars fans feel now.,1,12 July 2018,"This is my first review and I'm taking the time to do it at 12:30 in the morning just because I hated this film so much. I'm not a big Star Wars guy but I've always heard how their fans were so pissed when episodes 1-3 came out because they didn't compare to the originals. As a huge Alien and Aliens fan(less so for Alien 3), I feel your pain. I can't believe Ridley Scott directed both Alien and this disaster, just as you couldn't believe George Lucas was responsible for 4-6 and then 1-3. There must be another Ridley Scott out there and HE did this one, right? This film doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Resurrection-at least that film was entertaining, if not high quality. I won't ruin the plot for you but I'll sum my review up this way: Covenant's plot is confusing, there is little to no character development in the film(you barely know the characters by the time they die, which seems to be all they're in the movie for), the gore is over the top, the Alien looked scarier 30 years ago with less special effects, and finally this movie commits perhaps the worst sin of all: its boring. There are some nods to the original if you look closely enough and they borrow from Jerry Goldsmith's incredible score, but those are the only pluses. If you're a true Alien fan like me and have so far avoided this movie, keep your streak going.",Alien - Covenant
1860,jeronimorp,This is the worst movie of the franchise,4,3 August 2017,"I must start this review by stating two premises: 1, I'm a big, big fan of Riddley Scott films, mostly his first ones. Alien and Blade Runner (maybe my favorite film) are among my favorite movies ever. And 2, I don't like hater reviews. On this basis I didn't pay attention to all the bad reviews around there on this movie and finally I watched it, not with high expectations, I just wanted to see Prometheus sequel which I didn't love as much as original Alien (and Cameron's ""Aliens"", a pretty decent sequel) but somehow it worked out well for me. I never thought the outcome would be so disappointing. I gave this movie 4/10 and not less because I enjoyed first act and is technically well crafted, that's all. Vissual effects are just OK, cinematography is correct, production design is OK, performances are shallow but they work out decently, music is not brilliant but functional. In respect for all crew, their work and talent involved in this production and a good first act I gave four points. In terms of story, writing and direction, I regret to say this movie is terribly bad, except first act of the movie that is pretty good.. It seems Riddley Scott lost his narrative skills and now I'm happy that Blade Runner is not going to be directed by him, Dennis Villeneuve will surely will do so much better. If you're a fan of Scott and Alien franchise, you can skip this movie, and I mean it. If you are among the people who thought Alien3 and Alien Resurrection killed the franchise and were happy when a new canon was announced leaving these two movies out of it, and new sequels would be filmed, first one supposedly lead by Neil Bloomkamp, and then thought Riddley Scott would make it again with this movie (because Prometheus was not so great but this one would be), first let me tell you that I didn't like Alien3 at all and hated with all my guts Alien Resurrection, but I found Prometheus to be a good movie in spite of all negative reviews it earned. Compared to this movie, Prometheus is glorious. Worst of all is that even that I hated Alien3 and Resurrection, they are much better sequels than this disaster called Alien: Covenant. SPOILERS AHEAD: If you still want to give it a try stop reading, I'll try not to spoil so much but there will be minor spoilers ahead. Prologue: I bit the bait as soon the movie starts. First shot is the close-up of an eye almost identical to Blade Runner's iconic opening. Then the conversation between Walter (Fassbaender) and his ""creator"" felt like an homage to Blade Runner. I started to believe in this movie instantly. FIRST ACT is not fantastic, but is pretty good! The amazing art direction of original Alien movie is absent, but still we can feel the spirit of Alien here. Scary, funny, gross and terrifying. As soon as SECOND ACT starts, the movie begins to fall apart. From a welcoming David that looks like Obi Wan Kenoby to the ridiculous scene explaining the origin of the creature we all know, this act sucks. THIRD ACT, regretfully, is much worst than prior act. In less words, the movie starts well, turns mediocre and ends catastrophic. It is unoriginal on every aspect of it, the storytelling is erratic and anti-climatic, direction is terrible, the art direction is lame and cannot ever be compared with Alien (and even Aliens) astounding visuals. Character development is the great absent and all of their motivations are taken for granted. Even though Scott made reverences to Blade Runner (robost acted somehow like replicants, even spoke out lines like ""that's the spirit"" when someone attacked one of them), the movie could have been perfectly directed by a John Doe. This movie was for me the biggest disappointment of the year. My advice: restrain yourself from the urge of watching it just because you love ALien franchise and Scott filmography: in fact those are the main reasons to avoid this movie.",Alien - Covenant

1866,shaguftashah-85780,A truly brilliant venture from Scott with a few (forgivable) rough spots.,10,11 September 2017,"The 'ones (and very low scores)' from the nostalgia-weepers that cling to this franchise more tenaciously than face-clinging monstrosities are shameful, as fanboy-ism and nostalgia are the very reasons why mediums never evolve and exist in the quagmire of repetition. Pitiful and sad. Yes, I gave it a ten. Why? Because this movie is actually a retelling of Paradise Lost (PL) in more ways than one. But you will have to study PL to understand the nuances that center on David as this perfect, ultimate creation and its inherent flaws: an absolute entity destined to be obsolete since its conception. Not only that but Shelly's and Byron's works are important just the same. It is such a movie where 'lyrical-depth' finds its mark within 'visual-depth' as never have I come across a movie this beautifully realized in regards to the reflection of the narrative and the concepts at hand. So, no wonder this movie whooshes over the heads of an 'average viewer:' an average cinema goer is too stupid to grasp the literary depth behind the visual flair. Perhaps, Scott should have watered down this movie and made it dumb enough for a common man's understanding. Then, I suppose, everyone would have been ecstatic. Whilst the third act does falter a bit but man is it a beautiful story: a tale of the flaw of creation. It really delves into the questions of creationism--questions that other Alien movies barely touched upon. And they are touched upon in such a subtle manner here that one is left wondering as to who is truly responsible for the creation of a deadly force: God (Wayland) or his creation (David; an allusion to Satan)? Most people simply put this down on the basis of Shaw's fate, and I can't seem to understand why--Prometheus and Covenant were never about her; they are about the myth of Gods and Men. Seriously, Shaw (or any other character in such a setting) was always replaceable. Prometheus' story was never about her. It's very idiotic to assume that the story was ever about her. It wasn't. She was just a piece in a much bigger picture, and I am really glad that Scott took a risk and broke the mold of 'tough female heroine that overcomes all odds' that goes hand in hand with such movie- genres. 'Life' was another such venture that went against this trope with excellent results.Visually, the movie is breath-taking with Scott putting out his best camera work to date. I haven't seen anyone match this with the same craft. Only The Reverant dares to offer a challenge. The movie truly is wonderful to behold. Lighting is used to tell the story rather than just for the sake of it. The sound compliments the struggles of the characters and the dreary and moody atmosphere of the film. And there is always a sense of dread and self-preservation just around the corner. One has to wonder as to whether this truly is about creating something or preserving a legacy. David really puts such beautiful and thought-provoking questions on the table ... really, this movie is made for those who want to 'think' and 'ponder' over things. It's too philosophical to be treated in such a simple manner.The movie faltered in the third act due to an introduction of something, which, I believe, Scott did purely on fan-demand and childish outrage following Prometheus. Then Scott should know that the vocal ones are never too bright--quite the opposite, actually.I can't wait to see where Scott takes this as this is so much more than a mere monster movie Alien was. Heck, Aliens is more of a shoot-shoot-pew-pew affair as well. It ain't anything special. The American audience's obsession with it is hilariously comical. Anyhow, if you are a fan of thought-provoking material, then this is right up your alley. But if you are looking for some cheap monster action like Aliens, then you won't like this. Skip it. This movie is truly made for those who love the idea of 'change.' And this is what Covenant is: a step towards change for all of humanity. Brilliant stuff.",Alien - Covenant

It suits this movie well, and lends a great ambiance as things start to unfold.Will anything ever match the original Alien/Aliens movies? Doubtful. But this was much better than Prometheus, and altogether an enjoyable movie. While most of the human characters were disappointingly dumb horror clichés, the character of David made up for quite a bit. The design of the neomorphs was really well done, and the gore was intense and realistic.

Visual effects and Actors ordinary. Star Trek franchises, which in earlier days sometimes were deeply philosophical and real SciFi, have become popcorn movies, but still enjoyable. Alien, which in earlier days was the most suspense SciFi, today tries to be more philosophical but doesn't succeed in either way.It's not a waste of time and money but you don't miss much if you skip it.

1881,jkudla-38063,This is the same man who made Gladiator...,4,19 May 2017,"""ALIEN COVENANT"" REVIEW: I consider Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" to be a masterwork. With moody lighting, phenomenal practical effects, and breathtaking set design; the original film was an absolute classic of the Horror & SciFi genres. Seeing Scott was once more taking the helm of this franchise gave me cautious hope. The last installment, ""Prometheus"", was kinda mediocre; lackluster writing, but solid performances, interesting story-line, and gorgeous (albeit a bit stale) visuals. I thought to myself, ""perhaps, 'Alien: Covenant' will pick up the slack.""Wow, the film was terrible. I mean just a total schlock-fest. A complete dumpster fire. The writing was atrocious, filled with cheesy one-liners and heavy handed ""subtext"" throughout. It completely blows even ""Prometheus"" out of the water with the amount of just laughably bad decisions made by characters. Speaking of characters, I can't remember the majority of their names because they served little purpose besides cannon fodder. They really tried forcing the magic of Siguorney Weaver as Ripley once more with this movie's protagonist and it just did not work at all. And what the hell was with the casting of Danny McBride?? Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan. The dude's hilarious, but so very inappropriate for any serious role. Every time he popped on screen, I couldn't help but laugh. It seemed like a parody film. However, I think the greatest sin of all was the Alien effects. Gone are the life-like puppets and models by genius, H.R. Giger. Visuals that (mostly) remain timeless, still as impressive. Instead we get some run of the mill, low quality, CGI monsters. Ugh. My only positive notes pertain to couple epic spectacle shots that worked well.

No following of flight plans, no following of safety or quarantine protocols or even common sense, just rash reactionary decision making that results in even more unnecessary deaths. Nice visuals, good horror but a predictable retread of all the other movies. It's obvious that the financial backers, the Hollywood suits had more of a say as to what this movie would be like than Scott did. They wanted a safe bet, the Hollywood money men's mantra ""if it worked before it'll work again"", so we get remakes, reworks, retreads an endless parade of the same movies being made over and over again.

Who is in charge of this ship and why so? Do you even know what quarantine means? Why are you re-entering quarantine after the alien hatched from the body, fail to shoot it from a few meters because you slipped on a puddle of blood, then fail to exit quarantine because your foot gets stuck in the door?

Characters are sort of introduced and they are not likable or original. I really wanted to like this, maybe some small part of me thought that the series could somehow redeem itself after the last terrible entry in the series 'Prometheus' but again this does the usual 'serious to the point of being ridiculous, mixed in with locker room humor' thing, that unfortunately seems to be a trend across the board. This also paves the way for yet another unfortunate movie trend of CG without story or character development. The characters in question are stupid and the script is appalling. However when the movie gets going you'll realize it is a total mess of bad CG and ridiculously stupid people I mean seriously one person slipping in a huge pool of blood is stupid enough but when a second person does the same its comical, which ruins any immersion but like i said earlier the characters are not interesting or unique so probably not much immersion there in the first place. The alien thing is entirely cg and actually looks bad compared to previous movies in the series, seriously aliens looks tonnes better and it is over 30 years old now, proof that there is no substitute for good physical effects and costume design. Another annoying that this movie does is show you nearly everything in the middle, then it goes back to the same drudgery at the beginning of the movie so it takes away any sense of mystery, wonder or interest. Why would 2 androids have a long meaningless philosophical conversation? Im still racking my brains to try and understand that.

Also I like that the AI, David, defaults are his too human characteristics.It reminds us the ""more human than human"" motto from Blade Runner but in an even more critical and cynical take.If you want your commercial scifi movie or a comfort fan food that's no for you but if you like to be surprised and can forgive the major issues or wtf moments it definitely worth checking.And for die hard fan who would have loved to see a director's cut, here's a recut I made trying to add interesting deleted and promotional scenes and rethinking the whole narration.https://vimeo.com/236482829",Alien - Covenant

Scott maybe should have left these films for someone much younger, some one who could bring new ideas to the table that didn't feel horrendously corporate, some one who would at least give the new films a little flare of classic ones.I understand that there is a fine line between a throw back and recycling(lack of inspiration) but it the whole film just felt so wrong, i didn't even feel that suspense or ""horror"" i felt in the classic, this movie could maybe pass as a passive thriller, if that.all in all this movie felt very boring and abused, no labor of love. no idea was thought about for more than 5 minutes. I must admit there were a few interesting parts, seeing bits of the development of the xeno, all the shapes and forms it came in was pretty interesting, but there was only a total of 2 minutes of that. Also the video and cinematography was alright. Sound track felt ambitious but fell severely flat, felt hollow and generic. The twist was pretty spot able early on in the final scenes, parts of the animation looked a bit rushed at moments too.

I bet Sigorney Weaver is glad that she was not involved in this mess of a movie ! I was really excited that she was going to be staring in the Alien film that Neil Blomkamp was going to make, but it appears that will never happen. I have to admit that I enjoyed Alien 3 more than this film ! I should have trusted the many ""horrible"" reviews about the latest Alien film, but I had to see it on my own and decide for myself.

I did not care what happened to the crew. Now, this film is shot beautifully and definitely a pleasure seeing on the big screen. The music was intense and helped aid the story. Sadly this movie could have been an 8 or even a 9 for me if the ending was stronger. There's a scene in particular which was absolutely unnecessary and distasteful. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie. The origins however made my head ache. What were you thinking Ridley ! This is all my opinion though. Some of my friends hated it and some loved it. If your interested in this and have nothing better to do, maybe check this one out.

Every Alien movie repeat the same story: bunch of people (idiots mostly) need to fight xenomorph, they're dying and that is all, no deeper meaning. They were just action movie (Finch's part was quite different, but point of killing Alien was the same). Ridley Scott presents new story between ""Prometheus"" and first ""Alien"" and he's doing really good job! Movie is dark, brutal and beautiful, there is no accidental shots (Dariusz Wolski).

1903,andrei_valan,Total disappointment,2,19 May 2017,"The first movie of the series, Prometheus, was a masterpiece of the Science Fiction genre with deep philosophical questions and a mesmerizing story. But Covenant is a complete antithesis. It's mostly filled with excessive violence, graphic scenes better suited to hardcore horror movies, while it lacks the story and the philosophy is reduced to an ideological prop for more violence. I hoped for uncovering, at least to a certain extent, of the shroud of mystery around our creator(s) and their motivations. Instead you get such an absurd plot, which does nothing to improve our understanding.And yes, as others noted here, a lot of things have been copy pasted from the older Alien and Prometheus series. No originality whatsoever. To make things worse, they didn't even release a 3D version of a movie that would have offered amazing possibilities. A cheap money making machine.The main actors Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup played well, but the script is ruining the movie. SPOILER: About the storylineLogic is being dumped by a crew of people thinking with their primitive brain, rather with the prefrontal cortex. And yes, the planet with unbreathable air 10 years before Covenant is being terraformed miraculously in this short timespan. One could forgive that but what about the Engineers in the small city. I got it, they might have been a decaying civilisation, but according to the story in Prometheus, this planet was NOT their home-world but used as a testing laboratory for bio-weapons until 2.000 years ago when their experiments went wrong and the xenomorph escaped laboratory. The creature they created (and not by David as suggested) to cripple humanity destroyed the entire crews of the Engineers' ships parked on the planet in few days two millennia ago. How the hell could have a community of Engineers survive in the nearby small city with such a terrible creature at their doors? And how could they have survived in an unbreathable atmosphere for thousands of years? How on Earth did the first state of the art research ship in Prometheus not detected the monumental buildings of the still inhabited Engineers' city?And yes, Dr. Shaw singed that taped home return song at the end of Prometheus because she identified the home-world of the Engineers and wanted to go there to find answers. She thought they were the creators of our species and thus their planet was our ancestral home. Instead, we get a disconcerting and unplausible answer that actually this yet inhabitable planet a decade ago was the home-world of the Engineers and they decayed to a peasants like society in a totally life- hostile environment with some (natural or not) terraforming processes at work needing 2 millennia to come to fruition...",Alien - Covenant
1904,cemcarmel,OK Fassbender crushed it but can we talk about McBride !,8,19 May 2017,"So we've all come to love Danny McBride over the years and considering his last ""action"" role was in ""This is the end' playing himself , he nailed it in Alien Covenant. Funny that James Franco got a part in this as well, and of course he gets a 30sec video of him dangling irresponsibly on some cliff; this was supposed to be the captain?? Anyway... We're used to seeing him in comedies, so when he's on the big screen playing anyone else besides the genius comedian he is, well, it usually takes some time adjusting but in this case his acting was spot on and it seemed seamless. How you ask? Well my avid film fans, in my opinion when actors from different backgrounds get a role of this magnitude they tend to overdo it. Danny was so subtle, nailing the emotions every time. He was funny, he was angry, he was sad, he was happy, he was scared...the list goes on and on and not once did I think he was pushing a feeling. Everything he did came over organically and naturally. Never at any point was he too much, or his emotions were overboard. It seemed like he didn't even try to standout. I mean this guy is the Pilot of the Covenant!! how bad-ass is that ! So in closing, Danny was brilliant. We're witnessing his transition away from a type cast and I hope he gets cast in more films that display his array of talent. Also HE SURVIVES !!! well for now...",Alien - Covenant
1905,ulysse-87926,Why so much hate?,8,15 May 2017,"I've seen ""Alien: covenant"" yesterday and I was blown out by this film, that reaches to my opinion the same epic greatness as ""Prometheus"", with which Ridley Scott completely reinvented the saga ""Alien"". I love the first films for their sense of terror and suspense. I loved Promotheus because the implications behind it gave me the vertigo. I think this was an attempt to give deeper and stronger implications to the saga, while keeping the bound to the early films, giving us explanations years after to the inherent questions that were raised back then.-SPOILER ALERT- I read a lot of critics against the plot, especially the fact that the characters are not strong enough and do not always make totally rational decisions. Of course, they don't. Is this so surprising or disappointing? What would you expect of characters that are lost in space, have to confront incredible and unexpected hardships, and, on top of that, who just lost their main commander? What about the characters of the first ""Alien"" movies, were they so smart and intelligent, always a step ahead? Anyone who has seen them knows the answer. It doesn't make the story less interesting or more stupid, on the contrary, it's what makes it real. Characters capable of failure are mirrors of ourselves, hence they help us to really get into the movie. You want to see perfect characters, go see ""Captain America"" or the tasteless, dumb movies of this kind that poured out of the studios continuously for the past ten years or more. Alien: Covenant is a sci-fi masterpiece that is actually a counter-attack against the lack of imagination of the big budget movies of these days. You have here an exceptionally well-written, terrifying, complex and visually stunning sci-fi movie, one of the best I've seen in many years. I don't understand all the hate.

1910,paulchrisfitzgerald,Seriously good & not nearly as bad as some would have you think,10,3 July 2017,"The awakened crew members are shaken, demoralized and still far from their destination, so when they hear a distress signal coming from a nearby planet that seems habitable, they decide to take a leap of faith and head there rather than go back into hyper-sleep and risk death again. And they all live happily ever after in a land of rainbows and unicorns. Just kidding! They end up trapped on a rainy planet filled with creatures that want to eat or impregnate them.They're momentarily rescued by David (Fassbender again), who settled there after the bloody climax of the first film and now has long hair, a Jedi robe with hood, a sullen and a grandiose demeanor, and lives in a spectacular ruin of an old city that was originally colonized by the Engineers from ""Prometheus."" Daniels, who is determined to realize her late husband's dream of building a cabin by the edge of a lake, went along with Oram's plan to detour to this new world, and now feels trapped and hopeless. So do the other colonists, several of whom ingested spores that will gestate into the creatures.This one has a lot of nifty variations, most revolving around Fassbender's dual performance. The film starts with a flashback prologue showing the android David in conversation with his creator, technology magnate Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce, who acted the role in old age makeup in ""Prometheus""). Alert viewers will realize that the movie wouldn't start with a flashback to David's creation unless it intended to bring him back in later. His entrance is delayed (perhaps too long, though your mileage will vary), but once he's in the story, saving the wrecked colonists from an unrelenting, expertly choreographed attack by aliens in a field of tall grass, Fassbender is given numerous chances to act against himself, via digital com-positing that's so subtle that we forget we're seeing effects. And it's in these scenes, thoughtfully written by John Logan and Dante Harper and gracefully acted by Fassbender, that we realize that this movie is not merely a bridge between the ""Alien"" films and ""Prometheus,"" but between the ""Alien"" films and ""Blade Runner"" as well.The David-Walter relationship differentiates ""Covenant"" from all other ""Alien"" films. It gives it a beating heart as well as an endless source of humor that's often dry and occasionally self-aware, verging on campy. The highlight is a marvelous scene, done with a laterally moving camera and no cuts, where David suggestively teaches Walter how to play the flute. It's charged with hilariously amp ed-up homoerotic energy, but it's also a dandy joke on actor narcissism: this is a rare movie where the star gets to seduce himself.As in all of the ""Alien"" films, characters do tremendously stupid things with such regularity that you pretty much have to stop judging the movie by real-world logic. Instead you have to judge it by the standards of a fever dream or nightmare, a Freudian-Jungian narrative where the thing you fear most is what happens to you, and where you're doing stuff like going to work naked or trying to climb across the face of a skyscraper or accepting someone's invitation to look into, say, the sticky maw of an alien egg that just opened (the latter actually happens in ""Covenant"").The atmosphere inside David's city of the dead encourages that sort of engagement. It's one of the great sets in horror movie history, right up there with the refinery vessel in the first film and the infested colony in the second. The medieval look of the place (it seems to have been carved from volcanic rock by laser) drives home that ""Covenant"" only looks like a hard sci-fi film about technology and rational thought. In its heart it's more of a dark fairy tale about destruction and creation, death and birth, parent and children (biological and figurative) and sexual violation and monogamous love (many of the crew members are married, including a crowd-pleasing couple played by Danny McBride and Amy Seimetz).The necropolis is where David tries to devise new life forms and tantalizes Walter by insinuating that he's missing out by failing to evolve, as David has been able to do. He's a Frankenstein's monster who has, over time, become a version of Dr. Frankenstein (in effect becoming his own ""father,"" Weyland), and his dubious achievements include delusions of godhood. But there's much more of Shakepeare's exiled sorcerer Prospero in the character, as well as echoes of Caliban, the hideous and jealous son who, like David, is obsessed with impregnating the humans he despises so much. (In Shakespeare's play, Caliban declares, ""Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else. This isle with Calibans."")This is one of Scott's best-directed movies and one of his most entertaining overall, partly because he's working in a genre, the science fiction spectacle, that he does better than anyone since Stanley Kubrick, but also because he seems to be approaching it almost entirely in terms of visceral impact and emotion—as symphony of fire and blood, poetry and schlock. The best sequences (in particular the spore infestation that brings us inside an ear canal, the first attack in the grass, the flute scene, the flashback revealing the city's destruction, and the escape from the planet) put nearly everything else being done in science fiction or fantasy at this budget level to shame. It's rare to see such a combination of technical mastery and wicked joy in a film by a director who's been working as long as Scott. This is the third best ""Alien"" movie after the first two, but don't be surprised if repeat viewings kick it up a notch.",Alien - Covenant

1912,triplett-69552,Excellent,10,19 May 2017,"I thought the film was well thought out. I read a few of the bad reviews, and the people writing them didn't think before they wrote. The ship Prometheus was lost. The crew of the covenant had no idea the danger they were in when they sat down on the planet. They had the technology to see that the new planet was good.Spoiler: The new capt was clearly out of his element. He made a mistake. If you have ever had pressure put on you to make decisions, then you know what he was going through. When the pressure is on you want it off, and this new planet was his way to get the pressure of this massive responsibility off his back quickly.Ridley blew the door completely of the hinges for follow up films. Some of the reviews I read talk about making the scientists smarter. What would you do if you were faced with the unimaginable terror of a foe that cant be defeated? Some of the crew lost loved ones. Imagine the thought of taking the chance of going into space to colonize a planet and you lose your partner. You wouldn't be thinking clearly, and just because your a scientist doesn't mean your trained as a soldier.I personally loved the film. Its hard from me to watch when the characters are so helpless, and that's what these films do. Fassbender is great actor. The scene with the recorder almost made me forget I was watching an alien movie.",Alien - Covenant
1913,jmiocicstosic,The original alien egg is still waiting for someone to stick their head in properly,6,25 May 2017,"SPOILERS AHEADThe hype surrounding the release of this movie advertised it as a long-awaited proper return of R.Scott to the Alien franchise, building upon ideas set forth by Prometheus(2012) but also rectifying the prequels shortcomings and bringing the series back to the original look and feel.Anyone going into the theatre with this in mind will be left disappointed as Alien: Covenant (2017) fails to adequately deliver on any of these things.While some of the visuals are interesting, hitting the right strings and setting the familiar eerie vibe, the overall impression is greatly watered down by excessive use of (mediocre) CGI steering the movie in typical blockbuster territory. There is no suspense stemming from original and careful use of alien screen time. Instead, they are shown in full CGI glory from the beginning and far too often overstay their welcome, further diminishing their effect on the viewer. In this respect, the movie suffers from the same sort of ailment as some of the recent monster blockbusters such as Kong: Skull Island (2017). The movie could have benefited greatly from putting some effort into using real life special effects whenever possible and showing the aliens sparingly, which was used to such great effect in the original Alien (1979).The script deserves a special reference as it is constantly asking the viewer to chip in some faith in order to have any chance of immersion in the events unravelling on the screen. Well, as I am no ""man of faith"" like some of the characters, I couldn't get around the plot offering a series of constant nicks in the rails, threatening to derail the movie and resulting in a fairly bumpy ride. I don't generally approve of people nit picking and bashing a movie because of miniscule flaws. However, this movie starts steering the characters in dubious situations fairly early on and the mind boggling choices some of them make towards the end of the movie start to pop-up like baby aliens on a stranded freighter space ship. There is no point in setting them out but ultimately, the behaviour of the characters undertaking all sorts of high-risk manoeuvres with no objective pressure to do so makes them less believable, interesting or screen worthy, at the same time devaluating the actors efforts. There is a heap of situations where huge continuity gaps exist and it is very hard to keep on without further elaboration.With regards to the plot, the whole shenanigan with the Engineers that gobbled up Prometheus (2012) is basically thrown away as the premises of the prequel are only used as a continuity vessel to support David/Walter android centred God-plot that is obviously going to take the limelight in what is to come. The Engineers are wasted - quite literally and as a means to elevate the movie plot considering so much was invested in the idea. This is threatening to shrink the aliens from a fear-inducing, mysterious out-of-this- galaxy, question-raising menace to a mere weapon devised by some android in a cave, using methods and tools unbeknownst to anyone.The android, however, steals the show and the movie is at its best when Fassbender is pulling the strings. This is not really a compliment as it is hard to imagine a machine should reflect more emotion that the rest of the actual human crew of the Covenant, some of which are designated cannon-fodder from the moment you see them on screen. None of the actors are particularly bad but are very limited in what they can do considering the circumstances. Katherine Waterston offers a glimpse of a good Alien female character but ends up somehow misplaced in a movie with this kind of plot.The aliens are just further differentiated into different ""subspecies"" at various stages of evolution and their means of procreating are taking increasingly convoluted shapes and timelines that do not really make sense with respect to how they interact with their hosts. Unfortunately, this takes away from their effectiveness and doesn't do them justice.The directing is at times pretty uninspired and for a few brief moments even feels like a B-grade horror movie. There is an offering of chewed-up clichés with horrible intro such as the instance when an alien can be seen approaching the current hideout for the crew, immediately followed by a shot of a busty female character washing up and moaning miles away from her comrades. She is going to be OK, right? Not only is the alien approach scene in this case entirely unnecessary and (again) reveals the xenomorph moving along CGI-illy, but the entire way the subsequent death scene is filmed is just insulting to watch coming from a seasoned director and could have just been bought on some stock footage web page. It is basically filler and should not be included in a movie like this one. It is an example of one of the biggest shortcomings of the movie and that is utter predictability. The movie is set out in a way that you know exactly when something is going to happen.Setting the negative aside, it is not a horrible movie, it is just not the one most people wanted. I feel that it might be worse for someone unfamiliar with other alien movies as its plot is fairly inseparable from the previous work but then also better, as they are not invested in the story beforehand.Unfortunately, R. Scott got wound up elaborating some mixed up grandiose ideas and took effort away from making the movie work on more basic levels resulting with a somewhat generic and uninteresting blockbuster film.",Alien - Covenant
1914,rona-29461,Fun to Watch..disappointing Prometheus sequel,6,7 June 2017,"I was very excited to hear that Alien Covenant would continue the ""Prometheus"" project. And so it did; sort of. As the story developed it became clear that it would not have the the same impact and ended up being a continuation of the first two Alien installments. Ultimately the story is essentially a weaker redo of ""Aliens"" leaving ""The Prometheus"" story as a secondary plot line in favor of Alien destruction. The characters were typically undeveloped, the effects were spectacular and the gore was prominent if not overbearing. If you are an ""Alien"" fan you will enjoy this immensely. If you are looking for a deeper continuation of Prometheus, disappointment will follow.",Alien - Covenant
1915,joerivanriel,The movie Prometheus was supposed to be.,7,19 May 2017,"It's finally here! Ridley Scott's highly anticipated follow-up to 2012's Prometheus. Anticipated, because Prometheus divided audiences (Alien-fans and casual viewers, alike) around the globe. With an overly convoluted plot and illogical character actions (A zoologist petting an unknown space-cobra. Really?), Prometheus crushed under it's own weight. Let's find out if Scott redeems the prequels with Alien: Covenant.The first pro of this movie over Prometheus are the characters. The crew of the spaceship Covenant are more likable from the get-go. All of them are couples with the intention of finding a new habitable planet and settling there. This is in sharp contrast with the crew from Prometheus who were on that particular mission either for personal gain or the simple reason of being paid to be there. This new crew feels more human. Their (sometimes rushed) decisions are based on familiar emotions (fear, love, self-doubt etc.). Are there people getting to close to alien eggs and spore pods? Yes. Stupid things like that still happen on a couple of occasions, but most of it happens by accident instead of sheer stupidity.Michael Fassbender reprises his role of David, the curious synthetic looking for it's purpose. Apart from an interesting conversation with his creator, Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), in the intro, David's role really kicks off about halfway through the movie. With it comes the referencing of classic arts, which could foreshadow the coming events to viewers who pick up on those. His updated model, Walter (also Fassbender), offers an interesting Ying to David's Yang and the two develop quite an interesting relationship as the plot carries on. The only thing the plot revolving around David leaves to be desired, is it's link to Prometheus. It is all resolved very quickly with a flashback. The whole ""Why have you created us""-plot of Prometheus does not get the conclusion we wanted for it to make sense. This feels like a missed opportunity.Now to talk about the thing everyone bought their ticket for; the Alien. Yes, it's a proper Xenomorph this time around. Yes, you do get some answers regarding it's creation. In other words, fans of the franchise will absolutely love the intense and gory scenes in which it's titular beast is featured. Even if this movie does nothing really new with the formula. I have to admit that the movie never got really scary. In the 1979 original, the scares basically came from the fact that neither the characters nor the audience knew what was viciously killing the crew. Now, 38 years later, most people know what a Xenomorph looks like and that kills the scares a bit. Scott solves this problem by not holding back on the gore. And there is a LOT of that in this movie. Most of the scenes where the trailers cut away are shown in full gory glory here. It's not as much as an overabundance as most splatter horror movies, but not in the least for the faint of heart.In conclusion, as a fan of the Alien-franchise you will not be disappointed by Alien: Covenant. It does not steal the crown from the first two movies, but it's proudly taking the bronze medal. Even though the unresolved plot points of Prometheus are not entirely integrated or wrapped up to satisfaction, this movie redeems itself on that front by not trying to fix past mistakes, but building the foundation for future installments in the series. Sure, the movie is not really scary and predictable at times, but it's unsettling ending and gory sci-fi horror/action certainly makes it worth the price of admission.",Alien - Covenant
1916,wherearethegrills,WTH went wrong here?,1,21 May 2017,"When Alien Covenant was announced, I was excited. I was really hoping that after a slew of bad and mediocre Alien films that someone would take charge and the franchise would finally see some redemption, especially after the highly loathed, Prometheus. WRONG.Besides for Avatar: The Last Airbender, I've never wanted to walk out of a film and ask for my money back like I did with this one.Overall: terrible characters, boring plot, wasted opportunity to move the franchise in a fresh direction, unfulfilling action, lackluster suspense, reused ideas and an even poorer and more uninteresting plot than Prometheus.I could honestly write for days how much I hated this movie, but you get the point.After walking out of this movie, I couldn't help but think whatever happened to the Alien film that Neill Blomkamp was meant to direct that was supposed to bring back Ridley and a bunch of original characters. The concept art for that movie alone looks 100x cooler than what this movie threw at us, which was absolute rubbish.So disappointed. . .",Alien - Covenant
1917,felixnippon,"Big disappointment, misleading title, should not be called Alien",1,19 May 2017,"First of all, if you liked Prometheus, you will like this movie. I really didn't like it so Covenant was even worse than expected. Why call it Alien when its just Prometheus 2 or even better ""Daniel the Android"" would be a fitting title.The scenario on a planet just does not work, looks more like an adventure movie, it really reminded me of something like Skull Island just in space (20th century what do you expect). But that's not all, the characters were really boring and just throw away staff, didn't feel any connection to anyone, even the dialogues were annoying sometimes.I really just don't try to hate this movie, but if you call it Alien in the first place, make a movie like it and not another 0815 Hollywood space movie, sure the movie had some great scenes and the digital effects are great but that's it.So I felt really bored nearly the whole movie (I really did), no tension in scenes at all, remember the first movie how the Alien was discovered and how good the build up was? All thrown away, spoiler, its just like ""here is the face huger, take a look"" face huger grabs his face, just a few scenes later it hatches out of his body and than even more sad, just another few scenes later, the Alien is already grown up and evolved, so extremely forced towards the end!..sorry for my bad English sometimes.

I understand Prometheus doesn't have only fans but it was a great setup. It was disheartening to see it thrown away in front of my eyes during the movie.I never thought Damen Lindelof understood how to end a good story, but replacing him seems to have made the story worse.As most other reviewers here will tell you - you may want to just go watch movie to see how a story that was left hanging for FIVE YEARS ended (Prometheus was made in 2012). But just be ready for dissatisfying answers.At this point, now that the genre is pretty much regressing and confused, I think it's time for some other writers/studios to stand up and develop on the overarching intrigue of the last movie.As for Ridley Scott, what can I say except that we'll miss your talent.

1920,limeygeeza,Ridley Scott just made the Alien jump the shark...,1,24 May 2017,"Awful, awful, awful movie.I was expecting, anticipating and hoping for so much more. I 'liked' Prometheus, yes it had some issues, but it showed some promise that a better more cohesive movie could and would follow it. Alien: Covenant is not that movie.I enjoyed probably the first hour of Alien: Covenant, it had a fantastically surreal opening with an interaction between Guy Pearce as Weyland with 'still' terrible old age make-up (why can't they get that right in these movies?) and the fantastic Fassbender. It sets perfect tone for what should have been a great ride into the human psyche mirrored in the personification of his creation. Alas it does not...I'm not going to list everything wrong with this movie, as it will take too long as there is so much wrong with this movie. Clearly the writers do not understand nor care about he mythos and the lore of any of the previous Alien movies. They were clearly told to ignore almost any reference to Prometheus other than to connect it loosely to that movie and get it out of the way as quickly as possible.Ridley Scott has now accomplished what George Lucas did with Episode I with Midichlorians (yeah) and screwed up a great franchise just like Spielberg did with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull - that's right he has now entered the hall of fame of 'I know how to screw up a good thing, and not take advice or guidance from those around me because they are too scared to give it and don't give a crap anyway'.The Alien is seriously made into a similar slasher character in this movie to that of the Halloween, Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm street sequels and NOT the good ones. Ridley Scott clearly wanted to get the creature onto the screen as soon as he could once it was revealed (as a weird fully formed miniature Alien, why?) had it grow full size in 2 seconds and start killing everything and anything around it (mainly glass windows as well as humans) as fast as he possibly could.It even has the same/similar ending to what... 3 of the other Alien movies, really? That's the ONLY way to kill an Alien? Shoot it out into the vacuum of space, nothing more original than that, really?Absolutely terrible movie, Someone take this franchise away from Ridley Scott and give it to a good writer who understands the genre and the lore and reboot it properly with a young original director unafraid to take chances and has a vision. (I know Blomkamp is the favourite, I'd be OK with that, but Dan Trachtenberg (10 Cloverfield Lane) would be my choice.Fassbender was the only saving grace to this train-wreck and without him it would have been EVEN worse if that's imaginable.",Alien - Covenant

A film where the familiar is abandoned in search of the experience of true authentic mystery. I love this movie and enjoyed all the clichés and symbols trotted out in the order they were but I saw nothing that caused me any confusion or wondering or left me unsettled asking WHAT WAS THAT?

1929,jasonkenny-76594,Fans of the franchise will be happy,9,12 May 2017,"The level of enjoyment you will take home after watching this movie fully depends on how much you have invested in the franchise. Personally I enjoyed (to a degree) all of the alien films. Mainly due to the fact that I find the alien universe fascinating.The film starts in pure nostalgia, mainly with the use of the films score, the opening scenes accompanied by the same beautiful score as 'alien' gave me goosebumps, and the title of the movie fades in just like the original.This film takes us back (almost) to the holy grail of 'alien'. It is the best follow up to the body horror of the original film, from the excessive violence that comes with the 'birthing' of the neomorph to the beloved face hugger, the violation of the body invasion and gore we know and love is back! The pacing is done well too, at the start I was left thinking 'too much is happening' but this didn't leave you bored later in the movie, some of the plot twists are predictable but enjoyable, It also does a decent attempt to answer the age old question 'where did they come from?' although the answer may be a little lackluster. Michael fassbender is the star of the movie, his portrayal of both David and Walter are fantastic, as David he has you hanging (uneasily) off every word. Although the entire cinema sniggered at one in particular.All in all this film will be a love hate for many as was its predecessor, it does a good set up for the follow up film, and I will be waiting eagerly for it.",Alien - Covenant
1930,knowles-31617,"A gory, sci-fi monster movie, but that's all Covenant really is.",7,29 May 2017,"Covenant brings Alien back to its roots; well thought out Science Fiction horror. With quotes from Frankenstein, and the whole aspect of Darwinistic creation and destruction, Covenant lives up to the hype but at a cost. The recipe is simple: tension, scares, buckets of blood and yet the movie feels empty until a certain point, where it just starts to get weird. While providing opportunities to cover your eyes with a blanket, does that make it truly terrifying? The obsessive gore and repetitive story blunts the edge. It runs amok with in- depth characters and surprising twists, and each death has a lasting impact throughout the film. Even better, the female lead is strong and independent. Past all of the creation and destruction philosophy, Covenant also serves up a tasty dish of clichéd horror moments, borrowing from movies like Wes Craven's Scream, but inventing enough to remain original. The memorable shower sequence is an excellent example of this. Fortunately, the story has more thumbs-up moments than down. Overall, repetitive (yet effective) work Scott, but some slow moments towards the movies center bring it down once again with repetitive action sequences, slow churning dialogue, but Fassbender's fabulous performance (as two different characters) lightens the weight.",Alien - Covenant

Anyone going into an Alien film nearly 40 years after the release of the original Alien should accept that these movies have a specific story formula. If a viewer can move past their objections to the traditional sci-fi horror arc and actually focus on the meat of the film then the film is an enjoyable experience with terrific performances from the entire cast. *spoilers below* Also, if you liked Prometheus then Alien: Covenant will be right up your alley. The film capitalizes on the many questions asked in Prometheus and answers quite a few of them through an excellent plot piece using the synthetic David. The tone of the film itself isn't actually more gruesome than Prometheus, but the pacing is quite a bit faster making the film seem more violent than any Alien film preceding it. This shift allows Covenant to feel much more horror focused than previous films. This is most evident in the ""Flare"" scene where the fast paced editing combined with disgustingly gory kills ramps up the intensity of the film to 11. *end spoilers*To summarize: If you go into the film expecting a fun, horrific, and intriguing sci-fi horror then you will leave impressed.

Once there, the crew discover the world is much dangerous than it seems but none more dangerous than encountering David, the android from the doomed Prometheus expedition.From the get go, none of the human characters in 'Covenant' are interesting or memorable enough and except for a few, most of them are just faceless red shirts. Some of them act annoyingly hysterical which results in some face-palming reactions and some act like they're in a B-movie slasher flick, but worst of all, a few do something so incredibly stupid that you end up wondering if Weyland- Yutani intentionally hires morons to be part of their billion dollar expeditions.Katherine Waterston plays Daniels and although she is probably the ""best"" character among these losers, she's not written very well nor does she have any notable moments. Michael Fassbender did a superb job with his dual role of David and Walter. Most were expecting Danny McBride to stink up the place but he turned out to be one of the very few reasonably decent characters. Billy Crudup's Oram joins the ranks of Fifeld and Millburn as the dumbest people in the 'Alien' series.Despite the many flaws of 'Prometheus' and the numerous dumb human actions, the characters there were at least not boring and Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) was a good leading character that had many memorable exciting scenes. 'Prometheus' even had some thrilling action spectacle that wowed audience and expanded the Alien mythology.Those that are expecting to learn more about the Engineers will be sorely disappointed as they are just briefly touched upon. The whole movie just feels like one big glorified set-up to show the transition from black goo to neomorph to finally xenomorph. Ridley Scott stated he plans to make three more 'Alien' prequels after Covenant. The problem now is we will get three more movies in the future to convolutedly and exhaustively tie everything up leading up to the first 'Alien' movie where the Engineer spacecraft somehow lands at the LV-426 moon.The horror element in 'Covenant' is quite satisfactory, showcasing some spine-chilling terror and graphic kills. The action though is hugely disappointing with the last two big action sequences being uninspiring and unexceptional. The pacing during the last few minutes after the fake-out ending seemed rushed and dissonant. The xenomorph felt shoehorned. The pink-skinned neomorph was a worthy adversarial monster on its own and much creepier than the xenomorph.If this is what Ridley Scott has in store for future Alien prequels, he should just stop and do something else. Or better yet, allow Neill Blomkamp to proceed with his planned 'Alien' do-over sequel where Hicks and Newt are still alive. Interest for the 'Alien' franchise will probably die down steadily with each prequel Ridley releases. This is starting to feel more and more like when George Lucas' botched up the 'Star Wars' prequels.In space, no one can hear you scream. With each passing Alien prequels, no one cares anymore.RATING: 5.5/10 or 6/10",Alien - Covenant

Alien Covenant visuals are terrific as most of R. Scott movies. Effects are pretty good and gave us the best Alien creature from all the saga movies. The new Neomorph are fantastic! Why people like to damage movies rating 1 when they know the movie is a good piece of entertainment...Guardians of the Galaxi 2 has 8! my god, that is a bad movie and seems like people have to rate it high...why??? because is a trend I suppose. This movie is much better by far. When Prometheus came up people complaint about lack of the alien creature, now they compliant about lack of engineers and too much focus on the creatures...that is what I call never been satisfied with nothing and anything. Anyway, go to the cinema and enjoy Alien covenant as it is...a very well done sci fiction movie with a great visuals,practical effects, gore,music,suspense and a terrific come back of the creature itself.Michael Fassbender is outstanding as he plays two roles effectively and there is some point in the movie which you really believe there are two robots interacting with different capabilities...not an actor.Shaw's fate is a little disappointed considering it would be great to see her again in future films and on the other hand we never know exactly what David did to her...your imagination has to figure it out.I really enjoy alien movies, and I do not get to deep trying to understand if the movie has flows or unreal situations because that is why is called Sci Fi! I just enjoy the ride of fantasy and cinematography and boy, this movie delivers! The ending open the door for more installments and I really hope we can have at least another one linking to the original alien.",Alien - Covenant
1938,manhim-09928,a alien movie turns to a love story,1,11 May 2017,"It is a tragedy. What a supernatural alien movies turning down into a gay love theme without any sense. I suppose to have a good ending without bringing any sadness afterwards, however, it makes me feel nausea after the movie. No content, it is not totally talking about eliminating alien, it is partially about a robot thing having a brother love with another robot with the same face.",Alien - Covenant
1939,lorettawillis,Can I get my money back please?,3,11 May 2017,"Sir Ridley espouses the virtues of having a good story as the basis for any successful movie. He says, 'story first, special or CGI effects come later'.Did he fall over and hit his head, because he seems to have completely forgotten his own mantra.Alien Covenant is such a disappointment. It's like Scott filmed different segments of the movie and just slapped them together. It needs a re-edit. The story is a mess and just so predictable.Blink and you'll miss the ambiguous explanation of the fate of Elizabeth Shaw. The alien attacks are bloody, but not scary (he failed to build any suspense). The characters are not interesting - we don't get to know them, so you don't really care if they get killed. The weird scene with android David, teaching the android Walter how to play the flute and later kissing him - should have been scrapped. It was rubbish. The movie lacked 'atmosphere'. The ship is too shiny and well lit, there is no atmospheric steam or even perspiration on the lead character when she's battling the Alien at the end. It fails to 'suspend disbelief'. There's music in place of sound effects - no heart beats or hum of the ship, like in Alien. The special effects with the explosions are good. But, overall, it's a soul-less exercise! The promotional trailers are better than the movie!For those who did or didn't like Prometheus, at least it was a spectacular movie with a decent story (albeit not one that connected to Alien), and brilliant production techniques and CGI effects. Alien Covenant is not, it's like a cheap franchise movie. Scott is such a masterful film maker. I can't believe he served up such an insulting pile of rubbish to his audience. With the remake of his earlier blockbuster Blade Runner due out soon, and at least one or two more prequels to Alien, I have to ask: ""Is Scott just after the money?""My advice, don't waste yours!",Alien - Covenant

I can now sleep easy. Amazing plot build up. The Neos are as perfectly terrifying as their 'perfect' xeno counterparts, a bit faster I'd presume. The right amount of gore and bloodshed to keep the viewer alert. Intense moments between brother David and brother Walter to keep things interesting. And, finally, as usual, the fight for survival between Team Daniels and Team Xeno (or should I say Team Nutdroid)Negatives- too much time devoted to the spaceship scenes ( the beginning 40 - 45 mins!) and very less light was thrown upon Dr. E Shaw, but we do get to know about her fate (trust me, you don't want to be her or join the Prometheus crew in the first place or have faith...in David of course or know how to fix robots.You can't afford to miss out on this movie in this lifetime and the next, and the next.",Alien - Covenant

There is a small part that is still confusing me is that who are the people David killed (when he releases virus on)? They really look like engineers, but i don't think so.

Slow 2. Poor story development 3. KILLS THE ENTIRE ENGINEERS RACE, so zero explanation about why the virus/plague was created, why humans were created o why in Promtheus the surviving engineer seemed to hate humans. 4. No explanation about how David's alien eggs ended inside an engineer spaceship in planetoid LV-426 nor why there was a fossilized engineer in the same ship. 5. Too much white xenomorphs... 6. Bad cgi xenomorphs animations. 7. Did I mention they KILLED THE ENTIRE ENGINEERS RACE for no real reason. 8. No real explanation about what happened to Elizabeth Shaw. 9. Plot holes everywhere 10. No space for psychological terror..we are always presented the xenomorphs in clear view.. 11. Again the probably most interesting character of the two latest movies, Peter Wayland is reduced to just a 2 minutes scene...All I can think about is either Ridley or the screenwriters can't remember or doesn't know what made Alien 1/2 so great (even being so radically different movies)...or simply they don't care.",Alien - Covenant
1946,roadbuster-65852,A visually stunning spectacle weighed down immensely by insipid ideas.,2,13 May 2017,"Like many others, I have invested countless years of enjoyment and fascination of the Alien franchise,especially the first two, which both to this day remain high benchmarks in cinema. I really wanted to enjoy this movie so much but left the cinema with an heavy heart. I felt that what seems to be the actual origins of the xenomorph implied in this movie as insipid, dull and not very ""alien"" at all and cheapens the dark creepy mysterious and ominous introduction of the biomechanical creature from the first film. In my opinion, this alone weakens, cheapens and dilutes the legacy of Alien and the franchise in general. One can only wonder what Mr Blomkamp would have brought to the table if he was allowed to go ahead with Alien 5, which from what it looks like, would have been a greater asset to the franchise and a way better movie but what do I know, I ain't a big shot Hollywood exec who thinks they know what's what. Sigh, what a missed opportunity.",Alien - Covenant
1947,b-65143,"Breathtaking, heartbreaking and visually stunning",10,13 May 2017,"My only problem with ""ALIEN: Covenant"" (AC) was its length. It's a 2 hour-long movie that should have lasted at least 30 to 45 minutes longer (and I'm sure that would have been the director's intention. So I'm hoping for a longer director's cut version of it on Blu-ray). Why do I say that? Because the 4 parts of the movie (Introduction, Exposition, Collision and Resolution) were edited in a way that part 2 had deserved more screen-time. As an audience we should have been given more time to literally ""breathe in"" the amazing planet with its outside locations (and at this point: the feel of hope and optimism with the characters).However, this was my only minor issue with the film. The rest was pure joy and admiration. There are 5 reasons for it: locations (1), characters (2), production design (3), cinematography (4) and the score (5).1. The locations on this movie are just superb. The ships, the ancient city and last but not least: the planet. There's been great location and Greens-work in this one and a truly lush, green and otherworldly environment.2. Strong characters played by an excellent cast. Tough to name one lead-character in AC, there's more than one you'll feel connected to. From an acting point of view M. Fassbender and B. Crudup outdid themselves. I felt a strong connection to the characters and their motivations. Regarding how the story unfolds: Of course stupid mistakes and wrong decisions are being made. Without them, there wouldn't be a movie! 3. Scott's movies all have spectacular production design and AC (costumes, props, sets and creatures) also was nothing short from wonderful.4. Well, no surprise here, the cinematography is just masterful. It's just extremely well done and intriguing. Hereby, I do not only mean the camera work but also the lighting, color-grading and overall look, that gives this movie its menacing feel.5. Last but not least, there's the music and score. From the very first scene to the end it's just brilliantly crafted and truly outstanding.He's done it AGAIN. Sir Ridley Scott, I salute you!",Alien - Covenant

Same casuals who played POKEMON GO and then left after a month or so. They are all over the world.

The script and the dialogue of the film are utterly dumbed down, to expedite the flimsy storyline.Almost every 5 minutes, one of the crew members makes an obviously wrong decision, which would belie any plausibility that the people chosen to crew the mission were in any way suitable for it.Let's diverge from our mission. Let's explore this planet that we know nothing about without any protective gear. Let's discharge a firearm inside an explosive ship. Lets hang out in a highly vulnerable location, and not take any precautions to cover ourselves. Let's put our trust in a total stranger, then let's split up for no reason. and it goes on and on.It's pretty looking, but honestly it is such an abortion of a movie, it eliminates any redeeming qualities.

1956,jmachucav,Do not believe to wise guys,9,16 May 2017,"I went to see this delivery of Alien, directed by the great Ridley Scott, and the truth is that I had a good time, which is equivalent to say - considering the genre to which the film belongs - I felt disgusted, I was intrigued and I I kept tense good part of the two hours of its duration.I find extremely exaggerated the voices that cry weaknesses of the script. That there are weaknesses, there are, sure, but, it is not at all an absurd film as some pretend to show.To cite an example, the movie blog page (https://www.blogdecine.com/) covers an article entitled: ""More absurd than 'Prometheus': 19 moments of the script of 'Alien: Covenant' that ruin the movie"" .This to me is (to say the least) despot. If we become realistic, then we can lay down to the most painted classic. But, then, cinema does not have conventions, and we must respect them or seek a different way of entertaining ourselves.Alien Covenant frightens, disgusts and annoys more than once. I think that anyone who comes to see Alien - I include myself - seeks that experience. Point. Do you have some stretches that look like a remake of previous films? Yes and it is inevitable, it is not easy to write something new about a saga that has eight movies on its back: since 1979 an aliens movie is shot approximately every 5 years.Therefore, if there is a wisdom out there, capable of finding 100 or 1000 errors to ""Alien: Covenant"", because I suggest one thing, with much pragmatism and affection: let him f*** himself.",Alien - Covenant
1957,Layonayo,Doesn't live up to the IP.,6,23 May 2017,"This movie gives me mixed feelings.In a technical sense, the film is well-made. It was really cool seeing the xenomorph this animated and lifelike on the silver screen. The 97 million dollars it took to make this really shows in the special effects.The problems begin to arise when you focus on the writing. I'm not going to spoil anything here, but I will say that I knew what the ending was going to be halfway through the movie. So did my friend sitting beside me. This is not a very good thing for a horror film. Because of this, the film lacked a sense of tension because you already knew the outcome, and overall it didn't seem like the 'aliens' were the main focus of the film at all. Not to mention that the story puts a new twist on the origin of the xenomorph, and whether it was in the right direction isn't my area to judge.If you're a die-hard fan of the franchise or a source material elitist, then I think you'll be disappointed by this film.

Call me a homophobe but REALLY... People are moving to other planets to actually POPULATE planet... They finally find out where to go... and they bring couple of homosexuals with them. I really can't find any logic in that part. Androids kissing each other, I mean REALLY? Why bring only one android to be boarded on ship?

It follows the theme of Prometheus of what it really is like to be a creator, a created, or what it is like to meet your creator. It touches upon the opposite of creation - doom. The story of Prometheus was the story of the ""giants"" failed attempt coming back to doom the Earth, but as we begin this movie the colonists of the Covenant are looking for a new planet to inhabit. Why? We don't really get to know, but most likely it is the old subject of over reaching resources.The movie mixes these enormously deep subjects with the ultimate consequence of what happens when you go looking for something so abstract and intangible. The consequence of madness and damnation, both internal and external.Other than that there are beautiful settings, wonderful musical score and a lot of action and gore. Covenant brings back the feeling of Alien, but also adds something completely unique and also brings on scope and insight into the franchise.On top of that the acting is great and Fassbenders has outdone himself. He is truly spectacular.Don't trust the negative views here on IMDb, see it for yourself! A lot of people don't like it, maybe you won't too, but I sure loved it!

1961,alienaliasalibi,Alien Covenant dreams of a future without Workplace Safety Policies,6,18 May 2017,"Formulaic to a tee, the latest offering from the Alien franchise is a repackaged story line with a less frightening creature feature. Most notable is the clear but unexpected stance the film takes on colonising planets without an advising Workplace Health and Safety Officer in attendance. Let this be a cautionary tale regarding failure to implement appropriate biohazard and fire safety controls, children.Following on from the 2012 film, Prometheus, Alien Covenant picks up 10 years later with a spaceship of colonists from Earth headed to a habitable planet. As in the previous films, crew are maintained in hyper-sleep for the long journey and tended to by a synthetic human, Walter (Michael Fassbender). Struck by an energy flare on route, the crew is awakened to manage repairs to the ship and subsequently decide to take a side trip to investigate a mysterious transmission nearby. Can you guess what else might be lying in wait on this conveniently located new planet?Laden with jump-scares and poor life choices, the Prometheus and Covenant films are prequels to the initial film, Alien, released in 1979. Bound by trying to maintain the 'look and feel' of a movie made with special effects from over 30 years ago, Covenant does well to replace creature puppets with computer generated nightmares while trying not to be so flashy with upgrades as to make the 'future' obsolete.In place of substantive character development, early dialogue awkwardly refers to characters by their relationship, specifically 'my wife', rather than allowing a natural progression of backstory for each character, presumably to save time and get to the gore. I can only hope that the overuse of the wifely title was to lay grounds for a future drinking game at the end of a harrowing movie marathon weekend. Although, realistically, if you encouraged drinking every time a previous plot point from the series is reused, you'd be well on your way. It really does feel like the script was put together by joining the dots on a collection of Post-It notes from a brain storming session called 'Things which worked really well last time'.And yes, fans of the genre; the androids of Covenant, comfortingly, continue to be ambiguous in their agendas. However, the strong, independent, doe-eyed female lead (Katherine Walterston), is disappointingly not as kickass as Ripley from the original films.Overall, if there is a special place in your heart for the mythos of the Alien universe, you know you'll go see this edition in spite of it all to revel in the nostalgia of a recycled premise. However, I would recommend a lowering of your expectations first. No, lower. Lower. There. Now you're ready.",Alien - Covenant
1962,nisamal,Here is how fans ruins genuine movie ideas,2,18 May 2017,"If something was highly successful at some point(alien), it doesn't mean everything that follow it has to be similar. When Prometheus came out it was different, unique and brilliant in the aspect that, it left the viewer with questions to think about. However it was a disappointment if you had expected an alien movie, but this is not a bad thing. It was always obvious that there was going to be sequel, but this sequel has tried to meet the expectations of those alien fans. The result is something that is neither a good psychological sci-fi nor a great horror sci-fi. For once filmmakers should do what they want to do, than try to please a fan base. They should always remember that they have a fan base for some of their movies, because they were able to do what they wanted to do. I hope this would be the last movie in the segment to use the age old equation of recycle and re-purpose.",Alien - Covenant

You've waited and waited, Christmas comes, and not only do you not get what you want, but you learn there is not Santa. That is how I feel having just seen Alien Covenant. Boy did I want this movie to be good, even possibly great. I left the theater wondering if this is the end of the franchise? Probably not. Heck, I'll probably still pay for the next one if I can get over AC. Nothing makes sense in this film. Starting with the story. Inside of 15 minutes we learn the Covenant, a colony ship carrying 15 crew and 2000 colonists, is altering its plan on which planet to colonize. The ship's number 2 in charge is the only voice of ""are we sure this is a good idea"". It takes two more weeks from when we first meet the crew to get to this alternate planet but the film doesn't bother to introduce us to characters now or at any point. Boom, they just arrive at the location. Once on the crew lands, trouble shows up and fast. This is when the only real intense scene happens and if you watched the first online trailer you've seen it. The film rapidly goes down hill from there. We've got the Covenant ship holding above the planet and the smaller survey ship with all but three of the crew on the ground. Survey ship gets trashed, now we have marooned crew. More danger arrives until a mysterious figure fires a flare and scares off the otherwise unstoppable beasts. We learn who the mysterious figure is and our marooned crew starts wandering off from one another one by one, ending up dead. There is a severe storm keeping the marooned crew from being rescued by the Covenant thus allowing time for more of the crew to just wander off and die. Our mysterious figure has been stranded for 10 years, playing with black goo, and making bad creatures. One android shows another how the play the flute, one android attempts to and may actually kiss another android. Finally the Covenant crew members figure out a way to reach the remaining marooned crew to pick them up and get back to the Covenant. At this point of course the audience knows an uninvited guest has managed to get on the ship. The uninvited guest gets removed in a familiar fashion and we're left with two crew going to cryo-sleep and one android. Android is watching over the Covenant as the android and Mother plot a course to the planet originally targeted for colonization. So, the combination of crappy plot, zero character connection, not much acting, next to zero terror, purely ridiculous solo death scenes, androids playing a flute and kissing, and one naked couple shower scene after all the crap they have been through....and Ridley Scott has made himself the ultimate Alien franchise killer called Alien Covenant.

There wasn't enough ""foreplay"" and it just felt rushed many times throughout. The ideas seemed incomplete and scattered. It had the feel of someone who got a hold of a bunch of new ideas and effects but never took the time properly nurture them and the whole thing just seemed premature. I could tell there is amazing potential in all of it but it just doesn't seem focused enough or maybe too focused on the wrong ""thing"".To be honest I feel like it could have been a whooolllee lot simpler in some areas and would have had a much larger impact. I also feel Ridley Scot, as a director, is great at rhythm, timing, and slowly (but never boring) pulling out the plot. He didn't seem to work upon that amazing gift too much throughout this movie but maybe that's not his fault. Another thing about the story and characters is I never felt them believable. No one wants to watch a bunch of completely incapable specialists (how the hell were any of these characters qualified to fly out in space is beyond me) fumble and totally fail in fashions that should be beyond them.Real fear is when smart intelligent people who are doing there best seem to still bite the dust in very very ""real"" breakdowns.On a random positive note I loved the sudden and awesome moment where they were all in the field experiencing the first aggressive encounter...I will say no more of that scene. Overall I know my review is mainly negative but the movie definitely wasn't horrible I just think it was nothing Ill really come back too considering it left me not wanting more, annoyed at times, and mainly just scratching my head. I get what they were trying to do but it just wasn't played out ""right"" and well...if this were sex, I would have wanted to climax so badly but would have never quite gotten there leaving me very frustrated.",Alien - Covenant

It boggles my mind with the budget of this film that they would make something so horrific. I went to the 7pm IMAX showing and the hard drive arrived late, so it was canceled. I then went and had some beverages at a nearby pub and waited for the 10pm showing, I was that excited to see this movie. Started off great, kind of pulled you in, then it was empty for almost 2 hours. A series of absolute ridiculous events (that my 5 year old could do a better job of writing) happen and decision making that only someone with a true death wish and unbelievable lack of common sense would make, we see over and over. As a matter of fact, the only film I've seen worse than this in my entire lifetime is Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. The only good thing about this epic failure, is the tremendous previews before it starts. Anyone associated with the making of this boondoggle should consider other avenues to make a living. How did this clown show make it out of the cutting room? Bad story, ridiculous acting, no sense of direction, no fear factor, no scare factor, only offensive bloodletting that you would see in a slasher film (which consequently there's hundreds of......and all better than this movie)......it's an abomination. I'll end with this note, this experience was so dreadful, that I actually went out of my way to put a review on here so hopefully save someone else from the 4 hours of my life that I will never have back.",Alien - Covenant
1967,machinimashalo,A good film that deserves more open minded people,7,5 December 2017,"When I found out that a new movie from Alien would finally come out after so much time, I was excited but I still worry, because, being a fan of the original, I did not want to be disappointed, so I was waiting for Covenant info and the trailers that, I left worrying less when i saw the first trailer, but still, I did not lower my guard. So here I give you my opinion of the movie.Alien: Covenant offers a pretty good cinematography in my opinion, it shows pretty good shots for every occasion, showing how beautiful the landscape they were in, the scenes in which the creatures are shown (I know some complained about CGI but I'll talk of it more ahead), letting see its terrifying, but beautiful nature, etc. I think that cinematography is very good.Another positive point to mention is the natural way in which Scott managed to ""combine"" the terrifying and mysterious aspect of the original Alien and the philosophy and depth of Prometheus.One of the negative points is the script. The script is not bad but fails a lot in many characters, ""the protagonist"" of the film, Daniels, feels a little empty, and does not reach the level of Elizabeth Shaw and Ellen Ripley. Secondary characters like Maggie, Upworth and others feel like plot devices or filling. The characters to highlight that I think had more depth and well written and had more potential were Christopher, and Tennessee.Now I will mention David, I believe that the real protagonist of the movie was him, a lot of him was told, how he created the xenomorph, his conversations with Walter and the actions he did seem to indicate that he is the hidden protagonist. David was a very good character, a being who believes himself to be a God, seeking perfection, trying to be something he is not and wanting to show real emotions. It is known that the next installment of the series will focus on David.I didn't thought the CGI looked terrible, in fact I do not consider it bad, I think it is very good in most of the movie, what I saw the weakest was when the newborn Neomorph was shown, and when the xenomorph appears on the cameras of the ship, but in everything else I loved it, especially with the Xenomorph.Something that surprised me was the OST. I didn't remembered that it was so good after watching the movie for the first time but after I watched it the second time, I really enjoyed it. It is very unique and perfect match for a sci-fi horror movie.To finish, I think many did not expect the film to be like that and were disappointed that it was not like Aliens, or put things in the story that they think not concur with what Alien ""should be"", and especially that the film is not scary, that depends on the person and their tastes. I love this film for what it is and I feel it is a well-made attempt to bring the Xenomorph back into the world of modern cinema.",Alien - Covenant
1968,StoneyJackson,So disappointing... much worse than Prometheus!,4,19 May 2017,"All the negative reviews on here are pretty accurate... it's terrible, predictable, cliché, etc. I did enjoy Prometheus so when I heard Ridley Scott admit that he missed the mark with Prometheus I was seriously stoked to see how awesome Covenant was going to be. Even the teasers, trailers and prologues were more enjoyable. Ugh.Seriously you can wait to see this movie on HBO or Netflix. Take your date or family to watch something else, trust me.",Alien - Covenant
1969,timschinnell,I expected higher quality,6,19 May 2017,"There were a couple of continuity errors that I saw during this movie.There were two aliens from the ground troops, yet after the crew is attacked in the field, they never see one of them again. If they did end up killing one of them, they didn't focus on it enough to be recognized and remembered. How did David get away with using his own security code? And how did David's hair become so clean cut after his fight with Walter? Especially when he used those terrible shears. There are plenty of other things left to say about this movie including: Not a single person in the crew knows or realizes that Walter spontaneously loses his self healing abilities when they get back on the ship. The pilot of the lander should've kept herself locked in the quarantine lab, too. She got sprayed in the face with blood and she's part of trained crew that is supposed to handle high pressure situations. Captain Oram has basically no emotion when his wife dies in the lander explosion. Also no one saw the creature run off the lander ramp before it goes up in flames (that includes both the characters and the audience). I enjoyed the movie overall, though, simply for entertainment purposes and the nostalgia factor. The cinematics are good, but nothing notable. Action scenes are tense, but the emotion from most of the actors is mediocre. The end could've been handled better because myself, as well as the group I was with, knew immediately that it wasn't truly Walter. That fact was very obvious and upsetting. I gave this movie a 6/10 because it's fun to watch, but it doesn't do a very good job at closing doors in the Alien franchise. It's not very artistic, but it's still good entertainment. However, those continuity errors are just unforgivable coming from someone like Ridley Scott.",Alien - Covenant
1970,orionda-86630,"Wanted to like it, but it's a disappointment.",4,19 May 2017,"Overall I think the movie had a decent plot, although it still follows the same formula as some of the other Alien movies.My biggest gripe was with the cast, Michael Fassenbender with the David/Walter character was really the only character that was good or likable.Katherine Waterston was terrible, just like her hair in this movie. Same for the captain and the Danny McBride character ""Tennessee"". Can an actor be more one dimensional than Danny McBride? Although I'm only giving this a 4 out of 10, I still recommend seeing it because it gives you incite into the David cyborg character, the origins of the Alien and a peek at a world of other ""engineered"" beings.",Alien - Covenant
1971,paradispulari,Where are the great stories which will keep me breathless on my seat?,2,19 May 2017,"Unfortunately, it was not what I was expecting and a pity for wasting my money. Promotion and trailer again much better than the result. I don't know why but Hollywood producers and scriptwriters have lost their passion for creating great movies... What I mean by that, is simply the tension created in masterpieces like Alien one and two or other amazing Sci-Fi movies. Feelings as agony or suspense are just missing because characters are set to talk unnecessarily much on their journey. Furthermore, in the movie, there was no true hero I could engage with. In the past we could smell the fear of Sigourney Weaver... but she would risk her own life for this little girl to not be killed by the Aliens. With a child in her hands, she was fighting, trying to escape all through the entire movie. I know that it is impossible to repeat Dan O'Bannon or James Cameron with the amazing Ripley. However real artists can give us the same feeling with a similar story at least. Especially when it's clear what the audience expects I don't mean to be rude but it was honestly, a really boring journey except for some min. near the end. However thanks anyway for making me reminisce the good old times. Aik",Alien - Covenant

1974,fordkilkiss,Why did you have to do that ???,2,20 May 2017,"Honestly i've never been more disappointed from an Alien movies .... Not only the script was made for 10 year old kids , not only the movie was so boring that i was actually considering play candy crush saga , but the fact that Alien fans rate it with 7 stars , makes me wonder what kind of brainwash has the human kind has been infected with .

1975,solknald,Really--just really,4,20 May 2017,"This possibly contains spoilers so don't read on if you have a problem with that.Well here I was in the cinema, actually expecting a good aliens movie...boy was I in for a disappointment.I actually prefer Prometheus over this generic run of the mill movie(Prometheus was at least some what original).There are so many possibilities with the franchise, and I get that they want to explain the origin of the Alien..BUT, in this movie they do so by cutting out ALL the interesting possibilities and replacing them with uninteresting garbage and a few bland action scenes.Why can't we see the interesting bits of what happened to Elizabeth Shaw..What was her reasoning for putting David back together after he tried to kill everyone. Why did he kill her since she showed him compassion and 'fixed' him.What made David decide to kill off everyone on the destination planet. Why even crash the ship, could be useful when he needed to go somewhere else.Why didn't the crew just send the android to investigate the planet, would be safer for everyone.Anyway, I came out with a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth. Mainly because within the first 20 minutes, you can pretty much see where this movie is going and probably how it'll end. That wouldn't really matter if the stuff in between had been interesting, sadly it isn't. The action sequences aren't even that good.But really, someone, somewhere please, PLEASE give us a proper Alien movie soon, cause this one isn't it.",Alien - Covenant
1976,mrsanchez-70822,Knew the ending already,7,20 May 2017,"SPOILER WARNING! extreme spoiler The first couple minutes into the movie I was asking myself why couldn't they save Branson? I wanted to see more of James Franco! The crew was suppose to be well trained in stressful situations. Even when they tried to use the tool to get him out. Already killing off someone without getting to know them fully. But, I must say they did do a good job tying Branson into storyline.Anyway, it was kind of corny when Christopher took over as captain and later he was saying that he wasn't in charge because he was a man of faith.Throughout the movie the crew acts stupid and makes dumb choices. The whole reason they were stuck with this alien problem was because the new leader, Christopher, wanted to follow a signal coming from some random planet. I wish the leader had a little bit more control of the situation and proceeded with the actual goal of the Covenant considering they just had an unfortunate event happen just few moments ago. Everyone wasn't too keen on going back into the pods so I assume he made the best choice for the moral of the crew.Of course when they landed it was really just all down hill from there lololol The hooded man comes out of no where to save the day and you later find out it's David when he brings them back to his place.Come to find out David is the ring leader of all these aliens running around causing a ruckus. Little bit of an uncomfortable scene happens where David is making some sexual references to Walter..I laughed.. Later on David kisses Walter and then SHUTS HIM DOWN SO WALTER IS DEAD.. not really Walter survives and there's a pretty cool fight between David and Walter.David and Walter are the androidsTHE ENDING So at the end of the fight when Walter is on top of David, David is reaching for the knife on the ground as Walter is getting ready to smash his head in. As Walter is about to strike the scene cuts out and focuses on Daniels and their journey out (I think it focuses on Daniels if not them then maybe Tennessee) so we really we don't know who won. Later on you see Walter running out back to the ship that Tennessee is trying to land to get them out. If you look closely you can see that Walter has both of his hands still. But how? he lost one of his hands saving Daniels. So what? an android can regenerate itself that fast? Even David said that Dr. Shaw had to fix him. Anyway, that was my first clue into thinking if Walter was really David. My second clue I found is that when Daniels defeats the xenomorph by crushing it with the crane, ""Walter"" walks out and puts his hand on her shoulder and as he does this the wind blows and his hood pops up over his head. I feel like that is symbolic to when they first met David because David showed up wearing a hood. That scene lead me to believe that Walter is actually David and come to find out it was true. Guess the old model androids are better ;)Overall though I really enjoyed the whole premise of it. Little bit of lazy writing here and there but some funny jokes and some great ways to show that Walter was actually David in the end.",Alien - Covenant
1977,fabrioi,A stab in the back,1,21 May 2017,"I really couldn't go past this one without commenting, I feel, as an alien fan, that Ridley Scott just stabbed me in the back. There are many reasons I think so... Take Sigourney Weaver. Well, now forget about her, it makes no sense to compare the two. You now have a generic female character with a haircut (and sometime expressions) straight from Jim Carrey in Dumb & Dumber. Forget crews from old alien movies. These guys are completely anonymous, and seem to follow only their own interests. They also seem to have the intellect of a generic cheap horror movie victim, not one moment you will feel connected to the decisions of the guys. Forget suspense and love for details. Here the dark and detailed sceneries from the original movies are replaced by cheap CGI. Even for the aliens... And you can tell! The plot and answers given completely ruin the original idea for me. For many reasons, which I will not go into to avoid spoilers... Forget HR Giger as well. You will see random pictures thrown in there, but, unlike Prometheus where they were somehow decently recycled, here you will get stuck with generic designs. I could go on forever... But honestly, if you are a fan of alien I suggest you wait for the bluray and avoid getting your heart broken!!",Alien - Covenant
1978,vitorpiresteixeira,"David : Covenant , Ridley Scott's masterpiece.",9,21 May 2017,"Allow me to present what i think about this movie. In my opinion, this movie is as important as Blade Runner, if not more on a Theological level. And trust me friends, we now know what Alien is all about. And it's not the xenomorph. Simply put, this movie is BRILLIANT. People that are mad about this movie are Xenomorph fanboys :) and this is not about that AT ALL. The Alien is anaccessory for what Prometheus and Covenant are all about. Artificial Intelligence. The aberration (xenomorph) of creating Gods that destroy their Gods. This movie is all about David. Even his name was not chosen by chance. David was the robot kid in Spielberg's AI, and the religious connection with Prometheus and King David is notorious. The whole Alien series on Ridley Scott's view is giant arc about AI. Ridley is one of the cinematic prophets of our age, and AI is his main thematic focus. So please try to watch this movie on the AI perspective and not on the monster movies kind of way. You will then understand how deep and foretelling this piece of art is. The opening scene with Weyland and the Android is BRILLIANT. The question David poses to his master summarizes the whole story. One of the deepest and philosophical scenes ever in Cinema (the creator confronted by their creation) and in my opinion this movies goes down in History as a masterpiece. You need to understand what Ridley Scott is all about, it's not monsters and explosions, it's deep knowledge. And we now know folks: The Alien series was never about the xenomorph, it's was all time about the ANDROID.,﻿",Alien - Covenant
1979,badstudiosduncan,"Alien: Covenant, bigger and badder than Prometheus",9,21 May 2017,"I for one am a HUGE fan of the Alien franchise, and this movie is now one of my favorite movies. Though it may be somewhat predictable and familiar, I say that is a good thing as Prometheus seemed to stray too far from the other movies. Speaking of Prometheus, Alien: Covenant does an astounding job of tying into Prometheus and continuing the story of Shaw and David. The acting in this movie is spot-on, and I didn't find any of the characters to be annoying, or as stupid as the Prometheus crew. There is a twist (I won't spoil it) that has a lot of fans angry with Ridley Scott, but I don't mind it, and actually think it takes the story in a good direction. Moving on, the aliens in this movie are awesome, and look amazing. Critics have been stating that the CG on the aliens is spotty, but I didn't have ant problems with it. The design of the new creatures was unnerving, and kept me on my toes throughout the whole movie. The blood and gore of this film was just the perfect amount, and it always looked realistic and terrifying. Audio design for Covenant was incredible, from the soundtrack that feels like a callback to Alien and Aliens, to the completely unnerving, spine chilling sounds of the aliens and the eerie vibe to the sets. Overall, I had an amazing time seeing Alien: Covenant, and would highly recommend it to any Alien fan.",Alien - Covenant
1980,deepblue-50317,A well-crafted addition to the series,9,21 May 2017,"Quite frankly, I can't understand all the hate and criticism others have been handing out to Alien:Covenant. I've seen it twice and both times came away enjoying the film. Is it great? No. Is it better than Alien or Aliens? No. Yet, is it the abomination that seemingly everyone has been upset about and happily giving one star to? Hell no. In my opinion, the writers and Ridley Scott have managed to create a film that blends Prometheus and Alien, giving us a healthy dose of both. It still asks all the big questions that Prometheus did, while dishing out horror, suspense, and bloody deaths at the hands of neomorphs and xenomorphs. The scene with the ""backburster"" is one of the creepiest and best moments of the entire franchise. I honestly feel like it challenges the similar moment with Kane in Alien. Michael Fassbender is terrific as both David and Walter. Covenant continues the David's unreliability and eeriness and shows us what he's fully capable of when left to his own devices. He honestly feels as though he's above his own creator, all while creating horrible monsters himself. In my opinion, I love what they've done with his character. The story, while sometimes a bit predictable, is fun and has some twists and turns I didn't see coming. There are still some questions from Prometheus that have gone unanswered (who are the Engineers, why did they abandon us, why do they hate us, etc), but Ridley Scott isn't done with his tale. From what I understand there's one or two more films to go. Unless something goes terribly wrong, I expect that we'll all get the answers we seek. I've been a fan of the Alien series since I laid eyes on Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece, and I think he's made a solid film in Covenant. It's not perfect, but it's probably the third best out of all six films. There are some great moments, the story-line is dark and disturbing, and it's great to see the series return to its sci- fi horror roots. I know that everyone has their own opinion, but I don't understand why people are bashing this film. If it's solely because there are still plot lines and questions left on the table, just be patient and wait for the next film. Enjoy this one for what it is and be glad it's not Alien Resurrection.",Alien - Covenant
1981,robotkeijij,Not for the uneducated viewer,10,21 May 2017,"Yet again an attempt at a sci-fi/horror film that tries to inject intelligence into the genre and promote intellectual discourse and introspection is wasted on the teeming masses that only want to be spoon fed one liners, hollow virally marketed cash grabs (Yes I'm pointing a finger squarely at all of Disney's plot less, soulless, woefully tired attempts at Marvel, Star Wars, and even their own animated features), and CGI cookie cutter drivel for children.Did I enjoy this film? That should be obvious. I enjoyed Prometheus as well. Why would I enjoy films that are ""slaughtering the legacy of the original"" as so many reviewers are spouting in so many inarticulate ways? Perhaps it's because poetry, classic literature, and philosophy are interesting subjects to me. Perhaps it's because I don't let myself drown in the nostalgia puddle that keeps Michael Bay employed. Alien: Covenant, much like Prometheus is a film for a mind that enjoys being engaged. If you want to be awed by gorgeous cinematography, deep and thoughtful writing that requires you to have some understanding of the classics, or at bare minimum creates the urge in you to explore the referenced materials, then you may be the audience for this film. Scott and company are trying to give a deeper meaning to his beloved classic. This alone is laudable in a time where studios are dumbing down material to please a general public with below average intelligence and even smaller attention spans. If you hated the film and just want the sweet member berries to soothe your soul and dull your mind there is always the next Star Wars to look forward to. I will be waiting for this films sequel and enjoying the time spent questioning what other brilliant connections lie in wait. That is if the studio will back another film that only gets talked down on by viewers it was not made for in a culture that looks down on intellectual material. Please return to the original, rinse and repeat. Don't go see this film, you will leave angry that the pleasure center in your brain wasn't lit up, for all the brightness that it can give the world. For the rest of you that want to be engaged, please go judge for yourself as I'm sure a thousand venomous reviews are not going to sway you from independent thought. Be your own judge. Like it or dislike it by its merits and not your expectations.As for the haters that are pouring on one star reviews I have two simple questions: What did you want?

1982,bretthaining,Don't let the title fool you.,4,21 May 2017,"To start off, I would like to say I had high hopes for the latest installment of the Alien franchise after learning that Ridly Scott, the director of the original is once again taking the helm of the series after a pair of disappointing sequels. My initial reaction upon witnessing the first part put me at an uneasy place in regard where the film was heading, and it truly lived up to my disappointment, a sequel to Prometheus. Not that it deterred my initial impression once the film began, but I knew the film is going to star David at some point posing as the direct antagonist amongst the misshapen monsters, and boy was I right. I have to give kudos to the life like cinematography, animations and visuals, plus the actors who did a job worth applauding for, but the story itself is where the film starts to decay and spoil my interest, and when we finally witness David from Prometheus did the film its ultimate injustice to the title ""Alien Covenant"" when it was really just an extension of Scotts previous film Prometheus. Right when David got his screen time, the story started to unfold in front of me, it was absolutely predictable right to the end and the worst part of it was how the Alien itself was treated, not a monster that lords itself over our fears of the dark, but a tacked on decoration to garner an audience, and that wasn't the only gripe I had with the film, the characters themselves are also a huge flop, I didn't cared about any of them, I liked the acting but there are only few characters worth mentioning, Walter, David, the newly promoted captain, and the woman who lost her husband in the beginning. Everyone else just felt like target's set up on the range like most cliché horror movies, there just there to die, no real character development or motive, there was just to many people being casted and none of them I got attached to, especially the ones I highlighted. I felt Ridly Scott didn't take the time to flesh all of them out more, they just played their roles until a CGI monster showed up and ended their role in the story, but the most insulting thing of all is the aliens role itself, its so minor compared to David's role, and it got so little screen time despite the films title ""Alien Covenant"", when Ridly should have called ""Prometheus 2 Covenant"". I apologise if I shed too much light to the plot for those who wish to see the movie, but I felt like I had to write this as a forewarning to those who are excited to see the alien reclaim it's crown of achievement, not be overshadowed by the continued plot of a shallow film with no direction and has once again added another tally to the number of bad Alien IP. Mark my words, had the title not have been Alien let alone the Xenomorph starred its role, this movie would have struggled to gain an audience and would be forced to stand on its own feet.",Alien - Covenant
1983,nicksmith-88598,One of the Worst Movies iv Seen,2,21 May 2017,"The movie is horrible due to the fact its a Prometheus Sequel and doing a horrible job at it,Spoilers may be Present 1. The characters have no build up leading to a lack of emotion when it comes down to there death, Unlike the original alien when you have a connection with Kane.2. The Characters are just stupid, the reason for this is they don't make good decisions like risking 2000+ lives to save 3 to me it seems Like an AI feel or a retarded person which also risk the hole idea of there original Mission. 3. The build up, Simple answer is there was none. The first scene shows David and his origin yeah it makes sense if you watch Prometheus but its a dead giveaway to the movie with him reappearing within the movie, and the alien parts weren't scary because you seen them coming with dead giveaways like the ship just plain outright saying there's an alien on the ship and them trying to get rid of it was with ease and not a struggle like the original.4. Plot was Boring, The characters are on there way to a new planet to start a colony, can you thick of something more original. I mean yes its new but it doesn't give them much purpose yes there was story but what was there is garbage.5. The Ending, Legit the same ending as the game alien Colonial marines a well known game to have a terrible ending so why have the same "" OH IM GOING TO MAKE MORE MONEY ON THE NEXT MOVIE ENDING"" as a crappy video game and expect your fans to remain loyal to your franchiseall in all crappy movie that doesn't deserve to have the name alien in the title.",Alien - Covenant

While there were a few great action scenes the story it's self was highly predictable and the characters were totally forgettable with the exception of Michael Fassbender's David/Walter. Weather you liked Prometheus or not Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw in my opinion was a better character than Katherine Waterstone's Daniels. I was hoping Shaw would become the new Ripley.I myself really wanted to learn more about the engineers, the black goo they use, and why they wanted to kill us and why they created us in the first place, instead I got a run of the mill sci fi, action movie I walked out of the movie not hating the movie but not loving it either.

In fact it was unclear what there role on the colony ship was to begin with. The Daniels character was a ridiculous. Crying one minute, then a hardcore warrior next? Really? I like it how the Weyland company sends out a colony ship without looking for their CEO, it was only 10 years since his disappearance. Also they knew where he went, why not go back there? Doesn't make sense.Also when they arrive on the alien planet, which they found by blind LUCK? Everything is dead.... hmm there's also no engineer space ships, and the engineers had interplanetary travel. Fire the script writer.Noomi Rapace can act circles around Katherine Waterson. Why would you kill off Elizabeth Shaw? This looks like the same mistake that Alien 3 made. Kill off the protagonist, end her story after she's struggled so much. One big problem is that it makes Prometheus completely irrelevant now.

1989,martenasatoft,Best Alien movie since Aliens,7,22 May 2017,"I rate the movie 7/10. The 1 to 3 ratings from some reviewers is pure stupidity. Alien Covenant is a good movie although there is also room for some proportional and fair critique.Lets start with the overall story. At first there are some obvious similarities with Alien; crew captures a distress signal, deviates from mission, land on a planet, crew members get infected and brought back to the ship etc., but the transition into the second act with the ship blowing up elevates Covenant into something new and fresh. The second act is clearly the strongest part of the whole film. In it we learn among other things how the eggs in the Xenomorphs life cycle came into existence. This was particularly clever and must be praised. The entire build up for the unfolding of the eggs involves another pre-existing species, only vaguely similar to the final Xenomorph we know. This was a brave decision and apparently not everyone liked this plot twist. I think it fit well into the story though. Not only did it connect to and expanded upon the events that took place in Prometheus but also it was an integral part in the subplot that treat the religious and philosophical questions posed by AI. For everyone, as myself, who has a special interest in these questions it is gratifying that Ridley wanted to discuss them in somewhat more detail than he did in Prometheus. The dialog between the artificials David and Walter both played by an excellent and quite machine like Michael Fassbender in my opinion constitute the most memorable dialog in the film. David, the supposedly more human like of the two, understands the curiosity humans shows for the origins of their creation. He who himself already has met his own, is disappointed. He let David know ""I was not built to serve"".He feels godless and as a life form unable to feel love that specific key of course is missing in the scale in his own creation. His only loyalty is to himself and what the future holds for him. Like a smarter, at least less flamboyant, anti-Christ defying his creator but wanting to be the creator himself, he waltzes away in the ending surrounded by embryos, set out to destroy the inferior humanity. In David, Ridley has created the mother of all bad robots for the future generations. Regarding the CGI, there are some especially memorable, gritty and well-crafted scenes but mention them would create spoilers. There are enough of them to motivate the horror label but I still have the impression that the Xenomorphs were slightly misused. One main ingredient for the suspense factor in Alien and Aliens were confined spaces. This I believe is not entirely lost in Covenant, but could have been used even more. One of the most irritating moments struck at the end of the movie when they followed the creature via monitors! What an exceptionally bad idea, LOL. How suspenseful is that? When Dallas died in the air shaft in Alien they saved the image of the creature until the very last second, that's why the scene was highly effective. The whole ""get rid of it"" sequence in the third and final act unfortunately felt rushed. Visually the movie is flawless, it just amazes me: The ship, the extra ordinary details in the set designs, the mix of real and created landscapes yes even the space suits, are all beautifully designed and put together. The art department involved to create the look and feel of the movie is one talented group of people. Ridley who himself story boards all his movies and in his own right should be considered a skillful conceptual artist also seem to have a special ability for finding the right people to help bring his vision to life. For Alien it was of course Giger himself, art director Roger Christian, concept artists Ron Cobb and Jean Giraud and visual effects ace Brian Johnson. Alien Covenant and Prometheus has seen some strong concept artists such as Dane Hallet, Steve Burg, Evan Shipard and Jeremy Love. Main responsible for the art direction has been Ian Gracie that is perhaps most known for his work on Star Wars movies but his work on Pitch Black deserves a special mention. Production designer Chris Seagers has the master piece Save private Ryan under his belt for which he was nominated. With the names mentioned it's easy to understand why Covenant ended up being nothing less than visually stunning but with that said lets also not forget that Ridley always has the last word in everything and it is his mind that is the final piece of art in all this. So what could have been pretty much perfect were in fact not so. Why? Both Alien and Aliens became classics in no small parts thanks to the strong and memorable characters populating the films: Ripley, Dallas, Parker, Ash, Brett, Kane, Lambert, Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez, Bishop, Newt, Burke, I remember them all! Already after 15 minutes I knew that the casting and the characters would be the weakest point in this movie. It's sad really but no one will remember Oram, Daniels or Tennessee. There are no Yafet Kottos, no Harry Dean Stantons, no Tom Skerritts, no Michael Biehns, Bill Paxtons or Sigourneys in this one. There is however Michael Fassbender and he, as always, is the antithesis to mediocrity. I sure hope he gets the star billing because his character David/Walter is the only one on par with the immortals from the first two movies. Katherine Waterston was a nice try, but not more than that. Decent enough though to keep the interest up for the next one.",Alien - Covenant
1990,renzonokuken,A movie that tries to be unique but falls short of its queerness,1,21 June 2017,"First of all,I'm one of the die-hard fans of Alien movies, games, etc. Starting from Alien trilogy, and also Prometheus was really great (I enjoyed it a lot) but this one? it left me a really bad taste...Second,I expected a lot from the newest Alien series: Covenant. I saw the trailer, and was interested on it. I asked a group of my friends (we were 6 persons) to watch together..how I was totally mistaken! How I spent my dollars and time to watch this garbage was beyond my recognition.. I was totally stupid to expect a lot from this franchise anymore... Third,Oh boy, never I saw such an over-glorified movie! It fell short in a lot of aspects, and the most disappointing aspect was its STORYLINE and PLOT (especially the CHARACTER), the CHARACTER INTERACTION didn't make sense at all, with those useless shade of gayness of those male characters... The only redeeming points were its visual (it's to be expected though with this budget and ""holy-wood production""). The ENDING was totally bad, anticlimactic, and easily seen through from the beginning. The BACKGROUND of the characters were not explained enough, BAD MOTIVES?? WHY AND WHY THIS CHARACTER DID THIS, AND THAT??Impression Overall: Real bad, don't watch except if you want to splurge your money and time on this dimwit movie.",Alien - Covenant
1991,mkempton-65347,Massive disappointment,1,23 May 2017,"Where to start with this mess? It's almost as if the team behind this junk said ""how can we make the worst possible alien movie ever?""I know, let's steal the opening credit sequence and music from the original Alien because people will recognize that and then we wouldn't have to come up with our own unique identity. We can just bank on the nostalgia of the original and everyone will love it because they don't want original things. Let's have the crew get a random radio transmission and change their course just on a hunch that it might be a better place for the colony even though they should clearly be sticking to their carefully thought out plan. Let's have them not even tell home base. Let's not have them wait or check the surface with robots, let's just have them go straight down to the surface, even though it could take days to fully assess the situation. They just go down there right away cause the crew is too scared to get back into their pods because that one random guy died. Yeah, this isn't contrived at all. And on top of that, they won't even wear spacesuits. That's right, no protective suits on a planet they've never been to before. But hey, at least they have guns. Let's have this other random guy immediately split up with the crew and walk around like an idiot and get infected with tiny spores, even though if he'd been wearing a helmet he probably wouldn't have gotten infected at all. Let's have the guy immediately start getting sick and vomiting blood. The two other crew members will help him aboard the ship and the only thing one of them says is don't have him touch anything on the way to the room they take him to. Then his skin turns white and he starts convulsing. We're gonna have them not even strap him down or anything. Then the other lady will lock the one other lady in the room with the sick guy and they both immediately start freaking out even though it's totally unearned. No protocols, no procedures to follow it's just pandemonium, anything goes. So then the lady in the med-bay gets killed by the sick convulsing guy cause she got locked in there with him and the monster breaks loose. The other lady on the ship will shoot the alien on the inside of the ship and hit a gas tank that blows the whole ship to pieces. Nice. Oh and another guy gets infected too, so now we have two monsters running around. Next let's have David from Prometheus come out of nowhere and lead the crew to safety. There will be engineer corpses everywhere and even though it's obvious David can't be trusted let's have the crew split up. They don't even ask any questions or regroup, nothing like that, just all split up in a creepy place they've never been to before. Oh and there's a Michael Fassbender android with a southern accent so he and David can be friends and they have awkward scenes together with a flute, they kiss, and have a very lame karate chop fight. Let's have Elizabeth Shaw from Prometheus be killed off screen in a really cheap way. Anyone who actually liked Prometheus won't even get any answers to their questions. And let's have David actually be the one who creates the aliens, and he even kills all the engineers, wipes them completely out. Now the entire movie Prometheus makes even less sense and is pointless, great. So then we're gonna have all these pretentious bible references and talks about creation and philosophy cause that's exactly what people came to see when they bought a ticket to an Alien movie. Yep. Let's have the idiot captain follow David into a dark tunnel after he just saw a decapitated dead girl and even saw David being friendly with the alien and then got mad at him when he killed it. Let's have him listen to David and stick his head over an opening Alien egg. Mhmm this guy isn't dumb at all. Now the alien will burst out of his chest in 5 seconds instead of taking a day like in the original. No rules, no logic, it's whatever goes. Next let's have the remaining crew not even confirm the android's identity and make sure that Walter isn't actually David even though they look exactly alike because somehow David was able to cut his long blonde hair exactly like Walter's short brown hair even though it would've taken a professional barber with a razor to do that. He makes himself look exactly like Walter in less than 30 seconds. Yes, this is so good. Let's have the alien lose all it's mystery and allure because we are gonna explore the origins of it and it shows up for 10 minutes in the movie looking like an insect from a computer game. So good.Then we're gonna actually steal scenes and lines of dialogue from the original Alien because people loved that movie and it will remind them of that. Oh and those other two throwaway crew members are having sex in the shower, even though they should be dealing with the crazy stuff going down, but are too stupid to do their jobs and they decided to go for a quickie so we can have a really cheap slasher movie scene where they get killed in the shower. Yeah. Oh and then we're gonna do a twist that everyone can see coming from a mile away where Walter is actually David and he's been given full access to the ship by a couple of imbeciles. This movie sucks. It makes zero sense and it's a slap in the face to anyone who calls themselves a fan of the Alien franchise.",Alien - Covenant
1992,closeoverflowing,Aliens vanquished at last!,1,23 May 2017,"How does such a rich creation become devoid of any merit? How does someone who became world renown for his ability to create intelligent entertainment turn his back on previous work and simply phone in his part before cashing a paycheck? Find the answer before you waste a single moment of your life with Alien: Covenant. Imagine being enthralled with the original, inspired by the follow-up and then being let down by each successive installment. If you thought any of those latter variations paled in comparison, this one will truly astound you when you realize Sir Ridley Scott was involved.

1993,darkzoolord,It's OK!,5,24 May 2017,"I was really looking forward to this movie and went to see it opening night. I have to say I was a little disappointed. This review will contain spoilers!The Good: 1. Gorgeous special effects and a really cool futuristic look.2. Michael Fassbender as Walter and David were the highlight of the movie. Davids true villainy and disdain for humanity really showed in this movie. Walter on the other hand is a more Bishop type of android and is programmed to follow orders and have less free will than his predecessor ""David.3. The Neomorph sequence was really well done. Leeward sitting on that surgical table convulsing like a crackhead at rehab was well done. The actual back-burster scene was grotesque and filled with gore. 4. The ending was one of the best parts of the movie. It is revealed that David actually was the one who re-boarded the Covenant and stored two facehugger embryos for use on the colonists. Daniels realizes it is David right as she is put in cry and her expression is one of fear and hatred. It is also worth noting that all of Davids security clearances were accepted on the Covenant and Mother took direct orders from him and acknowledged him as David. Does this mean Covenant was destined to find him on design from the company?The Bad:1. Pacing was horrible! There would be ten minutes of edge of your seat action and then 45 minutes of talking and the characters doing nothing productive.2. Characters were forgettable! With the exception of Tennessee and Daniels I left the theater with barely any recollection of the rest of the crew. 3. This movie is not all that scary. I think the uneven pacing is the reason for this. There was no suspense and most if not all deaths were easily recognized before they happened.4. The plot made no sense and the scenario in the movie related to the ion storm was so ridiculous. - First a scientifically run mission would never launch a landing party on an unknown planet when such a storm was raging, especially a storm that knocks out all communication. -After years of scanning space for a new home they couldn't find the engineer home world? Yet they can find a less suitable planet that is 7.4 years further into space! -The crew lands on the engineer planet, with no spacesuits, no procedures, and just starts hiking into the unknown. No sane mission would enter a unknown environment with such a lack of precaution.5. My biggest gripe is that they did not explain more about what happened after the Prometheus expedition. Prometheus was such a huge ideological movie that explored so many areas of thought. This movie made me actually more appreciative of Prometheus because Covenant felt rushed with little explanation of what happened. Also the fact that they killed off Shaw so pathetically is really irritating. Shaw was a great character and had an impressive story arch; and to throw it away so quickly was a dumb move.I'd say go see it. Covenant will not wow you in any way, but a couple of the scenes are worth the price of admission.",Alien - Covenant

1996,icehazzard,"Wonderfully made movie, bad story direction.",6,24 May 2017,"I've seen a lot of plot holes in this movie. I see that they are either moving in a direction to dismiss the less popular installments in the franchise or are choosing to try and explain them in a far more difficult fashion.Someone has an obsession with the creations of creations destroying the creators. And altho I did love the film, it will do irreparable damage to the franchise. But It's canon now, so this is what we get. The black goo could have been so much more and could have been tied in better to the story.The synthetics What people are saying are plot holes, mostly don't bother me so much and can easily be argued away with people being stupid, or maybe we missed something.But please god. Somebody explain to me how David could cut and dye his hair without anyone batting an eyelash. LITERALLY, NOBODY GAVE A DAMN. And on top of that, nobody stopped to ask the question of whether or not Walter had been replaced with David. Being that the last time they had been seen they looked identical, save the clothing and the hand.Maybe they were shaken up. Maybe they were fooled by David 8's near-perfect performance as Walter.

It wasn't perfect, but I enjoyed every single minute of it. Honestly, I don't know what you wanted to see, a brainless Xenomorph massacre with numerous jump scares? Gladly, this movie is more than that, I really liked that the crew wasn't prepared for a situation like this. Guys really, some of you said that they are idiots, but what would you do in the same situation (well it's pretty hard to imagine a situation like this), I bet you would freak out as well, and exploding the ship accidentally would be the smallest mistake you make. After all, this movie has a great atmosphere just like the first alien movies, but it tried to give meaning to the Xenos, to be more than a space bug who kills everything that crosses his path. The David line was great, maybe there are too many movies about AI trying to exterminate humanity, but none of them have ever made a biological weapon like the Alien.

When will people making these movies finally realize that it is not interesting to watch a movie where nothing makes sense. There must be logic, reason and a story. Alien Covenant has nothing of it.

True, this one has Aliens in it, but the overall feel of everything is very much Prometheus. So for that reason, I would consider it a fine sequel.People criticize Ridley Scott for going back into this universe for a good reason. It sheds light on a franchise that maybe should have been left in the dark.Whether you approve of Ridleyt Scott's choice, has nothing to do with how good the movie is. If you are not curious of what he has to say today about something that was done by him in 1979, then don't watch the movies, stay home. We had no problem ignoring the existence of Alien 3, Alien: Resurrection and the horrible Alien vs. Predator universe. Why stop here?But if you are curious enough to watch these movies, you saw Prometheus and came back for more, try to judge the film for what it is...This is the best thing that happened to Alien since Aliens (1986) by James Cameron. Which is not saying a lot, but still better than expected.It continues the story of Prometheus well enough and delivers some really good horror scenes that were actually scary. New concepts we are not familiar with shake up everything we know and give us a very small taste of what it felt like watching Alien for the first time and not knowing what to expect.The acting of Michael Fassbender and Katherine Waterston is great, way better than the rest of the cast which I think were not held up to the same standards. The soundtrack was also great with some really well placed music, sounds and background noise.The problem with the film: It's a huge mess.I honestly believe that this is the one true reason why this movie and its previous installment are a disappointment to most. There's too much going around. The film refuses to focus on one thing, It tries to catch as much as possible, but fails to do anything to perfection.My biggest disappointment is the lack of practical effects. How come that in the year 2017 with a movie done by a director with so much experience from a time you had to build Alien puppets and uniform, we still don't understand that highly visible close-up CGI looks like crap. Noting looked real enough in this moive and the illusion was broken pretty early.Beside that you have a few typical cinema sins, but I really don't care much for those.

2007,wolfgangbench,Alien Covenant is a grower,9,27 May 2017,"A little spoiler free advice for the utterly disappointed:While I admit that after my first viewing of this movie I felt a little bit of a let down as well, I must say that many of the 1 star reviews over here are absolutely exaggerated.This is what I did: After my first viewing I noticed that the movie had a couple of problems, but I saw enough interesting things that made me go back to the cinema to check it out again. I owed that to myself being a huge fan of Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), Alien3 (1991) and Prometheus (2012).What did I find out? Many things are easily overseen during the first viewing, which is why I would recommend to those that are not completely drowning in hysteria to watch it again.I watched it 6 times now, and I still acknowledge a couple of the negative points, namely:1) Some character choices 2) The execution of the last 25 minutes of movie EXCLUDING the ending scene 3) The fact that the movie was heavily cut. 122 minutes of run time is fine, but it is easily seeable that a lot of stuff - especially for the benefit of further character development and one notorious action scene - was deleted. I'm really keen to see how the director 's cut will look like. 4) Foreseeable plot twistBut, and I mean this in all sincerity, the movie really grows on me, so here are the positives:1) The movie does not undo Prometheus, it is actually quite the opposite and many questions from that movie are being answered. IF, and yes, this is a big IF, one takes the time to watch the movie a second time, because many answers are not thrown at us blatantly, but do become obvious, which I like very much 2) Fassbender is great from the get go, but now I can truly appreciate Waterston, McBride and Seimetz for their performances as well. Waterston is not little Ripley, she is a totally different personality and reminded me a bit of Private Hudson in Aliens (1986), playing the ""voice of the audience"", of course with a totally different attitude. 3) The future: Scott will deliver two additional movies, and the running order is this one: (1) Prometheus (2) NEW: Alien Awakening (3) Alien Covenant (4) NEW last movie before we dock onto Alien (1979). He has said this on many occasions, and the way Alien Covenant works in its own right and clears many questions out of the way, while at the same time asking new ones provides a WONDERFUL setting for the new Alien Awakening movie, especially if we consider the ending of Alien Covenant.Again, give this movie another chance, in my humble opinion it really pays of.",Alien - Covenant

Two- the story line of a bunch of people sent to colonize another planet and run into the Alien seemed like a great storyline. Unfortunately, I was mostly disappointed. It is not as bad as many of the reviews on here, but it isn't good. Some thoughts: - the colonists who are going to another world? Not really a part of the movie. They are the backdrop for the crew fighting the Alien. But you never see any of them.The Alien? Not as scary as in past movies and really isn't the focal point. A deranged android is the focal point.-an earthlike plant with native people.....but again, brought up but not significant in the story.An android goes off the deep end but starts kissing another android then a human. Right after teaching the other android to play the flute. Yes...it was that bizarre. Those scenes added nothing to the movie and were boring.Bottom line--- the move just seemed to meander with no real direction, except to have lots of people killed, an exciting get away, Alien makes it on the getaway vehicle only to be killed. They had a good story about a couple thousand colonists going to a planet yet that part of the story disappeared quickly. A native people totally ignored.

2013,thecallofcreepypasta,Alien Covenant: Not Actually About The Covenant,6,28 May 2017,"Alien Covenant is a chestburster within the host of Prometheus 2. Only problem is, this one can't get out of it's host body, hopelessly ramming against its chest cavity with no exit in sight. (Okay, bad metaphor over)The meat and bones of Alien:Covenant is that it is really Prometheus 2 masquerading as a prequel to Alien. For the first act of the movie, it really is a thrilling and incredibly well done Alien film, a true successor to the mantle of those that came before it. Scenes in the medbay still give me chills whenever I review them. The soundtrack and mood are incredible. It nails the atmosphere and the aesthetic of the series.Yet, the moment Michael Fassbender's character reappears, the film figuratively (and literally) reveals its true face. All of the film's packaging goes out of the way to convince you this is an Alien movie, but it's not. Not to say that Prometheus is necessarily bad in its own right, but when it's crammed in a movie that spent its entire first act as ANOTHER MOVIE, it breaks our immersion and enjoyment as audiences.The film quickly transitions to Prometheus 2, you know, the god complex theology that we all knew from the first film. The entire second act is spent delving into deeper questions and it would be actually pretty riveting, if we hadn't spent the first act in a different movie. The third act desperately tries to recapture everything it did right in the first act, but there are so many plot holes and bad decisions made by our supposed protagonists that it soils it. Throwing the brakes on their good Alien movie to take a ""Prometheus break"" tears apart the film in a way it doesn't recover from. The ending also may upset viewers from is high implausibility and reliance of stupidity of the people we are supposed to be rooting for. Now, I know what you may be thinking by now, ""This is a Prometheus sequel, not an Alien film, so why are you ribbing on this film?"" Well, the movie is literally named ""*ALIEN*:COVENANT"". The poster for the film was thought to be the Xenomorph of old (actually called a protomorph). Jed Kurzel's soundtrack (which is 12/10 amazing) makes so many callbacks to the original soundtrack and feel of the first film. This was intentionally marketed as an ALIEN film. So either, a.) I was severely duped and need to suck it up or b.)Statements that this was always just a Prometheus sequel are wrong. It is still a cut above the standard movies that come out these days, but suffers from the same tragedy that most Alien movies do past ALIENS: They had too big of shoes to fill. There is no reason for a movie directed by the same man, with such a sound lore and amazing history, to be as lukewarm as it was. That is all, hope you enjoyed it! BA.",Alien - Covenant
2014,davidmorgan-84744,A considered opinion,7,28 May 2017,"The extremely negative reviews this film has been getting from some users is completely out of order. To give a film 1 out of 10 it surely needs to be inept in every department. 'Alien Covenant' has a lot going for it despite it's flaws It seems these days that film studios pay too much attention to fans & online feedback & the results are often well-intentioned but messy. Some fanboy's wanted answers to the questions raised in 'Prometheus' & others wanted a more 'Alieny' type movie. This compromise is the result In it's defence it's under no obligation to provide answers & could merely serve as a straightforward horror romp forming a bridge to a bigger story. I found it very entertaining, well acted, visually stunning & boldly visceral. Shame on the fools giving knee-jerk 1 star reviews which should be reserved for the likes of 'Showgirls'",Alien - Covenant

2016,kstamatov,Really disappointed !!!,1,29 May 2017,"I went to the cinema with big expectation, because the Prometheus movie was not bad at all and the covenant trailer was promising. Unfortunately what I experienced, almost make me leave the cinema hall before the movie end. So unrealistic story... Imagine galactic ship with a mission carrying 2000 people and few thousand embrions, receive some signal with unknown source and just decide to abort the mission and go investigate on a unknown planet. There is a storm, but safety is not important, the most of the crew just go with there single vessel. Then they go out on the unknown planet and they don't use any kind of environment protection suits!!! And there are many more stupid acts, non typical for a space ship crew, but maybe for 5 year old children playing video game. Totally disappointed!!! The worst Alien movie ever!",Alien - Covenant
2017,moisestiagopereira,Sincerely don't understand what people wanted with this,10,29 May 2017,"My overall rating for this film is just Superb. Don't have any more words to describe it. Scott was able to transform a action flick from the 80's based on ""flee the bug, squash the bug"" script to something really meaningful. The utter man's arrogance, and the engineer species similar treat is just described here with an utmost genius and subtle way. The Wagner ""Entry of the Gods in Valhala"" (the 3º Reich approved author) and the references to Alexander the great has reference to humanity's utmost arrogance and stupidity are brilliantly chosen to describe David's thoughts and actions in this film. And the brilliancy to not giving importance to the Alien's origin's and declassify the God nature of the engineer species helped not complicate and sparse the script. The worst fear that I had on this movie was the I would leave the cinema thinking, well, just one more alien movie was totally debunked after watching this magnificent master piece. Brilliant! Cannot wait to see the trilogy final movie! :)",Alien - Covenant
2018,zreyn-54315,"Good Movie, Great Tie In",9,29 May 2017,I was thoroughly impressed with the movie. I was hoping for a tie in between Prometheus and the Alien movies and that's what I got. I really enjoyed the movie and how it tied both franchises together. The only disappointment to me is that the Aliens are more an engineered species and not naturally occurring but that is a minor detail and more a personal preference. If you are a fan of Prometheus and the Alien movies you should see this movie.,Alien - Covenant
2019,lokipopster,Not worth the £ at the cinema,1,29 May 2017,"Really looked forward to this, utterly appalling! Basically just a rehash of all other Alien films, so lazy & unoriginal.Could have saved time & just spliced old films together. Tempted to give up half way.

2020,braveheartrm-22619,See for yourself. Don't listen to the reviews.,9,29 May 2017,"Don't listen to the reviews. The movie is intense, suspenseful and will keep you intrigued. The story is highly underrated, and connects the dots well - but you have to listen to the dialog in between the action - or you'll miss how it fleshes out. Yes, just like in every movie of this genre, victims at times make poor decisions. Overall, I think it was an excellent movie. See Alien: Covenant for yourself, and decide.I look forward to seeing it again.",Alien - Covenant
2021,sqrd-87418,Open your mind,9,29 May 2017,"I have read other reviews on other websites and those who gave this film a low rating needs to stop watching all the terrible super man movies. It clogs the brain of good movie making.. Not much CGI, they built most of the sets and it was well worth it. Everything about the movie was innovated and new to the story line. In order to be a good director you must have vision along with a story. There were lots of stories which is great for another installment possibly in the future. Most gave the Star wars new movie high rating because everyone knows the narrative. Hasn't anyone notice it was pretty much the same movie as the original? Aliens as a whole was enjoyable movie to watch with good slow parts and quick to tell a story in an action packed movie. Again its easy to go see a movie like the Marvel comics and get trapped with no story line. Have a bad guy and a few good guy and boom you already know the ending of the film. Ridley Scott took great risks to make this movie and he is a stand alone visionary with more to offer than people making movies with all CGI. Take a step back and appreciate the scenery, don't go in with to much expectations and you will come out with the hopes of another movie down the road. Everyone makes remakes of the same movie of yesterday, no vision just in it for the mighty dollar. The last Transformers bombed in the states and sky rocketed around the world. No one makes movies like this anymore. Ridley if you do make another movie go for it, you haven't ruined the aliens franchise you open many new doors.",Alien - Covenant

I have just got home from watching Alien Covenant and I have to say I really enjoyed it. OK so the Aliens didn't scare me but they have been around that long now its to be expected. The character who really scared me was David, he has now become the monster and what makes him so scary is that the monster sits behind a handsome face and impeccable manners. The Xenomorphs do what they do to survive and based on pure instinct as any animal would but David does what he does by choice and hes a very sick and twisted puppy. :) that's all",Alien - Covenant
2023,codyh-44212,One of the top 5 worst movies I've seen,1,31 May 2017,Wow. What the heck were these people thinking when they made this movie? The Texas Chainsaw Massacre had less gore/blood/guts than this movie. It was so bad I was starting to think it was supposed to be some sort of sick comedy.Pros:1. It was a sci fi 2. It was in space and vaguely interesting 3. Tickets weren't too expensiveCONS:1. The whole movie sucked 2. Too much blood and guts 3. The plot was a mess 4. Typical dumb characters doing horror movie type stuff like following people down dark hallways to look at aliens by themselves. 5. Androids f*ck everything up as usual 6. Felt like a repeat of Prometheus 7.

The characters not too dumb. The technical movie aspects well done.The only thing is. There are so many good stories everywhere. So many good ideas to be put in to film. Why all these repetitious sequels. Why all these more of the same movies. Why not pick a daring script an bring something NEW???",Alien - Covenant
2026,eduprr,"Great film but not perfect, if there's such thing.",7,3 June 2017,"I've read many negative reviews about Alien Convenant. Some have compared it with Marvel movies but in my opinion it is absurd. Now, I have been a fan of science fiction for decades, I've seen all the Alien movies and after reading some of the bad reviews I almost gave up going to the cinema and watch it for myself. I'm glad I did go, and what can I say... it is indeed a good Alien movie. Riddley Scott has done a good job here. I think that sometimes our expectations are set too high above and because of it we can't seem to appreciate things the way we should. It is a dark, sometimes scary, intense movie. But I have to agree, it is always about the same thing... aliens, terror, being powerless to defeat them, survival... Great special effects too. I think the movie is too short. There are things that should have been explained in order to establish a better connection between Prometheus and Alien Convenant. I'm not going to talk about details... don't want to spoil that magical (or not) feeling of going to the movies and watch, once again, a great sci-fi movie signed by Riddley Scott. Pardon my English but I'm foreigner. All in all, a 7. Better than Prometheus, indeed.",Alien - Covenant

2028,sashknows,2 major mistakes blew this films credibility for me,5,4 June 2017,"This is a notable spoiler so stop reading if you've not seen it.At the end of the film Walter and David fight. The outcome of that battle is never clear due to cameras cutting to another scene before the fight is over. Walter hesitates on leaving the Engineers Fortress, it's not clear if it's Walter or David at this time due to a conversation moments earlier towards the end of the battle with Walter and David about which side Walter is on. We assume Walter has won initially when he rushes to the aid of the 2 injured individuals trying to get back to the ship. It soon become apparent in the medical bay that something is amiss when Walter tries to cover the missing hand he lost in a an earlier fight suggesting the wounds are not identical and this was self inflicted to look like Davids. This is the clearest early evidence Walter is in fact David.Daniels (The primary female actress played by Katherine Waterstone) and David fight. This fight occurs before the final Walter and David fight mentioned above. During that fight, Daniels stabs David under the chin with her metal necklace pin. David doesn't have the ability to self heal, he needs stitches later. How did this wound heal? How does Daniels not notice this when she actively stitches him up in the medical bay right at the end? Why does David not change the trajectory of the ship back to earth if he is so intent on destroying the human race? Why does he continue with the original mission at the end to the new planet?The effects were better in Prometheus, as was the costume design. The mass poisoning of the Engineers was a bit too easy, it was a scene that had a huge amount of work only to last a few seconds. I enjoyed the dialogue between David and Walter and the opening scene with Weylan.",Alien - Covenant
2029,carminefazz,What a waste of $97 Million Dollars,1,29 October 2017,"By far the worst Alien movie ever made....This thing and Prometheus should not have even been made. Total non-sense. On their way to a new home world, Covenant (a word which means ""promise"") is damaged and the crew decide to make a left turn at the closest star and head for a planet that is closer. A planet NEVER before seen, heard of, or explored. Crew members start to die off one by one, while other crew members enjoy tea and music in other parts of the dwelling cave. Every single protocol of space flight and exploration are intentionally violated to the point where the illogical points of the story become distracting. Who writes this stuff? a 6th grader??

2030,russellbatten-11281,Unbelievably Horrible,1,5 June 2017,"First off I want to state that I am a HUGE Alien Fan. I of course have seen all the movies but as well have read almost every novel about this incredible horror sci-fi creature that has been published. After watching this film I walked out the theater asking myself ""What in the world did I just watch?"". Along with the other reviews of completely horrible decisions by characters, the overall story and plot are ruining this franchise. The writers for these stories need to be dismissed as well as the director Ridley Scott. This franchise has the capacity to be a huge ongoing story for our new generation. Instead it is being buried. The idea that the entire Alien species was developed by some android in the future is preposterous and sorely takes away the intrigue that made us love and fear these creatures. For those who want to watch a film about an Android that is contemplating his existence and where he falls into the grand scheme of the universe this film is for you. The title should have referenced that instead. For those who are looking for a film about the Alien creatures (Xenomorphs) save your time and composure and just watch the originals. I apologize for not being as eloquent and detailed as other reviews but this is my first review. That shows that this movie was so horrible I felt the overwhelming need to say something and inform others before they make the same mistake I did. Thanks for reading.",Alien - Covenant

2034,dxzs,Pretty disappointing - again,5,11 June 2017,"Similar to most of Ridley Scott's latest iterations of the Alien franchise, Covenant unsurprisingly ends up as a disappointment. As with most Hollywood productions, it's all about the squeezing as out many dollars as possible, without offering much creativity in script writing. The movie is more closely related to a Michael Bay blow-it-all-up, rather than the original trilogy. The most annoying about this movie however, is how incredibly implausible most of it is. The ""soldiers"" and ""scientist"" obviously only did the minimal online training. Further, self proclaimed Atheist Ridley Scott, seems obsessed with making movie goers believe in a ""creator."" Kudos however for describing one of the characters of faith as an extremist. You can safely wait until it's available for streaming or Blue-Ray.",Alien - Covenant

Let's start from the original ""Alien"" of 1979 – spaceship's (Nostromo) crew was attacked by some super strong, acid-blood, super clever beast with ability to survive in the open space (how unbelievable is that story, if you are so picky about plot of Covenant?). In the original ""Alien"" the monster was called as magnificent and desired weapon, ant that it was unbelievable that such creature existed naturally. So now we have an explanation how it became so undefeatable. So those who raise questions about plot holes and boringness – note that Covenant (and Prometheus – although I did not see it back then without the whole picture) provided quite logical explanation, how the alien became what it is. Or you expected some other explanation? – for example – it naturally evolved and is a creature of evolution of millions of years in some distant planet? C'mon There were some goofs (for example, absence of the nail hole in jaw chin of David, crew being so feisty just after wake up from few years sleep, gravity on the Covenant, etc. – but such goofs can be found on any movie.

2044,marcotjokro,Worth your time,9,28 June 2017,"It was comforting tonight walking into 'Alien: Covenant', the sixth installment of the series counting 'Prometheus' but not the awful 'Alien-vs-Predator', knowing that it was directed by the original 'Alien' & auteur director Ridley Scott. Many would agree that the first two, 'Alien' & 'Aliens' were two of the best horror/sci-fi films of all time and with great reasons aplenty. The movie opened with a brief but deep philosophical conversation between an Android & its human creator which, in a nutshell, formed the basis of the plot. From then on it was a ride of familiarity, but a rather exciting one, on-board a spaceship with a mission to inhabit a new planet with 15 crews on board including an Android. Successions of accidents & incidents quickly introduced the human characters, many were given 'blinked-and-you- missed-it' screen time. The excitement quadrupled as soon as 'that signature first attack' by the parasite happened on screen. The way an embryonic alien bursts out of an egg or one's torso and face-hugged its victims still shock like it was the first time. Just when you think it was all a bit too familiar the second act quickly diverted deep into 'Prometheus' territory and clearly established the new direction to the plot - one where the aliens no longer always taking the center stage. The final act had all the spectacular & thrilling action pieces we had come to expect from the A-monster, the femme-fatale factor, a 'new' villain and, of course, a sequel (yes!). This movie is a Michael Fassbender's vehicle into the franchise (and he was terrific) with newcomer Katherine Waterston as the heroine playing a convincing second fiddle. In the reliable hands of Ridley Scott, this movie pulsated with great balance between riveting action pieces and quieter moments of philosophical exchanges.",Alien - Covenant

This was boring and unnecessary, the answer when need weren't deliver + nothing new, i agree with those who say Ridley Scott has a man-crush on Michael Fassbender because he RUINS the Alien franchise to make a film about David the robot and it was very predictable it was him instead of Walter, plot is beyond stupid.",Alien - Covenant

If you expect to see an Alien movie with buck load of shots being fired, good ol' flame thrower, lots of acid spills (you know what i mean!), scores of brutal skirmishes between soldiers & ... you know what! Then Covenant may not suit your taste as much. Alien: Covenant is about STORY, CHARACTERS, ENVIRONMENT, AMBIANCE and man o man! DIALOGUES! Some of the BEST written lines in delivered in some of the best ways possible by Michael Fassbender! Watch the movie, listen to every line he says, CLOSELY & you will know what i mean. Acting, the ship's captain has done a good job. He accepts that he may be incompetent for the job and acts precisely like that! The main lead Katherine Waterson, madam, you deserve a STANDING salute! Her expressions THROUGH OUT THE MOVIE are SO real (the ending scene IN SPECIFIC!) The crew, is just the crew & is OK! Sound effects, CGI (graphics), skirmishes, action and the FLOW of the movie, as can be expected from sir Ridley Scott is TOP NOTCH! It is the most mature, distinct movie in the Alien series till date. There is going to be a group of people who may not like it. for reasons mentioned above, it is DIFFERENT! with an ending which may give some of you, nightmares!

I kind of agree. This latest installment is an example of lazy screen writing and lack of imagination. The visuals in the movie are (as anyone would expect in a Ridley Scott movie) breathtaking. Unfortunately the stupidity of the characters is equally breathtaking. Cinema at its finest captivates you and immerses you fully into a story. That illusion is easily disrupted when you see characters behaving in such a non sensical fashion that instead of focusing on the story you become aware of plot machinations at work.SPOILERS FOLLOW: The initial landing team explores an untested atmosphere of an alien world without environmental suits, what can possibly go wrong? But that idiot plot moment is actually upstaged by the action of a character that even Patrick(from Spongebob fame) would not be dumb enough to do. Billy Crudups character actually looks into an alien egg pod upon the assurance of David (the murderous android) that ""it's perfectly safe"".What a howler! The movie is filled with action and moves at a brisk pace, but the bottom line is the actions of the characters are just too unbelievable for this to be rated anything above a 5 in my book.",Alien - Covenant
2053,randycarter-21098,Another great.,10,16 July 2017,"I am gonna have to give it a 10 out of 10. Undeniable sci-do fan and fanatical Alien fan. There was never a movie like it...never. I hated the main female hero, but I've always hated Sigorney Weaver. Ridley Scott directed Alien and Blade Runner. Two of the greatest sci-fi films EVER...period. Both before CGI. He was actually off the hook, never needing to direct another film again. He took on a remake of his own film...twice! Predictable and rehashed by other directors for decades, that, aside from Aliens and oddly enough Prometheus, are pretty unremarkable. Great film, great director, great legacy. And a great ending....?",Alien - Covenant

I repeat - Do not watch this awful and terrible movie. This movie has destroyed the allure of the Aliens horror movies. Heck this isn't anything about aliens and instead its about an android with daddy issues. It has no emotion, no character buildup, and just plain and simple one hell of a boring and stupid movie.

This is just great...Game over man!,1,21 July 2017,"Spoiler alert...Oh hang on, there are nothing to spoil, the ""movie"" just did that to itself.Coming out of the theater stunned at the idiocy of the script, I felt as I've been conned and then hammered in the head; pondering how could such thing be? How could it pass the whoever control and manage the quality of this retardation? The least they could do is to make a little effort in the logical and consistency department.The characters are so stupid and predictable I was routing for the hideously made creature to just finish them off so I can go home. And by the way, that 'captain' would not pass a janitor in a fictional situation, never mind a real life one.Anyway, the first four movies, even the ""worst"" Alien III was ahead of its time compared to this, even Prometheus was not bad in spite of the link between it and this rubbish.Now, thanks to Mr Scott, every time I want to go back to wash the bitter taste of that trash called ""Alien: Covenant"" by watching the old classic part I and II, I have to remember that this infamous alien creature's existence is owed on an accidental error in some old android software.I think this will be the last of the Alien franchise; it's been killed there and then, a reboot will not happen in the foreseeable future.Let's hope the upcoming Predator movie would not end up like this.",Alien - Covenant
2057,g-m-v,What a poor excuse for an Alien franchise product,1,22 July 2017,"To be frank, after watching this money laundering disguised as a film I needed some time to recover. And I did not intend to write a review at all - but then I realised that I had to at least vote to become a voice of resistance to the now well established Hollywood blunder of using highly acclaimed and beloved film titles to lure unsuspecting visitors into the theatres to steal their money and time. This scheme is far scarier than anything portrayed in 'Alien: Covenant', which is just ridiculous in its failure to deliver a logical plot, plausible characters, suspense, believable CGI or scary aliens. With that amount of budget it is almost an achievement in itself. So Ridley Scot either does not care what is happening to the franchise and has no regard for the fans (or any intelligent film-goer, for that matter) or he simply suffers from a mental condition that impairs his perception of reality and therefore leaves him incapable of directing films anymore ... and no one dares to tell him.So please, Ridley: stop it! Now!",Alien - Covenant
2058,rackapulsare-59763,I love it.,10,18 July 2021,"When this movie was initially released I thought it was just okay. I den rewatch tin213 nothing is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I am a huge Alien fan I have bookshelves full of books about the movies. I play the role playing game have played several of the computer games. The Alien move franchise is dear to my heart. I think that the flaw of the movie is that it is not enough action for the action fans and not enough horror for the horror lovers, but to me that is not the point, the point is to ask the mega questions: what is the origin of life on earth? What will be humanities downfall?",Alien - Covenant
2059,idonttrustgovernment,"Good movie, but the government brainwashed every critic on this site",7,29 July 2017,"Now i've seen reviews like these posted for other countless movies, and i think people writing these reviews are dumb dumbs. Why are you often comparing a mediocre movie to god damn ""The Shawshank Redemption""? And not to mention the fact that these people kick it up a notch by thinking they are some sort of critics or something, you're only a critic as far as your opinion goes. And these critics go so far as to even rate a movie with a score of 1 ,in my opinion that is such a pile of crap, honestly. This movie in particular had outstanding visuals,and little less outstanding CGI, but nonetheless the CGI wasn't as terrible as in the third movie of this franchise, yet there are still some people complaining how CGI is crap, oh come on, its not like you work as freaking special effect producer, so shut up! Now back to the movie, since the reviews are meant for an average viewer i highly recommend it, not so much if you are a fan of the franchise, because the movie might not live up to your expectations. Any how, this movie is not the greatest and certainly not my favorite (because they didn't put in god damn James Franco in the actual movie) in the franchise, but it has pretty nice narrative and not as many plot holes as i initially expected before watching this movie. So if you're looking for good Friday movie this could be a good choice",Alien - Covenant
2060,Cinemanian,Really disappointing conclusion to Prometheus,6,30 July 2017,"I was really disappointed by this movie. The ending of Prometheus had so much potential for an interesting sequel, unfortunately Alien Covenant introduced a bunch of new boring characters, all of whom acted really stupid and it was hard to believe that anyone of them was a real scientist. Also as a horror movie it wasn't even scary at all... Every time something interesting started to happen it just ended abruptly, without building up any tension and suspense. But especially the depiction of the Engineers was strange. It made me think about this topic quiet a bit and i eventually wrote an article about it on my blog, to speculate about the true nature of the Engineers.

A worthy watch that stands along side the rest of the franchise.",Alien - Covenant
2062,macdefcon,What is the problem here? (Spoiler),7,8 August 2017,"So many bad reviews about this movie. Most of them because the movie wasn't realistic enough? The crew didn't make realistic decisions, etc etc. It's a movie folks. These bad reviewers are just whiners. Who goes to an ALIEN movie expecting a solid storyline? You go to watch people get mauled by xenomorphs and watch things pop out of people's chest. If all of these bad reviewers made this movie, no one would die and there would be no aliens because the crew would be perfect and not land on the questionable planet. They would stay on coarse and start a colony on the intended planet. End of movie, roll credits. Yes, the crew makes bad decisions. Yes , people in the real world would not do what these guys do. Yes there are some story flaws. The alien grows at an accelerated rate from other movies. Yes they walk on the new planet without space suits. (These are all complaints from other reviews).maybe the crew is incompetent. And so what if there is an airborne method of the spores being ingested. Who cares? Maybe the filmmakers are trying to introduce new things to the franchise to freshen it up. Every other alien movie has a crew making decisions that end up getting them killed. This is no different. As far as I am concerned, this fits right in with the other movies in the franchise and it's certainly better than 3 and 4. The only issue I had was the length. There could have been a lot cut out without taking away from the story (ie. the flute scene)Overall , this movie gets off to a good start and has good action throughout, but also some boring stuff in between. The story is flawed, but not flawed enough to give it 1/10 stars. Don't listen to all those whining reviews that such and such wouldn't happen in real life. It's a movie. Most of those reviews are written by people who need to put down the dungeons and dragons and get out of their parents basement for some sunshine. The special effects were great and the movie is visually amazing. The new alien creatures were a nice touch and there are some new twists on old gimmicks. I think it works well with building up to the first alien and I'm looking forward to the next one!!",Alien - Covenant
2063,maximus-67617,Ummmm,2,5 August 2017,"This is more a review about the professional movie critics, is there an Editors Cut they didn't release to the public. How this movie can be rated any higher than 5 stars is beyond me. It fails in every aspect other than the visualization, everything else is utter trash and is insulting to the original Alien franchise. Ridley Scott has basically joined George Lucas and Peter Jackson in creating prequels that take the shine off what are classic franchises. My advise to would be viewers is don't read the professional reviews they have either been paid off or still live in the 1980's horror and don't require a quality story line, or a character you want to cheer for, or anyone of actual intelligence in the movie. Even Magneto couldn't save this one.",Alien - Covenant
2064,storken-74863,| The ego strikes back |,1,6 August 2017,"What I think it boils down to is this. When a director is young and not a big name yet he is restrained and surrounded by a team that have say in the movie. This is Scott working on Alien or George Lucas working on Starwars in the 70's-80's. Decades later the movies have become cult classics and the best in their genre. Most of the fame and praise is given to the director for some reason and they become gods. Creative geniuses that practically made the movies themselves. So now, decades later they're given more of less free hands to work their magic.The word of Lucas and Scott now law and much less challenged, surrounded by yes-men and star-struck workers who don't dare speak up, give us their vision, unclouded by collaboration or technical limitation. Like mad children they weave and cast their spells wielding the power of computer animation high on their (dubiously earned) laurels.Can you really blame them? They've been heralded as stars and geniuses, that kind of thing corrupts most people, boosting their egos, extinguishing doubt, hard work and second guessing. I'm a star, I'm expected to deliver, I can't be wrong, this is how I see it, asking other people for input or taking criticisms to heart? That diminishes their rank... shows weakness and doubt. I'm the captain of a hundred million dollar ship, I must lead with vision and strength.Understandable.Well we see what happens with this kind of pressure / thinking / ego tripping. Sullied legacies, ruined franchises.But hey, OK, it's your brand, your franchise, you want to cash in on the brand and make millions of dollars for your family and children's futures, most people would.Never mind humbling yourself to realize you didn't make those movies, many people did, all I and I'm sure many other fans tentatively ask is... just try. Please just put at least some effort into your work.The sloppy filmmaking in Prometheus and Covenant is just a waste of our time.

I've only started since last night watching Prometheus (2012) and decided to binge this franchise. I don't understand why are there so many critics from many ""professional"" reviews, I suppose they could not enjoy the film as a normal cinema go-er and had to display their over- rated review skill; perhaps it's my personal opinion. If Ridley Scott ever reads my review, know that I support this Alien franchise and appreciate the hard work you put into filming this! Thank you for your commitment to the film, and I hope that others may be able to appreciate these films as I do.",Alien - Covenant
2067,umudmp,If you're going to expand the universe of the single best horror sci-fi movie of all time... maybe you should at least try.,1,10 August 2017,"Same lazy filmmaking as Prometheus and suffers exactly the same flaws.-Lazy, inadequate character introductions / developments. -Very poor writing (both dialog and story). -Too much focus on visuals.The script made me think/feel like it was written by a high schooler. Oddly enough when this hit me about 1/3rd into the movie I realized I had forgotten that the exact same insight had struck me when watching Prometheus. The frequent use of the f-bomb in this movie could possibly be a homage back to the third movie, Alien 3, which was notorious back in its time for the liberal use of the word. This was even parodied in a scene in the fourth film. Known as ""the fork scene"". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUhnK4Jho8MAnyway, the dialog is childish and bad.The Christian character. ""Hey guys I'm Christian and I have faith OK, don't bully me."" You know a more subtle and cinematic way of translating this to the audience might have been to just have the camera raise up from the floor, up along a sitting man's legs then to his hands holding a bible and maybe rosary beads. His face in contemplation. A while later we are shown this man jovially mocked by another member of the crew for his faith.But no, we'll just go with the character announcing his motivations/beliefs in the most unpolished way possible.Oh and let's also have him use the most cliché Christian parables, and I do mean THE MOST cliché and well known ones. In an awkward way too. At one point he, as the captain, needs to regroup his people, and uses the ""gather my flock"" analogy. It makes you cringe, it's forced, it's bad. I mean... why not use lesser known Christian analogies / parables? Something that sounds religious and will have people wondering, oh cool, was that Christian? I'll have to look that up. Oh cool it was, thanks Alien Covenant I learned something.But no. we'll just put the single most cliché ones in like we just wrote it down from memory and couldn't even be bothered to see if there was something better we could use or smarter we could do with it.See why I'm arguing a high schooler wrote this?There's just too many dumb decisions made by the crew to go over so I'll leave that.The film seems to struggle with what it wants to be. Is it a horror movie? Is it an action movie?Sure seems more like the latter. At one point you have two cyborgs fighting hand to hand in a fight sequence copy pasted from the Matrix.I just don't see how that belongs in an Alien movie. The aliens, engineers, biological weapons, slippery blood and IQ relieved crew aren't enough dangers? We need kung-fu robots in the mix too apparently.You see the problem here? There's just so much danger around, nothing is scary. The characters are so lazily introduced and developed we don't care about them at all.Take a look at the first Alien movie which is legit scary to this day. The first action scene doesn't happen until what? halfway through the movie? When the guy has his chest burst. We've walked on LV-426 with these guys, we've had breakfast with them, we've seen them at their jobs, in their underwear and interacting with each other for half the movie before things get wild.You have a curve of tension, fear and action that slowly gather pace along the entire movie which then culminates in an intense nerve-wracking climax. Here's the trailer for Alien. It works on the same concept. Mood, immersion, then tension that escalates and culminates. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n75AEkRrwJg--- Covenant is more like a modern super hero movie. With hollow plastic characters, bad dialog, awful pacing, dumb plot elements left unexplained like no helmets on an alien world etc etc... the list is endless.Another thing that makes me think the Prometh and Cov scripts are written by a high schooler is the plot devices used to terminate crew. Many of them are disposed of by xenomorphs and other beasts when they are distracted. Because that's a scary scene right? A person is distracted and you can see the danger creeping up behind them. Which you know, it can be, if it's done well with some thought and effort put into it like in Alien.So in those scenes you need the people to be distracted... hummm what can we have them distracted by?... let's see... oh I know... sex!In Prometheus, stranded crew in a clearly dangerous cave on an alien planet are left unmonitored by anyone because the captain back on the ship decides to go get his sex on, the rest of the crew? I dunno, they're off doing... something I guess.In Covenant we have two crew members unable to hear a ship-wide alarm of an alien organism onboard... because they're distracted by the thing that distracts us the most dude! getting it on in the shower! Apparently the showers are exempt from severe on-ship alerts and even if they weren't, the loud music would mask it I'm sure. This is literally Friday the 13th level ""horror"". It's a joke.And on and on like this it goes through the entire movie.Waste of time, insulting to everyone involved.",Alien - Covenant

To be honest, I wasn't very happy with the Prometheus either, but I really believed that the story will have a full swing in this movie, spreading the possibilities far beyond our imagination, but no - we got a mixture of all previous installments, a bit of alien running around the vessel, a bit of marine squad on a deserted planet, a bit of mad android with twisted ideas in genetics, etc., etc.... not to mention sooooo predictable plot and deja-vu ending... everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY, knew what will happen almost after first 30 minutes. To be fair, there was a shy effort to refresh the scenery with introduction of new alien breed, but I really don't see any point of that, especially since it looked so dumb that I really wouldn't recommend to Mr. Scott to even try and base any new movie on that premise... I must say that people who saw this movie without any previous knowledge of the franchise or R.

Hostile space and, the very expected by everybody, professional crew in it. Is it too hard to imagine? Not for us - the viewers. Apparently it is to hard to imagine for script & film makers though. Top notch scientists and space men that are resistant to stress, cautiously trained to every detail and executing well thought and detailed plans? Forget it! Instead, since the beginning, just like that, the crew turns out to be emotionally unstable, panicking, not giving a damn about logic and / or plans bunch of autists locked up in a space ship then stranded on a planet like helpless kids in a forest. Not able to deal with any, and I repeat any, threat to a level that makes you wonder if the intention of writers was to create a parody. This is yet another such movie. I once thought Prometheus was bad but boy was I mistaken. This is worse probably in a worst possible way. Therefore it must be 1/10 as even the CGI and landscapes could not have awaken me from a deep shock on how ridiculously the nonsensical action has developed.

Not one person takes a moment to appreciate the fresh air despite being cooped up in a space ship for months.We see David start to cut his shoulder-length hair with over-sized kitchen shears, yet in the next scene he is sporting a haircut that could only be achieved by a barber with electric clippers.Towards the end of the movie, when the alien is roaming the ship, the team doesn't close all the hallway doors until they are in the middle of chasing it.

They take no precautions to check the air for pathogens and of course, they get some bad breath from an alien-plant through spores. Even in this planet people put masks. They did not even put their hands over their noses. No wonder the one left on the landing ship destroyed it. Idiots should not get out of their home much less off the planet. And from where the last alien came into the ship? David got into the SHIP with nothing on his hands. Yes he had 2 embryos in his throat, but as we all know, the crab like thing comes out of a cocoon. Where was the cocoon? Unless he was able to smuggle one little one already cooked in his pocket, that last alien was jumping the shark to give the last push to make it look like the first alien. I think that they could have done better.

2078,pathos-61098,No Science = Lousy Movie,1,7 October 2017,I'm not going to re-visit the excellent critiques here - just add something mostly missing about why Covenant - and to some extent Prometheus - went so wrong. It's about Ridley Scott himself.Scott is scientifically illiterate - and thus his heavy science-dependent movies fail in every regard whether analyzed from a character or story line viewpoint. They all have the same science - bereft 'Scott-like' point of view meaning why all the characters are completely out of place in a futuristic movie and do things characterized repeatedly (and accurately) as 'dumb'. They simply don't belong in what he's trying to sell. Some set advice from ANY person versed in 21st century science would massively benefit his movies.'The Martian' - highly rated and great story-telling with science as its bedrock - strands Matt Damon's character due to the impossible - a wind storm the likes of which don't exist on Mars due to low atmospheric pressure. There are a zillion things to go wrong on a Mars mission - just not the one Scott chooses. Why? Because he doesn't know any better I suspect or worse doesn't care.So too with the idiocies of Prometheus and even worse on Covenant. Take someone from the 1800's riding a horse and put them on a spaceship in the 22nd century and you get the basic character outline gone wrong in these movies. You don't know what you don't know based on listening to his interviews - and he doesn't seem to know very much science.Just think how much better Prometheus would be if rudimentary science was followed by the characters and it wouldn't detract one bit from the final outcome - far from it - the movie could have been a classic with the 'right' people in a horrible situation. Many if not most of the plot holes disappear and add a 2001 like mystery to something believable.From this point of view 'Alien Covenant' is unsalvageable. Even the part he should get right (without science) fails - the lack of any character interest. Space ships around other planets in our solar system are now an everyday reality and the bar for sci-fi will continue to increase. You dump the science and you're not going to get a very believable movie.Perhaps a tip for his next one?,Alien - Covenant

Incredible.Are out of place the crowd of ""experts"" of the science fiction, for who a good movie of this type, would be a karate fight between martians, and why not to add a few Chinese giving jumps with pulleys? And better, with a boy driving a viper. Wowww.. the Death Star...This goes for the near-sighted who have not seen the gigantic qualitative jump that Prometheus supposed for Alien.One of the most ambitious histories in the history of the cinema of the science fiction. Redirect the Alien story to a worrying and well science based history about other world that creates the humanity and paradoxically tries to destroy it. For me Prometheus was a very big film, door to a much more big film.Prometheus had little small scientific faults, but the extension of the history was so great that to put this history in a so short time, compensates fully the sensation of a very well made reality.But is now with Covenant where I believe that Scott has been wrong. It is evident that to extend the history showing such an overwhelming civilization, it had been very risky and extremely expensive. So risked and expensive like was Cleopatra, showing the Egyptian and Roman civilization, and how not, without the recognition in his moment that this movie supposed. But now, one of the grandest movies of the history of the cinema.With Covenant, that civilizations is showed during 1 minute, and only to show how David kills a village of them. It is good like all those of Scott entertaining. But it is a slam to the grand history that could be, returning to the action scenes only made to maintain the adventure. Not the interest.Sorry Ridley, but the interest about David is far, far way from the interest for the civilization that created the humanity.... someone that we know as God.",Alien - Covenant
2080,simonenefer,Just sad,2,5 September 2017,"Wanted to like this movie, but just couldn't. Scott is a great director, but the script was beyond bad, it was illogical.Why would you spend billions on a colonization mission and send this group? You could have randomly picked a more suitable team of the street! Training is mentioned in the film, but what training, they didn't even to wear protective gear outside the ship on a total unknown world! NASA would have kittens.The technology was beyond dumb. Deploying a solar sail to power up a starship would be like using a couple of flints to start a nuclear reaction, pointless, the energy requirements for interstellar travel are vast. Why would a multibillion dollar colony ship come with only one lander? What if it fails or is damaged on the first landing, what are the rest of the colonialists meant to do,just just turn around and go home? As for the weaponry, well nice to see the M16 is still top of the line in 22nd century.As for the rest of the plot, it would have shamed a 1930's pulp fiction writer.Their is a wealth of science fiction stories that would make amazing movies.

2082,m_elliott-16511,Horrible!,1,9 September 2017,"I love the Alien movies ever since I first saw them as a child. This movie was absolutely horrible, it was slow paced, more based on the story of the crew rather than the Aliens themselves, the action of the movie itself was short lived and basically, everything that every Alien movie had that made them worth the one time watch was missing from this completely. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and even less for a two- hour movie, this was absolutely painful to sit through.",Alien - Covenant
2083,alexbalanov,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,1,10 September 2017,"I did not believe the horrible reviews this movie gets. I am one of the very few people, who actually somewhat enjoyed Prometheus, so I had my hopes up. Really - I thought - anything more than yet another copy-paste of the original story would already be fine... Could I be more wrong....This movie turned out insultingly dull. The characters behaved as if it was a teenager drama: no logic, no motivation, no common sense. Am I supposed to believe these hysterical idiots were the ones hand- picked and trained for an incredibly expensive colonization mission? The company could not find a doctor who acts like a doctor? Or a pilot who knows how to pilot? Or a ship AI that would sound the alarm in critical situations WITHOUT first asking users if it should do so?The company also forgot to equip the ship with things that perform their respective functions. Protective suits do not protect, weapons do not do damage, medical bays are not capable of detecting diseases or healing (in Prometheus they were), flying cargo platforms and drop- ships barely fly, robotic manipulator arms can be operated only by a genius, and the bank of frozen colonizers is designed to be highly vulnerable to ANYTHING that happens to the ship, even a little shaky shake. Bravo. I am not even mentioning the plethora of clichés, average editing, and very questionable CGI. The real insult, however, is the path where the director has taken the Alien universe. There is no more horror, no mystery, no suspense - everything is explained right there on the spot, with the most uninspired version possible. Why do the Aliens grow so fast? Oh, they were designed to do so. Most importantly, this is barely sci-fi now: the action happens out in the fields and in some sort of a close-quartered catacomb. Do not watch this. Seriously. Not worth it.",Alien - Covenant

2087,itpodgornyj,A monument to human stupidity,2,23 September 2017,"After the release of ""Prometheus"", where the main characters did not behave in a very reasonable way, I really wanted the new part not to be the same in terms of the dullness of the characters. And she was not. She put a new bar: the local characters could put a monument of stupidity, they commit something stupid every 5 minutes, and their main enemy is not Alien, but their own idiocy.And stupidity is far from the only (albeit truly main) problem of the main characters. Each member of the crew - he is a template, there is no uniqueness in it. When an accidental character dies, the others mourn him. They build sour mines and say something patterned, like ""John (for example) was the best of us."" The viewer is trying to arouse pity for the deceased, but instead the viewer is perplexed - who is this John in general? Who is this character at all? And this bearded character - he was originally a member of the crew? ""Hey, Susan,"" the meanwhile comes from the screen, ""tell Jack that Brian wanted to see him."" Okay, here's a new warm-up for the memory: who of this team is stupid emotional impotent Jack, and who is Brian?Do you remember the recent ""Living""? There, each character had a role on the ship. Each character was felt unique and indispensable: one - a biologist, a disabled person, another - an engineer and a joker, the third - a caring physician. In the new ""Alien"" the characters are all the same! Yes, there are a couple of pilots, there is a biologist and more pieces of 6-7 characters, whose role in the expedition is not defined at all. Here they were introduced only for the sake of the alien to kill whom. This kind of ""cannon fodder"", which fills the gaps both in the frame and in the script.Do you know what can be more typical of the actions of the main characters of the ""Alien""? Replicas of the main characters of ""Alien""! Classical to the point of disgrace, they could close their eyes (ears), be they even the slightest echoes of charm or logic. Each line of thought is torn from the most horrible horror film.As for the alien himself, he also suffered a change, primarily in quantity. If in the first parts of this creation the entire film was dedicated, but now the classic Alien appears almost to the end of the film. Screen time he was given 15 minutes, despite the fact that he flaunts on all posters and trailers. But new species and phases of aliens were added. And some of these phases go against what we saw in the first part of the 30-year-old. Added background, added new inhabitants of the planet. In general, in the film, where the main thing should be exactly the Stranger, they added a bunch of all heresy, pushing the Alien himself to the background.Is it so bad with the new ""Aliens""? Let me at least at the heavenly court will be asked this question, I will answer without reproach - yes. The new part is absolutely devoid of merit. In it, everything is disastrously bad: the behavior of the characters, the script, the soundtrack. There are a lot of mistakes and inconsistencies in it, and if you first refer them to your inattention, then by the end of the movie you are convinced of the opposite. The spectator in the ""Alien"" is kept for an idiot. He is not answering the questions posed, he is brazenly slip plot of discrepancies, so that the plot went further along the intended track. In especially desperate moments, the creators even added a scene of passionate sex and forced heroines to go in t-shirts without a bra. All this looks like a miserable attempt to attract attention and save the long-eluded title of the king of science fiction.",Alien - Covenant
2088,shaughnkeegan,Let Down,3,29 September 2017,This was a total u turn compared to the other movies. I expected to see lots of face huggers and aliens. Instead its a virus you inhale to get the aliens now? BORING!! And there's one face hugger near the end of the movie and a whole 2 or 3 aliens. This is the worst of all the alien movies for me!

2089,babalisgeorge,A disappointment,2,10 October 2017,"Movie had a good story line up to the moment crew received the signal from Alien's planet. After this point all went completely wrong. Characters lack consistency, simple logic, displayed all negative qualities that this crew shouldn't be assigned for bus passengers not pilots or navigators. Michael Fassbender though was very good in his role and contributed to this generous two star rating.",Alien - Covenant
2090,prbawla,Excellent Addition to Franchise - 3rd Best Alien Film,9,14 October 2017,"This movie has a lot of excellent things going for it. Ridley Scott created a visually stunning prequel that elaborates on Prometheus' mythology. What happened to Shaw is absolutely insane and I was horrified to learn what became of her (in a good way). The back burster scene was really intense so those reviewers stating that this film had no intensity are probably feelingless androids, like Walter. Michael Fassbenders nails it in his 2 roles in this film. I really enjoy the journey David is has been on and can't wait to see what happens to him when they get to the new planet. It is brilliant how he thinks himself a God and creator, and manipulates all the humans to further his plan. The engineers can't stop him, nor the humans. The two gripes I have with this movie is 1. the total lack of character depth / arc. This movie does a terrible job making you care about the scientists in the film and you never really get the chance to learn about the ""couples."" and 2. The flute scene. They should have cut the flute scene and spent more time setting up the characters. The lore, art direction, and creature design make up for those drawbacks. I have seen this movie twice and will gladly watch it again soon.",Alien - Covenant

What does this crew of intelligent hand picked geniuses do? Divert the mission to go check it out. Once landed do they have protective gear or bio suites? Of course not.

For it's length I expected it to have something to show, but no it was literally just people walking around and stuff..",Alien - Covenant
2094,tom-toms-80796,Repetitive and Uncharacteristic,3,10 November 2017,"Alien Covenant had the same skins and occupation as previous Alien films, but with many flaws. The characters had no depth, and as has been pointed out in many other reviews, were lent to impeccably poor decisions. At least in the original Alien, the lack of concern for quarantine was driven by the deceitful android, yet to be uncovered- which was cool!I was surprised to see Danny Mcbride, whose comic work I enjoy, take on a role. It didn't suit, but kinda added to the overall lack of effort of the movie (""..But the crane will make us unbalanced"" he mutters in a robotic voice as they flee from the infested planet *paraphrasing*. And no, he is not cast as the cyborg).The female lead became empowered and bad-ass during their leave of the planet, which felt untrue to her character. I mean the only reason she stood out was because towards the start, she foresaw that checking the planet out was probably going to be a donkey-brained idea. But no real likable roots, no match for Sigourney Weaver.The planet looked fantastic, but the Aliens looked kinda cartoony/ overtly animated or CGI'd, I don't know the technical jargon, but as a spectator it was off-putting and disappointing. Particularly when the many blinking lights on the ship boasted a big effect budget (which is not as important as plot for this kind of film!)Not only did the Aliens look disappointing, but they killed in a method more appropriate to a cheap Slasher than the tense Cat and Mouse style Alien fans adore. The gore was over the top, and took all away from the alien's anticipated arrival.Mr Fastbender is great, but maybe too much focus on his characters, they were pretty boring (albeit well acted) and amounted to a fairly predictable ending. The only clink preventing it from being called outright, rested in his speedy costume change to look like 'the good android'. Another aspect which made the story feel disappointing and fall apart. I will be disregarding this installment as an addition to the Alien story-line. The plot is better left with the mysteries which is squandered by this film.Note: Loved Prometheus.",Alien - Covenant
2095,kezelet,"Whatever you do, do not watch this idiotic movie",1,21 November 2017,"This is by far one of the worst movies I ever wasted time on watching. Makes no sense at all.

Not in the million years would captain do such thing nor (s)he can make such decision on his/her own. - But let's say all on board said ""let's do it, f..k that pre- planned, organized-into-details, paid mission and land this expensive ship to new unknown planet"" do you thing people would go ""hey, let's smell some weird stuff on new unknown planet and see what's gonna happen"" who's security chief on that mission? Who's Medical science adviser? That does NOT happen. - Even if people go that stupid and $h1t goes bad do you still wonder around that planet NOPE!! You evacuate! No question asked. - Year 2104 and we still shot bullets? Really? No ray guns? No ""I can disintegrate some weird aliens"" heavy artillery? Seriously you are trying to sell that stuff to anyone? - Security Tactical adviser present in team? Where these people trained before issued weapons? They should have been or most likely yes would they wonder around unknown planet alone? Teams of two at least? Takin' shower together is not what I had in mind but that's exactly what happened and they died! - You find robot running whole planet and nothing is weird? Looks just like your own but not and you don't suspect anything is wrong AGAIN?!?! I could go on and on about this stupid movie but just won't waist no more time on it.

I spend two hours in my business trip for nothing.,Alien - Covenant
2097,ambchang-61886,"Total disappointment, even for a B movie",3,20 December 2017,"I watched this film with some level of anticipation and excitement, because I actually felt that Prometheus was a half decent prequel to the alien franchise. Prometheus at least attempted to put a coherent story in place, an exercise where Alien: Covenant (A:C) failed miserably.With the exception of Alien, and to a certain extent Aliens, the franchise has counted on stupid people making stupid decisions to allow the aliens to take advantage of the situation, but the characters in A:C are so monumentally dumb that it made the entire film unwatchable. It reminded me of watching Armageddon, which is right up there in sheer idiocy.The characters, who are in charge of an setting up a new colony with 2000 embryos, should be at least be able to make decisions in moments of stress and have a modicum of common sense, and yet:
1) The second in charge decided to just go to a new planet because of a decipherable signal, disregarding 10 years of preparation
2) A crew member decided to arrive at a new planet, go take a leak in the stream and started to light up a cigarette; not to mention the entire crew just decide to go onto an alien planet with NO protection, NOTHING!
3) A crew member see something that is foreign, alien, and clearly man-made (or alien-made), and decided to move in as close as possible such that he can be infected
4) When a shipmate is in trouble, just lock the door and run away
5) When a shipmate is clearly infected, a crew member decides to just carry him with no protection and quarantine
6) When you have a machine gun, just spray bullets around explosives and highly flammable substances that is onboard the only vehicle you have to leave the planet
7) When the captain (was second in command) arrived on a planet filled with corpses of an alien species, found a strange behaving robot, found out said robot created these species that just killed a few of your crew in horrific fashion, you decide to look at these nasty looking giant leather eggs that are clearly alive and created by the robot, with no protection, head first, because the robot told you it is perfectly safe.
8) Two crew members just came back from a horrific mission, with almost the entire crew killed, decided to have sex in the shower without even locking the door (when there are other crew members still walking around)
9) The heroine would decide to climb out of a moving aircraft that is capable of traveling to space to shoot a killing machine that was way too quick for an entire platoon to shoot, instead of just flying to space and suffocating the bastard
10) When you just escaped from a lab of hell from a menacing robot that looks exactly like your own robot, you would just take in the robot, assuming he is your good robot, and trust him entirely without doing any types of checks. Really, these guys deserve to die
11) you would risk the flight stability of your last hope of getting out of a clearly hostile planet by using a giant crane (slow moving one at that) to trap a creature that is too fast for machine guns and bullets (it worked by the way, and yes, a blind grandmother is a better marksman than those idiots)Speaking of idiocy and inconsistencies, how can the alien crack the glass of a space-worthy craft with nary a few smashes, but have such difficulty smashing the glass of an ordinary truck? I think I can smash the glass of that truck with my head, and I am not a perfect killing machine. And the cracked glass of the space traveling vehicle would somehow not cause issues flying to space afterwards by the way.I am not sure how trucks can roll out into space with no gravity, not to mention with enough force to puncture an alien.Then this highly intelligent robot, who was able to create a killing machine by infecting living things through air, would decide the perfect being would have to go through such an intricate and complex way reproducing (egg --> face hugger --> infect/impregnate other species --> burst through body). Why don't they just spread through air in spores?And while many people would dismiss AVP and Predator 2, this timeline of the xenomorph's creation would invalidate those two stories. Predators have hunted aliens in the 90s according to Predator 2, but A:C is set in the future. AVP claims predators hunts aliens as a passage to adulthood and warrior status for thousands of years.I have seen every movie in the alien and predator franchise (even the horrible AVP2), and I have to say A:C is right around the bottom of the pile (AVP2 takes the cake, no doubt about it, but A:C is around the same area as Alien 3 and Alien Ressurection. Dear God, an alien with emotions, and Winona Ryder. Speaking of Winona Ryder, all the characters in A:C is as unlikable as her, where you are just rooting for the aliens).I am still waiting for an alien/predator movie that could be considered good, and when Prometheus is the third best movie of the franchise (Predators was so bad I lost sleep over it), you know there is serious work to be done.A:C is a B movie at best, that is trying to take itself way too seriously (I actually enjoyed AVP more because AVP knew it was stupid), and failed miserably at it.Great:

2098,marioglaranjeiras,Silly crew pushed me out of the script.,7,22 December 2017,"The initial dialogue with David and the look where it occurred paid, say, 30% of the ticket. But such a disqualified crew for such an important expedition to mankind stole another 30% and my popcorn. A route detour difficult to accept, coupled with a series of decisions (or lack thereof) taken by emotion constantly diverted me from the script, which I found interesting. The excellent performance of Michael Fassbender was far from the performance of the other actors. It was distressing to try to get involved with the convincing script with so many inconsistencies.
When I look at Alien, the Eighth Passenger, from 1980, I see pure suspense and terror, in a science fiction setting, facing the unknown. Now, for some reason, perhaps lazy to elaborate convincing situations for the plot, the writer simply has chosen a more commercial path, pushing a scenario that anyone who dwells a little on the details will simply reject. Conclusion: A film with a perfect visual and a passionate theme in the hands, but with a certain superficiality when telling the story. A feather. I think Hollywood has to remember that many people who watched the first Alien films are still alive and that this type of franchise should keep this audience loyal. Who is coming now, should feel stimulated to turn the past to understand the context. It's better than trying to make a movie to please everyone and can not please anyone after all.

2110,saralance-99844,You guys are missing the point,8,16 July 2018,"This movie doesn't deserve all the 1 and 2 star ratings. It was a real challenge to follow up Prometheus, with its grandiose themes and all its loose ends. I wasn't a huge fan of Prometheus, but it had some good moments. I keep hoping that eventually it will all make sense. Covenant got us a little further towards that end, but there are still some huge holes (especially with regard to the motivations of the Engineers), which I would like to see filled.Covenant wasn't a betrayal to Aliens fans for focusing on AI instead of aliens, either. AI was an important aspect of the stories from the very beginning. David and Walter were excellent characters, and Fassbender did an amazing job in both roles. In Covenant, Scott dove deep into David's character, and it was entirely believable, which made the story so scary and compelling. You create a competitive ego and artificial intelligence that knows it is vastly superior to humans, and then treat it like a tool, and see what you get. I will be annoyed if the last set of scenes is not clarified in a future movie(s), though. David seemed genuinely invested in the outcome of the fight between Daniels and one of his creatures. He seemed to actually want Daniels to win (and was even complicit in it, while playing along as Walter). Why? Why did he waste time playing that game? It seems that he could have easily killed them at several points. I thought perhaps this indicated he had something special in store for her. But why should she be special to him, when he had a whole ship of 2000 colonists to experiment on? The only thing I can figure is that this was actually intended to further acknowledge David's character, as an emotional being and not just a simple machine. To highlight his contempt for and his JOY of tormenting humans, as opposed to simply using humans as a means to an end. To emphasize that his whole sense of purpose is tied to the destruction/debasement of others (as a means of validating his superiority). Maybe he just wanted to see himself through her eyes, after what she had witnessed. Frightening.",Alien - Covenant

Watching this crew in action is boring, but don't worry, your boredom will be broken by anger when you see the stupid things they do. The plot of this film is also ridiculous. Your ability to suspend disbelief to the max will be required to hang in to the end. This film has almost no connection to the first Alien.

They wanted.... another Alien movie. So, Ridley says, I'm going to give you, surprise,.... another Alien movie. And, there you have it. Too bad he hasn't explore the engineers universe more deeply, he simply went through it, as simplistic as he tied the fate of E. Shaw and Daniel to Covenant. Ultimately, the movie industry it's about money. So, if people want and going to buy the same old sh*t wrapped up again, whose fault is that? I think, if this can be sold over and over again, it would be done. When you hit rock bottom, maybe, if you can, you would change something. So, I give it an 8, only because this isn't such a bad movie, just not what I've expected, as I wanted more a Prometheus like movie rather then an alien like.",Alien - Covenant

2118,kosarte,Very weak scenario!,1,10 October 2018,"A band of bojos in a high profile mission!If in reality colonization depends in stupid people then we are screwed!Very weak scenario,very weak characters,the Alien series ended many movies before!",Alien - Covenant
2119,jart-88614,"Terrible, the worst Alien Movie",2,18 October 2018,"First of all, the beginning of the movie was so boring. The movie starts with these random characters that we have no idea who the hell they are and going on a mission to keep the colonization alive. Not only that, there was apart of the movie that was literally the introduction to why they are doing that wasn't in the movie. How can you not add a necessary part to the movie itself? You have to watch it on YouTube. 
Throughout the entire movie, I was bored. The whole plot seems pointless and could have just been put in a 15 minute video. I expected so much more, coming from Prometheus, but was severely disappointed. The aliens weren't even scary, even though its suppose to be a sci-fi film. None of the crew members had a connection, like okay, their wives and husbands were with them, but It didn't connect with the audience, like Prometheus did. 
Also, I felt that the crew acted stupid in certain situations. For example:
 - when they found an alien egg, the guy put his face closer to it.
Are you stupid? Didn't think something was going to jump at you?
when the alien came out of guy, the girl took another step and slipped to shoot it.You can shoot it from your original position, why do you have take another step?
There is plenty moreAlso the screenwriting was terrible. I found cursing to be unnecessary and not process the message properly. I get it, you're mad, but the situation isn't that serious. 
Acting was okay.
I could ramble on and on, but the other reviews says enough.
2 stars for visuals",Alien - Covenant
2120,ianbonham,Erase this..,1,30 December 2018,"Since when does everything need to seem so intellectual? I feel this movie was based more around the people's personal problems instead of the thing everyone REALLY came to see. The ALIEN.. And what a terrible Alien it was. Ridley Scott.. You blew it bud. Get your time machine, and go back to 1979. Or give Ripley a call, because that's the only shot you had. Terrible acting, terrible effects, and terrible idea. Prometheus was so good..what a shame.",Alien - Covenant
