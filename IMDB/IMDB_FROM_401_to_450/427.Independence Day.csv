0,TheLittleSongbird,"Great special effects, but little else to offer",4,10 January 2011,"When I first heard of this movie, I was fairly interested. It does have a great cast and it looked good. But I was disappointed. Granted, I do not think it is Roland Emmerich's worst film, but it is far from his best either(that's The Day after Tomorrow and even that was pretty uneven). The film does look great though, the special effects are very good and the scenery and cinematography are also excellent. David Arnold's score is also serviceable, with some interesting song choices, and the ending is quite explosive. However, the dialogue on the most part is very cheesy and forced, the story is shallow and incomprehensible and the direction is murky. Also the film is much too long, and it doesn't help that the pace is uneven. The acting, despite this great cast, is not good, they all try hard but they can't do anything with the dialogue and with Emmerich fighting them every step of the way it is no wonder. I am not a huge fan of Will Smith but he has done some stuff I like, however he overdoes it here and his character for some reason annoys me. Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum are great actors, but their characters are shallow and Goldblum especially should have had more to do. Overall, not terrible, but it is a case of the special effects overshadowing pretty much everything else. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Independence Day
1,Leofwine_draca,"Fun special-effects filled extravaganza, nothing more",6,5 August 2016,"Watching this on a back-to-back with EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS, I was surprised to see how similar the two films are. Despite being separated by forty years, the plots are basically the same, both casts are full of military types, and even the way that the aliens are finally destroyed are very similar. It feels like INDEPENDENCE DAY is in fact a remake of EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS, and I'll bet that at least some of the scriptwriters viewed that film in advance (or maybe when they were kids). Anyway, it's sad to think that now we have unlimited budgets and state of the art CGI animation, we still can't do everything right. When it comes down to it, EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS is a more enjoyable film than INDEPENDENCE DAY.The trouble with INDEPENDENCE DAY is that, clocking in at two hours and nineteen minutes, it's just far too long. Sitting through this film feels like a chore and it's difficult to stop yourself becoming bored during the scenes where aliens aren't around. Let's face it, there's just too much sickly sentimentalising of the worst kind in this film, where all I wanted to see was more alien destruction. We are forced to sit through excruciating scenes of the president's wife dying (""she's sleeping..."") and people in love which are totally out of place and quite embarrassing.Not much of it is original either - when it looks like something clever is coming along, the film makers just decide to blow everything up instead to make the biggest spectacle. I guess the fault here lives in Devlin and Emmerich, the guys who made this film and GODZILLA, but at least this isn't as bad as that trash. At least they managed to assemble a memorable cast, but most people are wasted in their roles and frankly there are just too many sub plots and different characters to make you care about any of them. Jeff Goldblum just plays out his usual lovable scientist routine, like he does in just about every film I see him in. Will Smith enjoys himself in his first big screen outing, yet he's nothing more than a two-dimensional, gung-ho type hero who spends much of his screen time as comic relief. The two partners of the aforementioned are useless too, let's just say I'm not a big fan of television movie-style acting. Thankfully, we've also got Judd Hirsch in the role of Goldblum's father, a grumpy old man, and he's great.The role of the US President is played as a snivelling, stupid wimp by none other than Bill Pullman, and I hate his miscast performance here. It should be more like Harrison Ford in AIR FORCE ONE, as at least that was fun. Pullman is probably most at fault in the film for his stomach-churning sentimentalising, and it's a shame he didn't die at the end. Randy Quaid is also in the cast, and he totally overdoes it as an alien abduction victim. Robert Loggia appears as a tough military type, and he's well suited to the role - he fits it like a glove. Nobody else is sufficiently interesting for me to mention them.Anyway, if you watch this film, just forget about the scenes with people in, instead watch the epic destruction of America by the aliens. The CGI special effects come into their own here and they're some of the best we've had for a long time, they truly are visually stunning. The huge alien saucers look amazing, and when the final second arrives on the satellite countdown, the destruction doesn't disappoint as nuclear blasts through cars into the air and demolish buildings within seconds. While the small flying saucers don't look as impressive, at least they have a groovy-looking turquoise shield which protects them from enemy fire, and there are some exciting battle sequences between the humans and aliens. Speaking of aliens, they themselves are not particularly inspired, just tentacled humanoids which we've seen a billion times before, the only different thing this time is that their eyes are shiny and mirrored instead of black.So, all in all, if you want a modern B-movie, then check out INDEPENDENCE DAY. While majorly flawed, it's worth watching for all the special effects and explosions and has a fun spirit too. In the end, it's not bad, but it could have been a lot better.",Independence Day
2,SnoopyStyle,popcorn fun,8,13 September 2013,Aliens have arrived. The world waits nervously. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) uncovers an alien signal. He drives to the White House with his father Julius (Judd Hirsch) to connect with ex Constance Spano (Margaret Colin) who is an adviser to President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman). The aliens launch a massive attack. Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is a military pilot on the counter-attack.Roland Emmerich blows up lots of stuff. This isn't deep. Sure the computer virus idea is stupid. Who Cares? We get to see the White House blow up. It is a great 90s popcorn picture. The story works minus the computer virus. There is epic action. It is loads of fun.,Independence Day
3,claudio_carvalho,"Funny, Entertaining, but not as Good as When I Saw for the First Time",7,7 October 2013,"On July 2nd, satellite stations experience interference in their systems and the scientists and military believe that it is caused by meteors. Soon they realize that it is originated from the Moon by a huge spacecraft that brings other ones that are positioned over the major cities on Earth including Washington, New York and Los Angeles and governments do not know the purpose of the alien force.The scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) discovers that the aliens are preparing the invasion of Earth, destroying the human species, and he succeeds in reporting to the president of the United States, President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman). With an inferior technology, Whitmore and General William Grey (Robert Loggia) decide to give a chance to Levinson's plan of downloading a virus in the computer of the alien spacecraft as the last chance of Earthlings to survive.In 1996, when I saw ""Independence Day"" in a movie theater on the release, I liked a lot this sci-fi adventure. Yesterday I saw it again on DVD and I found it funny and entertaining, but not as good as when I saw it for the first time.The story of an alien invasion still has great special effects, but the conclusion is lame with the idea of the virus and the nationalist speech of President Whitmore. Bill Pullman is awful, with his wooden face giving the sensation that he is sick and tired.There are silly melodramatic subplots of soap opera, like for example, the death of First Lady Marilyn Whitmore (Mary McDonnell) that is forgotten by the president; or the desire of getting married of the stripper Jasmine Dubrow. But after 145 minutes running time, it is a good entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Independence Day""",Independence Day
4,nogodnomasters,"HEY BOYS, I'M BACK!",10,9 May 2019,"Whenever this film comes on TV I pause to watch it, or at least do the manly thing and frequently channel hop it it. There are only a handful of films I do this for. I have watched it twice in a month, once ignoring Rachel as she explained how the Democrats really won that last election.This is a film that has been duplicated and spoofed. What makes this ""B"" action film so iconic are the numerous subplots that are done well and then brilliantly come together. The film type casts all the characters. In spite of that it takes time to build character to reinforce those stereotypes. Jeff Goldblum as a geeky scientist, Will Smith as a cocky pilot, and Randy Quaid as a nut case.Even minor scenes such as the one with Harvey Fierstein were excellent as the individual scenes were well scripted. The special effects were top notch for 1996 and still beat today's low grade CG nonsense. The film produced a few memorable lines, and many memorable scenes.On the down side...the speech given by the President at the end of the film was a bit dorky. I noticed the last time I watched it on a premium movie station, they had cut it to make time for ""Mar Attacks."" I am the guy who prefers it that way. Sorry. Also for purists, the film holds 100's of factual errors, continuity errors, and goofs. It seems they took so many takes shooting this film to ""get it right"" they ended up with things out of place from scene to scene. Most people won't notice.",Independence Day
5,classicsoncall,"""Let's kick the tires and light the fires, Big Daddy!""",7,27 June 2018,"This movie might possibly hold the record for IMDb reviewers calling it the worst movie of all time. Wow! Obviously those folks have never seen ""The Aztec Mummy Against the Humanoid Robot"" or ""Goke, Body Snatcher from Hell"", a couple of sci-fi flicks that would immediately vault this film into the ranks of early 'Star Wars' territory. Personally I didn't think the film was that bad, in fact, it was better than I expected it to be. I was thinking along the lines of the same year's ""Mars Attacks"" which truly was deplorable. That's not to say that the film didn't have it's share of problems. Someone thought it would be a pretty good idea to put a delusional drunk (Randy Quaid) and a sitting U.S. President (Bill Pullman - what!?!?) into the cockpit of a fighter jet to wage war against a massive alien strike force! Really?!?! And the computer virus idea while sounding good on paper doesn't quite square against the advanced alien technology that would have brought the invasion into Earth's atmosphere. Uh-oh, it sounds like I might be joining the naysayers on this one if I keep on thinking this through.But I did like the early reference to 1951's ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". However in that one, the aliens offered us Earthlings a chance to redeem ourselves from the self destructive path humanity was on, while here, the foreigners weren't going to give us even half a fighting chance. The picture's special effects and cinematography were pretty sensational for 1996, and the concept of bringing the planet's inhabitants together seeking common ground against the alien invaders was a brief feel good moment even if a fleeting one. And if you're feeling nostalgic, Randy Quaid's kamikaze attack on the mother ship echoed that famous scene in 'Dr. Strangelove' where Slim Pickens rode that bucking bronco joyride to Armageddon in all of it's patriotic glory. Oh yeah, take that you nasty aliens!",Independence Day
6,lee_eisenberg,"this movie is the reason that ""vile"" is an anagram for ""evil""",1,4 July 2005,"""Independence Day"" was nothing but an excuse to have a series of explosions and glorify the army. To crown it all, they exaggerated racial stereotypes: the world is saved by a nerdy Jewish guy (his dialogue consists of incomprehensible computer lingo) and a macho black guy (""I'm eager to go kick E.T.'s butt."").I knew that ""ID4"" was an America-can-do story even before September 11. After 9/11, we saw that the government didn't base its policy on uniting everyone, but rather on unilateralism. I'm sure that if ""ID4"" happened in real life, we would probably see an invasion of every country including China, and a vicious agenda that only Stalin would find acceptable.This movie is downright unconscionable.",Independence Day
7,jboothmillard,Independence Day,8,15 March 2005,"This was one of the highest grossing films of 1996, it made breakthroughs with special effects, and is still remembered as one of the greatest disaster movies of all time, directed by Roland Emmerich (Stargate, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow, White House Down. Basically on July 2nd, communication systems worldwide are sent into chaos by atmospheric interference, caused by an enormous alien mother ship, it deploys large objects that approach Earth, they are alien spacecrafts, spreading to major cities across the world. MIT-trained satellite technician David 'Dave' Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) has discovered a signal embedded in the global satellite transmissions, he determines it is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack. President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) orders the evacuation of New York City, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., but the countdown ends and the ships activate, blasting energy weapons and destroying large cities, and killing millions of people. On July 3rd, Whitmore, Levinson, his father Julius Levinson (Judd Hirsch), General William Grey (Robert Loggia) and other White House staff has escaped the devastation, an aviation force is sent to counter-attack an alien ship, Captain 'Steve' Hiller (Will Smith) is among the pilots fighting, but the attack is unsuccessful, as the alien spaceships, and smaller pilot ships, are protected by a force field. Whitmore and everyone on Air Force One are taken to Area 51, Nevada, where evidence of the aliens attacking Earth has been kept secret, eccentric scientist Brackish Okun (Star Trek: The Next Generation's Brent Spiner) leads the project, and shows them a recovered alien pilot ship, and deceased alien lifeforms. Hiller crash landed following the counter-attack, and subdues an injured alien pilot, the unconscious alien is taken to Area 51 where Dr. Okun and his team operate, but it regains consciousness and attacks, it uses Okun's body to communicate telepathically and speak, before attempting a psychic attack on Whitmore, it is shot dead, Okun is left in a coma. Whitmore orders a nuclear attack on the ship positioned over Houston, but the ship remains intact, Hiller meanwhile takes a helicopter to search El Toro for his girlfriend Jasmine Dubrow (Vivica A. Fox) and her son Dylan (Ross Bagley), he finds a group of other survivors, including First Lady Marilyn Whitmore (Mary McDonnell), who later dies of her fatal injuries. On July 4, Levinson demonstrates that the alien force fields can be deactivated by uploading a computer virus, he suggests entering the mother ship to upload a virus into all alien ships, disabling all force fields, and plant a nuclear bomb on board, Hiller volunteers to pilot the attacker, with Levinson joining him. While Whitmore joins the aerial battle of military pilots and volunteers with flight experience, including alcoholic crop duster Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), to destroy the ship above Area 51, Hiller and Levinson infiltrate the alien mother ship, the virus is uploaded, all shields are disabled, but missiles are exhausted attacking fighters and causing minimal damage to the outside of the ship. In the end, Casse unable to fire his one remaining missile sacrifices himself, flying into the energy weapon as it fires, causing the ship to explode, and Hiller and Levinson activate the nuclear weapon, the mother ship is destroyed as they narrowly escape, humankind rejoices their survival and watch the mother ship burn up in the atmosphere, it resembles a firework display. Also starring Margaret Colin as Constance Spano, James Rebhorn as Albert Nimzicki, Mrs. Doubtfire's Harvey Fierstein as Marty Gilbert, Adam Baldwin as Major Mitchell, Donnie Darko's James Duval as Miguel Casse, Mrs. Doubtfire's Lisa Jakub as Alicia Casse, Mae Whitman as Patricia Whitmore and Harry Connick Jr. as Captain Jimmy Wilder. Then Fresh Prince Smith is fantastic as the wise-cracking fighter pilot and became a massive movie star, Goldblum gives a great variation on his Jurassic Park boffin role, Pullman is a good straight-faced President, and the supporting cast all get their moments as well. I agree with critics that it is a very Americanised movie, the rest of the world is targeted but hardly seen, the Yanks are ultimately representing everyone, but it doesn't matter, the big draw of the film is the brilliant special effects, seeing city-size alien spaceships covering the world in shadow, and blowing up the Empire State Building, the White House and the big cities with huge explosions, it doesn't matter how many times you watch, it is a highly entertaining science-fiction adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Sound. Will Smith was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 47 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!",Independence Day
8,ccthemovieman-1,Could Possibly Be the Most Stupid High-Budget Film Ever Made,1,9 October 2006,"This has to be one of the all-time dumbest movies ever made. When you consider the budget of this film, and the star actors, I nominate it as THE dumbest movie of all time!Why? Well, just to give you some idea, in this story we see (1) the President of the United States (the dumb-looking Bill Pullman) boarding a jet plane by himself and taking off to fight aliens; (2) a drunken crop-dusting pilot (the incredibly dumb-looking Randy Quaid) being the hero over any flier in the military; (3) Will Smith punching out aliens 10 times the size and 100 times the strength of him with his overly-arrogant macho bravado.I went to the theater with a co-worker who loves EVERY movie ever made.

9,BA_Harrison,"Yeah, I know—it's stupid, but....",7,7 April 2012,"Independence Day, the massively successful summer blockbuster of '96, is a deeply flawed, predictably dumb, jingoistic, gung-ho piece of mainstream sci-fi/action nonsense that depicts the USA as the saviours of mankind in a desperate battle for Earth against hostile aliens.Funny thing is, as formulaic, clichéd, moronic, plot-hole-ridden and over-sentimental as this flag-waving claptrap is, I don't find it anywhere near as irksome as I probably should, in part thanks to the great cast, but mostly due to the simple fact that it is just so much fun, a switch-your-mind off-and-enjoy-the-spectacle, slam-bang crowd-pleaser packed with exhilarating action and top-notch special effects.Sometimes, all I need to pass the time are massive explosions (they don't come much bigger than this), slimy aliens (that they are), and a Jewish cable company employee uploading a virus to an alien mothership via his laptop, and that's precisely what ID4 delivers.",Independence Day
10,moonspinner55,Pseudo patriotic...,6,30 October 2005,"Crass, bombastic special effects package has Americans attempting to wipe out war-crazed aliens after the power-hungry monsters have destroyed most of the country. Mindless hybrid of ""Star Wars"", ""Alien"" and ""Top Gun"" blends mass destruction with feel-good sentiments and bloated uplift (the film is a schizophrenic valentine to the USA, getting the opportunity to blow it up and then sentimentalize it). The dialogue is ridiculous throughout, although some of the characters are cynical and humorous and the cast comes through it all right. Film has aspirations to be heart-rending family entertainment, which makes its fiery violence and hollow vitriol that much more ludicrous. **1/2 from ****",Independence Day
11,paul_haakonsen,"One big cliché, but still entertaining...",6,16 December 2015,"""Independence Day"" is essentially one big cliché after one another, from the start to the end of the movie. And it is as much pro-American as you could possibly jam into a single movie.That being said, it is still an entertaining action Sci-Fi movie. The story is generic and predictable, yes, but it still has a lot of entertainment value. And while director Roland Emmerich managed to put every movie cliché and stereotype into this movie, he still knows what buttons to push in order to make a crowd-pleasing movie.The effects in the movie were good and that is essential to a Sci-Fi, as the special effects are make or break for a Sci-Fi movie. The spaceships were a nice design. But the aliens, both in and out of their exo-suits were really impressive, and they alone make it fun to watch the movie.""Independence Day"" is a star-filled movie, boasting talents such as Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsh, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Viviva A. Fox, James Rebhorn, Brent Spinner and many more. People did good jobs with their given roles and characters.This is a fun and fast-paced movie that is well-worth watching if you enjoy action Sci-Fi movies, just look past the American propaganda and endless clichés.

12,dbdumonteil,space (I believe in),2,21 November 2003,"One of the biggest hits of the year 1996 (especially in the USA) but certainly not one of the finest science-fiction movies ever made. The sole advantage of the movie rests in the special effects that are really impressive (the gigantic spacecraft). But the assets of Roland Emmerich's movie stop here. Then, ""Independence day"" accumulates the faults that damages the interest of the movie. First of all, ""Independence day"" wavers constantly between the science-fiction but also the disaster film. But the main problem of the movie is definitely the script. It's a weak and ridiculous script that alternates borrowings: ""Alien"" (the physical appearance of the extraterrestrials), ""Star Wars"" (the pursuit between the flying saucer and Will Smith's plane), ""the day the Earth stood still"" (1951) and homages: ""War of the worlds"", 2001: a space odyssey"" (when Jeff Goldblum turns on his portable computer, this is ""HAL 9000"" that appears on the screen!). In the long run, the movie's got nearly nothing new and it easily falls into the stereotypes of science-fiction. It's hackneyed and not inventive at all.This is also a movie spoiled by an atrocious performance of nearly all the actors, especially the minor roles. Moreover Roland Emmerich's crew wanted to introduce humor so as to avoid to tell too seriously the story. A good idea but the humor doesn't fly high and it's sometimes very crude.An average and pretentious movie.",Independence Day
13,Quinoa1984,Slightly over-rated Apocalypse,6,30 April 2000,"ID4 works as a sci-fi action film with humans against aliens.  But the story is used from other alien movies and the characters are thin and usual for these movies.  Still, this is a big action apocalypse that hs attracted audiences all over the world.  Most likely though, this film hasx a message. What message i it?  Well, the scene where the White house and Empire State building shows how if you are in the theater, you'll cheer like FDR was president forever.

From a secretive location in New Mexico (hint, hint!), the ""Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute"" (S.E.T.I.) informs the US Pentagon. No surprise if you're watching; of course, you already know we're on the verge of a massive alien attack. And, if they're attacking, we can safely assume they are unfriendly. The mystery about why they're here is explained, briefly, but it doesn't really matter why they're here - what matters is if and how we are to get rid of them...The task falls on the eight shoulders of four men, all Americans.

All of these people, and the majority of those supporting them, are caricatures. A few could take their act directly into a parody of this film, without changing a thing.

15,Coventry,Low-profile Americans save the world...yippy-ka-yee!,4,23 May 2004,"A massive, gigantically overhyped production that actually is one big B-movie! Independence Day only retells and steals multiple plot aspects from a thousand modest science fiction movies from back the 50's and add an unhealthy dose of patriotism. A couple of days before the celebration of the 4th of July, giant metal spaceships overshadow the largest cities of the world. The first part of Independence Day is filled with impressive explosions, apocalyptic demolitions and grotesque action. Apparently, the alien visitors are a bit hostile and cheerfully blow up the White House and they make president Pullman a  widower. In the second part of the film, Independence Day entirely sinks into idiocy with Roswell '47 connections and Area 51 confessions. It also is in this part that the heroes start to rise. How about a stripper who single-handedly saves the First Lady? Or a redneck farmer who saves the world, kamikaze-style? A wannabe-NASA pilot who gets to fly a UFO or a divorced Jewish mastermind who cracks the alien code? It's all extremely silly and light-headed, but the moral is still there: Don't mess with Americans! Still, with the right, low-brained attitude you can enjoy this film. The jokes and oneliners are so bad and wrongly placed they become hilarious at times. The aliens, on the other hand, look cool.

Fox,Mary McDonnell,Judd Hirsch,Robert Loggia,Randy Quaid and James Rebhorn. The narrative focuses on a disparate group of people who converge in the Nevada desert and, along with the rest of the human population, participate in a last- chance counterattack on July 4,which is the same date as the Independence Day holiday in the United States.It was directed by German director Roland Emmerich, who co-wrote the script with producer Dean Devlin.The film begins with the approach of a series of massive spaceships, which many on Earth greet with open arms, looking forward to the first contact with alien life. Unfortunately, these extraterrestrials have not come in peace, and they unleash powerful weapons that destroy most of the world's major cities. Thrown into chaos, the survivors struggle to band together and put up a last-ditch resistance in order to save the human race. As this is a Hollywood film, this effort is led by a group of scrappy Americans, including a computer genius who had foreseen the alien's evil intent, a hot-shot jet pilot, and the President of the United States.It's the first futuristic disaster movie that's as cute as a button. Which, when all the special effects blow over, is what the viewer like in a monster hit.And they are willing to overlook any flaws that this movie has like thin plot and poor character development.But nevertheless,it has proved to be a a thrilling, spectacle- filled,entertaining and visually stunning movie.",Independence Day
18,Theo Robertson,I Enjoyed It First Time But It Doesn't Hold Up To Repeated Viewing,7,29 July 2005,"When ID4 was released I certainly didn't think it was a movie I'd be going out of my way to see due to its reputation as being overly jingoistic along with being a shallow story with no substance so I waited to catch it on network TV and when I did I was fairly blown away by its quality . The first half of the movie is nail biting as whole cities across the globe are vapourised by the invaders who can't be stopped and it's not often we get a blockbuster that starts off in such a pessimistic manner . As for the "" American nationalism "" that some people hated it for I suggest you avoid watching every American war movie that doesn't have Sam Fuller in the credits . Here is a movie that only celebrates the Utopian dream of multi racialism in America ( Unfortunately that's all it is in reality - a dream ) but also the international community where Arabs , Israelis and the RAF can all join together to take on the alien menace While the multi ethnic / international idealism holds up to repeated viewing I'm afraid other aspects do not . I saw ID4 again tonight about five years after I first saw it and I'm sorry to say that it was nowhere as good as I remembered it . Yes the first half is rather bleak and pessimistic and what could been a very serious , intelligent movie that mixes downbeat drama with commercial appeal starts to shoot itself in the foot in the second half . I've no idea how I noticed this on first viewing but the dialogue is rather bad while the plotting is ridiculous . The president of the United States leads the remnants of the USAF into battle ! You might be shocked to know that allegedly Bill Clinton thought President Whitmore was based on him ! so goodness knows what Dubya thought about Bill Pulman's performance . I guess the major problem is that by making the aliens so invincible the screenwriters have painted themselves into a corner to how humanity can overcome the invaders , I mean when Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum entered the mother ship I was expecting the Colonel from MONTY PYTHON to jump out and say "" Stop this at once this film is getting far too silly "" There is another slight problem that wouldn't appear apparent in 1996 but is noticeable in 2005 and that is the breath taking advance of special effects . Nowadays it's nearly impossible to watch a film and decide what is a special effect and what is real . I'm afraid that in many action sequences like the F-16s attacking the alien ship you are aware that blue screen projection and CGI explosions are being used , it's not bad enough to condemn the film of course and at the time these sequences must have seemed awesome but the FX haven't stood the test of time very well Okay I'm in a charitable mood and I'm giving this movie 7/10 . It's a film of two halves with the doom laden first half easily beating the second in terms of tension and drama . It's a great pity the producers couldn't keep up the momentum",Independence Day
19,Hey_Sweden,"It's the end of the world as we know it, and we sure do feel fine.",7,4 July 2012,"""Independence Day"" is one of those blockbusters where we know we're basically in it for the spectacle. Yeah, the writing ain't so hot, the dialogue is silly, and some of the performances are indeed broad, but does all of that really matter when the action is as slick and high tech and impressive visually as it is in this over the top movie? We know we're in for a good time right from the start when we get a sense of how enormous that alien mother ship is. The story, for those of us who may not have already seen this, is basically an update of films like ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"", ""The War of the Worlds"", and ""Star Wars"", with state of the art special effects. Thoroughly evil aliens hover giant city destroying spaceships over Earths' major cities, apparently ready to do some damage, and the human race seemingly can't do much. U.S. President Bill Pullman keeps trying to figure out the best options, even as the stakes keep changing. Among our other heroes are a swaggering Will Smith as an Air Force pilot and Jeff Goldblum as the nerdy computer expert who finds out how to sneak past the alien defenses. This reviewer will admit that this movie is a groaner at times (the whole story with Randy Quaids' character especially) but writer / producer Dean Devlin and writer / director Roland Emmerich serve up all of the major set pieces with flair. ""Independence Day"" may be a long movie (145 minutes in its theatrical incarnation, 154 minutes in its extended version) but at least it's never boring. It's got a supporting cast just full of familiar faces, and the invading E.T.'s are such a loathsome bunch - they're compared to locusts - that one simply can't help but want to see the humans rise up and kick some damn ass. And eventually they get their chance, and in a development we certainly hope would extend to real life, all the countries of the world are united in their one single purpose. One particularly effective sequence occurs approximately half way through when an alien specimen is prematurely set up for an autopsy, and the entire sequence aboard the mother ship is a corker as well. Overall, this is good fun for anybody who'd just like to turn their brains off and enjoy some straightforward escapism. And, in conclusion...what's so wrong with a little rah rah flag waving?

On the face of it, it is quite an engaging story of mankind uniting in the face of overwhelming odds - a sort of blitz spirit. There to save us all from the pending oblivion is Bill Pullman as the President, Jeff Goldblum as the scientist and Will Smith as the epitome of the American ""kick-ass"" air force pilot. The plot is terrible; the sentiment oozingly American and the script lacking in any kind of subtlety.

The cast is excellent, in particular Jeff Goldblum, Randy Quaid, and Judd Hirsch, who all bring much-appreciated humor. The special effects are great and the action scenes are well-done. It's a quintessential ""big dumb summer blockbuster"" type of movie. This, of course, means it is panned by elitists and film snobs. This isn't a smart movie, nor does it try to be. But it also isn't so dumb that it insults the audience. The purpose of this movie is pure popcorn entertainment and there's nothing wrong with that.

They were ably supported by some stars as Randy Quaid, Mary McDonnell and Robert Loggia. In addition, there were some fine beauties sprinkled through the film: Vivica A.

24,Boba_Fett1138,A science fiction spectacle!,7,16 June 2004,"""Independence Day"" is a good old fashioned science fiction spectacle with lot's of stuff blowing up and dying people.This movie is pure entertainment. Don't watch this movie expecting a serious story with any logic in it. The movie filled with dumb dialogue, needless many characters and patriotism. But quite frankly who cares? The movie serves its purpose; to entertain.The best thing about ""Independence Day"" is the action. Not only are the total destructions of cities such as New York and Washington and their monuments totally awesome but also the plane fights versus the aliens are very well made, mainly thanks to some good and convincing special effects for which the movie also received an Oscar.But yes, the movie has too many weak spots to be ever regarded as a science fiction classic such as ""The War of the Worlds"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". One of my main complaints is there are too many characters, just like in disaster movies from the 70's. Problem with the characters is that the creators try to create a story around all of them with as a result needless plot lines and uninteresting situations.The actors are below average. Even Jeff Goldblum isn't in his element and seemed to have been miss cast. Maybe the best actor in this movie is Will Smith in his big breakthroughMindless fun.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Independence Day

It won't change the way we view anything(well, it may have people looking up, and/or appreciating the unblocked view of the sky more than usual). It won't revolutionize film-making. It may not even stay in your mind for terribly long after watching it. But it is an entertaining piece while you do, and hey, it's a chance for Trekkers to see Brent Spiner outside of Star Trek. Also, it never actually claims to be more than what it is, a Summer blockbuster. The film wastes no time introducing the extra-terrestrial element. The pacing throughout the film isn't bad. The plot is decent. Emmerich makes both disaster and action aspects work well. The film apparently holds, and may very well continue to hold, the record for the most miniature model-work in any one movie... that says something about just how much action is packed into this. The acting is fine. The dialog is... not the smartest ever written. The characters aren't bad. The real draw here is definitely the explosions and action. I recommend this to fans of action- and/or disaster-flicks, as well as fans of the actors and/or the director, Roland Emmerich. 7/10",Independence Day
26,neil-476,Grrrr,3,28 June 2007,"I don't think there has ever been a film which made me as angry as this one did. But then, I don't think there has ever been a film which has assumed I am completely stupid as comprehensively as this one did.The insults to my intelligence came thick and fast. Jeff Goldblum is the only man in the world who has the vaguest idea of what the alien ships are up to. Good job his estranged wife is the President's personal assistant and not a checkout girl at Safeway, eh? They have had an alien ship in Area 52 for 50 years and no-one can figure out how to get it operational - Goldblum figures it out in 10 minutes, in between writing a virus for the alien operating system. Clearly he is the most important man on the planet since no-one else seems to have the vaguest idea what to do about this threat, so we'd better keep him safe in case our counter measures fail, hadn't we? Naaah, let's send him up to the alien mother ship and near certain death! Now, let's see, in a world crisis, when the world is (apparently) looking to the USA for a lead as to what to do, how best should we use the President? I know, let's send him up in a fighter plane against one of those ships which keeps destroying the planes we send up against it! And how about this idea of outrunning the fires of Hell as they lick at your tail (twice, or was it three times?) and your dog... that particular card was played multiple times. Then there was Will Smith finding his girlfriend in the ruins of a burnt out city. At night. From a helicopter. Not to mention how fortunate that the aliens were using Windows and didn't have a firewall installed. Not to mention......And don't get me started on Bill Pullman's vomit-inducing 4th July speech.See, I love sci-fi, and I love CGI/eye candy, but I felt really insulted that Emmerich and Devlin could believe that cinema audiences were so completely stupid as to swallow the lazy, lazy scriptwriting which was thrown at them. None of these criticisms was anything which couldn't have been corrected by a little bit of rewriting, but taken together they indicated contempt for an audience which, clearly, was assumed to be so devoid of intelligence that none of these things would matter to them.I guess the box office proved them right on that one! Plus there are a lot of positive comments here, so maybe their assessment of the overall audience intelligence was right after all...How depressing.3 out of 10 for fun visuals.

No wonder other countries think Americans are a bunch of loud-mouthed boors.The all-star cast features Bill Pullman as our nation's president (God help us all), Mary McDonnell as his first lady, Will Smith (who grows old fast), Judd Hirsch, Jeff Goldblum, Margaret Colin, etc., etc.The film achieves what it sets out do to, but just know that it set its own bar extremely low.Grade: C",Independence Day

I remember seeing the ads for this movie before it was released, and even a well-polished advertising campaign could not hide the schlockiness of it all.The dialogue is completely forgettable, the plot is thin and obvious, and even if you can suspend your beliefs and assume that an Apple laptop computer can do all of the stunts that Jeff Goldblum's character's computer can do and that a crop duster suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (Randy Quaid) can learn how to fly late 20th century state-of-the-art military planes basically by instinct, there is one final piece of posturing that is too much to take. Never would the President of the United States both endanger himself and allow himself to become a spectacle by putting on a flight suit and piloting a plane in a time of war ... Oh, yeah, I almost forgot about that incident back in 2003...oops...my bad.The reason I am even giving this film 4/10 is for one, the special effects are impressive in a movie that has precious little else going for it. Secondly, and most of all, the only thing that makes this movie remotely watchable is Will Smith. Even with what the writers/directors give him to work with he steals the show. Plus, the ""buddy"" thing he has going with Jeff Goldblum's character when they go to deliver the computer virus to the alien spacecraft comes off well. I'm just glad that Will Smith got to showcase what he is really capable of the following year when he starred in a quality film about alien life on earth, ""Men in Black"".",Independence Day

Rumors say that it was suppose to represent many nations against one massive foe but all it showcased was Americans fighting the alien spacecraft. Yes, we have the United States President and an unshaven drunk leading the battle. A huge alien spacecraft hovers over the city and blasts the White House. The President declares it Independence Day and strikes back at the unwanted visitors without a clue as to how to destroy it. The climax is an attack on the mother ship, as if that development is suppose to shock us. Impressive special effects accompany a familiar plot that actually starts out well until formula sets in. Directed by Roland Emmerich who previously made Stargate. Only Will Smith as a fighter pilot contains any depth. Jeff Goldblum is typecast as a computer wiz. Bill Pullman is embarrassing as the President who issues this all out war. Mary McDonnell gets dragged into this as the First Lady. Randy Quaid plays this idiot drunk who can conveniently fly a plane. While blowing up the White House seems to be high point in the film, blowing up the film sounds like a better way to pass the time. Recycled idiotic mayhem at the lowest possible cause.

Suddenly, the wonder turns into horror as the spaceships destroy the cities. When we counter attack, the alien ships appear invincible to normal weapon systems, The President of the United States, decides to head to area 51, to formulate a plan to defeat the aliens, and Will Smiths one liners. Now, the fate of the world rests on a handful of surviving humans....My gosh the years have not been kind to this movie. Compared to other movies from 1996, its really looks dated and doesn't hold up.And this is why I really dislike the movie now. Back then, on the big scree, it was awesome, Smith was huge, and we hadn't seen anything like this since maybe Jurassic Park.Forward fifteen years, Smith has lost his touch with Hollywood and effects like this are seen on releases almost every week, which leaves nothing more than the story, which is good, but the narrative and the script are dire, just terrible.When the Aliens are not attacking, we either get Pullman saying something prolific, or dressing down another character for not agreeing with him, or Will Smith being really smug, knowing he is becoming the biggest star in the world.Luckily we have Goldblum to save the day and almost the film playing basically Ian Malcom again. He out acts everyone in the movie and makes it shine whenever he's on screen.It's a shame he isn't in every single frame, because the film would have been a little better. The support are caricatures from every trope going, and I feel sorry for those who haven't seen this yet, because they will probably dislike it more than myself.This is what happens to movies when they rely on special effects.They get old...",Independence Day
32,Aaron1375,Fun summer blockbuster that some just took to seriously.,8,7 May 2003,"I enjoyed this movie, sure it isn't the most original movie ever made or the best, but it was what it set out to be...which is a combo alien attack movie of the 50's plus an all-star disaster movie of the 70's.  A lot of critics don't like this one and a lot of people who think of themselves as critics don't care much for it either, but it still brought in over 300 million at the box office in the summer of 96.  I thought it was an entertaining film with lots of action and a good dose of comedy as well.  One complaint I have is that it runs a bit long and you feel the time pass not like other movies like ""The Two Towers"" where it doesn't feel like all that much time has passed.  Another problem with this movie is that it is best seen in the theater.  This movie has a score of only six at imdb, so a lot of people who saw it probably saw it on TV.  Or if they did see it at the theaters, realized it just wasn't as good on the small screen when they saw it on TV. The movie also benefited from a great ad campaign that started with a super bowl spot that showed the White House being destroyed.  The movie is basically an alien invasion movie and it is like a 50's science fiction movie.  It also has a lot of stars, not the biggest names, just like a 70's disaster flick.  If you don't care for either of these genres you probably won't like this movie, but if you like one or the other or both it is worth checking out.  Just don't take it too seriously and have fun watching it.",Independence Day
33,Wuchakk,Blockbuster Sci-Fi with overdone comedy and inanities,5,15 March 2016,"Released in 1996, ""Independence Day"" (or ""ID4"") chronicles events as the earth is threatened by malevolent aliens who wipe out entire cities. Bill Pullman plays the US President, Margaret Colin his aid and Mary McDonnell his wife. Will Smith plays a hotshot pilot and Vivica A. Fox his babe. Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid, James Duval and Brent Spiner are also on hand.I saw this movie when it was released while on vacation during the height of its hype (incidentally, at the very theater in Aurora, CO, where The Dark Knight Rises Massacre would occur 16 years later). While fun and entertaining as most blockbusters are, it didn't match the hoopla, so I've had mixed feelings about it ever since. On the positive side, the main characters are likable and there's a warmth to their relationships. I also like the feel-good quality of the movie in that it brings the whole world together to face a common enemy, despite our differences. In other words, it's not just Independence Day for America, but for Planet Earth. I also like the tie-in with Area 51, which shows that some thought was put into the script beyond just blowing up iconic buildings and whole cities. The scene where the captured alien utilizes Dr. Brakish Okun's vocal chords to speak is well done. Also, Margaret Colin looks great throughout.What I don't like is the mixture of serious sci-fi with overdone comedy and the numerous ""Yeah, right"" moments. Comedy works with serious sci-fi/adventure/drama/thriller/horror as long as it's not overdone. The Terminator flicks are good examples, even Star Trek. In ""ID4"" too much of the comedy and inanities take you OUT of the story rather than take you IN. The comedic asides seem disjointed from the plot rather than enhancing it. Despite the likable characters and warmth thereof, they too often come off empty and adolescent. The story focuses on the alien threat and human response so there's little character development of value. I enjoy a sci-fi flick even when its fantasy extends into the absurd and far-fetched, so long as there is some payoff -- some message of significance, some portrayal of what might or could possibly be, some character development that draws the viewer into the story and provides some basis for caring about what's happening. There's not enough of this in ""ID4."" That said, there's a lot to enjoy as a shallow sci-fi blockbuster with a likable cast and some thrilling sequences. The key is not taking it too seriously since it doesn't take itself seriously. The film is overlong at 145 minutes and was shot all over the USA with establishing shots from around the world.

35,Mr-Fusion,Only in Hollywood would a nerd and a fighter pilot be our last best hope,7,22 June 2016,"Watching ""Independence Day"" takes me back to that fateful day in early 1996. I saw the trailer right before ""Broken Arrow"" and that image of a wall of fire and debris coming toward the screen blew my 15 year-old mind . Some serious seeds were sown that day. So I guess I've got a soft spot for this movie even to this day. Even now, those fireballs are still pretty awesome, and even after seeing this as much as I have, I still get caught up in it.To me, ""Independence Day"" is synonymous with huge effects spectacle, at least in terms of Summer escapism. In a way, the movie really embodies it. Sure, we've had billion-dollar grossers since then, but can any of those movies really compare? None of them scream the July 4th holiday like this one, even while famous D.C. landmarks are decimated. I dare say that this has become synonymous with the idea of tentpole Summer titles, and even ingrained as a patriotic movie.Bottom line, it's the assured direction and across-the-board likability of the cast that makes this so watchable. I love the dogfights, and to this day, Bill Pullman's speech is rousing, to say the least. As cliché-ridden as this is, it's very well packaged.7/10",Independence Day

And thoroughly enjoying, although I couldn't really grasp what the story was about entirely. Which might have been a positive thing, since seeing it now the plot is actually quite dumb. It's a feel good alien invasion movie though and entertaining. If you can get past how dumb and ridiculous the direction the story takes in this one. This is probably the first movie I saw with Will Smith in it and this is probably one of the movies in his career that kick started his career. He is badass but comedic at the same time, which he is in a lot of his movies. But the first time I saw his performance, I was enthralled by his entertaining acting chops. I subplots are irrelevant, which focuses in on 3 main characters and there female loved ones during the invasion. I thought it would have been better if the story focused more on how to fight the aliens. Even the politics and how the countries work together during that situation would have been more interesting. So yeah, this is a entertaining popcorn flick and a movie that left it's mark when it came out. In another words it's not a great, intelligent movie. But for a movie that came out during the 90's it still holds up to a degree.7.4/10",Independence Day
39,OllieSuave-007,Lighting off fireworks on July 4th seems funner.,5,11 February 2015,"There was much hype about this movie when it was first released and I haven't watched it until many, many years later. It's a sci-fi movie with the classic alien-invasion theme, where a massive alien ship is wiping out much of the world's major cities. Therefore, a large group of survivors sets out towards Area 51, a secret government testing ground to devise a plan to counterattack the aliens.The alien invasion scenes begin almost immediately after the film starts, kicking the plot off to a fast pace. The special and visual effects of the alien spaceship, city destruction scenes and midair spacecraft battles were pretty spectacular. While the humans vs. aliens plot device generates some sort of excitement, much of the film is consumed in, what I think, in awkward attempts at humor and slapstick comedy, and also lacks much suspense and attention-grabber moments. This film is probably more of a sci-fi comedy, but the cast didn't appear to display much sensitivity, tension or urgency for an alien invasion incident, and the acting was pretty corny at times.Overall, it's a cheesy sci-fi movie. OK for some who enjoys campy sci-fi.Grade C-",Independence Day
40,thesar-2,ID4ever will watch this movie,8,4 September 2010,"First impressions rarely let me down. Rarely.Picture it, way back in 1996, Cine Capri in Phoenix, AZ, I first watched Independence Day andhated it. I went with two buddies, one of which said afterwards that it was realistic portrayal of the aliens. I said, ""In movies? Or (pointing) up there?"" He confirmed he meant from above. Sheesh. Eh, to each his/her own, but I didn't (at the time) find anything realistic about it.It was the second time I saw this, however, that grabbed me and opened my eyes to the best big-budget-B-movie ever made up to that point. And that's exactly what it is: a B-Movie with a Budget. It took elements from practically every MST3k-mocked mid-20th Century alien invasion story, but added the element of excessive funds.Further review of this movie, it also added hilarious lines, decent acting and state-of-the-art (EVEN by today's standards, 14 years later) special effects. So, you must know, this is the ultimate leave-your-brain at the door movie. Sit back and have a roaring time.Impatient people do not have to wait long for the movie to kick-start what it's here for; the alien mother ship makes it's ""Star Wars"" entrance seconds into the feature and all hell breaks loose first in the US government, but then the world as smoky-fire clouds reveal the ""baby"" 15-mile-wide ships over the world.Bam! Start the soap opera list of stars from various parts of the US. We've already met Constance (Colin) and President Whitmore (Pullman) in D.C. but then there's his First Lady Marilyn (McDonnell) in L.A. who shares the city with couple Steven (Smith) and Jasmine. NYC holds David (Goldlum) and Dad (Hirsch) – not to mention the hilarious Marty (Fierstein) who, instinctively cares for his mother and lawyer. For good measure, throw in crazy Russell (Quaid) who, not to really spoil anything, acts like Cartman from South Park episode one. There'll be more, but, I believe the movie revolves around this already extended cast.Unlike most disaster/end-of-the-world films, this is the best cast ever assembled in this particular genre. Unfortunately, even though I really did like the actors and their characters and felt the chemistry was perfect, that statement isn't saying much. Take Director/Producer/Writer Emmerich, since he happened to direct this one. Three of his follow-ups had so many big names and so many disappointments that I hardly cared enough about them to mind if they perished prior to the big and clichéd finales. 2012, 1998's Godzilla and The Day After Tomorrow were all sub-par to painful and each and every character was so one-dimensional and thoughtless, we lost a lot of what those movies were all about: hope.Don't get me started on the other Emmerich comrade, Michael Bay, and his terrible list of both movies and assemble of way below average characters: Pearl Harbor, Transformers 1-2, The Island and A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010.) (Personally, I didn't like Armageddon, but at least he had one-two worth rooting for in that disaster film.)At any rate, I loved the characters in Independence Day, but the true stars of the film was the special effects and tongue-in-cheek dialogue. After you get to know the different personality and employments of the actors, the rest of the movie is a just plain roller-coaster of aliens trying to eliminate us, humans failing at eliminating them, an actually plausible and believable love story and, of course, the kick-ass, though obvious FIGHT-BACK finale that does NOT disappoint for a single second.I'm a score-man. I love a beautiful and relevant instrumental background music track, and this movie's got a great one by David Arnold. It's not only action-packed and has elements of perfect Sci-Fi moments, but the number one quality it had was: HOPE. The movie centers around humans (FINALLY) banding together, putting way ""petty differences"" (LOVE THAT LINE) as spoken by the President in a great motivational and human speech, and the hope we have to survive. Truly, I love a score that through no spoken words, speaks tons for the movie, and mood, at hand.I've already mentioned how I liked the cast, but I'd like to focus in on some of my favorites. Back in the mid-1990s, it was unquestionable that the summers belonged to WILL SMITH. Bad Boys, Independence Day, Men in Black, heck, even some unfortunate fools went to see Wild, Wild, West. Personally, I like when he actually acts and not just play ""Will Smith"" but here he's at the top of his ""Hey, I'm Will Smith"" game.Further, I'm a fan of Jeff Goldblum, and you kinda have to be, to like him here. He's also playing his signature ""Hey, I'm JeffuhuhGoldblum"" role. He was hilarious, smart and I liked his true desire to use his talents to solve the little alien invasion problem.Mixed these two together, meaning Goldbulm's David and Smith's Steven, finally, and towards the end of the movie, it was heaven. They played off each other; two complete strangers who could both bounce off each other with 100% separate personalities, but had extreme chemistry. You almost wonder what took the movie so long to get them together.Finally, just plain see this movie, if you haven't already. It's extremely fun and even better on a big screen. In fact, this movie has been used in one of my long-standing arguments whenever I hear someone say ""Oh, I'll just wait for video."" Like Twister, Independence Day looks just, well, so small when you watch it on the television. Picture how threatening a 15-MILE-WIDE (TV Series) ""V""-shaped ship hovers over the cities as seen in the movie theater and then do the same for a 7 inch spacecraft on your TV and tell me this one was ""worth"" the wait for video.",Independence Day
41,FeastMode,my notes,6,30 June 2019,Entertaining and fun popcorn flick. a lot of cheesiness and corniness but still a fun time. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum were a great team (about 4 viewings),Independence Day
42,ElMaruecan82,"""Independence Day"" or America as the World in Microcosm ...",7,5 October 2011,"Let's get this straight, if only for the visual effects and the thrilling attacks sequences, for the iconic shot of the Empire State Building and White House blown to pieces, without any use of CGI but old good 'miniature' material, ""Independence Day"" is a groundbreaking achievement that redefines the purposes of visual and special effects in the Sci-Fi genre. And if only for that, the movie deserves a certain bit of respect.But when you make such a big-budgeted action-packed blockbuster, and expect to impress the eyes of movie goers and make their hearts pound so hard that they forget to put their salty fingers in the popcorn box, why not make a supplementary effect to improve a script that would justify the use of these special effects, and not let the success of a movie rely only on a technological achievement? In ""Independence Day"", it's like Roland Emmerich was so confident over the success of his film that he didn't care much for the complaints that would be expressed toward the script and its blatant lack of originality.And if it doesn't take a genius to know that some formulas simply cannot fail, it doesn't take an elitist mindset either to find obvious flaws in the way the story is written, and maybe worse, in the way the characters are written, not portrayed because I think the actors did a satisfying job with what was at their hands. Overall, the humans were fine but how about the Aliens? Couldn't have they come up with something fresher? I found hard to believe that these ugly octopus-like creatures could own a technology powerful enough to wipe out the entire human race. Well, never mind, the point is that I don't buy the argument that just because a movie features spectacular effects, one must suspend his disbelief and enjoy the movie for what it is, especially when the most difficult stuff is perfectly handled. I don't buy the counter-argument either that just because you criticize some elements of the plot, you're some kind of movie buff with a precious taste and a particular dislike for mainstream movies.I genuinely liked ""Independence Day"", I enjoyed it and not just as a guilty pleasure. I will never forget the experience in the movie theater when even as a 14 year old kid, I couldn't help but cheer during the President's speech. Oh some parts probably made me cringe, but it's nothing compared to what was thrown to my eyes that night, it was a great year for action films, ""Eraser"", ""The Rock"" but on that level, ""Independence Day"" was a class on its own, that till now, stood the test of time. But the more I thought of it, the more I realize that I loved the experience much more than the story ... well, the result is pretty much the same, and the film was the highest grossing of the year but this indicates the main flaw on special-effects-driven film like ""ID4"", they leave as great an impression as a ride on a roller-coaster, but as ephemeral too. Their inner ambition is more to garner the most viewers than to leave an indelible mark on cinematic papers. Again, the team did a good job, but it just could have been so much better on the story department.I don't want to fall in the wisecracking trap by numbering all the clichés that structure the plot; it would be a pointless exercise, because whatever plot was, it was relying on an overused concept anyway. And the film features every single stereotypical elements so cherished by the disaster genre, a lot of social and racial backgrounds presented through the classic external focus with the maximum of diversity as to sustain the beautiful vision of America's melting-pot. In a way, it's more economical to show all the racial minorities that constitute America than the whole world, America as the microcosm of the World. Hell, the liberation from the Alien invasion even coincided with the 4th of July. I hesitate between two words starting with P: pretension or patriotism, but when things are so obviously over the top, I guess it's a more of a clever reminder than we're only watching a film  as if we hadn't noticed before.""Today we celebrate our Independence!"" Did that make me cringe as a non-American? Not quite and I doubt the people in the theater pushed their thinking as far as I'm doing right here in a totally different context. In cinemas' darkness, movies affect us more, creating a deeper connection with the protagonists, in that case, a charismatic country. America entertains the world, and never is the empathy as strong as in theaters. I remember how the crowd cheered during that speech, and while I'm not sure people would look at the film the same way now, it makes me realize how these times were still innocent. These lost years between the Gulf War and the September 11th Attacks, when nothing was as religiously and politically lauded as today, from every side. I still look at the attack sequence with cinematically fascinated eyes, but I'm still lucid about the way some people would consider, now, the sight of the Empire State Building's explosion.And I wonder if that works as a critic or an alibi for ""Independence Day"" ... world has become a very dangerous place by itself and maybe this is what makes the film an innocent and immature entertainment. Let just think that the real enemy for men is the Alien, when it has come to men vs. men. There's even a sort of sentimental fatalism in the way it shows that it's only in the case of Alien attacks that Humanity will join its forces and be united.Finally, if the movie ever sinned, it's from a childish naivety  or was it deliberate? Or have we become just so mature that we changed our whole mindset regarding movies?",Independence Day
43,bowmanblue,It is what it is,7,4 December 2017,"I watched 'Independence Day' back in 1995 during the 'height' of the X-files-induced 'alien fever' that was so prominent in popular culture that even the President of America at the time had to address the world and point out that the Government wasn't really stashing away bodies of little grey men. Therefore me, like many, were absolutely blown away when marketing material showed a giant alien spaceship hovering over the White House and promptly blowing it to pieces. That one iconic image sold the film alone. However, I distinctly remember the sense of disappointment I felt upon leaving the cinema. I'd seen the (fleeting!) clips of aerial dogfights between fighter jets and UFOs and expected them to make up more of the film. However, what I got was effectively a two and a half hour story about one stupid decision after the next.Despite being one of the most profitable movies of all time, it hardly won any prizes for logical storytelling. If you search Google for articles about the film's numerous plot holes and daft developments (Apple laptop being the highpoint!) you'll see what I mean. I didn't hate the film at the time. I appreciated the amazing special effects (for the day) and a great deal of work had gone into showing the carnage caused by an alien attack of populated areas. No faults there. So, if the effects were really the only stand-out aspects of the film, why did I end up buying the film and still watch it to this day? Well, I guess I appreciate it for what it is. It's the very definition of loud, dumb and stupid. It's a 'popcorn' movie, designed to entertain and keep your mind vaguely occupied while you check Instagram on your phone. Granted today's generations will probably not appreciate the effects, based on the numerous superhero movies where entire cities get reduced to ruins over a period of a half hour battle sequence, but what still holds up is the general sense of eagerness. This is arguably the film that launched Will Smith's career and you just can't help but warm to him. Yes, no matter how dumb and unlikely every situation he's placed in is, he's still brilliant to watch and, along with Jeff Goldblum (who's basically playing Jeff Goldblum – again), the pair of them make the movie still relevant to this day.So, if you want to enjoy 'Independence Day' you'll definitely have to put your brain on hold and know that you're getting what became the template for disaster movies (certainly nineties ones anyway, but then 'San Andreas' was pretty much the same story). You'll also have to be okay with healthy doses of 'pro-America' scripting. If you've watched (the brilliant) 'Team America: World Police' you'll probably be singing along that song of theirs 'America *£$% yeah!' all the way through, as it really is applicable. And then, when you're done enjoying the stupidity, treat yourself to a YouTube video on how these are the dumbest aliens ever to invade our planet (with the possible exception of that lot from 'Signs').",Independence Day
44,ThomasDrufke,Welcome to Earth,6,28 June 2016,"1996 was a vastly different time for big time blockbusters. Independence Day is easily one of the most famous end-of-the-world blockbusters, but sadly, 20 years later, it doesn't necessarily hold up. With painfully cheesy one-liners and one-too many characters to follow, it's a less than stellar take on the alien invasion genre.One thing that does stand out is the ensemble cast. Perhaps besides Harvey Fierstein, I really enjoyed the entire cast. With a powerhouse like Will Smith bringing the charisma and most of the film's comedy, all you need is some solid supporting cast members to carry the rest of the weight, although let's face it, Jeff Goldblum plays the exact same character he does in Jurassic Park. Having said that, there are far too many characters that feel entirely unnecessary and end up bloating the film to an hour and a half. Cut half of the supporting roles and 30min of screen time and you have a much more re-watchable film.I can't entirely blame the film for having dated special effects, especially since it won an Oscar for them. However, I can blame the film for having a script and direction that doesn't seem to care enough to develop the characters and story into a respectable blockbuster territory. Perhaps it's because we are so inundated with mega-films that do all of these things so well that I got a little upset watching Independence Day. How many times can Roland Emmerich zoom the camera in on someone giving a shocked face at the alien's ship? It happens at least 20 times within the first hour.This film definitely has its copycats, as Emmerich recently pointed out in an interview. But he took a lot from the previous sci-fi epics that came before him. Everything from the music, end credits (visually), to the space battles felt like something out of a Star Wars or Star Trek film. With that said, none of those films have as good of a speech as Bill Pullman does as he rallied the pilots before the final takedown. That's right about when I began to accept the film for what it is and forgive some of the horrifically cheesy moments.Although the film is over 140 minutes long, we never really get a sense as to the alien's motivations or backstory as to their appearance on earth, which was disappointing for sure. Why did we need to follow the kids of one of the pilots, who barely had a role, and not get a little bit more insight from the aliens point of view? These are just a few of the issues I had with the film, but really, it's mindless fun that doesn't really need to be dissected to such an extent. Overall, it's half way decent and likely better than it has any right to be.+Will Smith's ridiculous one-liners+Pullman's speech+Mindless fun-Enough with the close-ups-Too many side characters-And they are focused on way too much6.0/10",Independence Day
45,Cineanalyst,Area 51 Storm,4,4 July 2021,"Usually it makes sense to me why this or that film or scene becomes iconic, but I may not get this one--how something so vacuous gains such cultural cachet. ""Independence Day"" was part of the 1990s resurgence in blockbuster disaster flicks--whatever that's worth. The visual effects, largely practical ones, were state of the art, but there's nothing especially groundbreaking that I discern from blowing up a White House miniature by shooting a laser beam through its center. Maybe it's not surprising that the same director, Roland Emmerich, went on to utterly bowdlerize the history of American Independence in ""The Patriot"" (2000), which I also rewatched this 4th of July. At least there, the hackery was amusing, or at least I thought so. This one, too, starts out as somewhat humorous as characters react to first contact--not unlike were they in one of those 1950s sci-fi films owed so much to here, such as ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951) on that staticky TV, but that quickly falls to the wayside as the dull eureka moments and counterattack planning, as well as the inevitable sentimentality, and the reliance on the thin comedic talents of the likes of Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum sets in.This was after Desert Storm, so maybe there was a thirst at the time for war turned into seemingly-simplistic screen spectacle, whether broadcast on CNN or projected at the cinema. Indeed, the Gulf War is brought up a few times here, as the President of the United States is a veteran fighter pilot from the campaign, and people the world over with their eyes glued to boob tubes is a frequent sight. The only one of the four main heroes in the movie who's not a fighter pilot is a satellite technician for television.It's also hard not to see this fictional president as a reaction to the Clinton administration, especially given Clinton was the first president not to serve in the military since FDR. Hollywood seemed to do the same thing by next electing a fictional warrior president in ""Air Force One"" (1997). Perhaps, next electing in the real nation the last president thus far to serve in the military and subsequently getting entangled in two wars in the Middle East has quieted the public war-waging appetite for the time being. Were ""Independence Day"" made half a decade later, it would've become a metaphor for 9/11 and terrorism instead, as is the case with ""War of the Worlds"" (2005), ""Cloverfield"" (2008), ""The Avengers"" (2012), ""Man of Steel"" (2013). Here, though, in 1996, it's almost as though it doesn't matter the reasons for war. As the political aide quips, voters ""elected a warrior, and they got a wimp."" Anything beyond a simple notion of survival or, at most, a personal vendetta, as with the drunk alien-abductee here, is beyond Emmerich's reckoning, here and in ""The Patriot.""Granted, the extra-terrestrials do have the nominal motivation of depleting Earth's natural resources, and there's Goldblum's bit regarding recycling, as if ""Independence Day"" were some half-hearted global warming metaphor, but that doesn't really work. That's just exposition, filler, stuff that happens--not what the narrative is about. The movie is hollow. The monsters mean nothing. They're convenient fodder for ""Top Gun"" (1986) style jet porn and shoot-'em-up action, rat-a-tats and kabooms as we gawk at our screens.",Independence Day

The acting is decent. Will Smith, with a movie career underway, is excellent. Bill Pullman is great as the President. The effects were amazing especially when the buildings were blown up.

49,CuriosityKilledShawn,Virtually unwatchable now,4,29 July 2000,"Ah...1996. It seems as if it were only yesterday. But it's a world away from the cynical, fearful, paranoid, and oppressive times we live in now. ID4 would be rightfully laughed out of cinemas in the present day.America, pulsating infectious positive vibes with its booming economy, popular President running for re-election, a summer crammed with iconic, action-packed adventures such as The Rock, Mission: Impossible, and Eraser, all while riding high the wave of the Atlanta Olympics, naturally turned ID4 into the biggest hit of the decade. I must admit, I too was suckered into it.Why do I say suckered? I recall being amazed by the teaser trailer before a screening of Broken Arrow on April 13th, a full 4 months before the release (we had to wait until August 9th in the UK). It promised a dark, scary, and serious film about interstellar war. Then, as we got closer, a new trailer synced to the theme of Crimson Tide came out, mesmerizing audiences with then revolutionary visual effects.When the film was finally released the dark, scary, and serious film that we were promised across the entire ad campaign quickly descended into camp, corny, stupid nonsense. It's easy to make a terrible film and entertain the masses with flickering images and bright, pretty colors even if it doesn't make a shred of sense. How else would you account for the success of Michael Bay? ID4 is bad across the board. The dialogue is just awful, I cringe at every other line. Despite the fact that an end-of-the-world scenario is potentially very dramatic there is no real acting in the film at all. Each and every one of the actors speak like they're reading from cue cards being held beside the static camera. Will Smith's irregular ad-libbing is irritating and dates the film even further. Bill Pullman, as much as I like him, stumbles through the film like he's drunk and/or unable to understand English.Principal photography for ID4 wrapped in well under 3 months. I blame the swift shoot for the obvious lack of rehearsals and decent performances. It's like Roland Emmerich got the film in the can as quickly as possible at the expense of everything that might actually make it worthwhile. His non-effort results in almost the entire film being made of static shots with no hand-held camera movements whatsoever, which castrates ID4 of any sense of urgency or realism. Even the extras are bad, which is pretty sad considering all they have to do is run away from very fake explosions. If they didn't work for free then the production was ripped off.There's not one likable character. The second round of promos sold it as a Will Smith movie. It's not. He's really a secondary character in a cast filled with secondary characters. The worst subplot features Randy Quaid as a drunk pilot. Whenever the film cuts to his family (and his very annoying, moody, Keanu Reeves lookalike son) it threatens to keel over and die. Emmerich really ought to have been a bit more liberal with the scissors. It's astonishing to think that his director's cut is even longer. As if it were not already too bloated and clumsy.Of all the would-be greatness, only David Arnold's rousing score truly entertains. Though if your very geeky like me you'll realize that it's merely a plagiarism of Richard Joseph's theme to James Pond 3 on the Mega Drive.Worth watching only as a curious, outdated relic of an innocent time long since gone. ID4's enjoyment has long since expired.",Independence Day

51,vincentlynch-moonoi,Heckuva good movie!,8,30 November 2013,"I'll tell you how I know that this is a REALLY good movie. First, I very rarely enjoy science fiction films; less than a handful in my entire life...and I'm 64 years old. Second, I very rarely enjoy military movies. Third, I rarely enjoy disaster films. And those genres are what this movie is. And I love it! The cast does a terrific job here. I was never much of a fan of Jeff Goldblum, but here as an MIT-educated computer expert, he's really good. In fact, there's only a handful of films I've really enjoyed him in, this being the principal one. This film, and ""Six Degrees Of Separation"" were the two movies that led me to realize that Will Smith was a lot more than just a sitcom actor and a rapper. I've enjoyed him ever since. He is wonderful here as a Marine pilot. Bill Pullman is no favorite of mine, but he does well here as the President and former war fighter pilot. I always enjoy seeing Robert Loggia, and no less so here as a general and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Randy Quaid is good as comic relief, but his role here is just a little deeper, and he handles it well...though the role as an alcoholic crop duster and veteran Vietnam War pilot who claims to have been an alien abductee is illogical. James Duval, as Quaid's son, does well here. To bad he's just a little too weird to be more Hollywood mainstream; he showed potential. Judd Hirsch...well, too stereotypical as an old Jew in this film for me to enjoy his performance. Mary McDonnell is low key as the First Lady. Vivica A. Fox...this was probably the first time I ever noticed her, though it took quite a few years before I became fully aware of her.The special effects here are quite stunning.The story? Well, as with all science fiction, there's a lot to swallow here. The biggest of which being that during a war for survival the American president would actually get involved in the battle by flying a jet...even if he had been a former military pilot.

53,ironhorse_iv,Watching Independence Day is like watching fireworks. Beautiful to watch and ready to explode.,7,4 July 2013,"Nothing says, American 4th of July holiday than a H.G Wells, ""War of the Worlds"" remake from Disaster King German Director Roland Emmerich call Independence Day. Honestly, this movie has nothing to do with American Revolution or the founding of the country. This movie has much to do with Independence Day, as killer giant Ewoks have to do with Grito de Dolores, (Mexico's Independence Day) which is little to none. I can see the rationale for why some people think Independence Day is the coolest Alien Invasion movie ever, and why some people think it's massively stupid. It's both, it's kinda dumb, but also lots of fun to watch. This movie isn't worth taking too serious, over. The movie is meant to be enjoy. And yeah, it's a War of the Worlds adaptation and probably one of the better modern update of that book because it's fun and works in the book's way of defeating the aliens in a modern way that's not too absurd. For a movie that channeling 'War of the Worlds', it does show other countries and other places trying to fight against the aliens, than the original movies. I do like that. It really does seem like a War of the Worlds. There isn't much to the plot besides the fact that Aliens attacking bit cities and people trying to fight them off. The narrative mostly focuses on a desperate group of people who are some of most stereotypical clichés characters ever, but also the most interesting and awesome, people I would like to be with, if Aliens ever do attack. In my opinion, I think the actors are mostly playing themselves in this film. There is Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) who flies in jet fighter planes and on his free time, punches aliens in the face while giving out some of the best bad ass lines. Not only is he the ultimate cool hero type, but Will Smith gives one charming performance. This movie, pretty much made Will Smith's movie career. He just move from one big explosion addict blockbuster Director (Michael Bay) to another big explosion addict blockbuster Director Roland Emmerich. The second best character in the film is David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) who is pretty damn cool how smart he is in solving problems. Then you got President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman), the Harrison Ford's Air Force One type of a president who gives one of the best speeches in the history of film. Last character worth noting is Russell Casse (Randy Quaid) who is pretty much just Cousin Eddie from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation with a different name who helps pilot the last comeback attack. As less, the producers gave him, a jet plane, rather than his normal biplane. It wouldn't work if he had to fly that to keep pace with F-18s. The special effects are awesome, even by today's standards of CGIs. I really believe the cities were getting destroy. The music compose by David Arnold is brilliant. Very uplifting and adventurous. There are a lot of cool scenes in the film, and a lot of dumb moments. One is the dog saving scene. I know dogs in film are typically seen as innocent, loyal, and uncorrupted, but to value animal life more important than human lives in film is just silly and wrong. If I had to choose between protecting my child and saving my dog, I would protect my child. That's not cold-hearted; that's called being a good parent. There are other questionable scenes worth asking. Like how do the aliens know the most ironic buildings for each city for point of attack, why did they wait six hours until attacking, and how can people give an alien computer a virus when they didn't even exist on OSX or basic Linux at that time? Specifically that the software would be incompatible. The biggest complain that I got for the movie is that nobody notice the aliens coming, even knowing they exist since 1947. For goodness sakes, you would have thought somebody would notice to tell somebody what was happening. Overall: personally I like Independence Day, even though I know it's corny. Really, though, the first half isn't all that bad. It's a cool set up to what turns out to be a bunch of reality pushing clichés. The scene where the big flying saucers are slowly appearing over the cities while the score lays on the horns is pretty awesome. Similar scenes have been tried in other movies since, and they just seem lame or excessive by comparison. In my opinion, Independence Day is how you film a good popcorn flick.",Independence Day

The plot is ripped off of so many other films, the aliens are so unoriginal, and it works on the principle that the Americans are just so good that they can beat off an alien invasion in one day.

Alien awesomeness with a heartwarming 90's style is always enjoyable.",Independence Day
58,paulclaassen,Entertaining despite bucket loads of plot flaws and credibility issues.,6,13 August 2018,"When reviewing a film, I always try not to comment on religious or political views, and judge it on an entertainment and credibility level, regardless of whether it is a drama or fantasy. Although this fantasy drama mentioned at one point in the film Independence Day would be a world celebration if they stand together and eliminate the enemy, I couldn't help but feel this film was viewed entirely from an American perspective. I did not agree with the choice of actors for some of the characters, especially Bill Pullman as the President. I'm not sure whether the President himself was not a very strong, believable character, or whether Bill Pullman was not serious enough to portray the President. Having said that, the dialogue is riddled with unnecessary humor, which was more annoying than funny and uncalled for. The film had a serious premise, but it was handled in a very lighthearted manner, killing the potential suspense more often than not. The scenes that were done more seriously, were preceded or followed by comical scenes, deeming even the serious scenes lighthearted. The film had all the material to be an awesome action thriller, but the characters and dialogue were too stereotypical American. The film also had way too many plot holes and convenience, silly remarks and a lot of credibility issues that made me raise an eyebrow. For now, I'll only mention the scene where Will Smith volunteers to fly the alien aircraft, saying he's seen how they manoeuvre. SEEN is completely different to actually FLYING an alien aircraft, and he not only succeeds, but manages to escape through almost impossible obstacles. Another example is Randy Quaid's character, Russell Casse, volunteering to fight the aliens. He flies a plane, yes, but its one thing to be able to fly a plane, but to engage in combat is entirely different. He simply does not have the experience, so it wasn't believable in the least. The music was also too dramatic and overbearing at times.Regardless, this was indeed a very entertaining action sci-fi with some amazing action sequences and visual effects that are good to this day. The aliens in particular were very well designed.",Independence Day

60,briancham1994,Bombastic blockbuster,7,4 August 2020,"This film is a very action-packed 90s blockbuster that does everything wrong and yet somehow achieves greatness. It is full of dramatic stakes, quippy one-liners and intense special effects. Perhaps the best part is the cast who just go all-out with their portrayals.",Independence Day
61,tomgillespie2002,No longer the movie I once despised,7,15 January 2017,"What I remember about Roland Emmerich's Independence Day as I child is the cheesy one-liners, that Presidential speech that has everymen and war heroes alike puffing out their chest with patriotism, and a portrayal of a world where America acts as the sole voice of reason to a bunch of lesser powers who fully embrace their own stereotype. I always hated it, and could not fathom why the movie had gathered such a loyal army of fans throughout the years, even amongst critics. The film was, and still is, very much a modern-day blockbuster, but watching it again 15 or so years later, it now seems wonderfully old-fashioned.Dismissing the more studious, and admittedly more intelligent, first contact movies of the 1970s as liberal wishful thinking, Independence Day harks back to the alien invasion pictures of the 50s, where a more us-against-them approach catered to the Cold War- influenced paranoia of the time, and squared-jawed heroes, loony scientists and military personnel alike put their heads together to defeat a force from outer space. Here, we get Will Smith as Captain Steven Hiller, a hotshot pilot who manages to capture one of the tentacled martians after a disastrous dogfight; Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson, a genius satellite technician who uncovers the aliens' plans; and Bill Pullman as President Thomas Whitmore, a young ex-pilot going through an image crisis.The posters and trailers focused on the image of the giant alien ship looming over major American cities, and indeed the moments of catastrophic destruction (usually of famous landmarks) and giant energy beams still manage to amaze, with the special effects still holding up 20 years later. Yet the movie spends most of its time at ground level, and crams it with enough characters and side-stories to fill another 3 films. The three central, intertwining stories aside, we also have a sub-plots involving Hiller's wife Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) encountering the wounded First Lady (Mary McDonnell), and a boozed-up crop duster played by Randy Quaid, whose claims of alien abduction have made him a laughing stock. Throw in Robert Loggia, Judd Hirsch, Harvey Fierstein and Brent Spiner, and there's enough going on to make your head spin.Yet Independence Day manages to burst through the convolution by sheer force, delivering a story that is simplistic, ham-fisted and very stupid, but never unspectacular. The three leads help make their characters memorable and incredibly likable with charisma alone, as the script never allows them to be anything more than an archetype. It's the very definition of big, dumb and fun, and was a bit of a game-changer in its day. Disaster movie audiences were no longer satisfied unless they witnessed carnage on a global level, and blockbusters today are still trying to replicate the success of 'ID4', including the director himself, who tried and failed on an astronomic level with the utterly atrocious 2012 (2009). I didn't see it coming, but my opinion of Independence Day has completely changed. Perhaps the movie's age gives it a nostalgic charm it never had before, so I'm hardly anticipating the sequel.",Independence Day

63,redryan64,"We had thought of this Movie as a Juvenile project; BUT, ""Upon Further Review..............""",10,4 August 2008,"WHEN first viewed, this INDEPENDENCE DAY (Centropolis Entertainment/20th Century-Fox, 1996), seemed to be a spectacularly done action flick; aimed at the Saturday Juvenie crowd, the kids. It was, we concluded, a sort of ""popcorn"" outing that was custom tailored for the demographics of the Saturday Matinée set. Our conclusion: thisINDEPENDENCE DAY and films like it, we reasoned, were especially made as a sort of modern day replacement for the Cliff-Hanger Serials and the Juvenile ""B"" Westerns series pictures; starring the likes of Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, ""Wild Bill"" Elliot and Sunset Carson.WELL we do confess that this first screening was done at the ""office"" at Chicago Police Headquarters with all of the interruptions of the ""Police Procedural"" daily routine. Ringing telephones and notifications were the main business of the day; ergo, our attention was divided and with our inability to make any proper evaluation was hampered greatly. We can hear you crying out in sympathy to our plight with, ""Poor Babies!"" RECENTLY we watched INDEPENDENCE DAY on Fox Movie Channel with an eye toward being both objective and having a fresh and thorough evaluation; with no preconceived notions from the previous experience obstructing the view. Well hush my flannel mouthed face; but, there seem to be many layers of storyline and metaphor present that here to for had gone mostly unnoticed.CONTRARY to our (really ""my"") previous pigeon-holing, the Film really has a lot to offer to all on many levels.FIRST of all there was no expense spared in preparation and in laying the ground work for the telling of what could have been a simple, straight forward story of conflict into a grand, even epic tale related in highly complex and intelligent terms. The story, the cast, the Special FX, the Cinematography and even the music were all given extra refining before being assembled into the finished product.LOCATION shooting included many sites in the United States; as well as Kenya, Egypt, London, ""Down Under"" in Australia and some necessary In Studio This gave the films various scenes a truly World-Wide appearance. The highly complementary use of a highly diverse cast of characters as portrayed by an equally impressive variety of Actors and Actresses* made for a perfect fit with the storyline.MUCH like so many of the previously produced ""Disaster Movies"", such as EARTHQUAKE (Film Makers Group/Universal, 1974), THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY (Wayne-Fellows/Warner Brothers, 1954) and THE TOWERING INFERNO (Irwin Allen Productions/Warner Brothers/20th Century-Fox, 1974), the main story of the impending doom is made more interesting and human by having several smaller stories contained within its main framework. These sub-plots are almost usually devoted to personal crises that other wise pale by such comparison to the events of the day. You know what we mean; the quarrels, the divorce, corporate greed vs. individual rights, etc.AS for these said performances by the various cast members, we believe there was an outstanding collective effort by what has proved to be a sort of supporting ""Stock Company."" But of course, we do believe in giving some particularly deserving players a little extra praise. Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith) and his affianced Bride Jasmine Dubrow (Vivica A. Fox) provide an excellent story of a couple trying to make it, in spite of so many difficulties. The President, Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) plays a very human, albeit a highly skillful Chief Executive; well counter-balanced by his First Lady, Marilyn Whitmore, who is loving and supportive, yet a strong and independent, ""Her Own"" woman.** LIKEWISE the on-screen contributions of such film Actors as : Judd Hirsch & Jeff Goldblum as a Father & Son Scientific Genius Duo, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn and Margaret Colin portraying Presidential Advisors, Harvey Firestein as a Super-Scientist and Randy Quaid's interpretation of the alcoholic old crop-duster & actual victim of Alien Abduction. Singer & Band Leader, Harry Connick, Jr., garners our honorable mention award as the ""buddy"" and flying partner to Will Smith's main character.ANALYZING the overall effect of the film, we have to say that all characters who wore overalls in it did so quite well. (We just wanted to see if you were still with us!) MAKING a judgment about just INDEPENDENCE DAY really is on ALL levels, we have come to find that it is much more than the ""Bubble Gum"" that we had believed it to be; while watching it in the divided attention mode, back at Police HQ's, so long ago. We now find it to be operating on several levels in addition to the very enjoyable battle scenes; like some advice for our Nation and the Free World. THE World faced an overwhelming threat in the Movie (Alien Invasion by self avowed exponents of Genocide for the Human Race.) The President is plagued with a plethora of advisors, who all seem to be feeding the Chief Executive with conflicting information. The threat is constantly expanding and at one point, President Whitmore states that we are up against an inhuman and ruthless adversary who will not abide with any ""Diplomacy"". He makes a statement like, ""Hell, we should Nuke 'Em!"" IN drawing a parallel to our situation Today, we too face an enemy who wants only our destruction and a President may well have to follow what will be an unpopular foreign policy, at least for now; all in the interest of our People. It's sort of like what Harry Truman said about the loneliest job; ""This is where the Buck Passing Stops!"" NOTE: * Yeah Schultz, we know; ""Actress"" is not deemed to be very Politically Correct by the Correct Speech Fascists.NOTE ** Yes Oprah, that's spelled ""W-O-M-A-N!"" POODLE SCHNITZ!!",Independence Day
64,zkonedog,THIS Is How Summer Blockbusters Should Be Made!,9,9 March 2017,"When making a movie of the ""summer blockbuster"" type, there a number of elements that must be present, such as action, adventure, a bit of humor, some sort of seemingly unstoppable enemy, & (if the film studio really cares) some interesting characters to latch onto. The coup de grace comes if the film is able to anchor itself around a significant moment/date either past, present, or future. ""Independence Day"" scores high marks on all those elements.For a basic plot summary, the film sees planet Earth suddenly attacked by aliens bent on taking over the world. With the future of the nation on the line, President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) recruits military man Steven Hiller (Will Smith) & scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) to hatch a plan to defeat the sinister invaders on the weekend of the Fourth of July.To put it as plainly as possible, ""Independence Day"" is primarily a rousing success because of the gravitas the ""Fourth of July"" theme lends it. Without that holiday serving as the backdrop of the alien invasion, it just wouldn't be as epic and would likely fail to get viewers as invested. For example, a speech given by Pullman's character towards the end of the film will bring the hair on the back of your neck to attention due to it being given on our nation's birthday.To be fair, however, this film is well-constructed enough to stand on its own merits. Primarily, this happens because of the all-star cast and their character development on screen. Besides the three primary leads (of which Smith almost steals the show at some points), other accomplished actors like Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Adam Baldwin, & Vivica A. Fox round out the supporting roles. They all interact very well with each other and give the viewers some people to root for (a necessity in any quality invasion film).Overall, ""Independence Day"" is easily a flick that can be enjoyed every July 4th (at the very least). It's one of those movies where you pop the popcorn, turn out the lights, and just get swept away in the scope of the action playing out on the screen.",Independence Day
65,filipemanuelneto,When disasters call for Americanism.,4,7 September 2015,"In this film, directed by Roland Emmerich (the man who likes to destroy the earth again and again and again), the Earth is threatened by giant alien ships that come out of nowhere in the sky, covering the major cities on the planet. The first attacks confirm the worst expectations: they are hostile. It's the opportunity of ""Uncle Sam"" to save the world from bad guys in full holiday of July 4th. From cast we can detach Will Smith, Bill Pullman and Mary McDonnell, respectively in the role of an Air Force airman, the U.S. President and his wife.This film addresses a theme that recurs in the film: aliens, and the possibility of they want to invade us. The question is what we would have so interesting to arouse that desire. The film also raises another question: although the film is American, why are Americans always the heroes of such films? The answer is simple: because only then these films can be used as propaganda to United States and all they represent. And if doubts exist of that see the title itself: the ""independence day"" has nothing to do with aliens but with the holiday of U.S. independence declaration. The way it's portrayed the US president himself also helps to see the ""hidden"" nature of this film.Although the actors fail to surprise and the script aren't innovative (even recalls, partially, the H.G. Wells novel ""War of the Worlds""), the film becomes interesting for the visual and special effects, which earned the Oscar for this category. Also the sound effects deserve a very positive note. Therefore, sci-fi and special effects lovers: this film was made entirely for you, especially if you are American.",Independence Day

Financially that is; I did have to clock off a couple hours on the dwindling meter of my life, however. I suppose it is mostly my fault tho, because I am old enough to know that, as a rule, the more a film is hyped, the more it stinks. And, ladies and gents, this rubbish pile stunk all the way out to wherever the little green men live. Hammy? Overacted? SILLY!? Yes to all! What was Fresh Prince bringing his brand of humor *laugh* into a so-called serious action film for? Know what this undeveloped mess reminds me of? The James Bond movies with Roger Moore. I despise a movie with all the little jokes and cool asides thrown in during what is supposed to be a tense moment.

75,FiendishDramaturgy,Amazing Patriotic Popcorn Fare...,9,27 October 2003,"Yes, the story has contradictions. Yes, the plot has holes. Yes, Will Smith is about the most over-rated actor on the planet. But this is still a terrific movie!I'm not about going with the mainstream on anything. Chances are, if it's loved in the mainstream, I avoid it like the plague. I've never seen ""Forest Gump,"" because of that. I grew up near the Alabama Bayou town where part of that movie was filmed (Coden is one block from Bayou La Batre, AL), and I never felt the need or desire to see that movie. The more I heard how good it was, the less I wanted to see it, until I had built up a pretty good aversion to it which still persists, today. Same goes for Apollo 13. Never saw it. Never wanted to. I was alive back then, and remember the moon walk. I don't need a movie about it, to remind me how fantastic and awe-inspiring it was. It was like touching the face of a god.My point is, regardless of the plot holes, the obvious ""War of the Worlds"" similarities, and the grandstanding done by both Smith and Goldblum, I found this movie to be highly entertaining. It's not the most intelligent production out there, but its entertainment value alone makes it well worth the time it takes to view it.Goldblum and Smith both ponied up professional (if at times hammy) performances in this production, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I watch it often, in fact. Also, I am highly patriotic. I'm proud to be an American. My family has fought (and died) for America's rights and causes, and in America's wars, throughout history since they immigrated here from Scotland and Germany in the (very) early 1800's, and I am proud of my heritage as an American. This movie inspired me, uplifted me, and made me feel a stronger sense of pride for feeling the way that I do.Bash this movie if you will. Bash Americans and American ideals.

76,freemantle_uk,A fun dumb film,8,22 April 2008,"I was around 10/11-years-old when this film came out and it still appeals to that part of me. The basic plot of the film is that alien spaceships suddenly come to Earth and hover over major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Washington, London, Moscow etc. The American government debate on what to do and how to communicate with the aliens. At the same time, a senior engineer at a television company, David (Jeff Goldblum), discovers strangle goings on and suspects the aliens. He realises that they were using the world's satellites against them and were planning to attack the Earth. After racing off the save the American President the aliens attacked and destroyed the world's major cities and planned to attack other cities such as Houston. When the American tried to fight the aliens were far stronger and technologically advanced.The film is dumb, but that is why it works. You can just swing your brain off and just watch it. Its meant to be loud, its meant to have a lot of action and explosions. It had good special effects for its time and it helped Will Smith from a TV star to a major movie star. This film is Roland Emmerich's best. He is German director who is famous for directing big budget action films.

Its budget, its Oscar-winning special effects, its blockbuster status as the highest-grossing movie of 1996 - yeah, all in all, ""Independence Day"" is a big movie, a really big movie.

It also has an all-star cast consisting of Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Vivica A. Fox, and Randy Quaid. When massive 15-mile wide alien spaceships darken the skies over the world's major cities, the people of planet Earth are caught in spectacle. But wonder turns to out-right terror when the alien ships begin raining down destructive beams all over the major cities and killing millions in the process. Why do they do it? They're after our natural resources, we learn; they just want to wipe us out first to make it easier for them to get what they want and leave. The plot isn't the best or even the most original aspect of this movie; that's not the point. What master of disaster director Roland Emmerich wants to deliver is special effects, awesome scenes of extraterrestrial destruction, and action scenes detailing humanity's brave fight back against the technologically superior alien menace. ""Independence Day,"" for the longest time, was my favorite movie of all time; I lived and breathed it. All I could talk and think about was ""Independence Day,"" and I'm not sure how or why I didn't wear out my VHS tape from so many repeated viewings. 15 years later, this movie is still as thrilling and entertaining as it ever was. Is the movie really rah-rah go-it-alone American patriotism? I have no idea, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I don't care, and I'M an American. All I care about is the alien invasion and humanity's desperate struggle to fight back. I could care less if it's patriotism before 9/11 made uber-patriotism the hot new thing to be in America. And oh yeah, ""Independence Day,"" as its title would imply, is set over the course of the American Fourth of July weekend. Oh, well. Regardless, ""Independence Day"" still rocks, big-time! And get ready for those fireworks at the end!10/10",Independence Day
78,drqshadow-reviews,"Big and Dumb, but Weirdly Charming, ID4 is a Lasting '90s Blockbuster",6,21 September 2020,"Giant, hostile, alien spaceships appear overnight to move on Earth's natural resources; humanity's last, desperate hope is a shaky plan involving a captured UFO from the 1950s and an old PowerBook laptop. Seems like this one was a guilty-pleasure classic from opening day. ID4 isn't well-written and constantly bathes itself in dense layers of cheese, but it tries hard, most the character arcs connect and the big special effects hold up quite well, despite their age.For a movie that's so thoroughly reliant on spectacle, that last point is pretty important. The power of watching the White House or Empire State Building burst into a billion bitty pieces is still there, irresistible, while the magnitude of the invading fleet remains immense, and I think both can be attributed to the production's choice to eschew then-new CG techniques in favor of a large, intricately detailed stable of miniatures. We get a few hiccups, like the obviously green-screened fighter jets or the absurd visual of a golden retriever leaping to slow-motion safety through a fiery inferno, but for the most part it all looks great and it's still easy to get sucked into the experience.Of course, the whole thing is over-acted to death. Roland Emmerich has never been one to bring out nuance from his cast, and this is an awfully shallow effort, even by his standards. Bill Pullman nails the big motivational speech, set to a telegraphed swell of patriotic symphony, but otherwise lacks conviction as a limp, reactive PotUS. Randy Quaid is a cheap xerox of every alien abduction stereotype to ever enter pop culture. Jeff Goldblum is naturally quirky enough to make his role worthwhile, but it takes every bit of his innate charismatic magnetism to overcome the dumb plot developments. Will Smith is the only unequivocal success, barking and fist-pumping his way to bonafide action hero status in a simple but essential role as a beefy marine / pure force of will.From a critical perspective, this is cinematic junk food. Big bangs and shiny lights to dazzle the box office crowd, with a few easy jokes to lighten the mood. But yet, there's something else to it, something essential and inexplicable. It's just raw, simple fun, I suppose, that makes no apologies for how it acts or what it aims to be. It won't make you think or weep, but you'll feel, and that's worth something.",Independence Day
79,XweAponX,People forget how well this film was received originally,10,2 August 2016,"And most people rating it today were maybe not even born when it came out. Different Generations see films differently. But I saw it weeks after it came out, and the Theatre was still filled to maximum on a weekday Matinée. I stayed in the Theatre and watched it a second time. I've watched this film many times since then and the magic is still there, especially in the extended cut. As with the new ID4 film, my favorite character was Dr Brackish Okun (Named after Special Effects man Jeffery Okun) played by Star Trek: Next Generation's Brent Spiner.Emmerich and Devlin should have used this film as a template when making their sequel, it seems they had forgotten how to tell this story. The fast pace, multiple character stories, and wry humor kept you glued to it. Randy Quaid's ""Russel Casse"" basically stole the film just like Brent Spiner did with the second one. What works is the flawed characters, both of these people, Casse and Okun, have serious social character flaws but they both rise above their perceived Geekness to become heroes.But what made this film great was the way they Composited practical special effects with the primitive Apple CGI of the time. When they showed the Alien Mothership and the 13-mile wide invasion ships, they looked not only big, but real. The Pyrotechnics were all filmed with real models of the cities that were being destroyed, upside down, so the Alien Weapons aftermath do not follow the laws of physics.Another thing that was not done in the new version, but was exploited here, was the use of an Apple Laptop as mankind's best weapon against an alien invasion. In the new time-line generated by this story, we have to assume the Apple Cupertino plant was destroyed, and there never were any IMacs, IPhones, or even modern day tablets and smartphones. Instead, advances in computing and Aerodynamics were affected by the infusion of Alien Tech. So the world depicted in ID4: Insurgence was not the familiar landscape we see here, which was totally destroyed.That probably made it difficult to insert modern day products into that story, as none existed. The Only thing we see there, was QQ taking over global communications due to by the void of ATT being gone.Emmerich and Devlin created an invasion story of special magnificence, something so large we could not have imagined it until we saw it here. 1953's ""War of the Worlds"" came close, but we never saw the level of destruction that is shown here as three major US cites are totally eradicated, blown to smithereens, vaporized, gutted and otherwise obliterated.It seems they tried to make the Alien Invasion force in ""Resurgence"" even bigger than what we see here, and it does not work at all. But the nature of the invaders was explored more in the sequel. This installment gives us a first look.But mostly the interaction between Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith is clever, even the relationship between Goldblum and his ""father"" Judd Hirsh (From ""Taxi"") which is just like so many of us in our relationships with our fathers. Especially with Russel Casse and the love of his kids, despite his alcoholism. And President Whitmore and his daughter, Captain Steven Hiller and his Fiancé Vivica A Fox and her son. So this film explores how family dynamics would be affected in such a scenario. That aspect is severely lacking in the new sequel.Mainly it's a story about heroism, not Jingoism. Nobody waves any one flag, it's the whole world united, Israel and Palestine working and fighting together for a common cause. Which is the world we all would like to see eventually. Here it takes an Alien Invasion to bring people together. Hopefully that won't be the case. Ironically, the world was closer to that goal when this film came out than it is today.",Independence Day
80,alindsay-al,A great fun destructive film,8,23 June 2016,"With the sequel resurgence coming out I thought I would watch the original independence day and this film is just allot of great fun. The premise of the film sees an alien invasion that forces the whole world to unite to stop them. Jeff goldblum is a brilliant actor and he is really good in this film. I found hid character pretty interesting and I found him really entertaining throughout the film. Will Smith was an unknown at this point but he just oozes charisma in this film. I also liked his character and how he and goldblum interacted. Bill Pullman plays the president of the United states and he is possibly the coolest president in film history. He has a pretty emotional journey throughout this film and I really cared about him. I thought the two love interests were good as well as they worked and I bought there romance with smith and goldblum. The story has some decent character moments and depth to its characters. Unfortunately, the film is a little simple and it comes across with a few plot holes and clichés that don't help the decent run time. The script has some decent drama and humour in it but it just has quite a bit of ridiculous cheese in it. The style is great especially considering that this film is 20 years old I thought all the action scenes and special effects were great. Overall I really enjoyed this film and I hope the sequel is just as good.",Independence Day
81,Fluke_Skywalker,One of the last really good Summer popcorn movies,7,1 September 2013,"Not sure I'd walk across the street for a free screening of a new Roland Emmerich movie these days, but boy he came out of the gate with some fun—if derivative—popcorn entertainment; 'Universal Soldier', 'Stargate' and 'Independence Day'. I hadn't seen the latter in probably a decade, so when I saw it peeking out of the morass that is the $5 DVD bin at my local Wal-Mart, I bit. Like when I went to my 20 year high school reunion last year, I expected the years to be unkind to the likes of Steven Hiller, David Levinson and President Whitmore, but to my surprise they looked better than ever. Maybe it was nostalgia (aka - Mental Botox), but I enjoyed every minute of this movie. Corny? Oh sure. Holes in its logic? A few (dozen). But it was *fun*. There was no naval gazing, no gray areas, just good old fashioned cheerful heroics. Not sure a sequel could be anything but a huge let down, but I'll be there opening day, popcorn in hand.",Independence Day
82,sauravjoshi85,Watching in 2021 and barring few scenes the movie still holds the charm,8,3 May 2021,"Independence day is a Sci-fi action movie directed by Roland Emmerich and stars Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid and Margaret Colin with Vivica A. Fox.This is one of the epic movies made by hollywood and highest grosser of 1996. Although I did liked the movie very much but the movie could've been better with little more fine tuned screenplay still it doesn't steals the greatness of the movie.The aliens are on the verge of destroying the earth but is saved by some of the will, determination and unity of mankind. The plot of the movie is decently predictable but the execution is strong and will keep you glued.Screenplay of the movie is fast paced and will keep you engaged throughout the movie and with some great background score it just adds to the beauty to the screenplay.Acting is superb but the only weak point of the movie was Bill Pullman as in my personal opinion somewhere he didn't match the persona of an American president. Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith were amazing. Judd Hirsch had provided the humour and was effectively great.There were some scenes in the movie which I think could've been little fine tuned, in one of the scenes I couldn't understand the reason why the first lady was shown surviving the helicopter crash when eventually she was supposed to die later, maybe Mary McDonnell was paid more then her screentime so her screentime was little extended to recover entire money paid to her. Also the room in area 51 where the president and entire army was monitoring the alien movement and captured aliens were kept was made like a public park where anyone can enter on his or her own will. In my opinion that area should've been kept under the wraps so that the privacy of the area can be maintained.Nevertheless the movie still has enough ingredients to entertain and and enjoyable flick. A movie which can be watched with entire family.",Independence Day
83,barnabyrudge,"Corny, over-the-top space invasion film which is agreeably entertaining if you disengage the brain.",6,11 March 2007,"The most curious thing about Independence Day is that it is structured very much like a disaster movie of the 1970s. For about an hour or so, disparate characters from varied walks of life are sketched in, then the big cataclysm takes place which draws them all together in a struggle for survival. This is exactly how films like Airport, The Poseidon Adventure, Earthquake and The Towering Inferno were put together. The interesting slant with Independence Day is that it takes this 1970s disaster movie formula and fuses it with a genre that was at its most popular in the 1950s  the alien invasion story. With a mega budget, a cast of hundreds and state-of-the-art special effects, Independence Day is a box office juggernaut that brings out the best and worst of Hollywood movie-making. Corny, over-the-top and jingoistic one moment; exciting, entertaining and spectacular the next.A number of massive spaceships appear above several major cities around the world. Worldwide hysteria follows, with some people welcoming the extra terrestrial visitors with open arms while others fear that the end of life as we know it is imminent. American President Thomas J Whitmore (Bill Pullman) tries to keep everyone calm, promising to take a sensible and communicative approach towards the newcomers. Meanwhile, scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) breaks a code emanating from the alien spacecrafts and realises that they are co-ordinating an attack against the Earth. In a cataclysmic offensive, the great cities of the world are decimated by the aliens  the Empire State Building, the White House, airports, air bases, and city blocks are reduced to rubble during the systematic destruction. Ace US Air Force pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith) somehow survives a mid-air duel against an alien craft, and soon afterwards seeks refuge in the top-secret desert base Area 51. Here Hiller joins forces with Levinson, President Whitmore, and various others, and together they plan one final desperate roll of the dice in their bid to save the planet from the seemingly unstoppable invaders.It's simple to get carried away with Independence Day, especially when viewing it on the big screen. The epic scenes of destruction are done with such enthusiasm that it becomes very easy to sit back awestruck, enjoying the mindless spectacle of it all. (From a post-9/11 viewpoint, though, it's not quite such harmless fun to watch American landmarks crumbling to the ground). If you watch the film again afterwards, particularly on the small screen, some of its shortcomings are much more apparent. Things like the hopeless dialogue, the endless clichés, the non-stop jingoism surrounding American courage and ingenuity, and the largely wooden performances are a lot easier to spot second/third/fourth time around. But director Roland Emmerich is clearly having a great time with the cornball scenario - and during many sequences you can almost imagine him just to the left of the screen, rubbing his hands with glee and delighting in the sheer technical bravura of his simulated world destruction. It might be advisable to leave your brain in neutral.. but if you do just that, Independence Day hits the spot as exciting, escapist fun.",Independence Day

The special effects stand up today and I enjoyed the extended cast. On the downside the plot and character development is thin and its corny at times with much gung-ho flag waving as the rest of the world (Brits) wait for America to decide how to handle this Morse code. Great entertainment though.For the most part the story follows Will Smith as an army of alien spaceships attack earth and threaten to destroy the human race. There's a huge cast attached, banding together to stop the invasion with multiple story arcs converging. The initial take down by the aliens is well done, devastating on a global level with fire balls etc. It's one of those movies that I catch myself watching and enjoying every time I stumble across it on TV.I enjoyed Bill Pullman as the president, Jeff Goldblum's banter with his crotchety dad Judd Hirsch.

A big budget blockbuster that is Action packed with heart,drama & comedy. I grew up watching & loving this film & always loved WILL SMITH as captain Steven Hiller the mouthy Action Hero, One of Smith's best roles & one of his best movies!!! WILL SMITH owned the 90s & was & is still always a hero of mine. BILL PULLMAN was also great as the president & JEFF GOLDBLUM was funny & great as was the whole cast & the Alien FX are still Amazing even today!!! A real treat of a movie. INDEPENDENCE DAY is a 10/10 spectacular blockbuster movie & makes me Nostalgic just thinking about it!!!
This film along with lots really that impacted me growing up in the Awesome 90s was about big spectacular fun on the big screen, ""ID4"" was a perfect summer blockbuster movie, people had Fun watching it like they did with others excellent 90's Summer flicks ""Men in Black"" & ""The Mummy"" & ""Lost in Space"" & ""Star Gate"" you get the point, not everything like today's social media obsessed world was picked apart & over analysed, films could just be big fun pieces of entertainment & nice escapism!!!
I love these types of films & hold them very close to my movie loving heart.
Times have really changed & for the worse, especially with movies & how they are hated on & totally despised before even being released? Now the hate starts from a simple teaser trailer & it's completely ridiculous!!! No one just enjoys what movies are about anymore.
Anyway Will Smith is my all time favourite actor & childhood hero, Smith in movie's means alot me & i defend most of them, especially these days where everyone hates on 90's movie's & only likes ""Stranger Things"" the world is mental!!!Anyway love ""Independence Day"" & it's one of the greatest summer blockbuster movie's of all time!!!",Independence Day

91,gcd70,"Unimaginative, one-dimensional and visually awesome",6,31 March 2008,"In reality, it's often comforting to know that all your expectations will be met and that no surprises are in store. At the movies however the unexpected is almost always a welcome visitor. But with the highly touted ""Independance Day"", the unexpected was never going to make an appearance.On viewing this phenomenal blockbuster, I was greeted with exactly what I expected : complete schmaltz with an unimaginative storyline, one dimensional characters and a sight and sound show that sends you reeling.Roland Emmerich (""Universal Soldier"") and partner in crime/producer Dean Devlin have ground out a terribly manufactured, formulated script that is both derivative and dull, but who cares. The characters are all stereotyped and one can hardly begin to care whether or not they are blown up by spaceships, but who cares. What really matters is that ""ID4"" has delivered exactly what it promised, a visual display of mind blowing proportion, and an awesome sound effects show to back it up. The alien invasion is incredibly convincing thanks to the work of the f/x crew, with the definite highlight being the explosive destruction of several major cities. All this amazing cinematic genius adds up to pure escapism for the viewer.Never mind that poor old Bill Pullman gets the worst role of his life as the young American president who is forced to deliver some of the most awful lines ever written for a lead player. Nobody else fairs any better, with Will Smith as the all American hero pilot who sees all of his dreams come true as he becomes a pseudo-astronaut and gets to save the world at the same time. And as the mathematical whiz who comes up with the ultimate plan to overthrow the enemy, Jeff Goldblum could be in danger of becoming stereotyped, though at least he had a little more to work with than most. Also starred Judd Hirsch, Mary McDonnell, Margaret Colin, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Harvey Fierstein, Harry Connick Jnr., and Brent Spiner.Although more than two hours in length, ""Independance Day"" never seems to over stay its welcome, but I wouldn't recommend more than one viewing. If you do decide to catch this f/x extravaganza, do so at the cinema, preferably one equipped with a THX or Digital stereo sound system.

The special effects wee excellent, and the detail placed in the alien's attire, spaceships etc. was exceptional, considering the art department could have tanked in this category.

I had to have it on video and I think I saw it at the cinema twice, which is a lot for me, but even then I remember thinking that they had missed a trick by not uniting the studios across the globe to make a film that showed how the whole world would react to an alien invasion, how it could unite us as a planet, and all these years later I still believe that I could watch and enjoy a story like that.
I don't blame them for making it this way and don't get me wrong, it's still a very good film, but the optimist inside me craves an alien attack or a zombie apocalypse to unite us all against a common foe and eradicate stupid violence because of silly differences. Let the movies lead the way in uniting us all and stop making films that show what the so called differences are. But I digress.
It has an all star cast and they really don't seem to be fighting for attention, which is always a danger. Will looks mighty fine topless and Harry Connick just has a charm you can't resist, but probably my favourite character is played by Judd Hirsch, who, although only a smaller role, gives a performance that represents a lot of the viewers. Someone who can't fly aeroplanes or work out alien codes and he does it with an ease. I could have done without Randy Quaid though.If I wanted to, I could pick many faults with the film, there's a lot that is far too unrealistic and some sentimental moments that really are saccharin and actually there are many similarities to War Of The Worlds, but actually it's just a good watch if I turn off my critical eye.

97,Spleen,We have only ourselves to blame,6,30 July 1999,"I paid to see this in a cinema, too.  In my own small way I  contributed to its financial success.  Forgive me.  Forgive all of us.  This is the kind of movie we, the audience, have created.  Certainly I can't detect any creativity on the part of the writers.Parts are symptomatic of the whole: so I will practise restraint and mention just ONE glaring stupidity.  Just one.  Longer (but incomplete) lists of idiocies may be found elsewhere - the last time I looked there was a decent list on the IMDb itself.  Okay, here it is:The aliens take over our satellites and no-one knows why.  With the same creative reasoning he displayed in ""Jurassic Park"" when he deduced a revolt of the dinosaurs from the movement of a water droplet, Jeff Goldblum works out that the aliens are using our satellites to communicate with each other so that they will be able to co-ordinate their attack.  ""That's IT!"" everyone shouts.  One wonders how the Allies managed in the Second World War.  Did they use German satellites - or did they simply synchronise their watches?  Here's a hot piece of technology we can sell to the aliens: the WATCH!  It's a little device that enables one to TELL THE TIME!  Everyone can have ONE EACH and then EVERYONE will know what time it is!My point is not that this is a stupid weakness in the plot.  I mean, it is, but that's not my point.  My point is that we REALISE just how stupid this is, almost before the words have left Goldblum's lips.  We aren't given a chance to be charitable about it.  A hundred weaknesses will make themselves apparent while you watch, however low you set the relevant dials in your brain (some people can go as low as ""dribbling moron"", but most of us can't).  The movie just stumbles from stupidity to stupidity via bridge passages of stupidity.  There's a bit of purported excitement here and there to distract us from all the stupidity but it's so perfunctorily done that it just doesn't work.  Aliens taking over the Earth: it's a grand theme, but there's little grandeur in the treatment.  There is, however, an awful lot of stupidity.To make matters worse there's some offensive nationalism.  The aliens are threatening the ENTIRE EARTH - patriotism under the circumstances is a good thing, but it's the Earth (or humanity) as a whole that the tub-thumping ought to serve; not the USA in particular.

With this inane, extremely dumbed-down action movie he begins a trilogy of films that aims its ugly, brainless head towards destroying New York City (and the rest of the United States with it) as aliens decide we really would not make very good hosts and take everything with them, enveloping them in turquoise light -- somehow this color is akin to everything horror: see THE RING for another reference -- which consumes all it touches in a ball of fire. All the clichés of action films are here and just shows how empty this movie is, with all its patriotism and heroism plastered on almost every frame.

101,justin-fencsak,The movie that made Will Smith a star and began a resurgence in alien invasion movies...,10,4 July 2017,"When it comes to sci-fi alien invasion stories, older generations think of HG Wells' War of the Worlds, which spawned a classic radio broadcast and two movie versions, both of which were successful. Then came Invasion of the Flying Saucers, and then Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Star Wars would soon put the genre to rest. In the mid 90s, the directors of the surprise hit Stargate came up with an idea to make a big budget alien invasion movie set on our favorite holiday in this country...Independence Day. The movie would soon break records and gross around $800 million worldwide and sell even more on VHS, laserdisc, and then DVD and bluray and digital HD and pay TV, and the rest is history. Watching it today vs 21 years ago is kinda outdated but this movie is much better than the box office failure that was Resurgence and the movie that Centropolis made two years after ID4, a rehash of Godzilla that wasn't as good as the original one or even the 2014 reboot. The visual effects in the movie as well as the sound mix are pretty good, the casting is great, and the acting is classy.",Independence Day

103,PredragReviews,The aliens are coming...,6,20 April 2016,"Independence Day is made in the style and tradition of the 50's B- movies like ""It Came From Outer Space"". It's not supposed to be a deep philosophical discussion about Man Against The Universe, nor an attempt to seriously visualize the possible consequences of alien invasion. It's meant to be good fun, watching Our Heroes struggle valiantly against The Evil Alien Hordes. And remember, this film is brain's candy, not brain's food.This is undoubtedly one of the most fun sci-fi movies in history. The tale starts with a ship roughly 1/4 size of the moon entering orbit of earth, only to send down multiple city sized ships to our cities to wipe out humanity. This is one of those movies where you won't realize you've spent nearly 3 hours in front of your set. In fact, you'll probably want more.. I think there's really nothing particularly special about this film, other than it manages to fit all it's 'block-buster' fair into such a tight package, and casts it so well, that it works. Again, I go on about pacing, but for me it's crucial in a 'block-buster' film. The characters are a distinctly stock: cool, macho pilot, geek who saves the day, drunk who comes good in a crisis, US President who is also action man (cf Airforce One). The special effects are very good, but alone this doesn't explain success (anyone remember Dune?). I think this movie succeeds, because it is fun. Lots of explosions, action & enjoyable clichés.Overall rating: 6 out of 10.",Independence Day
104,winner55,Does any of this film really matter?,1,1 July 2007,"A way-overblown remake of the George Pal ""War of the Worlds"", this is one of the last of the great ""so bad it's funny movies"", this film had me laughing out loud in the theater - along with the rest of the audience.When Tim Burton made his tribute to bad cinema, Mars Attacks! - well, he shouldn't have bothered. Actually, sad to report, Mars Attacks! isn't very funny - but Independence Day surely is.The wretched dialog! the ridiculously stereotyped ""heros""! the chintzy special effects! the story that just wanders through every sci-fi stock situation looking for more clichés to spew at the audience!

105,philip_vanderveken,"One of my favorite sci-fi movies, thanks to the humor",8,7 March 2005,"Independence Day is one of the few Sci-Fi movies that I really like. The main reason for that is because there is a certain amount of humor in it thanks to Will Smith. Not everything the man has ever done works perfectly (I really didn't like ""Wild Wild West"" for instance), but in this movie he is more than OK.A few days before Independence Day, a signal is received from outer space and large objects are spotted on a collision course with planet earth. At first everybody thinks they are dealing with meteorites, but soon they find out that these are actually alien aircrafts. Of course they try to make contact with the aliens, believing that they aren't hostile, but as their attempts don't get any response, a scientist finds out that the aliens are positioning themselves on strategic places, ready to destroy the human race. They almost succeed, but the few survivors that are left, will fight back and do everything possible to destroy the alien war crafts...If there is anything bad I can say about this movie than it must be the obvious and overdone American patriotism that can be found in this movie. Nothing else really bothered me. I liked the special effects, the humor was nice, the story more than OK and the acting was very good. Overall I enjoyed this movie and I don't really understand why it gets such a low rating on IMDb. Personally I give this movie a 7.5/10.",Independence Day
106,screenman,Racial Supremacist Propaganda With Special Effects.,3,5 July 2008,"Roland Emmerich certainly loaded this movie with astonishing special effects, and set something of a demolition standard. The infernos released by the alien vessels upon various landmark buildings are really quite stupendous. But - oh-dear - what a wretched, predictable (and arrogant) piece of ham it is in just about every other department. I lost count of the number of gaping stares the camera lingered upon. I likewise lost count of the number of clichéd comments in a script that was surely written by a committee composed of those adolescents who wear their baseball caps back-to-front, call each other 'dude', and conveniently possess IQ's that can be measured on a clinical thermometer. It was clearly intended as a 'God Bless America' movie, as implied by the title, and though I've no problem with yanks slapping themselves on the back from time to time, this was just a little too blatant for good taste. I'm going to risk accusations of anti-semitism here and suggest that the subtext for this work was 'American Jews save the world for an ungrateful humanity'. We have a Jewish scientist (played by Jewish Goldblum). He and he alone solves the riddle of alien invasion methodology. He and his arrogant Jewish father manage to secure seats on Airforce One, where this father goes about reminding everyone how his son has saved them all. Later, Goldblum is sent to the alien mothership where he manages to foul-up their computers with a virus. After that it's gung-ho all the way. Brains can be safely left behind.There is one particularly offensive scene in which the father is attempting to induct a group of people into a Jewish ceremony. One person declines, remarking 'actually I'm not Jewish' to which this Zionist bigot responds 'Well, nobody's perfect.' It's supposed to be funny. And to those building illegal settlements in Palestine; it probably is. Yet I cannot imagine any other religion in which such a comment would have been allowed to pass unchecked. Certainly if the refusenik had been Jewish and had received a similar discourtesy, the movie would never have gained release. It's Jewish backers in Hollwood would have made damn sure of that (not that its Jewish Producers and Directors would have included it in the first place). Whereas if this slighted individual he'd been Muslim, There would likely have been demonstrations and death threats. White Anglo-Saxon Protestants however can have their feelings abused with impunity. The other people to feature favourably are both of Afro-Caribbean race. Will Smith plays a preposterously gung-ho fighter pilot, stuffing it to the aliens, whilst his wife engages in civilian heroics on the ground. Together, they form a kind of ethnic apologia. They may be black, but they're still useful.The US president is unfortunately still Christian (well; no nation's perfect), and interestingly he experiences a telepathic event with a captured alien, in which he describes them as a plague of locusts that go about the universe, using up resources wherever they can be found. That selfishness alone apparently justifies their extermination, though his insight might just as easily be a description of humankind. As HG Wells once asked in his War Of The Worlds with reference to our treatment of other terrestrial species: 'Are we such paragons of mercy...?'Throughout the movie, these aliens are depicted as ugly, violent, smelly, and ruthless - almost as bad as Christians. No emphasis is given to their considerable scientific and technological superiority, or the fact that they appear to function as a harmonious people. They're messing with God's children on God's own Earth, and that makes them pariahs. No prizes for guessing who sees themselves as the new master race.This is not a movie for people with brains, let alone morals or conscience. It's a shoot-'em-up of the most banal and tasteless nature. It appeals to the worst instincts and bigotries of the narrow-minded whilst masquerading as a nationalist set-piece. Frankly; in every other faculty than that of special-effects - it stinks.",Independence Day
107,brando647,ID4 Was the Highlight of My Summer in 1996; It's Lost Some of its Luster Now,7,8 January 2017,"If you had asked me what I thought of INDEPENDENCE DAY when it was first released, I would've given it a solid 10 out of 10. I was twelve years old when it first came to theaters and I remember seeing it that opening weekend. It blew my mind. I immediately went out and started buying the action figures and the alien fighter, and I even bought the movie novelization. I still have one of the big alien figures with motion sensors that make it roar and open its head cavity to reveal the little alien dude inside. I found it at a Salvation Army for something like $10 a few years ago. Of course I bought it because I seriously loved this movie as a kid. Now? Well, I still have a soft spot for it but it doesn't hold my attention as well anymore. I've grown and seen countless movies since INDEPENDENCE DAY hit theaters. My tastes have expanded and there's very little room for Roland Emmerich's alien invasion, other than nostalgia. Pretty much everyone has seen this movie at one point or another and are at least vaguely familiar with it. Aliens arrive at Earth on July 2nd and their enormous saucers settle in over major population centers while humans around the world lose their minds. Eventually the aliens begin a devastating series of attacks and send the survivors scrambling for some means of defeating them. Their ultimate solution: Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and an Apple computer.There's no denying the sense of fun that comes with any of the big action sequences in the film. Watching the movie again after all these years, I love the dog-fighting scenes just as much now as I did then. And you know what? They still look great. I was recently made aware that most of these big action sequences were done with miniatures and motion-tracking, and that's really incredible. These dogfighting battles are chaotic with jets and alien fighters swarming and blasting each other out of the sky, and I never would've guessed it hadn't all been done with visual effects. There were some in there to give it that extra flair but a lot of those are miniatures. No wonder I can watch it now, 20 years after its initial release, and be just as engaged as I was the first time. And of course there's the massive destruction sequences for which the movie is famous. Everyone knows the shot of the alien beam weapon blasting down on the White House and exploding and, again, it was done with miniatures and it still looks amazing. From a technical and visual standpoint, INDEPENDENCE DAY is still marvelous. Watching it again now, it's no surprise that twelve-year-old me loved this movie so much. It's got great action, great FX, and some of the coolest creature designs I've seen in a movie. The aliens in INDEPENDENCE DAY are still one of the best designed science fiction creatures I've seen in film.My problem with INDEPENDENCE DAY is that any scene that doesn't directly involve the aliens or the big dogfights is sort of dull. There is a lot of boring extra material in the movie and, at over two hours long, it could've used a trim. If they had edited this movie down to a solid 110 minutes, I'd probably still love it. Did we really need the whole Randy Quaid subplot? For those who don't remember, Randy Quaid plays Randy Quaid as a drunken crop-duster who we follow as he packs up his stepchildren in an RV and evacuates as part of a huge caravan where he eventually crosses paths with Will Smith and gets a chance for redemption in the big final battle. Who cares? Cut it. It added nothing to the film. We can also cut down a bit on the Vivica A. Fox subplot where she rescues the injured First Lady from a crashed helicopter and collects survivors in a tow truck. Don't cut it (her reconnection with Will Smith in the third act is nice) but trim it down. We don't need to spend as much time with them. Keep the focus on the alien invasion and how the government is dealing with it. Smith, Goldblum, and Bill Pullman as the U.S. President are the film's heroes and we shouldn't be cutting away from them so often; all the real interesting stuff is happening with them. No one thinks back on INDEPENDENCE DAY and fondly remembers Randy Quaid arguing with his son or Vivica Fox having a fireside chat with the President's wife. We remember Will Smith being chased by an alien fighter through the Grand Canyon or the captured alien awakening mid-dissection to tentacle-choke Brent Spiner in a crazy horror scene.That about sums up my thoughts on INDEPENDENCE DAY. All the cool stuff you remember is still cool, and it's even more impressive that it still works twenty years later. Will Smith knocking an alien unconscious with a single punch and muttering ""Welcome to Earth"" is still awesome. But there's a lot of filler tossed in there to give this movie a more epic scope that just doesn't interest me and it can make the film's bloated runtime difficult to get through. Even moreso if you're watching the extended cut with an additional fifteen minutes of footage. It tries to take itself a little too seriously for a movie with Judd Hirsch cracking wise in Area 51 but, even with its flaws, it's still a classic in its own right.",Independence Day

Now the world's only hope lies with a determined band of survivors, uniting for one last strike against the invaders - before it's the end of mankind.I finally get to watch this film and yeah, I know I'm very late because I was never keen to watching it. This film was decent with it's above average action scenes and special effects only with a $75 million budget! The acting by Will Smith was comedic while Bill Pullman and Goldblum were both dramatic and comedic.I really think this film tries too hard to be a good film, which is why it wasn't as good as it want it to be. And I really don't know if this film tries to be funny or dramatic because it tries to be both but you really don't know when to laugh or feel sorry for the characters.

Looking back on it it was one of the most wow factor movies of the 90s and still one of my favorite films that I saw in theaters.This movie is lead by a almost powerhouse of a cast. Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Margaret Colin, Vivica A.Fox, James Rebhorn, Adam Baldwin, Brent Spiner, James Duval, Lisa Jakub,Giuseppe Andrews, Ross Ragley,Mae Whitman and many moreThis is one of those films that redefine the 1990s and remains a strong film even now.Independence Day centers around a alien invasion that leads humanity to fight back. The plot is one you have to watch the film to fully understand because I don't want to give anything away since you will get a rush and feel tense in this film.While the film does feature humor to help settle the tension. And to think some of the lines in this movie were improvised sometimes the best scenes can be created without being planned. In the theater the special effects just left everyone in awe the effects today even impress me because they took the time to actually create models and made it look real it goes to show that C.G.I. can have help with doing the real thing.The action scenes in this film are simply awesome they really go all out to make them tense and packed with amazing battles that you will be in awe when you watch it.Plus the music written for this movie is really top notch as each piece of music written for this film matches the story and each scene of the film Overall if you are a fan of action films you should check out this film it has everything you want, Still one of my favorite films I watched in the theater and still remain a great film I give Independence Day an 9 out of 10",Independence Day

Try 2001, A Space odyssey or even Contact; but if you want to unplug your mind and watch the a couple of hours of well produced action, then i think you'll like it.I give it 9/10 (at least it doesn't pretend to be something that is isn't.)",Independence Day

112,Screen_Blitz,Explosive science-action thriller is a whole lot of fun,8,24 June 2016,"For over thousands years, mankind has been hit with a powerfully intriguing question: Are we alone, or is there life on other planets. Scientists to do this day still continue to investigate whether extraterrestrial life is existent on other planets or has visited our planet when we didn't know it. This sci-fi action thriller formulates an obvious fictional account of mankind's fight for survival against the large army of aliens who are set to invade Earth. The concept isn't terribly new as we experienced it before in H.G. Wells' War of The World's, but it's not say the film doesn't succeed on its own merits. Showering us with a wide plethora of eye-popping special effects and CGI, director Roland Emmerich blasts the screen with an high-octane action flick swarming with pulse-pounding action sequences and pure charisma, resulting in what was called in 1996 ""the biggest movie of the summer"". The film opens up in July 2nd when communication systems are mysteriously failing from strange signals picking up outside the atmosphere. When the U.S military discover what appears to be meteors set to collide into Earth, they discover these strange objects are nothing other than gigantic spaceships run by aliens who appear to be here for a warm welcome. Soon, ex-scientist David Levinson (played by Jefd Goldblum) learn of their plot to invade our home planet when the aliens launch an attack on major cities including Washington D.C., New York City, and Los Angeles; resulting in the death of millions. With the future of the human race dangling, United States President Thomas Whitmore (played by Bill Pullman) on July 3rd, orders a large scale attack against the alien army with cocky Air Force pilot Captain Steven Hiller (played by Will Smith) leading the operation in attempt to save mankind. This big-budget action flick isn't highly original, nor does it leave a landmark on science- fiction genre. But it's hard to deny what a hell of a thrill ride it is, even if it's not a highly intelligent concept. From the opening minutes of the alien invasion, we are introduced to the startling, yet chord-striking shots of landmarks such as the White House, the Empire State Building, and other major downtown areas as they're obliterated into fiery explosions in front of a massive crowd of spectators. From that point, we know are in an intense ride. When it comes special effects, director Roland Emmerich doesn't play around. He embraces his beauty in jaw-dropping effects, and the air battle scenes involving Air Force pilots against the small alien spaceships make fine evidence of this. Though these scenes appear to borrow elements from other sci-fi classics like 'Star Wars' or 'Close Encounters of The Third Kind', there is plenty of excitement to be endured, including some funny (and occasionally no-brainer) one-liners uttered by the characters and the sheer likability of Will Smith playing a cocky pilot who embraces his commitment in active combat while maintaining an appropriately comedic attitude. If there is any flaw sustained in during the near 2 1/2 hour runtime, it probably comes from the shortage of properly developed characters as the mass array of action clouds over the character development, though the plot stands surprisingly stable throughout. In the end, we can't help but hope of these characters survival and success on their mission to save mankind from extermination. Independence Day is an exciting science-fiction popcorn thriller with dazzling special effects and decent, if slightly cheesy performances. This film isn't exactly what I consider a classic nor influential. Overall, it is a solidly entertaining and leaves a good note on Roland Emmerich's resume. Due to the amazing quality of the film, it makes me excited for the sequel 'Indepedence Day: Resurgence' which is set to hit theaters this weekend.",Independence Day
113,dunmore_ego,The Arrogance of Independence.,6,28 April 2009,"""The most likely circumstance is that extraterrestrial beings will look nothing like any organisms or machines familiar to us."" --Carl Sagan, The Cosmic Connection.And what is the moral of INDEPENDENCE DAY, my child? That humans will always win. Always always always. Aliens got no game like humans; even with faster-than-light travel and impenetrable shields and death rays and superior technology and ruthless efficiency far greater than humans... humans will always win.How could they not? Humans made the movie. Arrogant sluts. All alien invasion films are nothing more than human arrogance, from THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL to CONEHEADS.This movie just has better special effects.Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich have some gall listing themselves as the sole writers of this confused sci-fi debacle, when the alien arrival scenes in INDEPENDENCE DAY are plagiarized from Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End. City-sized spaceships eerily filter into Earth's skies, causing panic, yet simply hovering over major cities. These are the primo scenes in the movie, as massive shadows crawl over familiar landscapes, including the cowering White House.The inevitable human story lines are introduced - to make us care: Marine pilot, Captain Hiller (Will Smith), and his stripper fiancé (Vivica A. Fox); the President (Bill Pullman) and his stranded wife (Mary McDonnell); the tech geek (Jeff Goldblum), his Jewish dad (Judd Hirsch) and his estranged wife (Margaret Colin) who works for the Pres; the crop-dusting pilot (Randy Quaid) and his half-breed brood.And then - beautiful destruction; wholesale death ray decimation of cities, unquestioning, unmerciful, unhuman. And a cheer goes up as the White House is obliterated in a savage blast of energy; no two useless, duplicitous, bureaucratic bricks left standing together.End Act I.Let the stupidity begin.""The singular failure of UFO believers is their lack of imagination."" --James O'Ehley, The Sci-Fi Movie Page.The Aliens have razed whole cities in seconds. How do the Marines retaliate against power so formidable? Send in Captain Hiller and his fighter plane squadron, which will do as much damage as bacteria on an elephant's backside.The gargantuan Alien ships have impenetrable shields, which not even nukes can penetrate. Though nothing can harm them, why do they feel the need to counterattack Will Smith's bad boys with fighters of their own? Because the humans who wrote the movie have no imagination, forcing the aliens into stunted human methods of warfare.The ensemble cast all put in their 2c worth to defeat the aliens: Will Smith getting his black on, Goldblum getting his Goldblum on, Judd Hirsch getting his Jew on, Pullman getting his Clinton on; with Robert Loggia, Harvey Fierstein and Pullman trying to out-rasp each other for maximum cred.But can anyone's cred be saved if we examine their hypocritical agenda? Pres Pullman communicates with an alien through some kind of Spock mind-meld, and ""sees"" the aliens' Grand Plan and rasps, ""My God!"" with a Bon Jovi accent, ""They're like locusts, moving from planet to planet. After they've consumed every natural resource, they move on - and we're next!"" Oh, the Aquanetted outrage! Er... excuse me - isn't that exactly what MAN does? Carl Sagan filibusters in all his books for space exploration and terraforming. After Earth's resources dry up, MAN himself must find a way to move on and rape some other planet.When faced with extinction from extra-terrestrials, of course we would fight back, but not because we are sanctimoniously 'right' - but because we are as SELFISH as the next race of intelligent beings. INDEPENDENCE DAY could have been saved with the inclusion of this one little concept.End Act II.Let the terror forming begin.""To rejoice in conquest is to rejoice in murder."" --Lao-Tsze, Chinese philosopher.Before the humans launch a definitive attack on the alien ships, President Pullman makes us feel dirty with his raspy pep speech: ""We will not go gently into the night; we will not vanish without a fight..."" Somewhere an orchestra is playing; somewhere a cheese factory is dying.If Devlin and Emmerich stole the first act from Clarke, they stole the last act from H.G. Wells - in War Of The Worlds, Wells's Martian invaders die of Earth viruses. Conveniently forgetting that plagiarism is unethical, Devlin and Emmerich update Wells's organic virus to a computer virus, which Goldblum and Smith must plant personally in the mothership, which would scramble the force-shields of all the alien ships hovering over cities and leave them open to attack. Cue illogical plot, soporific aliens, enough special effects to feed all the children in Africa, and Einsteinian physics thrown out with the bathwater...How does Goldblum plant the computer virus in the alien computers - when we can't even get Macs to talk to PCs? Inspirational music, cheering across the globe, pretty orange explosions, sacrifice, tears, everyone on Earth happy (like an Obama election), movie stars uniting on the blasted white glaring salt flats... Is there anything more desirable to a woman than that last long shot of Goldblum and Smith striding towards the camera, their burning craft in the background, across the white blaze of the salt lake? (Probably the only recorded instance of a white man ever looking cooler than a black man.) Then the forgotten physics laws kick back in, as that same atmosphere that should have burned Smith and Goldblum to a cinder upon their re-entry now fries the remnants of the alien mothership as metal chunks of it streak across the stratosphere to put an epic cap on the overwrought finale...Carl Sagan wrote, ""The virtue of thinking about life elsewhere is that it forces us to stretch our imaginations.""

114,KUAlum26,More fun than War of the Worlds,6,27 July 2005,"While the 2005 WoTW probably is a much more artistic and carefully made 'Aliens blow up the world!' summer blockbuster,ID4 is much more fun.When ominously large,round alien ships enter the atmosphere,the wonder and awe of meeting extraterrestrial life that Earth experiences quickly fades into abject terror as the ships proceed to obliterate anything and anyone in their path. An ensemble of plucky heroes,most notably a computer technician and chess enthusiast(Jeff Goldblum),a tough and streetwise Marine pilot(Will Smith),his stripper girlfriend(the luscious Viveca A. Fox)with her son and dog in tow,a crazed vet working as a crop-duster(Randy Quaid,stealing EVERY scene he's in)and,of course,the President(Bill Pullman,butched and brooding,as contrasted to his whacked-out turn in the previous ""Mr.Wrong"")who has the task of being both a father and inspirational leader at this time.The plot points are firmly in place,the lines are spit out like professional writers made them(as if!),and there's expositions aplenty. Throw in a tie-in to Area 51 paranoia and some stock side characters(a fried scientist played by Brent Spiner,the put-upon kids of Quaid's character,a tightly-wound General played by Robert Loggia,the President's cute-as-a-button daughter and his doomed first lady, played by an underused MAry McDonnell,Judd Hirsch as Goldblum's character's kvetching dad,etc.)and you've got an instantly accessible hit. And yet,despite the sense of eye-rolling predictability about this film,it still is a fun ride! The action moves at such a fluid pace that it doesn't allow you the viewer to dwell too deeply on the light characters or the overly jingoistic sentiment.People who saw this on the big screen probably got the added bonus of being able to experience the audio intensity of the film's sound editing that you probably won't get from seeing it on video or TV.

118,TheUnknown837-1,"My definition of an energetic, old-fashioned summer popcorn flick",9,28 August 2010,"Even though it is packed full of conventions, stereotypes, and clichés of the science-fiction genre and its detractors are right in calling it old-fashioned and dopey, ""Independence Day"" is actually a terrific feel-good popcorn flick from Roland Emmerich and Dead Devlin, the Hollywood cognoscenti for the genre. These two filmmakers love the popcorn movie genre, as they have stated numerous times and proved even more times with their pictures. None of their movies, from ""Independence Day"" to ""Godzilla"" to ""The Day After Tomorrow"" to the more recent ""2012"" were created with the intention of being taken seriously. They are continuing the tradition of the silly disaster films from the 70s and occasionally the silly science-fiction flicks of the 50s. Their superlative film is ""Independence Day,"" the box office champ of 1996 that started a broad interest in aliens as bloodthirsty war-mongers again.The cast is populated by a wide variety of Hollywood talents perfectly matched to the stereotypes written in the screenplay. Bill Pullman is the weary-eyed, weary-voiced president of the United States; Will Smith is the smart-mouthed fighter pilot ready to kick some alien tail while shelling out punch lines, Jeff Goldblum is the nerdy but smart TV cable man who figures out before everybody else that the aliens are going to attack, his ostensibly Jewish father is played by Judd Hirsch, and Randy Quaid is the drunken, delusional crop duster pilot who claims he once had a close encounter before.The aliens in the movie are even less original, having been pulled off the shelf of the creatures from the 1950s. The only real update is that they've now been generated using modern-day special effects and not puppets, men in suits, and stop-motion animation. Their ships are also a very good visual achievement, and the sight of a 15-mile wide flying saucer hovering over L.A. looks really darn cool.You would think by the way I've been pointing out stereotypes in my review that I didn't think too terribly much of ""Independence Day"" and that it was too clichéd for me to praise or recommend. You would think wrong. This is just my style of reviews; I point out the good and the bad in every movie I see.So you want to hear what I liked about ""Independence Day."" Three words: it was fun. Three more words: it's a popcorn movie. Four words now: I *love* popcorn movies! This is the type of movie that if done wrong can be dreadfully boring, but if done right, as here, then is sheer entertainment. Sure, we've seen the like of a movie like this before in terms of substance. And it most certainly is a movie with style over substance. Of course ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and the original ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" are better movies because their substance is more prominent than their style. But admit it, every now and then you are in the hankering for a good, old-fashioned flick. Sometimes those kitschy black-and-white films really fill in the void for you. So therefore, I see nothing wrong with continuing this tradition using a bigger budget and modern technology.Another reason why ""Independence Day"" works is that it enthusiastically embraces its kitschy charm. Every single moment of it is played for visual spectacle or an old-fashioned charm or gag. And this stereotyping in the cast is repetitive, but it's used in a way where it is amusing, not offensive. Take Will Smith's character, for example. Even though he is just playing the same mentality of his beloved character from ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" (they seldom let him do anything else, after all) he brings a lot of charm and screen charisma to his performance. In the hands of a lesser actor, this role might have come across as annoying. But Smith is such a great performer that he makes it work. Randy Quaid is also in prime for as a deliberately comical drunk with a heart. And his final scene in the movie has deservedly gone on to become famous.And Roland Emmerich is very good at handling special effects sequences. There are numerous highly implausible moments, such as a fighter pilot maneuvering through a canyon while fighting off miniature UFOs, but the directing and the pacing is so tight that you don't stop to really nitpick over it, but embrace it. If there had been more dead air, you would have no choice but to stop and gripe.And unfortunately a lot of people do stop and gripe throughout the film. But even though I do enjoy this movie enormously, I can acknowledge and understand their points. This is the kind of movie you will either welcome and love for what it is or detest and scorn for what it is. As a summer popcorn movie flooded with enthusiasm and testosterone, I think it does its job most commendably. Roland Emmerich has made some really good popcorn flicks, but this is his best one.",Independence Day
119,mstomaso,Limited character development and an uncomplicated plot result in a one-shot movie,6,23 January 2006,"Independence Day doesn't stand up particularly well to a second viewing. It is basically a millenial version of The War of the Worlds with grand-scale effects and a cast which probably cost almost as much as the effects. Will Smith, Randy Quaid, Jeff Goldblum, Adam Baldwin and Judd Hirsch help pick up a surprisingly talented (but underexploited) cast and seem to have enjoyed their parts. Unfortunately, the mediocre script allowed few of the other actors to make their roles shine.The plot is so simple it's hard to imagine a 140+ minute film about it. The earth is under invasion from a highly advanced and merciless alien culture hell bent on intergalactic conquest. Our most powerful weapons can not pierce their shields and their weapons are capable of incinerating cities the size of Washington DC with one shot. After the first wave of attacks, all seems lost, and humans must find some way to fight back.Roland Emmerich's direction is good. There are few dull moments and very little in the way of uninteresting and pointless scenes. Unfortunately, the characters are generally two-dimensional - even Bill Pullman's brooding, depressed President of the United States comes across as an uncomplicated, uninspired and unemotional individual. Limited character development and an uncomplicated plot result in a one-shot movie.The best performances in Independence Day are the semi-comedic ones (note the actors mentioned above. This should tell you most of what you need to know about the film. Enjoy it by not taking it seriously, but spare yourself a second viewing unless intoxicated. And, oh yea, don't see it if you have a problem with American nationalism - the film is full of it.",Independence Day
120,brchthethird,A silly but fun popcorn flick,7,7 October 2014,"Roland Emmerich has never been one of my favorite directors, mostly because he has been making the same type of movie now for about 20 years (not unlike Michael Bay in some respects). Still, he does have a great eye for visuals and can create spectacle like few others out there. INDEPENDENCE DAY was one of his first forays into the ""disaster"" genre, and as a large-scale blockbuster, it largely succeeds. Sure, there isn't a lot of attention paid to character or plot, but it delivers on the action and visuals. The ensemble cast is also great, and each person gets their own moment to shine. At first glance, one might be tempted to compare this to Armageddon, but I think that this film edges it out by a small margin. Both movies have essentially the same story beats, but the emotional arcs in this movie feel more genuine and there isn't a sappy Aerosmith ballad, either. The special effects in this movie are incredible, considering it came out in 1996 and I thought that the alien and spaceship designs were creative and nice to look at. Overall, I think that this movie has had, and will continue to have more staying power than Armageddon, if only because it did it first. Generally speaking, I enjoyed it, and if you're looking for a fun, turn-your-brain-off type of movie, you can't go wrong with this one.",Independence Day
121,gizmomogwai,"Stupid, but sensational",7,27 June 2009,"Here's another page in my chapter of movies I used to love but don't any more. Actually this one had a huge effect on my life- not only did it give me an interest in aliens, but believe it or not, the president in this movie inspired me to look up real life politicians, and got me intensely interested in history and social sciences. All of my upper year schooling was centred on those subjects. Now, I recognize this isn't a particularly deep film, but for an action movie and special effects spectacle this is still a pretty good effort.The plot- an alien mothership arrives at Earth and sends city-sized spaceships over the great cities of the world, including Washington, DC, New York and Los Angeles. The dramatic music associated with these spaceships give them godlike importance (I've heard it said before that religious music and science fiction music are often alike). The movie tackles the interesting question of how people, including politicians and ordinary people, would react, showing panic, awe, and celebration. But I'd have to say Contact, the Jodie Foster movie that came out a year later, does a better job at thinking how people would react to aliens- that movie replaced this one as being my favourite alien movie (post-Star Wars). But the aliens attack the cities, which would be devastating since they're so important. The explosions look pretty convincing; the destruction of the American cities is seen but the movie lacks an international view (the scenes showing the attacks on non-American cities were cut). And we get the satisfaction of seeing the humans winning. Along the way we get some comic relief from, among other things, Jeff Goldblum's character arguing with his father, and Brent Spiner.We get some good material but there are some flaws- including an overly sentimental and cheesy subplot following the Russell character. I don't see why we should care about this idiot's issues with his children's respect, his wanting to prove himself. He's out for revenge, having been abducted by aliens years ago, so writers Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich predictably make sure to provide him the opportunity. Upon hearing he was abducted, people react to him like he's crazy even after the aliens arrive, and one has to wonder why when the world has seen conclusive proof that aliens do exist. Incidentally, Russell says the aliens have been carrying out abductions for years to learn our weaknesses. It seriously took these super-intelligent aliens *years* to learn fire hurts us? Another disappointment is with the aliens themselves- octopus men. They should have gone with the greys- they're the ones associated with Roswell, after all.The president (Bill Pullman) isn't always helpful- upon being told he's short on pilots, his order is ""Then find them."" He does give an inspiring speech, though. Jeff Goldblum is also good- he was also attached to two other huge money makers, Jurassic Park (1993) and its 1997 sequel The Lost World. Will Smith is the other star, and he's not bad.",Independence Day

123,hnt_dnl,Forefather to TRANSFORMERS,3,18 June 2009,"If you want to know the partial inspiration for the most recent TRANSFORMERS movie, look no further than this 1996 movie INDEPENDENCE DAY. On a lark, I watched ID4 recently again and it is just as bad as I remember it to be back in 1996. Both movies are very similar in that they have a host of annoying, poorly written characters and overly confusing action sequences. In ID4 the action is a tad more coherent, but strangely limited and kind of boring upon repeated viewing. When I originally saw it, I thought the action was the only good part of the movie. Still true, but not saying much.The story of ID4 is that aliens float down to attack and destroy earth (yadda yadda yadda) and so a core group of humans must band together and brainstorm to defeat them (sound familiar?). Should, because this is the plot of TRANSFORMERS. Of course, as in TRANSFORMERS, a secret part of the gov't knew about the aliens for years already. In ID4, it is the infamous Area 51 (it was Section 7 or something in TRANSFORMERS). The band of heroes include the Pres. and some of his staff, the military (or what is left of it), a computer genius and his crew, and a bunch of nomadic volunteers who SOMEHOW found Area 51! The actors? ID4 stars Will Smith. I'll admit I don't like Smith, but I have opened my mind with several actors and liked them in certain films because I was impressed with their work, even if I didn't like them overall. THIS is not the film to make me like Will Smith! This movie is precisely the reason I don't like him. Playing Air Force Capt. Hiller, Smith is overly cocky, shouts at EVERYONE, and delivers really bad one-liners that make you cringe. I will say, I did like Smith in the original BAD BOYS (ironic b/c Michael Bay directed that movie and he also directed TRANSFORMERS, which I'm connecting to ID4).Smith isn't the only actor who comes away unscathed. Bill Pullman is terrible as the President, just plain bad. He speaks at a slur/whispery tone throughout and I actually think he is supposed to be a tough guy! Conveniently, the Pres. is a former ""fighter pilot"" (haven't heard them called that since the 1940s!) and he lead the final July 4th attack against the space invaders. Other victims to the bad acting bug are Brent Spiner (STAR TREK:TNG's Data) looks bad as the Area 51 top scientist who experiments on the aliens to find out how to kill them, Robert Loggia (a usually reliable character actor) as the Pres. top military adviser, Judd Hirsch as an all-too Jewish father to a key person in the film; I'll mention later), Margaret Colin as the Pres. press secretary (who has an obvious crush on him!), Randy Quaid as a bumpkiny cropduster (convenient that he knows how to fly a plane!), and Jeff Golblum (really the film's third lead behind Smith and Pullman) as a brilliant computer nerd (and Colin's ex-husband and Hirsch's son).I mentioned Goldblum last for a reason: he is actually the only character watchable in this! How Goldblum comes away from this smelling like a rose is amazing. He actually abandons all that jittery, hesitant acting style that he is famous for and pretty much plays it straight and looks good compared to everyone else. And he actually has funny lines that aren't unintentionally funny, but actually funny.Interestingly also, ID4 is a fairly dated looking film that I've seen it recently. The special effects are surprisingly cheesy for a late 90s film. But the biggest clunker in this whole thing is HOW the humans defeated the aliens (a computer virus!). Sooo convenient that a simple earth virus could disrupt the central database of a highly advanced alien race. The ""band of heroes"" synchronizes the virus implant (headed by Smith and Goldblum, who use the Area 51 spaceship to fly into the mothercraft hovering above earth) with the figther attack (led by you know who!) so they can penetrate the alien armor and defeat them.Pretty neat, huh? Well, ID4 is the 90s version of movies like TRANSFORMERS, which insults the viewers intelligence with an empty plot and poorly drawn characters. I hear people all the time say that ""it is supposed to be mindless fluff"" or ""it's just a movie"" or ""at least the action is great"" or ""enjoy it for what it is"". That's fine to a degree, but a movie ought to have a semblance that the filmmakers actually put real effort into what translated to the screen. The makers of ID4 did not.",Independence Day
124,hall895,Today we celebrate our Independence Day!,7,21 May 2011,"Nobody is ever going to confuse Independence Day with any kind of work of great cinema. It's fun though. Sure, it's cheesy and corny. Often absurd and ludicrous too. But fun. As big, huge, visual effects summer blockbusters go you could do a lot worse. The aliens have come and they're gonna blow things up real good. And for this movie that's enough. Yes, the dialogue is mostly inane and terrible. Yes, there are some characters who disappoint, adding nothing of any substance to the proceedings. Yes, the movie goes on too long. For any movie of this type two hours will more than suffice. Independence Day careens well past that two-hour mark with a misguided attempt to inject some actual plot lines, some drama and real human emotion, into the movie. Plot? Drama? Emotion? Who needs any of that? Aliens invade. Humans fight back. The end.It's easy to bemoan what Independence Day isn't. But you can certainly embrace it for what it is. If you're willing to buy in, and ignore the fact that so much of the movie makes no sense at all, Independence Day can be a rollicking good time. Will Smith is perfect for this sort of thing, Jeff Goldblum falls perfectly into his world-saving scientist role, Randy Quaid makes for an entertaining kook and Judd Hirsch provides some laughs. Some of the other performers admittedly don't fare as well. Harvey Fierstein is an over-the-top annoyance, Brent Spiner makes his bizarre scientist much, much too bizarre to take at all seriously and the key female characters, played by Margaret Colin and Vivica A. Fox are pretty much worthless, total bores. And then there's the President, played by Bill Pullman. Confronted with a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions, not to mention personal loss, the guy seems utterly devoid of feeling. My country's three biggest cities were just destroyed? Eh, whatever. An inspiring figure this guy is not. Until all of a sudden he is as, before humanity's final assault, he gives one of the most awesome movie speeches ever. OK, the speech is totally cheesy and corny. But awesome. Of course that final assault is based around a plan which is incomprehensibly absurd, defying all logic and reason. Logic and reason have no place in this type of movie. If you accept that than this movie is easy to enjoy. It's the end of the world as we know it. And I feel fine.",Independence Day
125,Beta_Gallinger,"Very little excitement in this over-hyped blockbuster, and the poor humour doesn't help",4,28 August 2010,"Released in 1996, when I was just under ten years old, this sci-fi action blockbuster directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich turned out to be a massive hit. I remember seeing at least a bit of it probably shortly after it was released on video, but don't remember much about that. Within the past couple years, I've seen three films which Emmerich has made since this one, which are ""The Patriot"", ""10,000 BC"", and ""The Day After Tomorrow"". Of those three, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was the only one I was impressed with at all, though even that one certainly has its flaws and is hated by many. By the time I finally got around to watching ""Independence Day"", fourteen years after its release, I knew it was a popular blockbuster, but also knew that it was widely criticized and that Emmerich doesn't have the greatest reputation as a filmmaker. I thought that as popular as the movie was, there was a good chance I wouldn't like it, but obviously had no way of knowing for sure. However, after watching it, it's not too surprising that I find myself joining the naysaying crowd.In the United States of America, it is very close to Independence Day when it is discovered that mysterious giant objects are headed towards Earth! It is believed that these are meteors, but not for long, as it is soon clear that they are actually spaceships! A New York City cable worker named David Levinson discovers satellite transmissions which seem to indicate a countdown to an alien attack! He goes with his father, Julius to warn U.S. President Thomas J. Whitmore about this planned attack, and the president orders an evacuation of the cities the intruders are targeting, but it's too late. It isn't long at all before the countdown ends and major cities around the world, including three American ones (New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C), are destroyed by hovering spaceships which blast them with destructive beams! It is now up to the survivors to defeat these evil aliens and save their planet. Whitmore, who escaped with family and staff members from the capital of the United States just in time before the city was obliterated, heads to Area 51, where it is said that a seized alien spacecraft is being kept (something he had never been told before), and must work with others to prevent the end of humanity! This 1996 blockbuster suffers from the quality of the characters, plus the performances from the cast members who play them. None of them stand out as really good here, with a very unimpressive performance from Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore, and a number of other bland performances. Randy Quaid is worse than most of the others, playing alcoholic Russell Casse, and so are the ones who play his kids. Scenes with these characters can sure be annoying, with lines such as, ""You don't want to die a virgin, do you?"" I've only seen the special edition, featuring nine minutes of footage not included in the original theatrical version of the movie. Apparently, the Casses are not featured as much in the original version, and that certainly doesn't sound like a bad thing to me, but unfortunately, these characters are not the film's only problem. In addition to the problems with the characters and those who play them, I also didn't find much excitement while watching this film, as much as I know so many others have. I found SOME excitement, but very little. I also didn't care much for the story, in which we barely ever see these evil aliens, nor do we ever get to know much about them. With all the problems I found with ""Independence Day"", I found it to be tedious and usually boring, and I doubt seeing nine minutes less would have made much of a difference. There are parts that I could tell are supposed to be funny, but none of them made me laugh, so I can't say anything for the film's humour, either. Since this is a high budget modern blockbuster, it's no surprise that the visuals are great, but that's not enough to make a good movie.Shortly after watching the special edition, I thought about watching the original theatrical version before reviewing the film. (One might find it hard to believe I've never seen that version!) However, I decided not to do that. It is nine minutes shorter than the special edition, but if that's the only difference, I really don't think it's worth sacrificing another two hours or so of my life watching it. Maybe the extended version I saw features some restored scenes which the film is better off without, and that might mean that the version people saw in theatres is a BIT better, but I was unimpressed with a lot more than just nine minutes of what I saw! MAYBE it would rise to a 5/10 for me if I saw the original, but that wouldn't be enough. Many viewers consider ""Independence Day"" an entertaining blockbuster, and I certainly don't look down on them for that, but personally, I can't imagine myself ever actually liking it. Since there were several months in between my viewing of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and my viewing of this 1996 film from Roland Emmerich, I'm not sure how to compare them (though they do have similar flaws), but for some reason, I found more suspense in the 2004 release. If you like ""Independence Day"" for any reason, that's great, just don't expect me have the same opinion.",Independence Day
126,vip_ebriega,The definitive summer blockbuster.,10,26 September 2007,"My Take: Perfection in its own silly, explosive, action-packed way. A highly entertaining blockbuster. I love the summer. It's the time every year or so, that we could sit back, relax and try to get back to your lazy self. You can go outside, fly kites, ride your bike across the countryside, go to the beach, stay at home and watch television, or go to the theaters and catch the latest in summer blockbuster releases. It was way back in the 1990's that these blockbuster flourished. It was almost every year or so, we get a film that tried to top the other. It was the busiest time for Hollywood.I wasn't much frequent on watching movies on the big screen back then, and only manage to watch these movies on video. I watched INDEPENDENCE DAY many years later, having missed it on both its exact release date and decade. I saw it on a post-summer night, just a few weeks after summer vacation just ended. Upon watching, I found myself enjoying everything about it. Rating it on a summer movie meter, it's terrific entertainment. The definitive summer blockbuster.INDEPENDENCE DAY has no moment to spare. It starts out quickly with the sight of a gigantic alien spaceship hovering over the craters of the moon, heading towards the Earth. The film has the usual news on Earth, like all invasion flicks, having the news spread, starting from a small organization investigating extraterrestrial activity, then to the military, who then phone calls The White House, giving it full news to President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman), who obviously remembers Michael Douglas' president performance in THE American PRESIDENT (but I didn't say lampoon), who stares in a moment of shock and disbelief.Before the sight of the alien spaceship hovering above the cities around the world, we first get a glimpse of the many characters in the film. First, there's computer engineer David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum, in an excellent performance), playing chess with father Julius Levinson(Judd Hirsh) at Central Park. David is divorced from his wife (Margaret Colin), who happens to be the President's Chief-of-staff (see the connections). Then it switches to Kansas, where the focus is a small family. The father, Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), a crop-dust farmer, believes he's kidnapped by aliens and is willing for payback, much to the dismay of his teenage kids. We also get introduced to a soldier (Will Smith), who both longs to return to NASA and reach for the stars (literally), and to propose to his girlfriend Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox).Well, enough of that. It's time we see an invasion, and, boy, did we get one. After the discovery of the invaders plot (using the Earth's satellites to plan an attack), we get a mind-blowing sequence after another at incredible pace. The destruction at the streets of New York are just the first great effects-laden sequences in the film. Lets see, we get a STAR WARS-inspired dogfight between fighter jets and alien spaceships. And we also get a suspenseful sequence of an alien in laboratory (Talk about a close encounter), INDEPENDENCE DAY doesn't fail when it comes to a good visual feast. Admittedly, some of the effects are cheesy, seeing how much CGI has improved over the years, but they still provide an eye-filling experience.INDEPENDENCE DAY runs for a long 145 minutes, but director Roland Emmerich fills it with lots of fun and excitement, it just seems to pass by. Director Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin spares no moments and doesn't stop for a break, giving the film a roaring pace without a dull moment that can't be interesting. The photography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub gives the film a good look, while composer David Arnold serenades the film with a rollicking and patriotic score.Forget its stereotype problems, INDEPENDENCE DAY is terrific summer entertainment that never fails to have me entertained.Rating: ***** out of 5.",Independence Day
127,Stampsfightclub,Aliens and love,8,4 July 2008,"With a great story lined up and an A list cast all included, Independence Day broke records when released in 96, and now 12 years on it still hasn't lost any of its magic.Will Smith (Fresh Prince of Bel Air) coming almost straight from being a rapper and starring on a network TV show got the role of a U.S pilot which put him firmly on the market as one of the hottest and youngest actors around.Smith stars alongside Bill Pullman (While you were sleeping) and Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park) as the world comes under attack by alien spacecrafts and the stakes are raised by each of their love lives.With its Oscar winning effects, Independence Day established itself in the Sci-Fi genre with the huge and very impressive spacecraft designs and justified it brilliantly, especially with Smith's first encounter with one of the aliens, a personal favourite moment.And along with the great effects, comes an even better plot which is gripping, tense and extraordinary. The suspense is built as viewers are given glimpses of what is coming, and the world's response is also intriguing, none more so than the political view of the president.There was an interesting political side to the story, what to do and what not to do to save lives, keeping secrets and to use the right course of action, giving the plot more depth.Though at first we are thrust into so many people's lives that it can be easy to forget, we gradually get to know the characters and their situations and though a bit cheesy, are still fun to watch, and at points dramatic and thankfully realistic in context.There are some great one liners, especially from Smith. The acting is far from brilliant but the effects and the suspense in the plot is enough for it to be included in the top Sci-Fi thrillers of all time. And though it does wear thin after a few watchers, it never loses its power to entertain and shock.",Independence Day
128,Mister-6,Salute the flag and blast the ETs...,8,6 September 2000,"Maybe it's just me but the one thing that kept running through my mind as I watched ""Independence Day"" was - man, Irwin Allen would have LOVED this one!In fact, ID4 plays at times just like an Allen epic - awesome special effects, one-dimensional characters, action and danger at every turn, melodrama that any soap opera would kill for and top-name stars rounding out a powerhouse cast.  The only thing missing was the little boxes with the cast's pictures in them along the bottoms of the movie posters.And stereotypes?  SHEESH!  There are one-sided portrayals of drunk hicks (Quaid), old Jewish men (Hirsch), hysterical gays (Fierstein), detatched intellectuals (Goldblum), gung-ho tough guys (Smith), gruff military men (Loggia), and a bunch of women (Colin, McDonnell, Fox) who stand around and look worried as aliens blow up most of the world around them.Although, Fox is about the toughest of the lot; she can kick doors, drive trucks, tend to the wounded and stand up for herself mighty well, which is more than what the rest of the women here are allowed to do.  Quite a shame, too; remember when McDonnell was being lauded for ""Dances with Wolves""?Even so, the FX are top notch as we see New York City, Washington DC and all the other world capitals blasted to smithereens, alien ships hovering overhead like huge gray Frisbees and aliens that look like a combination between crabs, octopi and one of the cantina dwellers in ""Star Wars"".  Very impressive.BUT, and this is only a slight problem here, why did they have to paraphrase ""War of the Worlds"" so much?  I mean, with all the technology and talent available, why not do something new and exciting?  Instead, the solution to curing the Earth of its alien problems is no more advanced than the end of WOTW.  If you've seen it, you know what I mean.For what it is, though, it works.

Judd Hirsch is fun as Jeff's dad.Sure there are problems with the plot - the fact that this all happens in the pan of 3 days is ridiculous. Maybe there are too many characters and maybe the film is long, but this isn't a terrible crime. The film isn't BAD.

What used to be common in the seventies, with movies like The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and Towering Inferno (1974), films showing catastrophes had taken a bit of a back seat until Independence Day. This revival on a globally-catastrophic scale brought about such films as Armageddon (1998) and Deep Impact (1998).Granted, Emmerich continued to make world destruction a part of his directing career, which is why films like this almost seem hokey today. Godzilla (1998), The Day After Tomorrow (2004), 2012 (2009), and White House Down (2013) haven't been the most critically-acclaimed films of all time, but they certainly carry Emmerich's penchant for demolishing cultural landmarks. One does wonder why Independence Day stands out amongst his other films, almost as an anomaly. While later films by Roland Emmerich were a bit too over the top in their carnage, this film has a good balance of destruction and plot. Some of the comedy in later films felt forced, but in this film the actors did a great job of lightening tension. Perhaps the biggest difference between Independence Day and his later films is the fact that humanity can actually fight back against the annihilation it currently faces.I mean, let's face it, the legendary speech by Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore is merely the icing on the cake of great characters like Will Smith's cocky pilot Captain Steven Hiller, Jeff Goldblum's awkward genius David Levinson, and Randy Quaid's conspiracy theorist Russell Casse. These are characters we care about. These are characters who have their strengths, as well as their weaknesses. These are characters who are greater combined together, and are able to halt the alien assault on earth.A great sci-fi film that almost guarantees it'll be shown on TV at least once a year due to it's loose holiday theme, I give Independence Day 4.5 stars out of 5.",Independence Day
131,Hollywood_Yoda,Today We Celebrate Our Independence Day! Happy 4th of July,10,4 July 2017,"Today seemed like the most appropriate day to write a review of the classic Will Smith alien film, Independence Day. There are so many memories I have of this film growing up (even the satire).One of the first major films that Will Smith starred in, alongside Jeff Goldblum of Jurassic Park fame and Bill Pullman (not Paxton). Paxton, in my opinion, played one of the most heroic, and best Presidents on screen. Goldblum was not bad, of course most of us associate him with his role in Jurassic Park.Don't forget Will, he was pretty great in this film too as Steve Hiller, probably one of his best roles. Which begs the question, why he didn't return for the sequel?! Oh well!!The technology to make the film at the time, 1996, was really out of this world great. With the films now, in comparison, it looks a bit old. But after 20 some years, they all look that way.Paxton delivered the best line of the entire film, towards the end, he said, ""...should we win the day, the fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day the world declared in one voice: ""We will not go quietly into the night! We will not vanquish without a fight! We're going to live on! We're going to survive!""TODAY WE CELEBRATE OUR INDEPENDENCE DAY!""",Independence Day
132,ivo-cobra8,A classic Sci-Fi blockbuster of summer 1996,10,8 October 2016,"Independence Day (1996) is a classic Sci-Fi blockbuster of summer 1996, it was actually released the year that I was 12 years old and this film become a hit in Slovenia and it was released in movie theater's. This movie is directed by German director Roland Emmerich who also directed Universal Soldier (1992) with Jean-Claude Van Damme my favorite movie that I love to death and it is my first favorite movie of Roland Emmerich! Independence Day is the second favorite film of mine that I love to death from this director! I love this film to death, it is my favorite alien invasion sci-fi action film. The film is rated PG-13 and even with less violence this film still brings been entertaining and very interesting action movie. Of all the 90's action movies that focus more on airplanes are only two movies from the 90's I consider been best: Die Hard 2 and Independence Day I love them to death! This film stars: Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia and Randy Quaid.War of the Worlds (2005) remake with Tom Cruise is the only movie that I know about alien invasions and I can say is not as a good as Independence Day. I thought War of the Worlds was kinda boring film and too over long. I do have that movie on Blu-ray disc because of Tom Cruise collection but I still I am bored to death with that movie. This film is the opposite of War of the Worlds and the remake can't beat this classic epic sci-fi action film. Plot: Independence Day is a 1996 science fiction action film that follows the citizens of Earth who band together to repel alien invaders determined to take the world by force.The film was be followed twenty years later in 2016 with the sequel Independence Day: Resurgence. I still have to watch the sequel which I am very excited to see that film. This flick has a great talented cast such as Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and Robert Loggia. The movie has a great practical special effects, heroism and characters that are written easily likable and sure the movie it's over the top sometimes and it doesn't hold up as maybe it did 20 years ago but it still does it's job pretty well and it's without a doubt the best film of Roland Emmerich next to Universal Soldier. The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the Nevada desert in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by an extraterrestrial race of unknown origin. Along with the rest of the human population, they launch a last-ditch counterattack on July 4 – the same date as Independence Day in the United States. It has good action, good story, good characters, good mix of computer, models and practical effects which still hold up to this very day. A little trivia, when Bill Pullman gave his speech about how they are going to fight back against the aliens, I think when people saw this in South America that they actually believed Bill Pullman was the President which shows how great his acting was in this film. The scene where it is the aftermath after the attack, and we see the Statue of Liberty destroyed that was a homage to the original Planet of the Apes movie where Charlten Heston finds the Statue of Liberty destroyed. I enjoy a lot of great and funny scenes with Will Smith character when he punches the alien and says ""Welcome to Earth!"" and then grabs the cigar and said, ""Now, that's what I call a close encounter!"" I totally disagree with some people who didn't care for it especially critics, it was way better than that awful ""Skyline"" and the ""War of the Worlds"" remake. In my honest I'm definitely not looking forward to the new sequel that come out, but I am going to gave a shot even tough I hear mainly negative stuff about it. Overall: Independence Day is a good movie to watch on 4th of July the same date that holiday Independence Day is in the United States. 10/10 still is Roland Emmerich best film!

133,fernandoschiavi,"A guilty pleasure. After all, action and tension is what Independence Day wants to deliver. It is not about complexity as his artistic expression resides in entertainment",7,10 April 2021,"Roland Emmerich is, without a doubt, the Master of the catastrophe films. On his resume, the director not only has Independence Day, his first dive into the sub-genre, but also Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow, and 2012, all marked by mass destruction - global most of the time - and a complete absence script or quality performances, absences that open the way for the visual spectacle in computer graphics with several memorable sequences. Here, Independence Day literally encapsulates the spirit of all those similar films from the 70s such as the series Airport, Earthquake, Hell in the Tower, Poseidon's Destiny, copying almost entirely from the classic formula, which usually addresses family nuclei or friends before the tragedy in a slow narrative construction and the consequences after the apocalypse sets in. And there's nothing wrong with that, actually, as Emmerich lends his ability to create epics - Stargate was his immediately preceding film, which already demonstrated his ability to handle science fiction well - and creates a film that will be guaranteed fun. Just ignore the various poetic licenses in the script and embark on the guilt-free adventure.With an estimated budget of 75 million, Independence Day stifled Spielberg's intentions to remake the classic 1953 War of the Worlds to present an alien invasion on an absurd scale. Since the first teaser trailers, with the shadows consuming tourist spots accompanied by the expression of astonishment from passers-by, the feature film has already come with the proposal to shape America's basic formula of self-destruction: if terrorists could not find access - until then - , a flurry of blockbusters began that featured the United States being threatened by natural phenomena and alien forces. As a masochistic pleasure intensified by the approach of the end of the millennium, the result could not be other than a lot of destruction, with sensational effects from impressive models, and the exaggerated patriotism, capable of putting the American president himself on a fighter to face the enemies. Interplanetary.Don't ask how, but even though the United States government communicates with other nations through Morse code, television continues to quietly broadcast the news with naughty information to the viewer - commonly, us - and that's even after the attacks. It doesn't help the spectator to wonder how David managed, in less than six hours, to pick up his father, get out of downtown New York faster than the whole crowd, and still arrive in Washington, about 330 kilometers from distance; And why bother with the fact that aliens, coming from beyond the solar system, count time in the same measurements as we do? After all, who cares? Forget it, after all, we are back in 1996, a time when the characters use gigantic cell phones, while the aliens have a touchscreen.Regarding the script of the film, it is fair to say that it is the factor most detonated by the specialized critic. The focus of the production really is to bring elaborate scenes of destruction, leaving the likelihood in the background. There is a lot of patriotism to the United States, to its July 4th holiday (which becomes a world holiday) and to the American army. The script also does not seek to deepen the personal dramas of the characters and some situations are quite fanciful. But the truth is that this was never the intention. Director Roland Emmerich sucks at character development - it would be prudent to say that he may not know what that actually means - but, on the other hand, he is efficient in his action sequences. And since they tend to put the protagonists and large crowds of people in danger, it is easy to gain public empathy, since we on this side of the screen prefer to think that, instead of those figures, we would also survive - right? Big explosion and collapse of a tunnel? No problem, you would go through this to drive a truck and save the First Lady of the United States. Drag the body of an extraterrestrial across the desert, even without supplies? Of course, if you, like Will Smith, can punch one of the damn aliens right in the face. Escape from a colossal explosion at the last second by just a few feet with Air Force One? Only if we can get rid of an even bigger explosion, in space and on board an alien spaceship. Emmerich may not take the human side of his characters very much into consideration, but he is great at instigating the superhuman in them, which hits our ego right in the middle - after all, if they succeed, why not me?If, on the one hand, the narrative is poor, Independence Day stands out in the technical part. David Arnold's great soundtrack, simply contagious, manages to electrify in the intense scenes and manages to thrill in those more dramatic scenes, as in a moment when an important character dies. The composer manages to bring a track with melodies that help and a lot to give the mood of the film. The editing of sound effects and sound mixing mixes well the noise of explosions, the shouting of people, the shooting of ships and falling buildings. It is no coincidence that he competed for the Oscar for Best Sound.The general shots taken by Karl Walter Lindenlaub, which Emmerich brought from Stargate, work very well to convey the magnitude of the attacks. David Brenner's montage (The Day After Tomorrow, 2012, The Man of Steel) also deserves commendation for not succumbing to the spectator's bewilderment. Using Lindenlaub's broader photograph very well, he connects the sequences in a way that makes the beating - even in the complicated final aerial attack - logical without losing its energy. And what about the visual effects, which won the Oscars? Today they may seem a little dated, but nothing that gets in the way. And when reviewing the film today, it is actually impressive that many scenes remain current. The grandeur of the ships, the destruction of buildings and the White House, the final air battles, everything remains exciting.The film is shallow and somewhat empty of content - the theme ""union of nations"" is beautiful, but if we squeeze it, nothing comes out - but it is undeniable that the director and his script partner Dean Devlin manage to create captivating characters, who they carry the film on their backs. Will Smith in his first big hit, in his burst stage. The star has always lavished charisma, mainly for his comical crazy things and in the action scenes. The best jokes and jokes come out of Smith's mouth. The star Jeff Goldblum (from 'The Fly"" and 'Jurassic Park') always with presence and a restrained performance. Bill Pullman plays with respect a well-intentioned and convincing president. Veterans Randy Quaid and Judd Hirsch are surprisingly funny. The synchrony of all of them is something that helps us to care about the characters and cheer in the end.Independence Day is a beautiful example of the catastrophe film, almost a return to the seventies past, which seems to have been the decade that ""created"" the genre. This work by Emmerich will remain in the viewer's memory even if it is due to its exaggeration and absurd technological freedoms. A true guilty pleasure, of those who leave a pleasant smile on the face after the projection. It's another great guilty pleasure - that movie, which is essentially pretty bad, but you have fun watching it - directed by the filmmaker specializing in catastrophe films. After all, action and tension is what Emmerich wants to deliver. It is not about his ""sophisticated and complex"" plot that he wants to base his feature film on, as his artistic expression resides in entertainment. Who cares about ufanism - I would say implicitly, if the foreground was not an American flag - and cheesy melodramas when Bill Pullman is giving such an ""inspirational"" speech? Anyway, they say that there is that kind of film to ""turn off the brain"". I say that for this we have those we can call ""bad"". Independence Day is not to turn anything off, but rather just one of those event films that requires less from the intellect of others - which is different, and by no means a demerit. After all, features like these by Emmerich, however disposable they may be, will always find shelter.",Independence Day

136,TheNorthernMonkee,"America saves the world AGAIN, but at least people suffer first",7,4 August 2005,"SPOILERS The biggest, and most annoying thing about Hollywood is the way that so many of it's films feature humanity saved by America. Self obsessed, and often stereotypical, these films can range from entertaining disaster movies to mindless drivel. Luckily for 1996's 'Independence Day' it is closer to the first classification. Explosive and action packed, it is also entertaining at points and well worth someone's evening.After alien ships appear in the sky, humanity is divided in their opinions. When scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) discovers a timer counting down to an event however, he fears the worse and rushes to the White House. Showing his ex wife (Margaret Colin) and her boss President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) his evidence, Levinson shows them the truth of an impending attack. Unfortunately for humanity though, the aliens are already prepared.Violent and explosive, 'Independence Day' will always be remembered for the moment the White House is blown up. Impressive effects for the time, that scene is just one of many occasions throughout the film when graphics take over from the human element. For this sort of film, this can only be a good thing. Whilst actors like Goldblum, Pullman and personal favourite Judd Hirsch, all pull their weight during the film, people don't watch for them, they watch for the special effects and the occasional Will Smith quip (of which there are many).People also watch to see humanity come out on top. It's a strange state of affairs that irrelevant of what fate befalls the world, humanity, and especially America, always manages to survive and thrive. We loose some characters along the way, but for the most part we prove to the universe that we are here to stay. Pessimists amongst us dream of the day when a decent disaster movie exists where humanity doesn't actually thrive (weak films like 'Deep Impact' don't really live up to expectation) and we are on the verge of annihilation. A depressing thought yes, but all too often in these films, there is no way humanity would, or should, survive the situation in hand. Still, that's the Hollywood fantasy for you.If you love watching monuments get blown up from around the world, then you are never going to run short of options. Over the years practically every single monument has been destroyed. Few films manage this with such panache however as 'Independence Day'. Well acted, but who really cares, and constantly entertaining, it is a violent, explosive movie with some stunning special effects. It is a film well worth watching, although just for once, it'd be nice to see humanity loose.",Independence Day
137,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,One hell of a high-octane action-fest!,8,7 April 2005,"TNT packed entertainment, pure and simple. That is what this movie is. Nothing more nothing less. It was obviously made to show off fancy special effects (which won an Oscar) and give film-goers a fun time at the theaters when it was released in the Summer of 1996. And that's exactly what it did, and still does. The ""wall of fire sequence"" was absolutely stunning and frightening when I saw it in the theater and it still manages to impress.The film is, of course, overly patriotic as the almighty USA saves the day, but seriously what did you expect? Deep thought-out political commentary on how the nations of the world deal with a crisis that could spell doom for the world? If so, that is probably why you were let down. From the very first ads to theatrical release the hype about this movie was kick-ass special effects and explosive action along with a feel good story. That is precisely what this film delivered which is why I don't understand the bashing of it. It was never meant to serious. Also seeing that it grossed over $300 million in the USA and over $500 million abroad making it one of the most successful films of all time, the bashers should just admit it: people like this stuff. It is simple and feel-good, but definitely not trash.Granted that I can see people finding roaring explosive mayhem boring and not worth their time, so... DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! It was never made to look like anything else. Enjoy. 8/10Rated PG-13: violence and intense action",Independence Day
138,swilliky,ID4 was fun in 1996 and still decent 20 years later,7,25 June 2016,"The highest grossing movie of 1996 was the alien invasion blockbuster directed by Roland Emmerich. Independence Day featured the destruction of national monuments including the White House and the Empire State Building. Will Smith stars as Captain Steven Hiller, a fast- talking and even faster-flying fighter pilot alongside Jeff Goldblum, who was coming off of the 1993 highest grossing movie Jurassic Park, as the cable guy David Levinson.From the first shot of an alien spaceship hovering over the moon toward Earth, this movie set a precedent for iconic invasion imagery. Bill Pullman plays President Whitmore, a retired fighter pilot. Pullman does a decent job as a president out of his depth with this new threat.

And I am glad that I watched it because it kept me thrilled and interested until the very end.To this day there are already 906 reviews and everything that has to be said about this movie has been said, so I'll keep my review short. Suffice to say that despite the movie is at times more special effects than plot, director Roland Emmerich managed to balance both things perfectly. The acting, especially by Bill Pullman, Jeff Golblum, Robert Loggia and Will Smith in one of his first movies is good. And the movie itself has today a nostalgic 90s feel (folks that were teens or adults in those years will understand it better).In the end, I recommend this movie, but don't have high expectations.

140,jrarichards,23 years old and looking splendid...,10,17 June 2019,"Unlike his 2016 ID:Resurgence, which can pretty much be dismissed without a second thought, Roland Emmerich's original is a triumphalist triumph of epic film-making, with gung-ho David Arnold music to match. Although 150 minutes long, it is in many ways an economically-made yet attractively-filmed movie, passing smoothly and logically (but also at times with pleasant eccentricity) from scene to scene; and all the time looking plausible (at the military and government levels), while playing successfully with emotions of fear, shock, sadness, patriotism, stoicism, wit and indeed enigma.Not much is wasted here, very few scenes indeed fall down, and a great many have become iconic, not just for this movie, but in the whole history of cinema. One knows those images or vignettes are coming, yet they continue to give pleasure, and have not lost their edge. There are no dud characters here, and many are a joy to see in action, all the more so as unlikely combinations of characters come together.To look at ""Independence Day"" as it should be looked at is to see an antidote - or better a mirror image - of ""Close Encounters"". While the latter is clearly the more cerebral movie, ID also does its bit of emulation by following logical if strange paths of the stories of individuals, many of whom resemble Richard Dreyfuss's Roy Neary in being able to penetrate the top-secret military and scientific stuff, opening the movie up, though of course exposing those featuring to fear and misery, as opposed to the mix of awe and wonder that Spielberg had to offer back in 1977. But the universe is a big place, and if aliens exist at all, perhaps they will indeed be the locust-like lifeforms Bill Pullman's President Whitmore tells us about.While Pullman is not a great actor, he does quite well enough in this role, while the Smith-Goldblum pairing is again iconic, robust and witty, as is the father-and-son provided by Goldblum and Judd Hirsch. James Rebhorn and Robert Loggia are perfect in their top-politician and top-military roles respectively, while Randy Quaid gets his character just right, as of course does Brent Spiner as the slightly whacko Doctor Okun. Adam Baldwin showed early promise in uniform as Major Mitchell, and Harvey Fierstein also offers his part with a nice mix of humour and poignancy. The female leads are perhaps weaker, though with Vivica Fox convincing most.Many at the time dismissed ID as an effects movie of little import, but ironically the chance to compare with ID:Resurgence all those years later makes it abundantly clear what a surfeit of CGI can do to render a film meaningless. In contrast, the original ""Independence Day"" plays a military battle story straight and really seems to offer a tangible hint of what the dread event of alien invasion might look like; and it's authentically scary and awesome, and far from just throwaway death and destruction (unlike the tragically weak 2016 effort). To my mind, this kind of invasion is (thankfully) something that's never going to happen, but recall how mainstream physicists do actually see life as a relatively likely outcome out there in the universe (even as biologists, ecologists and geologists feel that planets with any life are going to be excruciatingly few and far between). Which means that a species gearing its whole way of life to moving from one to another exploiting resources look all the more plausible...",Independence Day
141,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"While definitely not a classic, Independence Day still retains it's heart on it's 20th anniversary",8,4 July 2016,"In the 1990s and the early to late 2000s, Roland Emmerich, a German director, directed a few movies. Some of them were science-fiction, action-oriented, thriller, and disaster related. This film in particular.Aliens have come to our planet and destroyed most of our countries. Only a few people survived and with the help of the president of the White House, a military solider, and a nerdy scientist, they plan to fight against the aliens on Independence Day and destroy them once and for all.I'm reviewing this on Independence Day because considering that's how the battle between the humans and aliens started and the sequel just came out two weeks and three days ago. Anyway, this is a really good film. Nothing awesome or anything, but still good. I understand why the Nostalgia Critic and everyone else hated this film and Roland Emmerich in general, but as a big fan of action films that have heart, this one actually worked for me. There are some problems that I want to address before I can get to the good parts.First, the story. The concept is very fresh. The idea of humans fighting against the aliens as the part of patriotism is really original, but when it comes to the overall narrative, it's very formulaic and it does contain lots of clichés that plagued the later Roland Emmerich films. Second, some of the dialog does come across as clichéd and unbelievably cheesy and the character development seemed to be lacking at times. That's it for the flaws. Now for the good parts.Despite what I said about the dialog, the overall acting is great. I mean, talk about a big cast of talented actors. Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Harvey Fierstein, Randy Quaid, and yours truly, Will Smith. All of these actors did really well and gives the characters some likability. Also, the one liners, aside from the cheesy and clichéd moments, are really funny, the best coming from Will Smith.Also, the patriotism theme of the movie is presented really well and shows that if we work together as a united nation, we can defeat our enemies and bring peace to the world. The special effects, despite being a little dated, are still nice especially the spaceships designs which were also pretty cool. The action sequences are great and the explosions of all the countries are well-shot.The best part, however, would have to go to the music score from David Arnold. The guy composed some of the later James Bond films and even did some great music for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. His score here is beyond fantastic. It has heart, it has an epic tone, it has some strong action cues, and it fits the patriotism theme of the film perfectly. Particularly with the President's speech scene which made me shed some tears. That's all I have to say.Like I said before, I understand why the Nostalgia Critic and everyone else didn't like this film, but in spite of it's problems, I actually think this is a really good film for the fourth of July. Yes, it's a little cheesy, but to be fair, the 80s did had it's share of cheesy stuff and we were OK with it. So, overall, Independence Day is a really good patriotic science fiction action film and I think that it's one of Roland Emmerich's three best films, the other two being Stargate and the Patriot. To those who haven't seen it yet, go check it out and you'll enjoy the ride. Thumbs up. :)",Independence Day
142,rebeljenn,"Silly, annoying, unrealistic",3,30 December 2005,"'Independence Day' is a science-fiction thriller starring Will Smith in the role that made him famous. Regarded highly after its cinema release, the film's reputation now seems to have taken a turn for the worse. The film is patriotic in the annoying sense, and Will Smith's character is annoying as he battles the aliens and becomes an outspoken hero. It's also got those cheesy scenes - people and pets avoiding ultimate doom and somehow, miraculously surviving the destruction. In fact, 'Independence Day' is just another take on Wells' 'War of the Worlds', but it's America at the forefront of this disaster, which happens on its day of independence. I never enjoyed the film and thought it was a little long to sit through, but everyone else seemed to like it. I've noticed, however, that it seems to have lost its audience. If you like thrillers and liked the most recent version of 'War of the Worlds', then I think you may like this film.",Independence Day

It wasn't like it was trying to be Citizen Kane or anything like that it's just sort of a movie about gun happy aliens who blow crap up. It's like a more contemporary Plan 9 From Outer Space. I guess I can't really expect much logic in a movie where a TV repair man can find things that the government's top men can't find. Also in a movie where the president get's into a fighter plane to stop the aliens. Also in a movie where the ship can be destroyed by a drunk redneck pilot flying his jet into the gun. Also...never mind. If I point out all the plot holes then the review will be longer than War and Peace. But overall it's a fun movie. Go see it.,Independence Day
144,FloatingOpera7,Films Of The 90's: Independence Day,10,15 May 2006,"Independence Day (1996): Starring Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Will Smith, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid, Vivica A. Fox, Harry Connick Jr, Harvey Fierstein, Margaret Colin, Mary McDonnell, Robert Loggia, James Duval, Brent Spiner....Director Roland Emmerich, Screenplay Dean Devlin Released in the summer of 1996 to correspond with July 4th, Independence Day, this was a box-office blockbuster and a document in films of the 1990's. Initially, I was repulsed by the commercials and previews for it and despite all the hype surrounding it (everyone who was ages 13-30's and fans of sci-fi thrillers at this time kept raving about it)I didn't see it. Not until it was released on video (yes video not DVD) did I finally see it and appreciate it for the exciting if unlikely story and the special effects, attractive characters, music, stunning cinematography and the overall ""feel-goodness"" of it all. Predatory, heartless aliens invade the earth and destroy pre-9/11 New York City and other parts of the US and the world, and humans fight back on Independence Day and beat the aliens. This was a time, we must remember, when the X-Files was on TV, as well as Millennium and when interest in aliens and end of the world prophecies were rampant, especially because the year 2000 was approaching. Remember the looney Heaven's Gate cult consisting of seemingly normal middle-class Americans who left families, trust funds, identities and renounced their current life in order to be picked up by a spaceship and instead committed group suicide ? If this film had been released after 9/11 the aliens would be a stand-in for terrorists. Will Smith as Captain Steven Hiller is delivering the kind of action-hero role he has for the most part performed and is enjoyable nonetheless. Vivica A. Fox as a stripper/mother is another fine role, though she, like all the women in this film, take backseats and it's the men who save the day. Especially good are Judd Hirsch and Jeff Goldblum, as a Jewish father and son Julius and David who constantly bicker but prove resourceful and valiant in mankind's darkest hour. Margaret Colin as Constance ""Connie"" Spano, a beautiful, strong-willed President's Secretary and David's love interest is also doing a fine job. Not to mention Bill Pullman as the President, portraying the President as tough and ready to put his own life on the line. Yes, his wife the First Lady (Mary McDonnel) dies, and his Presidency seems to be under mostly Republican attack (like Bill Clinton who adored this movie) but he proves heroic and fights the aliens with his fighter jet, something President Bush would never think twice about. Overall, there is a sense of patriotism and humanity in this film, expanding beyond American love of country but in a sort of Many People, One Planet sort of way, and truth be told, should aliens threaten the earth, humans would set aside their religious, political rivalries and unite in a common cause. Randy Quaid as ex-World War II pilot Russell Casse, another hero, is superb. Harry Connick Jr and Harvey Feinstein make appearances - Harry Connick as Steve's army buddy Captain Jimmy Wilder and Harvey Feinstein as Marty, David's other Jewish (and gay though we don't get too much gay from him) friend who panics, worries about his mother and dies in a firestorm in his car as the Empire State Building collapses. Far from being a movie which only relies on everything being blown up and military planes battle alien ships, this is a movie with a lot of poignant and genuinely moving human moments, even leaving room for good humor. Roland Emmerich established himself as a master of this kind of epic adventure film. He would later film ""Godzilla"" in 1998 to lesser success as that film pales by comparison, but he made up for it in 2004's well-made ""Day After Tomorrow"".",Independence Day

147,timdalton007,ID4 At Twenty,9,1 July 2016,"It seems difficult to believe that Independence Day turns twenty years old this year. One of the biggest films of the 1990s, ID4 (as it was known in publicity material) became one of the biggest crossing films of the decade and a template for the current era of disaster films. Yet despite its age, it's a film that continues to stand up remarkably well.For one thing, it's well cast. While Will Smith has become a well known name as a result of this film and others like it, the ID4 cast is perhaps wisely made up largely of character actors who all give performances that help sell the incredible events of the film. These range from Jeff Goldblum as an MIT educated computer expert, Smith's fighter pilot Steve Hiller, Bill Pullman's President of the United States who comes into his own during the film's events to a supporting cast that includes Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn, Mary McDonnell, Randy Quaid and Brent Spiner among others. Each has standout moments that helps to make the film work though with the potential exception of Smith no one really steals the show. It's as good an example as any of what an ensemble cast is capable of and especially so in a Hollywood movie.What the film is perhaps best remembered for is its effects. Two decades later and shown either on large screen televisions or projected on screens, those effects hold up pretty well. From the opening scene on the Moon to the ship's entry over major cities to dogfights above cities and deserts, the film's is a powerful showing of what was being done on the end of the physical effects era and the beginning of heavy CGI effects. Yet the film's iconic moments as the White House, Empire State Building and other landmarks are wiped out (done with impressive physical models) makes a compelling case for a way of doing effects that has largely vanished in recent years. Perhaps the makers of this film, who helped to spur those efforts, might need to take a look at their work from two decades ago?Beyond that, the film might well be the best thing that director Rolland Emmerich (and his producer/co-writer Dean Devlin) have ever produced. Independence Day is a surprisingly well constructed film, using the classic three act structure in a big budget sci- fi/disaster movie complex as we get set-up, defeat and then one last battle all in the space of around two and a half hours. Despite showing the worldwide nature of the film's events, it only rarely seems to hint at it briefly which makes the film feel at times oddly American centric (something overseas reviewers have noted for years) yet perhaps it notable that the filmmakers at least made the effort to expand the story at all. Combined with dialogue and knowing homages to some of the genre's classics, the result is a film that is tense and utterly enjoyable to watch.It's also worth mentioning the the film's extended version as well. That version, which has seen the light of day on home video, contains some nine extra minutes of footage which is immensely helpful to the film. Not only does it help to flesh out not only characters but also some of the plot points that have been somewhat criticized over the years including setting up the film's ending. In a way it's a shame that version wasn't the original theatrical version or the one that came to be so well known on home video initially as it is a superior cut of the film to say the least.Also worthy of mention is David Arnold's score. Though Arnold has already scored Stargate and was a year away from scoring the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, it's this score that likely brought Arnold to greater attention than anything else. Though British, Arnold created one of the definitive American film scores of all time that includes rousing action scores and a memorable main theme. Yet Arnold's score also proves adept at both tension in the film's first hour and most especially in the lead-up to iconic moments as well as mournful sounds in its aftermath. It's a fine piece of work and a calling card for Arnold even today.Keeping all that in mind, it isn't to see why Independence Day was a success both then and now. It's a well-cast, visual spectacle that uses classical story structuring, witty dialogue and a rousing score to produce a story that is as much a joy to watch now as it was twenty years ago. However one feels about its belated sequel, there is no doubting the power and success of this film. And long may it continue to entertain generations to come.",Independence Day
148,gigan-92,Hollywood Budgeted Massive Destruction At Its Finest,7,14 July 2011,"C- Lo and behold, it's the only Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin film I actually care for. I saw it at a young age, and have seen it well over twenty times if not more over my years. If you, especially like me as an aspiring film maker, take a gander over the pair's many productions over the years, you'll realize the actual amount of creativity and talent they have can fit inside of a pin head. Their movies are predictable and serve merely as popcorn movies. As far as revolutionary sci-fi goes, it only qualifies in the category of special effects and nothing more. Of course the ships target the most popular cities first, it's movie's basics. My sole praise is to the obvious that of the extraterrestrial ship and body design. Naturally, my favorite part is the alien autopsy scene, the amount of detail put into the creatures. The film's use of miniatures is appreciated as well.As for the characters, Jeff Goldblum is pretty decent, and Will Smith is the usual gun-ho protagonist. Mary McDonnell and James Duval also star in not too bad of roles. The performances don't bother me; it's just that I'm not emotionally invested in the characters because I know who's going to die and who's not. To truly experience a modern sci-fi achievement, check out ""District 9"", a text book example of a fresh take on aliens, or in my humble opinion Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"". Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin's at their finest, if that really say's much but a good ride.",Independence Day
149,moviesleuth2,The Ultimate Summer Action Movie...Period.,10,22 April 2010,"This is it. The penultimate summer action movie. Car's don't explode, they fly 50 feet away. Buildings don't fall down, they get incinerated. And if that's not enough, New York doesn't just get busted up, it gets leveled...along with every other major city in the world.There's only one guy ballsy enough to make this movie, and that's Roland Emmerich. ""Big"" just doesn't cut it. Nor does ""epic,"" for that matter. You have to at least admire a guy that completely skips on the kitchen sink and instead throws in New York, Los Angeles, The Presidency, and a space ship that's a quarter the size of our moon. Now THAT'S what I'm talking' about!Of course, it helps tremendously that ""Independence Day"" is immensely entertaining. The action, of which there is plenty, is exciting, and there are more one-liners than there are fingers and toes of you and the person sitting next to you. And, oh yeah, don't forget the creepy aliens.Anyway, the story stars on July 3, when radar picks up a signal coming from the moon. Then, after introducing us to the surprisingly vast array of characters, the alien ships show up. And they're not looking to become your next door neighbor. So after causing massive destruction, a few stragglers gather together to bring them down.Yes, that's vastly oversimplifying things. But for a movie that has so much going on, it accomplishes everything it sets out to do: provide eye-popping action, and a good few laughs along the way. Nothing seems to be left out, and there aren't any glaring mistakes.The cast is made up of a few well known faces and a surprising amount of character actors. All of them do their job extremely well. Of them, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman can be considered the ""main"" characters. Will Smith is one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood, and it's not hard to see why. He has more range than is often recognized, and his screen appeal is undeniable. He also has considerable comic skill (after all, he was the star of one of the funniest sitcoms ever on TV). His performance as fighter pilot Captain Steven Hiller is among his best performances. Jeff Goldblum is once again playing a geek, but unlike ""Jurassic Park,"" Goldblum's David Levinson is not an egotistical jerk. He has solid chemistry with his co-stars, specifically Smith, and his father, Julius (well-played by Judd Hirsch). Bill Pullman is the weakest of the three, although that's hardly a damning statement. He acquits himself well enough amidst the surrounding talent, and never fades into the background (which he has done in other roles). The smaller roles are made up of recognizable faces, including Randy Quaid as an alcoholic pilot (played with the off-the-wall panache that only Randy Quaid can give), Mary McDonnell as the First Lady, Robert Loggia as a general, Vivica A. Fox as Hiller's stripper girlfriend, Margaret Colin as a Presidential aide (and David's ex). Cameos by Harvey Fierstein as David's co-worker and Brent Spiner as an off-the-wall scientist are also good. But special mention has to go to Harry Connick, Jr. as Jimmy Wilder, Hiller's best friend. Connick is electrifying, and often steals scenes from Smith (something that is quite difficult).This is summer fun, and Emmerich knows this. There's never a moment where it takes itself very seriously (even though there are a few times where the opportunity arises). Critics weren't very approving of this movie, and you know what? It doesn't matter. This is not an artistic movie of any sort. It's plain and simply entertaining.",Independence Day

151,Min111,I seen it many times now,8,1 June 2018,"This was a really entertaining movie to watch back then. It's one of my favourite movies of that time, and it was something I could watch again. I use to watch it all the time whenever it appeared on television. I seen it many times now, yet I still can't get bored with it. The plot was good though it could've been more better. The only thing I didn't like about 'Independence Day' was that there wasn't enough of these aliens. In fact, I don't think there was much at all which is bizarre and strange. All I could see was alien spaceships, and I think there's a difference. Also, there was barely much information on who those aliens were, where they were from, and how they knew about us. If only the movie gotten those things right, 'Independence Day' would've been far greater than it already is. It definitely would've got a much higher rating. But I have to admit. Those spaceships were so big, cool, powerful and scary-looking. It's these spaceships that make this movie enjoyable to watch. I can't believe the enormous size of those spaceships. The technology they had was far more advanced. I really liked the scene where one of the spaceship just disintegrates an entire building in mere seconds with all these people on top. I laughed at those people thinking the aliens have come to make peace or something. The people got what they deserved. I was happy. That was the most memorable moment. I like the casting. One of the characters was played by Will Smith. Another character was played by Jeff Goldblum. They are popular actors. They made the movie exciting to watch. I liked how they teamed up towards the end, so they can save the world. It was brave of them. It was risky though. Will Smith was the pilot. Jeff Goldblum was the one riding alongside him. Let's not forget the President. The President also played a big part. I don't see many problems with 'Independence Day'. The movie came out during the nineties. There were just too many great movies back in the nineties. This was one of them. 'Independence Day' is an action, adventure and science-fiction movie. The movie is very long though. You don't know what you're missing on if you haven't seen it. 'Independence Day' is a movie which will entertain you from start to finish. I'm amazed with the level of consistency.",Independence Day

Need I continue? Even the most patriotic American must see that this film is trash.

Even as a young adult, I found this to bee too stupid to be entertaining.Of course, I don't live in Hollywood - wait, I did then...for a few months.However, this movie is so full of American propaganda that it hurt my head to watch it.From beginning to end and everywhere in between, this movie was just a nasty mess.Apart from all the flaws that you read on every other post, this made the USA look so bad in the eyes of other nations that instead of promoting the country to something of a hero, it made the US look like a total mess of self serving, egoistic, glory hungry retards.Why had the President and the US Armed Forces not try to contact any other nation's leaders in trying to overcome the aliens? Because the US leaders, politicians and gatekeepers want to prove to the world that they have the answer and solution to even the most insane and unforeseen problem attacking the world.There have been lots of horrible movies, but this one is definitely in the top 20.I knew the US would save the world and I hated the movie for it. I was really hoping that the aliens would blast the zhit out of the USA, so that the rest of the world could possibly try to negotiate some sort of truce with the aliens.As you can see, Germany or England, Russia or Australia did not attack. And the aliens didn't even think of hovering over Canada - even though it's right close to the USA! What happened there?By this film, they stood idly by, watching everything fall to the floor in flames and it was only the US that was able to do anything.What a load of s__t! Too retarded for somebody who doesn't fall for American machismo...too much Hollywood for Hollywood.What happened to Hollywood? Can't they find any more Bruce Willis clones to make action movies anymore? They have to try to result to DRAMATIC action with a huge cast of characters who in their own right should not be paid 1/10th of the wage they earn.I'm certain that had Brad Pitt been a star that year, his ugly mug would have been in there somewhere - as well as his bitch of a wife.",Independence Day

156,Antagonisten,Entertaining,6,21 February 2005,"Sometimes it's hard not liking a movie even though it has so many things to dislike. ""Independence Day"" is one of those movies.I remember when the trailer came out for this movie. It was one of the best trailers i'd seen back then. Simply because it really made med want to see the movie. Everything about it just seemed so cool. And i guess when i saw it at the theater i was not disappointed. It was a fun ride. And seeing it now a couple of years later i may not enjoy it as much as i did, but i can sure understand why i enjoyed it the first time around.Because let's face it. Plausibility is exceptionally low here. Goofs are present in almost every shot. The dialog is a joke, the characters are caricatures and the plot is basically ""War of the worlds"" moved to present day. But still, like a video game that may be stupid but can still entertain this is not so bad. Admittedly though the movie loses most of it's entertainment value as it slows down toward the end. But up until then it's a lot of fun.It feels like most people who disliked this movie did so for rather strange reasons. It seems they expected something completely different from what they got. This is a classic matinée movie about peoples fear of the unknown. A classic genre no matter if the unknown factor is Aliens or Russians or whatever. This movie is not trying to be smart, only entertaining. And while the dosage of dull and pompous American self-pride is a little too high, it still manages to rise above it and entertain most of the time.And when i see a movie like this one i first and foremost want to be entertained.

159,garethcrook,America! F&@k yeah!!,6,10 August 2019,"Independence Day, a big fat ""Yeehaw America"" kinda film... but as stupid as it is, it's bloody good fun. Sure there's nothing complicated about it, it's cut to the chase stuff, spaceships appear within 2 minutes, def cons are mentioned shortly after. Cue lots of booming sound effects to match the flash cuts as we whip around the globe setting up the alien invasion, whilst maintaining the focus on the US Military. Mr President Bill Pullman doing his breathy, I'm really important act, I'm surprised the TV doesn't explode with testosterone. In fact women are pretty much left out of the story altogether. I wouldn't be surprised if a portion of the US population watched this and thought ""Hell yeah, we'd show those aliens!"", truth is though that's not the way to enjoy this film. It's a tongue firmly in cheek sort of ride. ""The LA Police Department asks people not to fire their weapons at the spaceship, you may inadvertently trigger an interstellar war"". I mean it's got Will Smith in it, not to mention Jeff Goldblum being Jeff Goldblum. It's a sci-fi, disaster movie farce with a massive budget. A budget largely spent on explosions. Landmarks blown up, relentless fireballs, flying cars, all in slow motion of course and the audio balance is bloody ridiculous, speaker killing pyrotechnics coupled with rousing score, followed by cheesy exposition heavy dialogue at half the volume. Ah... the dialogue, seriously who wrote this script, that speech, it's so cringe inducing it made my face hurt, as the characters bumble through a solution to their impending doom. I guess if hostile aliens do ever attack us, sticking the gun toting nutjob country in the line of fire isn't a bad idea, as long as we can handle the endless fist pumping gloating that might follow. It's not aged badly though, it is what it is, daft over the top fun, but I guess I'm a bit more cynical these days and I seriously doubt anyone would green light anything like this now... although they did make Independence Day: Resurgence a few years ago, now THAT was a disaster!",Independence Day

That detracted from the overall experience for me personally...The story line is right out of the classic ""aliens come to take over the Earth"" theme, but with considerable panache this time. It seems the entire alien race lives on this humongous star ship, and even have smaller attack ""shuttles"" that are still 15 miles in diameter...All the actors are household names in their own right, but in this case putting them all in the same movie, each one trying to out do the other was a letdown really...Otherwise, the acting is presentable, the CGI rather well done, and it was an enjoyable experience overall...",Independence Day

That may be true (in fact, I'm inclined to believe it is), but you also need talent, and they fall short there.  The first half hour of the movie has problems which re-occur throughout(like Randy Quaid; never is he more annoying or condescending than when he's playing crazy types), but grabs us at least, and I can't deny the visceral effectiveness of watching the White House being blown up.  But then the story becomes cliche city.  The only actors who survive are Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum, because they at least are entertaining.  Some do solid work (Harry Connick Jr., Robert Loggia), some are wasted (Mary McDonnell, Bill Pullman), and some are awful (Quaid, James Rebhorn), and the movie is similarly patchwork.  This movie does not represent the end of civilization as we know it, but it's a sad state of affairs when this is the norm and not the exception.",Independence Day
164,Al_The_Strange,"""We're going to live on! We're going to survive! Today we celebrate our Independence Day!""",9,4 July 2013,"In 1996, this film was released with a simple premise: an alien invasion occurs on July 4th, with massive ships obliterating entire cities and systematically exterminating mankind. In some of the most chilling and awe-inspiring footage, the 15-mile-wide flying saucers destroy the White House, Los Angeles, and New York City (just a few of many), with massive waves of fire washing over the streets. This is quickly followed by retaliation, with squadrons of jet fighters taking on the extraterrestrial vessels.This film crams in a lot within its two-and-a-half hour timeframe: the first act takes its time to establish all the key characters as the UFOs gradually take position. When the attack begins, the action remains pretty constant, leading up to a grand final battle. Special effects were really inspiring at its time, and remain iconic to this day. Even when firestorms, alien ships, and jet fighters aren't filling up the screen, the movie runs pretty fast, with frequent comedy to keep things light and fun. Overall, it's the perfect blockbuster picture, finding a fine balance between action, spectacle, humor, and drama.The story is pretty much more of the same as any other alien invasion story you see. In fact, it bears much in common with the classic War of the Worlds. What makes ID4 more compelling, however, is that it juggles multiple characters and multiple points of views, and eventually brings them together for the central fight. All these characters are pretty fun to watch and root for, and show just enough development to make them work. The plot is pretty well-structured, using three distinct acts to portray this larger-than-life situation. It's also most noteworthy for portraying relatively realistic politics and military protocols, thanks largely to the consultation the filmmakers received from the Air Force during filming. The film also ties in a few ufology aspects to capitalize off of the popular concepts of alien life. It makes for a grand and entertaining story, even if it isn't all that deep or original.This film has very solid photography and editing. Acting is generally fun from the whole cast: Bill Pullman is probably the only one who takes his role seriously, and actually comes off as a little cheesy with the way he tries so hard to sound cool and tough. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum steal the show the whole way with their lighthearted performances. Writing is pretty decent, although many lines are silly and goofy. This production spares no expense on sets, props, costumes, and special effects, although they are showing their age. David Arnold's music score is appropriately boisterous.At the time of its release, Independence Day was one of the most exciting and awe-inspiring features I had seen. Despite its age and cheesiness, I still call it one of the most essential blockbusters of all time.Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)",Independence Day
165,Offworld_Colony,There's so much character and so much quality in this epic destruction blockbuster...,6,14 February 2020,"...that it's easy to see why it's not just the quintessential example of its genre but still regarded as a classic. The glut of lessor imitators has shown Independence Day's great use of sets and design and multiple characters and the deliberate pacing and intelligently used destruction. Yeah it's still rah rah USA but less so than I remembered, maybe because it's so much more tame than recent flicks like Transformers. And it's still extremely cheesy and contrived but only in exactly the right measures for a summer blockbuster. It fuses a ton of genres and ends up being a bloated but undeniably fun retro ride.",Independence Day
166,chrisbrown6453,"Independence Day is big, it is loud and it is long.",7,15 May 2002,"INDEPENDENCE DAY is also instantly forgettable, yet another disposable summer movie with little staying power. It gets off to a relatively engaging start, and the alien destruction of various US landmarks is fun to see. Too bad the rest is merely mechanical without the necessary human interest to keep us involved. Hostile aliens traveling in city-sized spaceships have entered our atmosphere and have made rubble of New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Houston, etc. If they keep this up, Clovis will be the largest American city left standing. Scientists must figure out a way to penetrate the spaceships' invisible shields before the entire planet is leveled and civilization destroyed. Not much has changed since the 1950s when planet Earth had to battle unfriendly visitors in INVADERS FROM MARS and WAR OF THE WORLDS. The special effects are, for the most part, more impressive, though some still look a tad cheesy. Jeff Goldblum seems stuck in his JURASSIC PARK mode, but generates a few laughs as a jittery scientist. Judd Hirsch, who is terribly miscast, is most annoying as Jeff's fretting father. Likable Bill Pullman is very sketchy as the US president, and Will Smith (at the time this movie is made) is far too lightweight to register as a he-man action hero. The finale with peoples around the world celebrating the US victory over the aliens is only slightly less jingoistic than NBC's coverage of the Olympic Games.",Independence Day
167,bat-5,Highly entertaining!,8,3 July 1999,"ID4 is one fun movie to watch.  Impressive special effects help propel the plot and those ships are something!  Part of the fun is watching Will Smith. He brings a touch of bravado that makes you laugh and root for him.  Jeff Goldblum seems to have a knack for playing smarter than average guys, and he makes them falliable.  Bll Pullman puts in a good performance as the president who has to deal with an invasion from outer space.  Highly patriotic with an American slant, considering it was directed by a German and the stirring music was composed by an Englishman.",Independence Day
168,DavidSim240183,Hollywood entertainment of the driest kind,4,7 October 2008,"Independence Day was the runaway hit of its year. It propelled Roland Emmerich to the A-list, made a star out of Will Smith, and provided audiences with some of the most extravagant special effects and action sequences not seen since Jurassic Park.But for all that, Independence Day typifies everything wrong with Hollywood blockbusters. Spectacle comes first. At the expense of everything else. When it comes to this type of gratuitous bludgeoning, Roland Emmerich is a particularly guilty offender. He has a list of empty-headed, special effects action bonanzas on his CV, with patriotic flag-waving to back it up. And Independence Day is the one film on Emmerich's resume where these faults are at they're most extreme.Its the worst kind of Hollywood entertainment. Everything about it is designed to be a crowd-pleaser. It pushes the right buttons at all the right moments. Plenty of eye-popping effects. Mind-blowing stunts. An all star cast. And its meant to appeal to the American heartland. The last time I saw a film that embodied such patriotic rabble-rousing was the equally perverse Top Gun.Naturally for a film so commercially calculated, ID4 was an inevitable success. But I was left underwhelmed by the whole thing. Alien invasion films have been done much better before and since. Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds was much more respectful because I cared for the people in it. But as with everything else Roland Emmerich gets his hands on, he can't resist filling out the film with stock characters and easy clichés.Bill Pullman is the gung-ho All-American President. Jeff Goldblum the eccentric scientist who stumbles onto the truth that nobody listens to. Will Smith is the wisecracking fighter pilot. As well as the straight arrow US military types who believe the best defence is a good offence. And small-minded bureaucrats and techno-nerds this type of film can't seem to live without.Independence Day seems a conscious ripoff of every SF film ever made. From The War of the Worlds to The Day The Earth Stood Still (shown on TV at one point). Even the climax seems modelled on the assault on the Death Star at the end of Star Wars. There's also a dash of X-Files style paranoia added to the mix with the whole inclusion of Area 51. The aliens recovered in Roswell are the same aliens invading the Earth. The one amusing spark of originality in the entire movie.The film uses the days leading up to the 4th of July as a device to frame the invasion in. Starting with they're arrival. The attacks. And a last ditch counterstrike. The gigantic spaceships and they're massive attacks turned out to be the selling-point of the entire film. (Add to that a rigorous marketing campaign). And while there is a certain amount of fun to be had watching national monuments and The White House get blown to pieces, there does seem something a little flat about the special effects sequences.When we got our first glimpse of an alien spaceship in Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the result was awe-inspiring. Like something transcendent and immense had touched down on Earth. But the ships in Independence Day are curiously unremarkable. They only impress by the sheer vastness of they're scale. They may have Grand Canyon-sized interiors, but they lack any of the elegance and mysterious beauty Spielberg conjured up in Close Encounters. They never really connect with their audience.And then there are the aliens themselves. I wish Roland Emmerich had come up with something a little more original than octopus people. Its disappointing when you take into account the alien creatures 20th Century Fox have produced in the past. The Alien and the Predator were genuinely otherworldly. They truly felt like creatures one had never imagined before, much less seen.Another problem I have with ID4 is its patriotic flag-waving. Roland Emmerich, although German, shows a peculiar reverence for his adopted country in his films. This one displays it more than any other. We get majestic closeups of the Statue of Liberty, the Lincoln Memorial, the American flag. And despite the fact its a worldwide invasion, not once do we see how the rest of the world is affected. Just the American side. Bill Pullman's stirring speech has become the stuff of legend. It practically drowns in its own sentimentality. And he personally leads the troops into battle. George Bush Jr didn't follow his example when he waged war on Iraq.The cast are quite a mixed bag of ethnic diversities. Will Smith rises above it all, and although not as funny as he would be in his next alien invader film Men in Black, his effortless charm is a winner all the way. Jeff Goldblum basically plays the same flaky scientist sort he's been typecast in ever since The Fly. And beyond Bill Pullman's all-American president, there isn't much more to learn about him.There are some interesting faces found in the supporting cast. Brent Spiner (Data!) amuses as the (mad) scientist in charge of Area 51. All the more when you realise who's behind those thick glasses and grey hair. So does Randy Quaid as the whacked out crop-duster kidnapped by aliens some years back. Judd Hirsch is warm and engaging as Goldblum's father. They're scenes together are quite believable. Also look out for Adam Baldwin, six years before he played wild-card Jayne in the muchly missed Firefly. His lantern-jawed US Major is a rather witty reversal.I'm not sure I believed the way the aliens are dispatched. Its just too convenient. And ID4 has an improbably happy ending. It does have the occasional nice idea, like Area 51 used as the base to strike back against the aliens, but I find Independence Day much too unpalatable. Too caught up in its own patriotism and spectacularity, the dramatics of the story end up swamped by it.",Independence Day
169,Cinemaniac1984,Happy 25th anniversary to Independence Day. Still a fun movie.,8,3 July 2021,"Happy 25th anniversary to the science fiction action blockbuster Independence Day which was released on this day in 1996.Independence Day was great fun when I first saw it and it's still great fun now. Independence Day would be the biggest box office hit of 1996 with its spectacular action and incredible visual effects. Director Ronald Emmerich (Universal Soldier, Stargate) will always be remembered for this classic movie headlined by Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman.Spaceships arrive from outer space commanded by extraterrestrial aliens and incinerate New York, Los Angeles and Washington D. C. with a single laser beam causing a massive explosion leaving behind mass casualties and a path of destruction.Amongst the survivors, satellite technician David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) tries to warn everyone of the impending spaceship attack however when that fails, he works on a way to penetrate the force fields protecting the spacecraft. U. S. President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) is left to deal with the massive destruction and threat to wipeout mankind as well as finding a way to defeat the hostile extraterrestrials. President Whitmore rallies the military to fight back against the alien invasion. Fighter pilot Captain Steve Hillard (Will Smith) leads a failed attack against the large saucer and manages to successfully escape after the rest of his squadron is wiped out. Though the weaponry on his fighter jet is ineffective, he does successfully cause a enemy fighter to crash land and thus secure one of the aliens to take to Area 51 for further research.Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman are entertaining in their own respective roles as the heroic fighter pilot, the nerdy technician, and the U. S. President. Director Ronald Emmerich turns the action and visual effects up full throttle and the bigger the better. You can either like the plot or you can hate it, but there's no denying that the movie is pure entertainment.I was disappointed that I missed out on watching Independence Day at the cinema, however I was very lucky to reserve a copy at my local video store the weekend the movie was released on VHS. I used to like this movie a lot in my early teens and it was my favourite movie for a while, though not so much now. Though I haven't seen the movie in several years, it's still a fun movie. Independence Day is vintage blockbusting entertainment 25 years on.8/10.",Independence Day

The only movie about aliens invading during the fourth of July weekend, just kidding. One of the best alien invasion movies ever. Not a buried treasure, this movie is almost as big as Titanic. There's this speech near the end by the President, best damn inspirational speech I ever heard. Made me feel like jumping into a plane and kicking ass with him. Let's talk about the effects for a moment. The CGI was perfect, it looked like there was a giant alien ship menacing Los Angeles and when it fired, it looked like they really destroyed the White House. The aliens were creepy and scary looking design, the most unique monsters I've seen for a long time. A classic science fiction that goes up there with the fifties WAR OF THE WORLDS. I give it...10 STARS!",Independence Day

I loved it the second I first saw it, and my appreciation for it has not dropped at all in 8 years. I don't understand why people rate this movie so low, it deserves much higher than 6.3 (2/25/08). I know what the most common thought on why this movie is rated so low is: ""Why is America the only country taking any action?"" Well, to answer that stupid question, it isn't. If you weren't so busy criticizing this movie you'd notice that other countries have taken the same affirmative action that America has. ""Why didn't other countries go into space?"" Because America was the only country to have an alien ship in full tact on their soil, duh. And no, they weren't going to wait until astronauts came form other countries to fly the thing, if you listened, the general said ""36 hours until world destruction"", so why waste time? The characters in this movie were great, the storyline was also. The effects were excellent. This movie is a classic, and should be watched more rather than criticized for stupid reasons. 10/10",Independence Day
172,charchuk,A pure summer blockbuster,7,7 April 2007,"Big, dumb fun. Everything up to the attack is nearly perfect, save for some rather inane subplots. The suspense and gradual horror is terrific. Some of it is kinda silly, but it doesn't ruin the film. Unfortunately, almost everything after the attack is even sillier, and really ruins the film. The inane subplots from the first half are widened to become the bulk of the film in the second half, and logic and reason are more and more done away with. By the end, it's become hopelessly jingoistic and patriotic, and far too cheesy. The cast is pretty good, with some great chemistry between Smith and Goldblum, and the special effects are still stunning today, which make up for the failings of the plot.

Yes it's incredibly stupid with the whole computer virus thing. Yes it stretches the suspension of disbelieve way, way too far. And yes it isn't the most well written movie in the world.But the special effects are fantastic, with a nice mix of practical and CGI so that everyone is happy. The acting is actually pretty good for the most part. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum bring likablity to their characters. Speaking of characters, all of them are likable and get a good amount of screen time so we care about them. This is a big film, with a huge ensemble cast and many plot lines that all come together, and I love stuff like that.The film never takes itself too seriously, having a patriotic theme that's so cheesy but awesome at the same time.

These two are independent and so a movie can be a mix of any degree of each.[1] did ID entertain? You bet. 10/10. [2] is it a good story? No way. 4/10.So I gave it a 7 for the average. This may turn out to be a good way to judge a movie. Afterall 7/10 is not a bad score. It says the movie is worth a watch, but at home, rented, or on commercial TV.ID was very entertaining... just leave your intellect at the door and have a ripping good time. If you don't you're going to have a lousy time and what's the use in that... and besides, don't we all like to be entertained?-ZafoidBTW, if the movie didn't entertain, and say received a score of 4/10, then the average would be 4 which would say that the movie is a total waste of time. On the flip side if it was also a good story and received a 10/10 for the story as well, then the average would be 10 making the movie a keeper!I like my new system. I realized it after reading several other comments, some quite vitriolic and some focusing on the fun they had just watching it.

There's nothing wrong with this film that a little suspension of disbelief wouldn't solve. Of course it's largely predictable, yes it's lays on sentimentality like a trowel, so what?

179,Med-Jasta,My long relationship with ID4,8,8 July 2021,"I loved this when it first came out. Then as I got older I realized it was cheesy and hated it. Then in my 30s I watched it again and liked it a lot. I was surprised. Let me break down the evolution of my relationship with this movie. As I'm sure this may be a similar story for some of you.I was 10 when this came out. I was more hyped Than anyone could be. I even tried to go to the sneak preview but didn't realize how packed those were and couldn't get it. I saw the movie, loved it and saw it 3 more times. I had the toys, got it on VHS and loved it. I think this is the first movie that I walked out of and thought that I had just seen something life changing and that my life would never be the same again. Of course that's how movies feel at that age.Then a few years later in my teens when I watched it I saw the cheese that I never before noticed. I felt betrayed. How could something so dear to me have been so bad that I didn't notice? I knew then that I was growing up and was developing taste. Star Wars and Indiana Jones weren't cheesy. ID4 sucked then. I laughed at it from then on. I would only watch it to make fun of it.This year, at 35 my wife wanted to watch it on the 4th. I agreed with the stipulation that I could make fun of it. For some reason the movie was much different this time and felt more like it did in the 90s. The cheese was still there but it was small enough and didn't effect the story. And the stuff that's good is really good. And I really appreciated that stuff more. Maybe because they don't make these kinds of movies anymore (good) is what made it stand out. But I found myself enjoying ID4 and it felt good. This movie that defined at least a summer. This was before the Star Wars prequels so this could dominate my prepubescent mind.Many movies that I grew up on I went back to and they were better than when I was a kid. Like Jaws, Alien, Jurassic Park, T2, Star Wars... All the classics. Because they have more to offer than your little brain can pick up on. And they are a superior level of movie making that you need to know movies to get and be grown up. ID4 doesn't really have that. But it's well done and very effective. It doesn't belong with those movies but it's still good. It's still A level movie making. It just doesn't have the subtext that so many movies had that I went back on. And for a while this was a ding against it. Then I leaned to accept that movies can just be really well done and they don't have themes questioning humanity or something.I think being more mature now I can look at the flaws and ignore them or even laugh at them and keep enjoying the good parts. The cheese is there, there's no doubt about that. But it just didn't feel like it dominated the movie. I guess I could enjoy this not as a perfect movie but as a fun one that's well done. Because the core of it is really good, it's just a few little sparkles on top that aren't. I already have to look past the dumb jokes in The Dark Knight so why not this? It feels good to like ID4 again.",Independence Day

And it is exactly that. Director Roland Emmerich creates a film that is good sci-fi and action, while not trying to take itself too seriously. The cast is excellent, with Will Smith and Jeff Goldbum standing out, and Randy Quaid playing an off the wall character as only he can. With the same attention to detail as he used in Stargate Emmerich gives us a film that will long be remembered for it's scope if nothing else. Underlying the film however is a disturbing trend that needs to be addressed. In the early days of the cold war, when McCarthyism was rife in our country, most sci-fi movies were about alien invasion. Then through the sixties to the eighties we had a period when aliens were benign as we looked for a better world. But as we entered the turbulent nineties and into the new century where conflict and violence is again pressing our sci-fi movies have once more started turning to alien invasions.

I go to a movie to be entertained, not to pick apart like a Rotisserie chicken. That's my two cents. And even if the dialogue isn't the best, it's still interesting.

The best way to destroy a city is to point your alien death ray at the most recognisable landmark in the city (rather than at the centre of the city).With references to Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/4 Century and Bill Cosby, I don't think the movie makers were ever trying to make a serious movie.Aliens are attacking the earth. Of course the Americans will save the day.The movie is a lot of fun, with good special effects and a script that requires a great deal of suspension of disbelief. The marketing try to make this movie into the next Star Wars (more like an episode of BattleStar Gallatica on steroids, speed and acid).Here is the core spoiler. The aliens are defeated by a computer virus written on an apple laptop which can overcome their own computer system. Many people say this is impossible. However think about it, the aliens have a single cohesive society (like bees or ants) so they have no computer hackers. Their computer system lacks and security. So maybe a virus would be easy to create to destroy their computer system. Humans only can do this because they were lucky to get one of their spaceships.Anyway check out of the ""Things I did not know until I saw ID4"" and other related listed on the Internet and enjoy this rather silly movie with a sense of fun and adventure.",Independence Day
185,cosmic_quest,Clichéd but in a fun way,8,21 October 2007,"I have to admit that, as far as Hollywood blockbusters go, 'Independence Day' has always been a favourite. The film starts on July 2nd, when the planet is thrown into chaos when number of alien starships enter the atmosphere and settle into orbit over various key cities worldwide before launching a devastating attack. Survivors-- including the American President and his staff, an Air Force pilot and his girlfriend, a drunk and his three kids and the cable repair man/genius who first discovered the aliens' intent-- congregated at a secret facility at Area 51 then on July 4th, they launch their counterattack.The characters were stereotypical but the actors, including Bill Pullman, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch and Robert Loggia, all gave decent performances despite the cheesy dialogue they were sometimes lumbered with. Even then, the 'good' characters were all likable enough and you wanted to see the good guys strive through and win (unlike Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' where I wished someone would just dish the main characters up to the aliens) while the token difficult, arrogant politician played for 'boos' with good effect.In terms of the storyline, it was predictable and, at times, sugary but it was fun! It has everything from action to romance to humour to drama and even handled death with some degree of poignancy, and all this before the standard geeky character saves the world using the 1996 version of HG Wells' virus idea. The special effects used for destruction of the cities were impressive, even eleven years on, as was those used to depict the combat between the American planes and the aliens. It was quite breathtaking when I saw it in the cinema back in '96.The main complaint about 'Independence Day' seems to be over the depiction of Americans saving the world. As a Briton myself, I do find the idea that every other country would sit back and expect America to save us a tad idiotic, not to mention I like to think the majority of mature Americans don't need to be spoon-fed patriotism, but you can't expect deep thought from a blockbuster. And the President's nauseating Independence Day speech was good for a laugh.Overall, this is a fun film that was the first to update the whole 'disaster' flick genre. Don't nitpick but just kick back and enjoy.",Independence Day
186,ExpendableMan,Look at the size of that thing,7,2 September 2007,"Independence Day is the sort of film that's best appreciated on a big screen, preferably a massive great plasma television that is so huge you had to cut the roof off your house and get airlifted in by helicopters just to get it in the living room. You should also have the most state of the art surround sound possible, with bass pickups so deep they cause earthquakes on the Eastern seaboard. Not because Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's alien invasion flick is a masterpiece of cinematic art or anything, but because it's loud. Very loud. And if the windows in your house don't shatter when the spaceship flies over New York then well, you're just not experiencing it properly.Taking the 1950's invasion narratives and pro-tooling them for 90's audiences, Independence Day is an absolute blast of visual flare and gung ho heroism. The plot is so straightforward as to be superfluous (aliens invade, fights ensue) but even so, it remains an invigorating watch purely because of the spectacle it provides. Back in 1996, the sight of that giant blue laser tearing apart lower Manhattan made jaws drop and while it's unlikely to do the same to today's overstimulated audiences, it's still an incredible visual feast. What's more, the ensemble cast makes it surprisingly unpredictable - we all know that the aliens will be defeated at the end, but what isn't so obvious is which characters are going to be alive to see it. Except for the kid and the dog. They're relatively safe bets.Watching it now though, it does possess a cheerful naivety in the face of world politics. After all, this was 1996, the Cold War was over and 9/11 a long way off, so the entire world uniting against a common foe without being bogged down with petty arguments and personal agendas still seemed believable. Hell, even the gun-toting Arabs that briefly appear on screen are more than happy to rally behind Uncle Sam in the name of freedom. That's right folks, it's an Americans Save The World movie, complete with a snapshot of British officers drinking tea in the desert and waiting for those silly yanks to get a bally move on and show us what to do.Needless to say, this is blockbuster entertainment through and through. The aliens are apparently here to strip mine the planet of all her natural resources, but they're quite happy to put that off for a bit in order to blow things up for the entire running time. Fans of in-depth characterisation, intelligent story telling and emotional engagement with the protagonists are wasting their time, but if you want to watch tourist attractions, jet planes and space craft exploding for three hours, you can't really go wrong. That business about a computer virus bringing down the mother-ship is a bit daft though, not once did they try switching everything on and off again.",Independence Day

By chance, i enjoyed the DVD special edition and seeing the uncut version.Something that would like to comment is the wire which hooked to the actors.

It's a great film with a great cast and a lot of different angles from different families that all come in to one heart warming fight to save the world.",Independence Day
189,stormhawk2021,In the name of the Mankind,10,4 January 2018,"One of the most criticized movies that I remember, and for a large sector that far from seeing its true pretensions, which are none other than those of a pure and carefree entertainment judge for their patriotic messages. They can not argue otherwise than the worn and boring speech ""Americanized"", the same ones who do not mind that concept when they come out of films like ""Save Private Ryan"", ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and many others that according to the director the same message seems to be forgotten, when dealing with more serious issues should be more objective.
In any case Roland Emmerich, he goes through the lining (fortunately) the opinion of critics and is limited to perform the kind of show that he would like to see in a movie theater. For ""Independence Day"", he does not hesitate to take references such as ""The War of the Worlds"" or ""Star Wars"" as well as the cinema of catastrophes of the 70's, recycling what was the day of its premiere a spectacular production with extraordinary visual effects, which combine exemplary models and digitalisations with a result of reference. The story is not new, but if it is, the dialogues are not Shakespeare's, but who cares? when it comes to spending two hours of pure action in which there is hardly room for absurd ramblings. It is therefore an easy target for those who believe themselves to be scholars and try to make those who enjoy this type of products complacent, who at least have a clear objective, to collect and entertain. I certainly had a great time and fully enjoyed this excellent science fiction film, to ""Hamlet"" we will leave for another day.",Independence Day
190,Gubby-Allen,Brilliant,9,10 December 2001,"Great film.If we are to continue to get, what many term 'Hollywood movies', either make them completely realistic, without any innacuracies, or go to the other extreme and make them unrealistic. Namely, go the whole hog, like this, and quite often, like this, it is brilliant.Don't pussy foot around like Forrest Gump & Sixth Sense do, where half the time you feel you're watching something genuine whilst the other half it's a complete farce.Yes there's errors & much of this would never occur in real life, but films like this are to entertain the public, which it does. I'd rather have films where one or two scientific facts are ignored, than actual & entire historical occurences being manipulated or reconstructed as you get in crap like Braveheart, The Patriot & even dare I say it #3 Schindlers List.I dislike an awful lot about America, as I often remark, but realistically if this film concentrated on every country involved in a worldwide battle it would've lasted about 3 days.People also read too much into the plots of these sort of films. Armageddon and even Tomb Raider the plots are completely incidental. There's basically a lot of fighting, bombing or some sort of action going on, normally to save the world from a villain, darkness, aliens etc & whether it's finding the other half of a coin, blowing up a meteor or anything else I couldn't care less. I never feel a part of the film as we all know how it will end & don't really have any interest in how it comes to that as long as there's some good action.But this was far better than any of that. It was really easy to feel a part. You could also let your mind wander & visualise what it would be like to be caught up in that sort of thing. The speech by the president was moving, so was the bloke giving his life, especially given recent incidents in the US.One reviewer complained of there not being enough emphasis on developing characters, but really who cares? Two hours later once the film has ended, it doesn't matter. This was principally a battle by soldiers & scientists to save the world, nothing more, so why spend time finding out what Jeff Goldblum's character was really like away from work?Of course we'll never see the day a President or leader fights at the front of a battle, but just imagine WE were that leader. I bet we'd all like to think we'd be different & would get involved. So, we can at least hope it may one day happen.9/10",Independence Day
191,basrutten,Enough plot holes to fit a 550 mile spaceship in,5,16 January 2002,"I actually liked the first part of this movie ! The scenes in which large parts of US cities are destroyed are great to watch. Unfortunately, that's the only good thing about this movie. The rest is VERY bad.Let's make a list: first of all, it's got Will Smith in it, which is by itself almost enough reason to give it a rating of 1/10. Secondly, this movie has every tired cliche ever found in any action movie: little cute kids, guy that sacrifices himself, best friend that dies, romances that rekindle, creepy CIA agent. I mean, come on, can't they think of anything more original.Also, this movie has more plot holes then a piece of swiss cheese. For example: since when can you knock out a huge spacecraft with a computer virus written on a totally different computer. 90% of Earth's computers aren't even compatible, the probability of an Earth program running on an alien computer is ZERO. Secondly, all the alien spacecraft are apparently destroyed because someone flies into their main weapon beam at EXACTLY the right time. I could go on like this, but the basic idea is that it's TOTALLY LUDICROUS that a bunch of nit-wits use a couple of fighter jets and one UFO to take out a vast army of highly superior aliens. Finally, to top it all off, it's again the Americans and only the Americans that save the entire earth. Yet another movie filled with over-the-top patriotism and false emotions.* out of **** stars",Independence Day
192,fjhuerta-2,A good way to spend a Sunday evening.,8,14 July 2000,"*Warning: Potential spoilers ahead*What about ID4, you say? Well, I think it doesn't deserve the 6 it has averaged at imdb.com. More like an 8. True, it has plot holes the size of New York's own potholes, and no one in his 5 senses would believe Bill Pullman could be President of the United States... or that a virus could be implanted on an alien mothership... and using a Macintosh?!?!?Then again, this movie should be looked at face value: no one said it was factual, possible or even close to reality. It is science fiction, pure and simple. And it excels at that.The movie is amazingly good at making people have a good time. It's simply a movie about good and bad guys, about America and their (or yours, given the case) patriotic feelings. Nothing more than that was implied in the trailer, in the posters or in the advertisment. And it works! The stunning images of the Empire State Building exploding were simply awesome. The CGI planes and alien ships had some terrific battles, similar in concept (although not in the final product) to the trench battle scenes in Star Wars (the real one, not the Fandom Menace). There were enough explosions to satisfy any action flick fan (although my neighbors might think they would have liked the movie more had I turned down a notch -or two- my subwoofer's amp). It's entertainment, and it's very good one. Just don't look for common sense or reality around here. That was not the initial premise. I loved this picture, and I drool over the DVD special edition. You really have to see the original theatrical ending. It would have been a good one.I cannot rate this movie less than an 8, just because I have seen it so many times and it has never failed to entertain.",Independence Day

The action is great and the plot is good. Alot of action, good paced film with an American flag in almost every shot, surely it'll maintain its cult classic status for many many more years.

Merging this with a string of bare bone vignettes of people, brought together by a cataclysmic event. That being, large UFO hovering over cities of the planet.
The sequence of events revolves around the plot that the UFO's arrive, the military sends up a ""Welcome Wagon"" and it gets zapped. All Hades breaks loose. From there, it's the humans versus the homicidally-inclined side of ET's family. The humor is tongue in cheek, and although not void of a lot of end-of-the-world cliches, it's still a lot of fun. As an extra bonus, the soundtrack is great. Randy Quaid is terrific. This movie, like a nuclear blast, will send you out glowing. Recommended.",Independence Day
195,general-melchett,"Incredible visuals, brilliant action - Independence Day delivers!",8,22 October 2007,"Independence Day is really just patriotic drivel in means of plot and adventure. But the film comes into its best moments when the action sequences hit the screen. Buildings explode and men die in beautifully choreographed fashions that raise the bar for many modern action films today.The film is predictable, and none of the characters are particularly memorable - you aren't really bothered whether they live or die. The plot is so much like War of the Worlds, with more sky battles and aliens, that you may feel that it is just another remake under the same title.But Roland Emmerich (the director) deserves to be called the undisputed king of action movies - he beautifully directs his films, and the special effects and sound in his films are truly stunning. This was his biggest success, and deservedly so - though The Day after Tomorrow was just as spiffing.The script ain't strong and the plot ain't great, but this is an action-epic film, and on that scale, Independence Day delivers. It is an extremely memorable experience, and beats action flicks that are being made ten years on. A stunning job that deserves to be called a huge success (in the box office, of course). Great! 8/10",Independence Day
196,joemamaohio,My Review,10,19 September 2008,"On Independence Day, alien spacecrafts have appeared all over the world. No one knows why they're here, or what their purpose is...they're just hanging out in the air. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) discovers the truth...the aliens are planning one major attack on the entire Earth at once. Unfortunately, no one believes him except for his father (Judd Hirsch). David makes his way to Washington, where his estranged wife (Margaret Colin) works for the President (Bill Pullman). Meanwhile, Captain Steven Miller (Will Smith) is having problems with his commonlaw girlfriend, Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) and her choice of work. She has a son from a previous relationship, and Steven acts like the boy's own father. He gets called to service to see what is going on with these alien ships. David is able to reach the President literally minutes before the attack commences. Soon all the major world cities are attacked at once, and it seems like the Earth is doomed.By far this is one of the best alien movies to come around in recent memory. The acting is excellent, the effects are amazing (especially for coming out in 1996), and the action is palpable. ""Independence Day"" is everything a true moviegoer seeks to find, and delivers.",Independence Day

198,robsta23,"A Great ""Popcorn"" Movie",8,27 February 2015,"Most seem to say this is a terrible film, but I just find it so damn exciting! It doesn't exactly lack content, but I admit some of its content is over-the-top at times.We are flooded with iconography of American culture at the opening of the film, such as a plaque we left behind on the moon saying that we ""came in peace"" with the original mission. Then, after a shadow passing over the moon, foreshadowing danger, we see many icons such as the statue of liberty, the Iwo Jima Flag monument and the Washington monument. We are shown America as a striving world power throughout the film.While the film touches on unity from people of different status/ethnicity/gender, it mainly does this with American characters. Other nationalities are conveyed as the U.S. sends them information on how to defeat the aliens through Morse code. This is a little disappointing from a film that is about unity between nations to fight a danger from another world.What bothers me is that we are given the aliens' motivation rather abruptly through the fictional President portrayed by Bill Pullman who just happens to ""see"" their intent, and the intent is somewhat stupid coming from an ""intelligent"" species.What this movie lacks in intellect (which isn't as much as harsh critics say it lacks) is entertainment and excitement, and while films are meant to make us think and portray a good story, they are also about entertaining audiences; after all, movies are money- makers. When watching this film we were bursting out laughing at certain points in the film, and rightfully so. ""Welcome to Earth"" is such a great line no matter how campy it seems.This is a better movie than people may say, and although it is more about the spectacle it is much better than most Michael Bay films.",Independence Day
199,freaky_dave,Good Special Effects and humor equals a fun movie,8,5 July 2006,"This is perhaps Roland Emmerich's best film to date. It's not a great film, but it was fun to watch and had me feeling a little patriotic after seeing it on Independence Day of 1996.Like The Day After Tomorrow, another Emmerich film, Independence Day draws a good line between popcorn fun and quirky enough characters that kept me smiling. If I had to compare the two though, Independence Day would fall on top. It is also Roland Emmerich's best film so far.Aliens from another planet are bent on taking over our world with huge ships that block out the sunlight. Using smaller one manned ships, they decide to do battle with our air force. We use atomic bombs as well, and neither one has any real effect on the monstrous ships that loom over major cities to lay waist to everything. All hope seems lost until a simple Cable technician (Jeff Goldblum) finds a way to make the fight more fair for mankind. With help from a cocky air force pilot (Will Smith in one of his better and more famous roles) the two set out to attack the alien mother ship with a computer virus. Will it work? Well if you haven't seen the movie you'll have to.Independence Day was a phenomenal success. It helped make Will Smith a superstar and paved the way to become the biggest blockbuster of 1996. It was one of those movies you couldn't help but enjoy no matter how flawed it may have been. Like many other summer films, Independence Day was pure popcorn entertainment. I enjoyed it a lot.",Independence Day
200,kingofdanerds,Boy is this film entertaining!!!,9,8 September 2020,"Independence Day was released in 1996 and was a box office smash hit. It managed to be the year´s highest grossing film! But reviews for the film at time of release the film had mixed reviews but since release has gotten more positive reviews. The film had a $75 million budget and made over 10 times the amount back. The film had a fantastic trailer which is probably why so many people watched this film. The film was directed by Roland Emmerich who beforehand did Stargate and would later do the sequel to Independence Day, the critcially panned Godzilla 1998, and other disaster films like The Day After Tomorrow. This film is often criticized for being unoriginal, sterotypical characters, but has been praised for special effects but I have a few things to say about that.The plot follows aliens coming to invade Earth. There are spaceships everywhere. Los Angeles, Washington DC, and New York just to name a few. The aliens destroy the major cities and it is up to a group of survivors to prevent a bigger attack.Most of the negative feedback from this film surrounds the ¨sterotype"" characters. I would have to agree with this. You have the redneck sterotype, the Jewish sterotype, the hero sterotype. But I do not consider this to be a bad thing to be honest. I think it adds to the entertainment value of this film. I quite actually enjoy every single character in this film. Likeable, memorable, but definitely not the best written characters of all time. The acting is fairly solid too. Will Smith does an amazing job in this film and is often cited as the best actor in this film but lets not forget Jeff Goldblum who gives a Goldblum performance. I couldn´t ask for more. Randy Quaid is not the best actor but he manages to give a memorable performance to a memorable character. Bill Pullman does a good job as the President. In all, when a character dies, I geniunely feel sad. Yes, the story is not the most original but it was the first time we got a movie like this on such a huge budget and has paved the way for films of similar nature. The effects are hit and miss for me. The minature effects are done pretty well but anything involving the use of CG is a huge miss but that is coming from someone who watched this film years after its release. So, the effects have not aged really well. The musical score in this film manages to be one of my favorites of all time along with other films like The Terminator and Star Wars. I have seen some complaints about the length of this film and how about 30 minutes could have been cut from the film and I DISAGREE. Sure the film is almost two and a half hours but this film is so entertaining that I don´t care about the run time (I should note that I did watch the Special Edition which includes 9 minutes of extra footage). I love the setup of the film how it goes from normal life, to the invasion, to the destruction, to the big battle. The whole tone of this film envokes fear that maybe the humans will not be successful. The President´s speech, while sterotypical and silly, does give me hope for the human race.While this whole film can be deemed as silly, and let's be honest this film can get silly, this film is entertaining as hell! Fun characters, fun setup, this film is just a fun film to watch. It is truly something to admire about this film.",Independence Day
201,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: Super Disaster Fun!!,8,23 February 2014,"Independence Day. Roland Emmerich (The Day After Tomorrow, 2012) just loves the idea of extinction of humanity so he keeps on showing us different ways of having it happened. Here, one alien race threatens the earth at their face to kill all humans in one shot. The movie works big time because it enjoys this idea to the core and then finding the solution in more enjoyable manner. The characters of the American President played by subtle Bill Pullman leading humans from the front, the smart scientist played by charming Jeff Goldblum finding the unbelievable crazy solution and terrific fearless military man played by unmatched Will Smith put up a great show of heroism and courage apart from the amazing special effects done all the way from start to finish. You just feel amazed watching the whole New York going ashes, Will Smith's plane being followed by the alien one and the priceless visual of huge spaceship almost covering the whole city. In one line, if you have purchased a state of the art home theater system with one big projector screen then this movie should be the first one to enjoy.",Independence Day
202,faraaj-1,One of the better high-concept movies..,8,11 November 2006,"As a rule, I don't like high-concept movies. However, Independence Day is one of the few with some merits. It is also the best film to-date by German sci-fi/action director Roland Emmerich. The greatest flaw of Indepence Day (aka ID4 due to initial copyright problems with the Independence Day title) is the excessive jingoism. Completely America centric, it seems that the rest of human civilization is helpless without the Yanks. The American President is not just the only world leader fighting for a free world, he even moonlights as a fighter pilot attacking the aliens.However, its still a damn entertaining film. There is a large ensemble cast of good actors, some in career best roles. Will Smith was really launched as a movie star by this film and he has some very funny lines. Jeff Goldblum actually looks nerdy-cool as a scientist who likes to play chess in the park. And Bill Pullman is the clean-cut American President who proclaims that July 4 will no longer be an American holiday, but a world holiday! The rest of the ensemble cast includes small but meaty roles for Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid and Vivica Fox. Harry Connick Jr. has a small part but blows it completely.The things that make ID4 watching is that something is always going on. There are plenty of one-liners and the one-dimensional character all have their peculiar personality traits and quirks. The action scenes are impressive and in fact this film has the largest number of miniatures ever built. That record will probably never be broken because digital technology is limiting the use of miniatures. If you can let your hair loose and just want to enjoy a light movie without letting the America is Great propaganda get to you, ID4 is for you.",Independence Day
203,BadWebDiver,Storytelling par excellence,10,22 March 2002,"I STILL rank this as top-grade storytelling. In fact I think this is one of the few films I've seen where practically all the main characters (including the females) sound like a group of top-class well-trained professionals trying to work out a complex (if admittedly unusual) situation without all instantly jumping to the stock drama textbook conclusion.In case you haven't heard how the idea came about, the story goes that Roland Emmerich was giving a press conference in Europe for his film STARGATE when a reporter asked if he believed in UFOs. He said he didn't, but went on to say that if a whole heap of spaceships appeared over Earth's cities, it would cause a lot of people to really sit up and think. Thus the idea for the story was born.One of the things that attracts me to this movie is the little details that give the story a personality. One of my favorites is the newscaster who says ""LA residents are warned not to fire their guns at the spaceship, as it may cause an interstellar incident"". It shows personality, sounds authentic, and is very ironic considering what happens afterward. And how many standard sci-fi films would have their characters accidentally back the spacecraft up while trying to take off? It's story moments like that which make the difference between a good movie and a great one. Most of the more critically-acclaimed and lower budget films don't have stuff like that (they usually can't afford to). This is when the characters sound like they give a hoot, and not like they're just brainlessly following the script. (Yes, alright; I know they REALLY are, but at least they don't sound like it!)I think it's what attracted a lot of viewers to the movie and decided to reject the critics' overwhelming advice; which hadn't happened for quite awhile when this movie was released (and the critics are still resentful of that). I can remember on a current affairs TV show when a critic unusually came on and said; ""This is the worst movie ever made! No-one should ever watch it!"" (And the critics accuse the general public of being simplistic and unsophisticated?!?)Still, I guess that sums up the eternal dilemma. Most film critics go to a movie to see how the film-maker presents themes and how well they live up to the abstract drama theory; whereas most members of the general public go to a movie to watch an entertaining story!",Independence Day

205,ryan_kuhn,Will Smith vs. The Aliens,5,13 February 2005,"The Will Smith reign of terror, errr, i mean reign at the 4th of July Weekend box office began with this modest little movie, Independence Day. One of the most expensive, yet financially successful movies of all time, Independence Day proves that you can remake a movie without anyone knowing it. In case you have not heard of it, the movie War of the Worlds from the 1950s is the inspiration of this aliens-will-take-over-the-world story, whether anyone knew it or not. Will Smith plays a Captain in some branch of the military, I want to say Air Force, but it's not really important, Jeff Goldblum is a cable TV repair man who is the only one in the world to crack the alien code (a fact that is not lost on his father, played by Judd Hersch), Bill Pulman plays the president who was elected president because of his heroism in the Gulf War, and Randy Quaid plays an alcoholic crop duster who claims he as abducted by aliens, possibly to find out what makes the Quaids just so talented. The movie follows a simple formula, aliens invade, great looking special effects show Los Angeles, Washington, and of course New York get blow'd up real good, then humanity comes together to find a way to blow the aliens up real good. The special effects are first rate, the acting is solid, but the ending is really silly and is perhaps the most direct homage or rip-off of The War of the Worlds. The most clever part of the movie is the use of Area 51, which I thought was original and could have been the start to a good sci-fi movie, but instead was just a gimmick to the rest of the formula. This is a solid popcorn movie, people will enjoy it, but let's not start looking for awards for Independence Day.",Independence Day

207,Calaboss,What's with all the anti-American comments?,6,16 April 2005,"I started reading the comments for this movie and was taken by how many people from outside the U.S. were deriding it as being too patriotic. A recurring derogatory comment was ""The Americans save the day, again."" And the movie is ""only for stupid American children and rednecks."" I don't understand what those people are thinking about. This is an American movie, made for, oddly enough, Americans! Would those people also be surprised that Americans are biased for America? I personally agree that the RAH-RAH factor was too high in ID4, but not all my countrymen must have felt that way. The movie made over $300,000,000 domestically, so more than kids and hicks must have liked it. And despite the fact that, overseas, the IMDb commenter's seem to dismiss the film as propagandistic pabulum, it made almost $500,000,000 in foreign sales, so there must be a lot of American rednecks in other countries too.Now, if foreigners want to watch American films, that's fine with me (and I'm sure it's more than fine with U.S. movie producers), but they shouldn't be surprised if our movies are ""Pro-American."" I would expect that Russian films are ""Pro-Russian"" too. If anyone is offended by our films, the solution is really simple - DON'T WATCH THEM. I found French films to be pretentious, low rent, chick flicks, so I stopped watching them. Not watching foreign films is easy to do, so feel free to show your disgust by never watching an American film again. In fact, if all foreigners stopped, maybe Hollywood studios would start making films just for them, although you shouldn't hold your breath.If Germany, Japan, or any other country could make such big, booming, over-the-top films, I'd probably watch them, but no other countries have production companies that can afford to throw a hundred million dollars (or more) into making a film. If you want wiz-bang, high-tech, blockbuster films like Harry Potter, Terminator 2, Spiderman, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, The Matrix, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, ID4, etc., you're going to have to view an American film. And if they have to put some patriotic RAH-RAH in there to make sure they at least make their money back domestically (in case the film doesn't work overseas), well, that's what they'll do. Movie making is just a business like any other. If movies don't make money, they'll stop making them.Remember- Movies like ID4 and X-Men are just mindless FANTASIES.

Why??? Action movies don't have to be brainless - it's not a prerequisite component. So why was the script so dire?As a poor excuse for said script what we get is a load of jingoistic, hyper-macho chest-beating rhetoric played out by a bunch of toy soldiers. Women consigned to damsel in distress roles - or undressed roles, if we take Will Smith's Stripper Bride(!)into account.

But, Independence Day has to be one of the best alien invasion movies released in the last quarter century. True the story line is not very original, it does borrow themes from other sci-fi movies. The thing that is original is that the time line of this movie is between July 2 and July 4. But this movie has marvelous special effects, lots of action and lots of heart. Will Smith kicks absolute butt , love Randy Quaid as our resident lunatic kidnapped by the aliens... Vivica Fox merely eye candy.. our story deals with Aliens landing on earth,, now we have to find out what they want. well after that doesn't go so well, we try to fight the, and that doesn't go so well either,, now the President Bill Pullman is left with a choice,, he is taken to one of my favorite places in the whole world...... Area 51. I thought that this was the best part of the entire movie hands down. Roland Emmerich is undoubtedly a very skilled director who knows how to please the crowd. This movie has several good points and a few bad points which can be easily overlooked.Overall this film, is so Pro American that if you vote it down you might get deported or blown out into space ;)",Independence Day

I could say i even liked this movie, when it first came out. But than again, i was younger, inexperienced movie critic, who just simply fell for Will Smith jokes and maybe for the effects.But today, after I've seen it again, I nearly felt asleep. I haven't notice such a dull script since...Pearl Harbour maybe. And since i'm the citizen of the earth, the funny showing of US patriotism...till Pearl Harbour.
All in all, you could say that Pearl Harbour is the sequel to ID4. It contains everything. Beside, dull script and US patriotism, a ""puke up"" love story, stupid officers dialogs (""the world needs you, son"" style), a friend dying, someone sacrificing for the good of the nation, needless humor scenes...Anyway, not all US movie are that corny.

213,caseynicholson,A Gloriously Cheesy Movie,6,5 July 2016,"Twenty years. That's how long it took me to finally watch this movie. I have no idea why I never went to see it when it was first in theaters in 1996--I think maybe my best friend from high school saw it and didn't like it, who knows. All I know is that it wasn't until the sequel, ""Resurgence"" hit theaters that I decided to sit down and actually watch this movie.Now that I have, what did I think? I found this film to be a glorious cheese fest of a movie. It's perhaps the cheesiest movie I've ever seen. That's of course easily done when you've got Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Harry Connick, Jr. all in flight suits playing virtual Galaga for two hours. But in all seriousness, the movie is just downright cheesy, from the plot to the characters to the lines, cheese galore.That having been said, the movie is nevertheless watchable and fun in its own right. There's an element of it that feels almost like it was made for little kids or teenagers--it certainly has the feel of a 90's era video game. But whatever the audience it might have been intended for, it does make for a fun film overall--which is why I've given it 6/10 stars. I wasn't greatly impressed by this movie, but it's just good enough to be considered a ""good movie"", in spite of itself. Worth seeing, perhaps, even after a couple of decades. A good popcorn flick--but not the world's greatest film, by any means.",Independence Day
214,zfiany,I watched it when I was 15 years old...,8,20 November 2009,"That was something to a 15-year-old! I still remember that day vividly. My dad took me to the cinema to watch ID4 and that was like the happiest day of the year! I have to agree with the review that says ID4 must be seen on a very big screen and I don't think any screen would do better than the Cinema's. The effects are huge in that movie and to feel them right,the way they were originally tailored for you to feel, you need to see it in cinemas but since now it's not feasible to do so, you can still watch it and keep in mind this single info in order not to misjudge the movie.I remember the scene when the alien they found and grouped around to study awakened all of a sudden and hit the glass. At that moment, every one in the audience even those who were sitting in the balcony, reflexively moved back to their chairs as if the alien is coming towards them with that ""huh"" sound which was heard from all at once. I am not exaggerating that really happened and we are not talking 3D here. That's how good Roland Emmerich! Another scene was that when the lady is driving the car with her son and dog so she manages to escape the fire in the tunnel going into some hole in the wall and then for few minutes she is trying to save her baby and we were all sitting nervous so when she finally does, we were all like ""thank God"" and relieved but that wasn't all because the director made us is a few seconds care for saving the dog as well so back to nervousness until the dog was also saved. Those were moments in the movie that I still remember even after 14 years! I didn't watch ID4 again. It was that once but I still remember most of it.",Independence Day
215,tom_koopa,Very enjoyable movie!,8,8 June 2009,"Ahh Independence Day...I remember seeing this way back in the summer that it first came out in the cinema. I was blown away! Almost literally...Aliens destroy our major cities and want to annihilate mankind! HELP! A team of unlikely citizens of Earth eventually come together and think of a plan to stop the invaders.Let me start with the acting. I really LOVED the acting in this movie. Especially Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith. Man those two have awesome chemistry together. But alone, they also delivered a great performance.Okay, so the music didn't really stick with me. Then again, it's a disaster movie. Stuff gets blown up all the time. There's not much room for any kind of music.There's a good amount of humor in this movie as well. There are a lot of funny scenes. My number one has to be when Will Smith drags an alien in a parachute behind him. Awesome dialog...The effects are good enough. I think the design of the aliens is creative. Even though you don't see them much up-close, which is a shame. Spaceship design is maybe a little too... classic? I mean they're basically flying saucers. Not saying it's a bad thing, but I personally prefer more exotic, strange designs. Just one opinion of course.For a disaster movie, it has a surprisingly long runtime. Over two hours. There's a good build-up in the story and it gives more depth to the movie when it comes to characters and background.Independence Day is a good Sci-Fi movie with a nice mix of humor, action and drama.8 out of 10 stars.",Independence Day
216,ScottAmundsen,"Yes, it's Kind of Dumb and Cliché Ridden, But it Has Something Very Special",8,21 May 2013,"Some people might be surprised that I give this movie a star rating of 8. After all, everything the critics said about it is true: the story is a stupid one (honestly, if a race of creatures out there really were so advanced as to be able to make such long journeys through space, would they REALLY do so just to make war on us?), there is virtually NOTHING in it that has not been done already and usually by far superior films (WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE and THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, for example), and to describe the script as cliché-ridden is an understatement: it positively REVELS in clichés and trite old memes from low-rent Fifties invaders-from-outer-space trash. The plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese and the movie at times seems to be daring the viewer to keep watching.Why, then, with all these faults, is this one of those films that whenever it comes on, I simply HAVE to sit down and enjoy? BECAUSE IT'S FUN.Don't get me wrong; I love serious drama; I studied the works of Tennessee Williams for two years at University. But the director/writer team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin did not set out to make serious drama. They set out to ENTERTAIN, a goal that is equally as valid as the goal of most serious drama which is to elicit a certain emotional response. There is a place in the pantheon for movies made just for fun.And entertain this film does, and it does it well. Thanks largely in part to a script that was positively audacious in its deliberate loading the film of every outdated sci-fi idea in the book, aided and abetted by an incredible cast. The people in this film are all utterly believable and ground the film in a way that lesser attention to the acting would not have done. There are even a couple of moments I choke up every time: President Whitmore's (Bill Pullman) rallying speech to the pilots on the airfield; the reunion of David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) and Constance Spano (Margaret Colin); and most especially a quiet moment between David Levinson and his father Julius (Judd Hirsch, a particular favorite of mine) when the father looks at the son and says, ""I'm very proud of you"" that gets me every time: the father and son look at each other for just a moment, and so much is said in that moment.Some folks reading this might think I just have a taste for really bad movies (and I won't deny that some movies I hold very dear are indeed VERY bad), but this is a film that knows what it's doing from the first frame to the last; a roller-coaster ride that is even more fun after you've seen it a few times.Pass the popcorn and enjoy.",Independence Day

In fact, this makes BATTLEFIELD EARTH look like an unmitigated Academy Award winner, so there's really not that much further down the toilet you can go besides this one.I had the misfortune of seeing this due to the urgings of a (then) girlfriend who was so enamored with all the hype making the rounds that we just; ""had to go see it...""And I'm sorry I did.The plot has more holes in it than a pile of swiss cheese and the CGI looked animated and ridiculous. And Bill Pullman as the President leading the air force into battle against the (technologically superior) aliens, looked so stupid that only a dumb ass could be impressed by it. This is the kind of film that would appeal to CGI morons who think video games are 'high art'.I'm not even gonna go on and on about it.

Come to Earth presumably on a mission of peace. Their giant mother ships appear in the sky all over the world. Los Angeles is where the first miniseries is set. It's also the setting for one of the most ludicrous scenes in the movie Independence Day. That scene has them all up on the roof of L.A.'s tallest building to greet the aliens. One of them, only identified as ""Elvis Fanatic,"" says the following: ""Oh god I hope they bring back Elvis!"" We know what happens after that. Every city on Earth, including Washington, New York, and Los Angeles, is destroyed. El Toro, a Marine Corps Air Station, is destroyed. Captain Steven Hiller is shot down by an alien over the Grand Canyon. In one scene, he's trying to get him off his six, and threads the needle with his F/A-18 Hornet. Hiller loses his plane, but the alien that shot him down loses his ship, so it's a fair trade. For most of the film, Will Smith is seen dragging the alien through the desert to Area 51. Since the '90s were a time of militia activity, most people cheered when the White House was destroyed. The aliens are defeated by a computer virus written on an Apple laptop, as pointed out in another review, and Russell Casse, the crop duster who claimed to have been abducted by aliens, carries a nuclear missile straight into the belly of the alien ship after Hiller and Levinson get out of Dodge. Casse is on a suicide mission. America saves the day because America's the only country to bring the nations of the world together. How do does America do it?

222,michelerealini,A useless film,1,10 October 2005,"""Independence day"" (ID4) is one of the most overrated films in movie history. Technically is very well done, the rest is a disaster.I wonder if the film -which is one the biggest hits of all time- would enjoy the same gigantic success NOW... The film was released in 1996: these were the Clinton years, without terrorism threat.In 2005 we've already experienced 9/11 and two wars decided and led by US administration (Afgahnistan and Iraq). Audiences (at least outside US) probably wouldn't like ID4 so much. So, I ask again even if the answer doesn't exist: would the film enjoy the same gigantic success?The picture is an hymn to patriotism and contains strong political messages:1. US president is an example for everyone and he's ready to take part in a fight for freedom (...""Enduring Freedom""?)2. All the countries should live a day like the 4th of July, the Independence day3. US democracy is the best one and every country should follow itTo me these messages were clear also in 1996, but at that time I just made a laugh -after all it was only a popcorn movie. NOW I think people outside US could hardly enjoy this film. I'm sorry to say that because I'm not anti-American and I know that not all the Americans think in the same way.The film is also full of stereotypes regarding Americans themselves. Look at the characters: the main ones are a white Christian president, a black pilot and a Jewish scientist. That's a way of making several kinds of audience happy, because many races are represented in the movie.There are clichés regarding foreign people as well. Common people of the world are represented in their stereotypical physical and cultural characteristics (see for example the pilots of the different armies!).The movie is very conservative. I don't know if Mr.Emmerich wanted to do a film like this, but the result certainly speaks a lot.I'm disappointed when I think that Roland Emmerich, a German director, made it.

It was one of the biggest movies of the summer. It shocked and was seen by thousands of movie audiences. What made Independence Day the biggest action movie of the summer of '96? Well, Independence Day is a alien invasion movie about aliens from outer space coming to invade Earth. Soon then, the world become suspicious when these very giant alien ships float above us turning day into an dark place. The President of the United States, played by Bill Pullman, alerted the people that they are in a state of emergency. The alien ships soon destroyed major cities in the U.S. including Washington D.C, L.A. and New York. This was something very extraordinary. The screen is then set ablaze as the ship fired on the buildings and destroys everything in it's path. So, an Fighter plane pilot, played by Will Smith takes action to eliminate these unearthly beings. The movie has a lot of great visual effects, good camera shots of the big alien ship hovering over New York. The action scenes are very exciting.

226,eastbergholt2002,Entertaining Blockbuster,9,14 April 2007,"Independence Day is fun and fast-paced. In many ways its the perfect Hollywood blockbuster. It involves a battle between good and evil and has a clever mix of action, romance and comedy. The characters are smart, brave and likable. It helps if you have a mental age of about 14 and don't take it too seriously. Overall, the film has a good story, superb production values and some impressive explosions. It has the obligatory, feel good ending and will probably be regarded as a Hollywood classic in twenty years time. Bill Pullman plays a U.S. president who has to deal with a alien invasion. The president was a pilot in the First Gulf War and his war record propelled him to the presidency (sic). The president tries diplomacy but soon discovers that the aliens are hostile. Many cities are destroyed and people die in large numbers. The Earth's military forces initially take a beating, but America finds a way of fighting back. This is mainly down to the nerdy genius of Jeff Goldblum and the bravery of Will Smith, a cocky marine pilot. On the eve of the final battle, President Pullman rallies his troops by giving a speech that recalls the patriotic St. Crispin's Day speech from Shakespeare's Henry V. With no irony whatsoever, Pullman depicts the Brits and the aliens as interchangeable evildoers. There are various romantic sub-plots. Smith is in love with a stripper with a heart of gold (Vivica Fox). Goldblum is still in love with his ex-wife, the president's press secretary (Margaret Colin) The film has excellent scene stealing performances from a large supporting cast, including: Quaid, Judd Hirsch, Mary McDonnell, Robert Loggia and Brent Spiner.

It's just a very stupid action movie, that makes absolutely no sense.The Good:Let's start with the good, the very little there is. The film's action is fun to watch, and Will Smith is descent in his role, even if his character has no character, and I think the alien designs are the most creative thing in the film.The Bad:As I mentioned before, the film has an incredible lack of originality. The story is your generic aliens try and take the world story, just dumber. As the characters make stupid decisions, like letting the president go into battle. The Roswell UFO Crash being real. The film is just really dumb, and many might say, it's meant to be stupid. Well, if it wanted my brain to hurt, it succeeded. The film is almost intelligence insulting. And here's something, people hate on Battle Los Angeles, a terrible movie, for the same reason they like Independence Day.The characters are also uninteresting, just saying catchphrases, and being stereotypes. Like Jeff Goldblum is a Jewish stereotype, Will Smith is a black stereotype. The actors are clearly not trying, and the film just feels like no effort is put into it. The aliens are also just generic, they have no character, and they're just evil.

There are so many better action and science fiction films. This one barely stands out. It's just another stupid movie. And I can kind of understand somebody liking it. It's dumb. Everyone has a guilty-pleasure. But there are so many people that enjoy this film. And that's what I don't get.Conclusion:Well, I've probably put more effort into this review, than the writers put into the movie. It's not very good. I can't stand this film, it's lazy, it's stupid, and it's cliche. There is nothing original about it, and I don't get it.",Independence Day
233,IamROCKAS,It's a mess of a movie but it's fun and entertaining,8,22 June 2020,"This is a great action flick, even with Will Smith and his presence making us question whether this is comedy or not. He was cracking jokes through out the entire run of the movie and we had a lot of one liners from him but it was bearable and the ""Welcome to Earth"" line is still memorable and is widely known even by those who haven't watched this flick. The movie kept me on my toes, it kept me entertained and it made me question all logic at some points with the unrealistic plot and questionable technical faults but overall - I'm not too triggered by the unreal aspects of the movie and I enjoyed the experience.",Independence Day
234,BlueSkies765,Great popcorn movie,9,3 August 2020,"As many I was a big Will Smith fan in the 90s for Fresh Prince of Bell Air. Loved his movies like Bad Boys, but for some reason I've always dodged Independence Day. Was never really into Alien storylines (except for the X-Files) and this is probably also why I also wasn't into Men In Black. However now I like this movie. I like the spirit of it. Humanity under threat of a powerful, seeming invincible power trying to take over, and with its never-ending optimism they show the strength of humanity.Independence Day has a very popcorn movie feel to it. It must have been a blast watch this in the theater in 1996. If it were to be rereleased it would still look great on the big screen. Funny one-liners, machoism of the hero smoking a cigar after a fight and huge large airships involved in warfare. A great adrenaline fueled spectacle.",Independence Day
235,Mulliga,"The ultimate popcorn flick - breezy, predictable, but fun (very minor spoilers)",7,15 November 2003,"""Independence Day"" is the epitome of the summer blockbuster. You have Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum cracking wise in an alien spaceship, major landmarks getting destroyed, and enough explosions and creature effects to please anyone. The story isn't that great (in fact, the whole movie is just a remake of ""The War of the Worlds,"" right down to the plot twists), the characters are sort of stupid, the acting is just passable, but the movie isn't bad. It does miss the apocalyptic feel you get in other films, but obviously Mr. Emmerich isn't looking to bring anyone down on the Fourth of July weekend. The effects look good, there are some laughs, and everyone goes home happy. And maybe, just maybe, that's enough.7/10",Independence Day
236,Alcaminhante,It couldn´t be much worst than this. A complete piece of junk.,1,19 May 1999,"There´s to ways of  looking at this movie. If  you look at it ,as a film, it´s a complete crap, but as a popcorn movie, this must be a masterpiece. A true blockbuster Hollywood politically correct movie that even braindead people could understand. A producers dream come true.Never since RAMBO 2, such a waste of  celulloid was released throughout the world.But it´s a fun movie nevertheless. To this day i still don´t know if i like this. Sometimes i do, others i hate it. Sometimes i hate myself for having fun watching this piece of #@$& ! And this is what is annoying about this movie.Here in Europe many reviewers wrote that this was a terrible movie that everybody should see just to be able to believe how BAD it is !This is the perfect movie to go see with a bunch of friends and joke about it all the time, because this is truly a bad movie where the most entertaining thing we get from it ,is the moments where we trash it down. And if you don´t live in the United States multiply this fun twice.The story couldn´t have been cheesier and idiotic. This is the bottom of the pit in creativity. The worst "" War of the Worlds "" rip-off ever ! This couldn´t have been worst written or imagined ! H.G.Wells must be turning in his grave till this day. Instead of developing the great potential ideas that could have been done with a story like this, they choose to focus on the patriotic stuff ( !!!!??? ).  Man, what a puke !The fun thing about it, was that this movie gave a bigger contribute to create a bad image of America abroad than the whole RAMBO series put together instead !And talk about predictiblity ! This story is so predictable it is boring to watch despite the magnnificent  aerial batlle scenes in it.Not to speak of the way the aliens were defeated ! I won´t even comment on that ! Pure hollywood at his worst !Nevertheless it´s a fun cinematic junk. If you don´t mind acting like a brainded for two hours, this is fun to watch. If you love Cinema and you´re a masochist, you´re going to love this, because it will make you suffer with pleasure.See it and speak bad about it later. Absolute cinematic garbage.",Independence Day
237,duraflex,"Senseless, Stupid, Violent",1,28 January 2007,"There is nothing to recommend this horrible movie. To graphically depict widespread death and destruction and to computer-generate marvelous landmarks being obliterated one after another is an unconscionable travesty in the name of entertainment and the quest of the almighty dollar, peso, yen etc. There is enough real mayhem in too many parts of the world to make this mess unnecessary. Nothing can justify this flick - it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. This is violence and destruction aimed at a cretin populace that is too stupid to know right from wrong or good from bad.Will Smith is his unbearable self. There is no humor in this story. Overall, Independence Day is a sickening and perverse waste of time, money and talent. The producers, actors and studio made a fortune by creating this stupid, senseless ""thing"".I saw it at a friend's house on DVD and didn't pay a dime. I feel like they owe me for wasting 2 hours of my life watching this load. It stinks out loud.",Independence Day
238,DoctorSkyTower,CLICHE,5,1 July 1999,"Hmmm.... Saw this quite a while ago. Loved the special effects!Great for the time it was out!!!However, the characters are a bit cliched, especially the President of the United States Of America - I cant see Clinton jumping in a fighter jet and taking off to shoot a giant muthar of an alien ship! The bit that really made me wince was the Presidents Presidential Speech - I mean - the whole world accepting an American holiday as their national holiday? Yeah, right!There were bits that could've been edited out - they mostly involved Ye President of the Mighty U.S.of A. ie when he figures out the aliens plans for us poor Simians, his jumping in a fighter jet to take on the Bad Guys, when Mommy dies and he says ""Mommy's sleeping now"", that sorta thing. It was all one largish ClicheI liked Jeff Goldblum, he's a cool actor, I found his acting better than ole Will Smith, but I did like Will's one-liners.My favourite line in this movie is jeffs dad saying ""Look at me, I'm not even wearing a tie. I look like a Schlimeal"" or something to that effect. I get a laugh out of that every time I watch this flick. Dont know why, maybe its just my sense of humour!Aside from that, I do think it could've been better handled, maybe a bit less of the patritism, not that i have anything against the good ole US of A of course!!",Independence Day
239,abrafocus,Too much profanity,5,28 February 2006,"The story is good. The acting is good. The battles are good.But the profanity, it's TOO much.I liked Bill Pullman's performance as the Commander-in-Chief, and Will Smith and all the other actors.Why the profanity? I know it's about an alien invasion, but cussing is never necessary. The movie is PG-13, but good grief. There's just too much bad language. Even this movie could have done without it.Other than the foul language, it's pretty good.**Spoilers ahead!!**I like how David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) and Capt. Hiller (Will Smith) got out of the mother ship just in the nick of time, just before it blew up, along with the rest of the alien ships.What I don't like, besides the profanity, is the fact that the First Lady dies. What's up with that?My score: 6/10.Above, it's a 5. I didn't want to be on the ""Hated List"" so I gave as low a score as I could. I do NOT love this move, nor do I hate it.",Independence Day

Considering sub-par performances and an empty plot, INDEPENDENCE DAY is fun to watch for one thing...the special effects.  Otherwise, this film would have been a lot worse.  One other positive thing is that it made plenty of money at the box office, so it goes to show that a movie can make hundreds of millions of dollars and not have much to show for it, but this film is highly recommended for anyone who enjoys watching stuff get blowed up.3 out of 5",Independence Day
241,mwcrunner,One of the best summer blockbusters ever,10,4 July 2016,"This is definitely one of the best summer movies ever. It has a lot of action and plenty of aliens to fight. This is also the movie to be watching every 4th of July. Sure aliens may not exist, but this movie is worth watching. Also the operation room scene where they were operating on the alien until the alien came awake used to scare me as a kid. Also I laugh at that one guys raspy voice every time I hear it. Also the aliens in this movie are really cool. I used to have a toy of one those aliens. This movie will always be a part of my childhood and I still like it today. We'll also never forget the famous speech scene with Bill Pullman in this movie.",Independence Day
242,byson5186,"Action Entertaining, Characters Forgettable",7,7 July 2015,"It seems like about every holiday has a movie based on the holiday. Frequently, the movies are also named after the holiday as they did it with this movie. Most of the movies named after a holiday are not action movies with exception to this one. This movie is a movie you can definitely expect to see on TV during the 4th of July, as that holiday just happened. A little like how you can definitely expect to see Home Alone and Home Alone 2 on TV during the holiday season, and if you're like me, you'll like watching them around the holidays to get into the holiday spirit. This movie would definitely be an entertaining movie to watch on Independence Day with friends. Seeing action in movies naturally excites us and keeps our eyes on the screen. The action in this movie is definitely one to excite you.So, while this movie has some entertaining action it definitely has flaws which I notice and you probably notice too. Like the biggest example I think has to be getting to know the characters. This movie has multiple main characters, and scenes keep switching from one character to the next. We might remember a couple of the actors that starred in this movie, but we will probably forget the name of the character they played. As the scenes keep switching from characters, it is hard for us to keep up with all of them and a lot of the scenes we see them in where there isn't action are slow scenes. They don't seem like characters you'd write a wiki article after or really care to know about their background outside of the movie. The characters mostly seem like just a group of people from different backgrounds handling an alien invasion. Will Smith also starred in the movie Men In Black which also dealt with aliens and came out less than a year after this one does. We seem to get to know his character better in that movie than this one, and we'd probably think of Men In Black a little more as entertaining, and his character is a little more funny in that movie.Again, the action scenes are cool. The first action sequence has to be the most memorable as it is seen in the covers of this movie. It is sometimes even shown in pop culture, like they show a scene from the first action sequence in Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me. The action sequences after that look like scenes from a Star Wars movie, or a video game. They remind me of a video game I used to play, Star Fox 64. Those scenes are cool and can be cheesy at times, but also have humor to them. They also have really good special effects that seem to work really well, almost 20 years later.The plot from this movie does not seem too out of the ordinary. It seems like a common plot of having aliens come to earth. Some aliens coming in peace, and others wrecking havoc like this one, and humanity having to find ways to defend themselves. About movies of aliens coming in peace, one movie which I feel like is way underrated and it seems like half the people who saw this movie loves it, is a movie that came out last year called Earth To Echo. I'd go far enough to consider that the greatest movie ever made, and I'd strongly recommend it. Also, another movie I'd recommend in movies named after holidays which I feel like is slow but entertaining, and the slow scenes in that movie are more entertaining than the slow scenes in this movie is called Labor Day. I enjoyed it when I saw it.One thing I always remember from watching this movie on TV and how it's on during Independence Day and I remember this from many years ago. If you watch movies on TV, they frequently shorten some scenes and go to commercials at the exact same time every year you watch it on TV. I notice that with Home Alone, how some scenes are shortened and one scene in particular from Home Alone that I remember them going to commercials to is after Kevin looks out the window after fooling the crooks of people in the house using mannequins, if you watch it on like TBS. In this movie, from what I remember watching it from like 18-years ago as a kid also on Independence Day. While I don't know this movie well enough to talk about shortened scenes, I always remember how one time this movie switches to commercials is after the first action sequence right after the light bulb in the tunnel pops. A way to keep us watching to find out what happens next.So, the movie is entertaining and in one sentence it's flaws are not getting to know the characters, sometimes cheesy, not a lot of plot, something that doesn't seem too out of the ordinary, and some slow scenes for a 2+ hour movie. This movie has seemed to change how we see movies and action in cinemas since it came out and I look forward to it's sequel. Though this movie doesn't seem like the type of movie that needs a sequel or can go in the direction for a sequel. So, despite it's flaws because of the action and entertainment I give it a 7/10.",Independence Day
243,thewillt08,"Well, It Could Have Been Worse",7,16 April 2013,"Welcome to WillyT Reviews. Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, and aliens. Now that's a recipe for success. Independence day takes place over a three day period and between those three days the world's population is reduced to basically nothing after a wave of aliens attack. Bill Pullman plays the President and he is probably my favorite portrayal of a US president on film. Jeff Goldblum knocks it out of the park again as the smartest man on Earth. Then there is Will Smith who matures from The Fresh Prince to a pilot in the army and even though he is playing a role with more seriousness but still has his wit and comedic charm. There is a lot to talk about with this movie but my limit is 1000 words, here we go.The opening scene, if you have followed my reviews recently I talk a lot about the opening scenes and other than the cliché REM song ""It's The End of the World as We Know It"" the movie zoned me in right away. It starts on the moon and the spaceships just hover over and descend towards Earth. I feel like the movie kind of jumped into it and had very little character development in the beginning but they made up for it in the middle and end. The ships fly over major cities all over the world and the first act concludes with the destruction of cities and the death of millions. Like I said earlier I love the characters and how they develop in the film, especially the president. Bill Pullman starts out as an unpopular President who has made poor decisions in the past. As disaster strikes he grows a backbone and becomes a strong leader. His little speech about Independence Day was really inspirational. It was a little cheesy but it did its job and I liked it. Jeff Goldblum learns how to love again and he becomes a stronger person and a better man. Will Smith grows up in a way and his dream comes true. It's a little weird but the destruction of Earth and the almost extinction of humanity was kind of a good thing for these people. In a way it makes the world stronger and one can assume what happens after the credits roll and my imagination went wild, which is never a bad thing.My favorite character is David's Jewish uncle. I forget his name but he is hilarious and steals every scene he is a part of. Was his acting memorable or amazing, no, but I feel like the actor was just being himself and he did such a fluent job that reflected on screen. His lines fit well and are smart at the same time witty. Towards the end he is praying in a circle. He invites a man to join him, ""I'm not Jewish"" he says ""Nobody's perfect."" He responds. In the time of disaster and fear he still cracks a joke and made me smile. He was a perfect blend to the movie. Let's talk about the aliens. Now I have a few problems with them. They look OK, a little unrealistic and silly but it could have been worse. I like how they use technology and communicate with each other but they have shields around their ships. That's cheating and makes it almost impossible to stop them. I thought it was lame and the movie could have worked without them, maybe even better. Finally, they have no reason for the attack. They literally go from planet to planet and kill everything. ""They're like locusts."" The President says after he actually communicates with them in my favorite scene. I wanted a better reason. After the buildup in the first act and half of the second act it made me think, wow that's it. That makes no sense. The aliens are so smart and are basically invulnerable but they make so many stupid mistakes. Watching the movie conclude I didn't really buy it. I was OK with the ending and I enjoyed it but it was not as good as I expected. I won't spoil the ending but it's not like War of The Worlds where they just die from the parasites and particles in the air. My feelings on that is for another time. When it comes to alien movies I have been let down so many times by the ending. Signs, War of the Worlds, and now Independence Day, out of those three movies this one had the best ending but I don't think it was enough because it wasn't realistic. Overall, Independence Day was a good movie with really good special effects. I could watch historic buildings all over the country being blown up and the wall of fire tearing cities apart all day long. The lead characters were strong, the acting wasn't terrific but it worked and they developed well. Side characters were fun and fit nicely, specifically the General and David's Uncle. The aliens were OK, foolish but still scary. The story was really good and presented well but had a disappointing ending. I see this movie on TV all the time and whenever it's on I can hop right in and watch it while still being entertained. It is a good movie to watch alone or with a group, it can be a background movie so I give Independence Day the Willyt Honorable Mention for its characters and their development, the awesome special effects and its entertainment value.

Why did they have to include such a president (in the best Air Force One style) and not a more credible one...?Why...? Why did they have to include a drunken pilot instead of some other credible character...?Why...? Why did they choose Will Smith for such a role when he was still in people's mind as the funny Fresh Prince of Bel-Air...?Why...? Why a NASA candidate had to be living with an exotic dancer...?I could continue with many more questions, but I think you get the point.All in one question, I'd like to ask:Why do they spend so much money and do the hardest part of the film so well done and spoil the rest of it with so many strange items...?Is it perhaps that the writers didn't receive enough money to write a better screenplay...? Sincerely, I can't believe it. And nowadays there are lots of films in this same style, I mean, with lots of money spent in the technical aspects of the film and horrible screenplay and/or actors.Is it perhaps that they knew that people would like the result? Is it perhaps that I'm wrong and most people really like that trash...?Or is it perhaps that they thought that the film was too horrifying that they had to include comic elements to make it a lighter horror film...?Maybe there is no explanation at all, but in any case I think they failed in their intentions whatever they were.5-6 out of 10 (just for the effects).",Independence Day
247,Gambitt,Deserves its kudos,6,7 July 2003,"Independence Day did great at the box office but has suffered a bit of a backlash over time as its inherent flaws and cheesiness are exposed.Normally I would totally rip into a rah-rah-USA flick like Independence Day. A computer virus being transmitted by a Macintosh to an alien system?  The president hopping into a jet fighter to personally join the battle?  An alcoholic redneck elevated to hero status?  Seeing the final celebration scenes, I wonder if 300 years from now American movies will still portray other nationalities in their basest stereotypes.  (ie happy Africans running around with their spears and loinclothes).Nevertheless, I give ID lots of credit for its initial impact, especially given its most fundamental goal: entertainment.  I remember the first time I saw it in a theater in '96, and I fully admit that my friends and I had a blast.  The action was great, the characters were likable, and even the humor was cute.Plus, ID was one of the first to really effectively use the theme of massive disaster.  The audience was glued to the screen watching New York and Washington get devastated, overwhelmed by the destruction and loss of life. Looking back and seeing all the copycat films of late, it's actually quite emotionally exploitive, but hey, ID gets credit for being one of the first to do it well.All in all, I give Independence Day an imdb 6: worth watching at least once.",Independence Day
248,daveisit,"And Boy, He Could Fly",1,13 December 2000,"Bill Pullman should stick to movies like ""Spaceballs"". As for the rest of the cast, what can you say?

No more no less. They didn't make this a great movie though, so were probably a waste of $999 998 479.

249,blackwidowis7cool,Fun Adventure,10,23 July 2019,"This is an awesome movie. It is brilliantly executed, well thought out. It has action, quite a sense of humour, entertaining, and suspense and tension. It is a real fun watch. And has great special effects.
It also has great character development - Russell Case (Randy Quaid) when he first appears in the film, is a drunkard and irresponsible, even though he has three children, one of whom is ill. He is also a widower and was kidnapped by aliens and experimented on ten years prior to the story's start. During the coarse of the film, he starts taking care of his children more and begins being a father to them. During the climax, he sacrifices his life to destroy the flying saucer.
There is also the personal story between David Levinson and Constance, his ex-wife. They had divorced three years before the start of the film as Constance believed that David was not 'ambitious enough' and wanted her 'life to mean something' by going to work at the White House. During the course of the film, they slowly reconcile and by the end of it, they get back together.
The cast is excellent and their acting is solid. I personally think that Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch are the best of the cast, though all the cast were excellent.
It is a marvelous film, and I generally do not get into or like alien movies. What really appeals to me is that the aliens are portrayed as evil, not as some 'friendly we are here to help humanity' creatures, which is annoying and painful. One of Emmerich's best movies! I recommend watching it!",Independence Day
250,matlefebvre20,A movie to love a lot or to spit on,5,16 June 2006,"I know that I've recently written many reviews about sci-fi pics or other special-effects-laden movies and that I've inserted several comparisons with ""Independence Day"", without reviewing the latter movie. Well now, this is a thing of the past and here is my ""ID4"" review.We can't talk about ""ID4"" without talking about the visual effects involved here. From the beginning, ie. with the arrival of the mother ship above the Moon, till the final battle, which leaves every spaceship destroyed, a lot of laser and missile shots, explosions, eardrum-hurting sounds and other surprises occur.That's because ""ID4"" primarily is a special-effects machine. These are incredible and harrowing visual effects. I haven't seen this movie in a theater, but I guess it would have shaken the walls and the screen, along with the produced sounds. Sounds are a primordial aspect of the movie. They give to the spaceships a terrifying and monster scream when they come through the atmosphere and hover over the cities (nice wordplay here...). Explosions are eye-catching and the fire waves which break on LA, NYC and Washington are astonishing.But the problem is you can't do a good movie with over-the-top special effects and a storyline bought in a Dollar Tree store. It's surprising that the movie is called ""Independence Day"" because it itself depends on its visual and sound tricks... Show the example, they say...With some very iny-tiny exceptions, the storyline and the actors are no more than weak. The story elements are built like in the Bible: they say a lot of things, but they don't give the details about anything. We know the facts, but that's all. For example, we attempt to communicate with the visitors with a helicopter equipped with powerful projectors, which send light spots that are supposed to be some kind of message. What does the sequential message means? It's so cheesy that I guess it's the reason why the aliens shot the copter.We're introduced to cheap characters into the movie. Jeff Goldblum, best known for his Ian Malcolm appearance in ""Jurassic Park"", is David, a Jewish computer whiz who appears to be the only person in the world who's able to find the aliens' signals, how to interpret them and how to defeat them. It's far from a great performance. He's able to track the signals, while the NASA, the ESA and the different armies are not? Talk about something! Bill Pullman is the President of the United States. He's apparently the youngest president that the country ever had and, as we can hear, he was a fighter pilot during the Gulf War, which occurred only 5 years before the movie was released! Other (cheap) performances include Randy Quaid as Russell Casse, an alcoholic ex-fighter pilot in the Nam War, who suffered a post-traumatic incident that makes him believe that he's been abducted by extraterrestrials. Well, guess what? He's about to become the Earth's savior! There is also Brent Spiner as Dr. Okun, an Area 51 scientist who looks like an insane modern Victor Frankenstein, and James Rebhorn, who is the Secretary of Defense, but he acts like if he was in the George W. Bush cabinet, with his words, his ideals and his attitude.The only actor who delivers a fair performance is Will Smith, who gets his breakthrough role here. He is Captain Steven Hiller, a hot-shot pilot from the El Toro base. He's the most entertaining character of the lot and it's always enjoyable to watch him.Aliens are briefly described in various parts of the movie. They're mostly a nomad people and their technology is told to be much superior from ours. This is surprising, especially when you watch the end of the movie, when Jeff Goldblum's character is single-handedly able to send a virus into their system. Our technology is already able to produce anti-viruses and theirs is not? Help me, I don't understand...And finally, let's not forget that patriotic mood that swarms into the movie. It's present from the very first scene, which shows the American flag planted on the Moon's surface, till the very last one with typical fireworks from the Fourth of July's festivities. And among that, you even have the movie's title that's implied into this.An interesting essay subject for film students, a crowd-pleasing experience and an anti-intellectual presentation. That's what ""ID4"" is. And while it won an Academy Award and became the highest-grossing movie of 1996, there's not a lot to cherish here. But if you just want to get entertained and to escape reality for a moment, ""ID4"" is more efficient than smoking marijuana. And that's enough to justify its existence.",Independence Day
251,eamon-hennedy,Brilliantly Entertaining.,10,27 October 2003,"I saw this movie when I was twelve and I remember I couldn't wait to see it. As a twelve year old it was the greatest film ever made. The mixture of aliens, explosions and Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum blowing up the mother ship all made up for my favorite film at a young age. While it may no longer hog the top spot (I have grown up a bit since then) the film is still a favorite of mine, owning it on video and DVD and I still find it great fun to watch. Okay, okay, so the American patriotism is a little overdone at the end, but Jeff Goldblum is great value for money, especially when playing the cocky scientist who is destined to be right and mixing it up with a cockier Will Smith this has the basis to be a fun film which it is.While the special effects are what the film relies on the most, it is the affectionate tribute to the many genres that inspired Emmerich and Devlin that makes this a joy to watch. Clearly in love with alien invasion films and disaster films from the 50's and 70's, they have ever cliche in the book thrown into the film, from the frightening, although fantastically done, alien attack that sees some of the most famous landmarks in America being blown up, through to the self sacrifice of a character through to the death of many a loved one who are merely one dimensional characters who serve no purpose other than to be killed and cause a gamut of emotions, Emmerich and Devlin have done their job well. The film is affectionate to the genre's it is paying tribute to and in doing so they have created one of the most entertaining Hollywood blockbusters in many a year. While the film would seem to have a lot in common more with a Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay collaboration (explosions, explosions and some more explosions), they do in a less excessive mode and in doing so do create some funny and moving character moments. Goldblum and Judd Hirsch have some fantastic scenes together, while Bill Pullman's president having to watch his wife die is genuinely sad, never have the word sleeping seem so weepy.It is the action scenes where this film comes to life and boy does Emmerich know how to put on a good show. From the aforementioned attack scene to the the retaliation of human kind, the film is a fast paced fun ride that never lets up and never has a dull moment. It may be corny and it may be a film made for twelve year old boys, but seven years have passed since the film was released and I'm going to admit it. I still love it.",Independence Day
252,Pingo-2,"Oh, how I hate Roland Emmerich!",7,8 March 2001,"Roland Emmerich seems to have a problem of showing the fears of violence... it seems like he always, in all movies he makes, has to make a too-good ending, make all the people in the story happy in the end and of course, no person we like can die in his movies... When I watched it the first time, about 12 years ago or so, I hated it. Now, I've seen it a couple of time, and I like it better.Still, it's not a perfect film. There are things I'd like to change. That the fire never reaches the room where Jasmine throws herself in the tunnel. That they never salvage the shot-down alien spacecraft for parts. No reason for how a common PC can interact with the alien-computers. How it's possible to fly away from a fire-storm with Airforce One. And so on...Considering that most of these weird ""mistakes"" actually LOOK kind of cool on the screen, you can get away with it. If you watch an Emmerich film with one reason only: to be entertained - then you will love it. You will love ALL his films.From what I understand of Emmerich, he is doing these enormous movies with enormous sfx that are pure entertainment - and that's the way he wants it. So, my guess is that this is what he set out to do.ID4 is a good movie. Very entertaining and some visual stuff that are still wonderful 12 years later. Great stuff!7/10",Independence Day
253,mrbluto,A great movie,8,15 June 2001,"A wonderful wonderful movie, Not long like 2001 but filled with action and real people. The casting was perfect,making will Smith the lead instead of a white was great.There are small moments in this movie that are special,like when they discover area 51 is real and there is a real alien spacecraft. As far as the jerks putting down Americans and this American movie 75% of all movies are made with Americans in mind because thats where the money is,also when was the last time Ireland or Spain had a movie make 200 million dollars (answer NEVER), I am not putting down other countries but the American bashing of the jerks posting from Ireland and Spain make me sick.",Independence Day
254,writerasfilmcritic,Worst Movie of the Decade,1,10 November 2006,"Sometimes you wonder just how bad a movie can be. Don't wonder any longer. Just rent this colossal piece of manure and strap yourself in for perhaps the worst movie viewing experience you have ever tolerated. This overlong, overblown, ridiculous cartoon has one redeeming quality and that is the buildings being blown up once the aliens FINALLY launch their attack on the world. Prior to that, and trust me, it takes awhile, you must tolerate scene after scene of reaction shots to the approaching alien craft. The cast aren't really looking at anything because the computer animation hasn't been added yet. Ho-hum. Between these scenes and for a long time afterward, the people featured in this story have a peculiar tendency to go on with their lives as if there is no particular hurry trying to deal with everything suddenly turned upside down. There's all the time in the world to say goodbye, eat a bag of chips, drive to work, go on a short vacation, or do whatever else you want. That's when you realize just how boring and absurd this thing is going to be. We must admit those effects are pretty good, the giant explosions and the flying cars and trucks squashing the running crowds as they attempt escape. I'll give this horrendous pile a ""1"" just for that. Soon enough, though, we're right back to the sappy, dreary, meaningless dialog. You can almost imagine one of the actors on the set acting confused and asking, ""Wait a minute. What's my motivation here?"" The cast and crew crack up, knowing just how silly his remark is, but the actors actually must pretend this farce is poignant. For example, there's Will Smith trying to tell his girlfriend he loves her while choking back the emotion, or was it the other way around? I don't quite remember but who gives a rat's. Then Will's dragging an alien across the salt flat and hamming it up. It's painful to watch. Then there's Jeff Goldbum and his dad (Judd Hirsch), who play chess in the park as a regular thing. Jeff is well-educated but lacking in ambition, so he's a cable guy. His appraising gaze is often fraught with smouldering sensitivity, belying the supposed depth of his character. Go grab a snack or take a pee and don't bother with the pause. You won't miss anything worth seeing, except perhaps a rather silly excursion into the character of the ""president,"" who is seen at the helm in the midst of this crisis. Gee, he looks kind of young to be president. As the aliens wipe out most of the world, he seems paralyzed with indecision, but never fear. Finally, realizing the invaders are beyond redemption and the human race is about to be annihalated, he gives the order to ""nuke 'em!"" Wait a sec, we almost forgot. it doesn't matter what you hit 'em with because nothing will penetrate their shields. Sounds familiar. The prez gives a stirring speech and hops into an Air Force fighter jet. He wants a piece of them, himself. Whaddya mean that doesn't quite add up? Pretend you're six years old. Goldblum and Smith fly into space (never mind how) to rendevouz with the mother ship and download a virus into it's computer banks, using Jeff's trusty notebook computer. This, he thinks, will screw up the alien ""signal,"" our only chance to save mankind. Once this brilliant maneuver is executed, it will take down the shields from all the giant craft and we will be able to shoot them down, at least for a few precious minutes. The armed forces of other countries have been contacted by Morse Code and are ready to act in concert. The ridiculous virus strategy worked, of course, and Jeff and Will are heroes. So is the president, and so is the drunken crop duster pilot who makes the ultimate sacrifice. Too bad the First Lady took some shrapnel in the ass early in the flick and went down to defeat. Anyway, that's a wrap, people. Let's sling this piece of cheap dogfood into the can and go home. There's gonna be a cast party over at Will's house and attendance is mandatory. Do I make myself clear? Do you wanna get paid? Be there!",Independence Day
255,Mr_PCM,Simply a great fun movie,10,8 May 2005,"OK, If you are wanting a film that examines the meaning of life or some such other philosophically clever question, then you might as well stop reading now, for Independence Day certainly ain't for you. What it is is 2 hours of bam-splat mindless action, and a lot of fun. It is a film like this that reminds people what the movies were invented for - entertainment, pure and simple.The preposterous premise (well, a film like this had to have one) is aliens have come to annihilate life as we know it on earth. It then falls to a few plucky survivors, led by an heroic President of Earth (sorry, USA) to stave off the evil aliens' diabolical plans to use our planet for their own devious ends. That, basically, is it. A simple plot though is essential for a film where you just want to switch off, sit back and enjoy the show, and Independene Day delivers. Just make sure you realise at the outset that the film has its tongue firmly embedded in its' cheek. It is not a film to take seriously.Will Smith plays Will Smith (as he always does), in the form of a Captain in the United States marine air force. He is aided and abetted by the anally retentive genius Dr Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), the aforementioned gung-ho president (Bill Pullman), and an ex-marine (Randy Quaid) who has been abducted by the invaders before, and whose warnings have gone unheeded for years. Together they must dust off the rubble and beat off the aliens with a lot of big bangs and explosions.This was one of Smith's first films on the back of the success of the Fresh Prince TV series, and his wisecracking routine is therefore still relatively fresh and humorous here. OK the dialogue is horrendously corny, yet somehow endearing because of (or maybe in spite of) it. The jokes come thick and fast between the explosions, making Smith the perfect popcorn-movie actor. The lines are frequently laugh-out-loud bad, so bad they're good - ""I have got to get me one of these,"" ""Elvis has left the building"" and ""Now that's what I call a close encounter!"" being just some standout ones.The special effects are excellent (and deservedly won an Oscar), the standout moment being the full-frontal blow-out of the White House. Never let it be said that Emmerich wasn't daring! (In case anyone still isn't sure, he goes on to prove it again in The Day After Tomorrow.)The American jingoism is often hideously over-powering at times, to the extent where you want to stick two fingers down your throat as the world flocks to America's banner. Thank God for the Americans! seems to be the film's message to the rest of the world. Just wait for the President's inspiring speech on the eve of the final attack and his subsequent personal entry into the battle. What a guy! The Hollywood ending is so sugary it should carry a health warning as it may rot your teeth. But for all that, the movie is tremendous film, and if you can refrain from letting the incredulousness of it affect your viewing pleasure, then this is the perfect matinée entertainment. Just sit back and enjoy.",Independence Day
256,RunningFromSatan,These aliens have got some talent for blowing up cities!,9,28 February 1999,"The special effects for this movie were spectacular! (They did win an Academy Award for Special FX, so they must be good). The spaceships and the destruction sequences were very well done! This movie has a big all-star cast, including Will Smith (possibly the best actor in the whole movie besides Bill Pullman) and Randy Quaid was hilarious! This is a great sci-fi movie with a little humor mixed in to all of it",Independence Day
257,stebird,"We stand together, this is our Independence Day!",10,17 August 2017,"One of the first modern blockbusters, Independence day is a landmark achievement in film-making and made mega-money at the box office. A perfect story and a well told narrative to celebrate the Independence of America, as well as tackling the situation of an alien invasion head on; the formula of the story is a mixture of spectacular action and the human psyche, instead of mindless in-your-face grandeur, Independence Day opts for a more humane approach, adding tension and heightened emotion to the score. Unlike a whole load of other sci-fi films, in this film the physical appearance of the actual aliens is purposely limited, what they look like isn't important..., they limit this to a couple of scenes most famously in Area 51 where the alien attacks the doctor in the lab. In all honesty I believe this film to be Will Smith's finest, I see the man as a limited actor who hasn't got the greatest set of skills, but in Independence Day the guy was near perfect, embracing his role as Captain Steven Hiller with gusto and possesses an air of confidence unrivalled by any of his other film roles. The supporting cast most notably Jeff Goldblum's David pulled their weight with enthusiasm, each of them had a required sense of urgency about them, choreographing their characters so they fit handsomely into the bigger story. The premise seemed a little bit outrageous, this wouldn't happen in real life, if aliens did invade then the situation would be tackled very differently than how it is in the film, hence the story was tarted up for the big screen, overly elaborate in every department, this isn't a problem though because it's a fictional film and in every fictional film, there are deep exaggerations bordering onto the far-fetched. The recent sequel of Independence Day doesn't hold a candle to the original, the sequel does everything it shouldn't, resists no temptation and appears to be glorified and therefore terrible, not so with the original, this film has clear boundaries and doesn't dare to cross them once, twenty years apart? The equivalent of a million years in Hollywood, and can't you just tell the difference in quality between the two films.One of those films you can watch again and again and never get tired of, that's the mark of a top quality film..., one of the finest films of the 90's you'd be hard pressed to miss it.",Independence Day
258,MovieWarfare,They'll never let you fly the Space Shuttle if you marry a stripper,7,4 July 2020,"The 4th of July is almost upon and what movie is fitting for Independence Day? Of course, the movie ""Independence Day"" by Roland Emmerich. The premise is simple, aliens have come and attacked Earth on the 4th of July and the planet but mostly America has got to stop them. I've watched this movie years ago so rewatching it will be a very interesting experience.One thing I've remembered while starting this movie is how amazing and tension-filled that intro is. The scene with mankind's footprint on the moon getting blown away by the alien ship and the people on earth panicking about the ship in the sky is good stuff.My biggest praise for this movie has got to be the visual effects though which still look great even today. I think everyone remembers it since it was all in the marketing but the iconic white house getting blown up by the alien ship is just phenomenal honestly. Looking at how the movie was made and finding out that they built a miniature white house and blown it up which is cool. All the action scenes in this movie are just very thrilling and exciting to watch with its fast-paced air battles and spectacular explosions. The first act with the alien destruction and the final third act with the war is just so good! The movie contains a lot of comedic moments especially from Will Smith and they all gave me a slight chuckle and work in the movie's favour.Speaking of Will Smith, this and Bad Boys are the movies that practically launched his career to action fame and watching this movie again I can see why. Will Smith is extremely charming, funny and awesome as ""Captain Steven Hiller"". He punched an alien in the face while giving a cheesy one-liner, what more could you ask for? Jeff Goldblum is also likeable as the tech expert ""David Levinson"" and Bill Pullman is charismatic as the American President ""Thomas J. Whitmore"" and gives one of the most memorable speeches in movie history. The supporting cast is also great in their variety of different performances from the weird to the serious and they all do a great job.The negatives of this movie are very clear and it is that the plot is just very thin and bland. However, this is kind of expected since the movie is just an alien invasion but the movie runs for 145 minutes which is LONG. So the director does a lot of padding which ruins the pacing of this movie. This is especially noticeable in the second act where it feels like everything is slowing down and coming to a halt just so they can find a way to bring all the characters together and it just drags. Additionally, the movie has to find a way for humans to fight back and win but it is not very convincing. You are required to ignore questioning the logic of the plot and characters and dialling down the sense of believability for this movies plot to work.While I did praise the actors for their performance, the characters themselves are very lacking in depth. I don't feel like I understand any of the characters motives or backstory and none of the main characters changes by the end of the movie either. I never really cared for any of the characters dying and there are moments I've feel where they want you the audience to feel something but it doesn't work because none of the characters is that interesting for us to care. Well except for the dog who is a character we all care for and has a great moment in the movie. Rewatching the movie I've noticed how stereotypical the characters were which is probably why this movie was a product of the 90s and wouldn't be allowed today necessarily.Overall, the movie is still a fun movie to watch and even to rewatch. The true main star of this movie is the visual effects with its stunning action pyrotechnics giving us some of the best destruction in movie history. The production and set design are great and the amount of practical stuff is astounding as well. However, the movie is pretty cheesy and dumb with a very stupid conclusion which I've still find dumb even during my rewatch. One line still sticks to mind is ""they'll never let you fly the Space Shuttle if you marry a stripper"" and honestly I still think about that because it shouldn't affect ones flying ability but apparently that is important. Nevertheless, this movie is just pure spectacle filled fun and no doubt watching this movie was an enjoyable time which is all that matters in over the top, cliche movies like these.",Independence Day
259,CalDexter,A movie where the trailers turned out to be better than the feature.,4,23 September 2006,"I saw Independence Day twice in the cinema during the summer of 1996. The first time, i thought it was action packed, with stunning special effects with fantastic set pieces like New York and Washington D.C. being blown to pieces by the invading aliens. Then i had to see it again. This time i went with some friends.When i walked out after the second showing i realised that the film was disaster rubbish with sit com comedy dominating the entire feature. The proof is in the daft stereotypes. Jeff Goldblum takes the film seriously for about five minutes (during the arrival of the massive ships over the New York skyline) after that as far as Goldblum's concerned its Laurel and Hardy time with Will Smith's fighter pilot when they team up at the end to take on the mother ship. Then there is Will Smith. The director must have just said to smith 'Just be yourself' meaning Fresh Prince of Bel air in a military uniform. Smith is much better in Men In Black (a real comedy) and the excellent i, robot so it is a shame he just made his character into a complete parody of the Hero.Special mention must go to Randy Quaid for playing one of the most annoying characters in movie history. Rand's character is to this film what Jar Jar Binks was to the later Star Wars prequel The Phantom Menace.The potential to make a great invasion thriller with measured humour and stunning thrills and chills is lost amid silly comic capers and daft one liners between insipid characters. ID4 made a lot of money but for me (and my friends) it was one of the biggest letdowns of 1996.",Independence Day
260,nmholland,"Not the Greatest Film, But Definitely a Very Fun One",8,2 March 2016,"Independence Day is directed by Roland Emmerich and stars Will Smith, Bill Pullman, and Jeff Goldblum. These three characters represent an Air Force pilot (Smith), the President of the U.S. (Pullman), and a low life tech whiz (Goldblum). When aliens from outer space attack Earth, these three, along with the remaining survivors, must come together to defeat the aliens and restore freedom to the human race. This all takes place on the 4th of July, as well, because of America.To start, this movie isn't supposed to be serious, and it's not supposed to make too much sense. This film was purely made to be fun, and to entertain the audience. And that's exactly what it does. Although the movie isn't amazing critically, it's a blast in every way possible. I could watch this movie in the summer (heck, on Independence Day), when it's too hot to go outside, or on a cold winter day when I'm snowed inside the house and can't leave. This movie isn't The Shawshank Redemption (1994), but I'll watch this movie way more than I will Shawshank.Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith, and Bill Pullman do great in their roles. Will Smith plays the awesome action hero, that eventually learns to care about people other than himself, including his girlfriend and her son. Jeff Goldblum, while playing Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park (1994), plays a good science geek, that eventually becomes another action hero. Bill Pullman is actually believable as the President, and learns that being such a high up position means more than just having the title and giving commands; you have to personally help your people.The special effects are also great; in fact, they were ground- breaking for 1996. All of the shots of alien spaceships look really believable, and the use of practical effects on the aliens themselves was very smart. The shot of an alien ship blowing up the white house was amazing; I don't know how they did that.The only real bad thing about this movie is the human's plan to take down the aliens. I don't want to spoil it, but it doesn't make sense barely at all. It's plausible, but it's about a .00001% chance that it would actually work. However, the same could be said about Bill Pullman being the President.Overall, Independence Day is a very fun movie that's hard to look at critically. It has very few cons, and revolutionary special effects. I'm going to give Independence Day a B+, or an 8 out of 10.",Independence Day
261,Danimal-7,Almost as bad as reported,5,8 September 1999,"(Some spoilers).INDEPENDENCE DAY is the story of an attack on the planet Earth by the dumbest aliens in the universe.  In this movie, a heroic president (Bill Pullman), a crackerjack fighter pilot (Will Smith), and a computer programmer (Jeff Goldblum), with some help, manage to defeat the combined efforts of an entire species that has been scoping Earth out for decades in. . . two or three days.Words cannot describe how stupid these aliens are.  We'll leave aside the unlikelihood that a species thousands of years ahead of us technologically still hasn't advanced culturally beyond the rob-and-pillage society of the 13th-century Mongols.  It seems unlikely, but you have to admit that we humans have kept on being pretty brutal to each other despite our advancing technology.  But why would such aliens do something like blast Earth's cities, building by building, to get rid of us?  That's something like trying to exterminate ants by stomping on them one by one.  If the aliens wanted to get rid of us, they'd just bioengineer a microbe specifically bred to eliminate only humans, or whatever species they wanted to eliminate. Humans are only a hundred years at most away from being able to do this; to highly advanced aliens it would be routine, especially when they've putatively been spying on us and experimenting on us for decades.  They expose their flying saucers to attack from Earth's combined air forces, for no visible reason.  It's enough to make you wonder how these aliens ever lasted this long in the planet-conquering business.Then, of course, there's Goldblum using a computer virus to defeat the aliens, which makes about as much sense as the idea of using ENIAC to sabotage a Cray.  No, make that less sense.  And there's an alien that keels over at one punch from Will Smith but then kills half a dozen scalpel-armed lab technicians a few scenes later.  This goes beyond any reasonable suspension of disbelief; it's just plain lazy writing.Jeff Goldblum's acting is wooden and unappealing, and the characters are extremely one-dimensional.  I know some will say to forget about these matters and just be entertained, but that's not the point; I *need* to see some interesting people to be entertained, and the feeling of having my intelligence insulted makes for a less entertaining experience.  By the same token, thoughtful scripts and fleshed out characters aren't just more prestigious and more ""arty""; they're a lot more entertaining, too!Anyway, there are some good points to INDEPENDENCE DAY.  Aside from Goldblum, the acting is mostly pretty good.  Will Smith is passably cocky and arrogant, and Bill Pullman has some charisma as the president.  Judd Hirsch is so good that he manages to give some life to his cliche character. There are some humorous one-liners such as ""Welcome to Earth!"" and ""Nobody's perfect.""The special effects truly are breathtaking at times, as when the shadow of the alien ship creeps over whole cities at a time.  I truly did feel as the Carib Indians must have felt when Columbus landed on Hispaniola and confronted them with something totally outside the range of their experience.  Off the big screen, this effect would be lost, so I don't recommend renting this movie on video tape.A man like Whitmore could never be president of the United States, but I can see what Emmerich was trying for; this is the guy a lot of Americans wish they had as president, instead of the snake-oil salesmen we usually get. And while it's totally unrealistic, even given his pilot's experience, that Whitmore would fly in combat, it sure would be nice to have a president who knew that the country would survive just fine even if he died.  (America has had five presidents die in office; the country survived each time none the worse for wear).Oddly I feel compelled to defend this stupid movie from its detractors in at least one respect; its American patriotism.  Patriotism, American or otherwise, is not in and of itself a bad thing to have in a movie. CASABLANCA is loaded with French patriotism (they play La Marseillaise at least twice); THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING is chock full of British patriotism; the Oscar-winning MRS. MINIVER is also full of British patriotism;  EXODUS is to a great degree an exercise in Israeli patriotism; and the much-hailed ALEKSANDR NEVSKI is a celebration of Russian patriotism.  Americans should be allowed their own patriotic movies (though preferably higher quality than this one).  Pullman has repeatedly been excoriated for suggesting that July 4 would become an international holiday, completely missing the point that such a holiday would be celebrating not American independence, but rather the combined efforts of *all* the world's countries to fight off the alien scourge, an event that certainly would deserve international commemoration and which happened to occur on July 4.Lazy, dumb, overblown and insulting, INDEPENDENCE DAY is not worth renting. But it is not as worthless as some would have you believe, and if by some chance it returns to the dollar theater, you could do worse than see a little humor and some good special effects on the wide screen, if you're in a tolerant mood.Rating: ** out of ****.",Independence Day
262,Mccadoo,This movie has become part of my 4th of July,8,1 July 2011,"OK, so plot holes abound in this movie, and Jeff Goldblum being able to actually sync his laptop up to an alien computer is possibly one of the most absurd plot devices in the history of cinema, and the dog should have been flash fried, I know I know... But I don't care, for me this movie always reminds me of the American 4th of July holiday (I'm American obviously) which means summer and fun. I remember the media blitz in the US for this movie, it began months before the release date and all you saw everywhere were black billboards with nothing on them but ""ID4"". The promotion for this movie was huge and very well done. It opened on July 3rd and my then wife and I went to see it that night. It was the only time before or since I've seen a movie on its opening night because usually it's too crowded but my wife actually insisted, she'd been dying to see it for weeks. And it was indeed very crowded but it was also fun, it was the start of the holiday weekend and the movie was playing in multiple theatres and the air of anticipation after that marketing campaign was palpable. It was an event. Did the movie live up to all of that? No, not really, it's not a great film, it's not in my top five or ten favorites. It's a popcorn movie, a check your logic at the door movie. But what's wrong with that? Those types of movies are fun too. And Independence Day is at the very least, good fun entertainment on a big scale. And on that night, at the beginning of the 4th of July weekend, it was perfect. Possibly if I had seen it at any other time I would feel differently but I didn't, and I don't. Another much maligned film that also came out in the mid-90's, Armageddon, is another prime example of a great popcorn movie. Is it great cinema? Of course not, but it is a great sit back and be entertained movie. It's a movie movie, meant to be seen on a big screen and I don't care what anyone says, it's a fun, entertaining way to spend a few hours. Did the people around us in that theater on July 3rd, 1996 cheer or applaud at the end of Independence Day? No, they didn't, and neither did my wife and I, but we weren't disappointed either. It was a great way to kick off our 4th of July. And now, fifteen years later, I still enjoy watching it, I enjoy sitting down with some popcorn and just being entertained by a big budget movie that may not be great, but that gives you a good ride for a few hours. Independence Day delivers that in spades, every time I watch it.",Independence Day
263,charlessmith702210,One lone hero saves the world from evil alien ships,9,29 May 2006,"I believe that this is the best science fiction film since Close Encounters of the Third Kind and even 2001: A Space Odessey. Of course, ""Independence Day"" reminds Americans about July 4---a celebratory day with plenty of fireworks---but the main fireworks were there in the flick---lots of special-effect explosions in the combat scenes between the U.S. fighter jets and the ailen ships. Big explosions, small explosions...enough to make you wonder, when the next explosion will take place, as if you are seeing a real fireworks display.Yes, the movie is a lot more violent than ""E.T."", but there is still a lot of extraterrestrial elements there---from the voices of the ailens---to the sounds of the small alien fighter ships and their laser shots. It seems like the big combat scenes in the flick were taken out of the famous space fights in the Star Wars movies--particularly the ""Return of the Jedi"".There was one scene where authorities were trying to establish communication with the alien ships...It may not be the famous 5 notes-- B-flat, C, A-flat, A-flat an octave lower, and E-flat, like in ""Close Encounters"".....but it was through the help of a helicopter code-named ""Welcome Wagon"", which showed a visual type of communication through its light panels.You may have heard about the Japanese kamikaze pilots who crash their planes into Allied battleships in World War II, but this is what character Russell Casse does to completely destroy the monster ailen spaceship. Finding out that his fighter jet's missile failed......he decides to give up his life to save mankind....by going right into the path of the deadly laser beam in the center of the spaceship....with the failed yet armed bomb in it. The way the bomb blew up the whole ship seems like that bomb was a nuclear one. Sort of an unusual suicide mission for that character, isn't it?",Independence Day
264,ericjg623,Just sit back and enjoy!,8,8 July 2001,"This movie isn't about Oscar award winning acting, directing or writing and it doesn't explore deep, serious issues, nor does it try to be any of these things. It is simply great entertainment in the tradition of the big budget Hollywood Sci-Fi special effects extravaganzas. The plot is simple enough, and hardly original. Aliens arrive at our planet and intend to wipe up out. We fight back, and in the end human ingenuity and courage win the day.
What makes this movie work, quite simply, are the combination of the straight forward way the story is told, the basic competence of the actors (Jeff Goldblum, as always, plays the quirky science geek type character to perfection) and of course the awesome effects. If you see the DVD version of this movie, you can watch the companion disc which explains how they made everything from the aliens to the spectacular White House explosion scene. Clearly the people who made this movie wanted to spare no expense in creating absolutely stunning visuals, and they succeeded on every level.Quite simply, the way to see a movie like this is to just sit back and enjoy 2 hours of great entertainment.

267,jiangliqings,"It's average, no more, no less.",5,21 January 2001,"** out of ****It's been a while now since Independence Day had been a reigning box office champ.  I remember all the hype and media coverage over it.  The film broke box office records and had people clamoring over it.  Well, it's pretty much a forgotten film now, as nobody seems to really mention it anymore.  Either the ones that receive awful reviews (Battlefield Earth) or good to great reviews (Star Wars, The Matrix) are the big-budget sci-fi films that stay remembered.  Independence is just relentlessly mediocre.Taking place over the course of 3 days (basically the first 3 of July), the film begins with a gigantic spacecraft hovering over the moon.  Separate pieces disentangle itself from the mothership, 36 in all, and position themselves over the world's most powerful cities.  At this point, President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) is undecided as to what course of action to take.  Should they wait, or fire upon the alien ships.A brilliant cable repairman (Jeff Goldblum)-no kidding-figures out that the aliens are using a code through Earth's own satellites, and is actually a countdown, and when the clock ticks to zero, all of Earth will be decimated in a hailstorm of lasers.  He manages to warn the president in time (he's the ex-husband of one of the president's advisors, no less), and they evacuate just before the ships fire down on the cities, and soon 36 of the world's largest and most powerful cities have been reduced to rubble.The humans aim for a counterattack, with fighter jets to take down the ships, but as Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) and his squad figure out, these ships have some sort of force field that prevent penetration from any object.  With the exception of himself, Hiller's squad is completely destroyed, and he ends up in the deserts of Nevada, dragging an unconscious alien.  Eventually, all the characters meet in Area 51, buried secrets of the past are unearthed, and discussions and plans of ways of fighting back are brought into light.There's really nothing to get excited about concerning this film.  It has a few exciting action scenes, some humorous bits, and a barrage of outstanding special effects, but it's rather dissatisfying.  There's not nearly as much action as you would hope for, and I would like to have seen some hand-to-hand combat, not just some aerial dogfights.  The movie is basically hollow entertainment, and even then, it tries the patience with the slow buildup in the first hour.  If you want entertaining and non-stop sci-fi action, go with Starship Troopers, and if you want a better film a similar storyline, then just stick with Star Wars.Roland Emmerich isn't exactly a director that's well known for helming compelling scripts and Independence Day is no different.  The screenplay features a bevy of plot holes and blatant stupidity, most of which appear in the final half hour, as the ridiculous plan to fight back the aliens strikes me as lame-brained.  Emmerich is adept at handling special effects and action, but a good bit of it feels like it's for naught with some of the outright idiocy of the story behind it.The performances are merely average.  Will Smith is a lot of fun to watch as the hero, and he does turn in the most likeable and charismatic performance. Jeff Goldblum plays a genius as usual, and he's good at it, too.  It's just that everyone else is not so good.  Bill Pullman is pretty stiff, and while others do manage to put life into their roles, there's not nearly enough screentime given to them to put any signifigance into it.I suppose now that all the sound and fury is over, Independency Day really doesn't add up to too much, it's a major disappointment.  It's nowhere near being awful, but it has too many flaws to make this a film worth watching over and over again.",Independence Day
268,acdc_mp3,This movie would have been a 10 if not for Randy Quaid,9,3 July 2021,"Independence Day is a movie that has 2 personalities. One is a dark, sinister, and violent personality. The other personality is a cheesy, simple minded, cliche clotted dullard.The premise of the movie is truly scary and it was presented very well using practical effects that hold up today. The aliens are single minded in causing the extinction of the human race. Seeing how the humans are in this movie, I was rooting for the aliens.The cheese factor is off the charts so often you could make enough quesadillas to feed all of Mexico and then some.I could overlook all of this if not for Randy Quaid. I usually like him in the movies he is in, but I really wanted the aliens to probe him to the point he was out of the movie within 5 minutes. Are we really supposed to believe a drunken slob can fly an advanced fighter jet and kill the evil aliens? He was unbelievably annoying and seriously, I was rooting against him.All in all, though, I will always stop channel surfing when I stumble across it and watch until the end. The special effects and the pure evilness of the aliens made this movie worth watching.",Independence Day

270,nelliebell-1,The Jolly Rogger,7,10 January 2005,"The Motion Picture Independence Day was a film that wanted to be liked so badly that it bordered on absurdity,however as a film it possessed enough air head possibilities to make it the highest grossing film for the year 1996.This blockbuster film was not so much a film about aliens and the possibility of life existing elsewhere other than the planet earth but about what would occur if indeed these creatures were more advanced and could time travel and almost the whole family show up on the Fourth of July.I was one of the many persons who learning of the extreme blockbuster status that this movie gathered in the theaters went to see what it was about.There is perhaps good reason why reviewsnever get written and indeed I had to think about this blockbuster film to decide if it was worth writing a review.Iam still not so certain that it is worth much of a say outside of the near hysterical non-sense that we get bowled over by,sufficient enough to pick our pockets in exchange for a afternoon at the movies.One of the by products of this relatively new advent of the whole community writing a review about these pictures is that we are encouraged to participate in the activities and become if you will a contributor to its well being.Iam not so certain that such contributions are worthwhile and indeed it is not even the participation which is unwholesome but the fact that there is a very real underpinning to all this that borders on a shameful illusion and it only provides for a lie that gets its way.Some of the problem to judging this film like the motion picture itself, is the value that it provides for,which is not only suggestive but as well unsupported.The boastful goings on of the film are showy and indicate a look at me mentality,however that not withstanding,it isn't where the fault is,it is in the assumption that we all care and that everyone from all around the world is paying attention to the Americans.The undesirable prospect is if that be true then there is reason why this film is so worldly and that is because it wants to be certain that it is noticed and indeed viewed by as many as can be gotten into the theaters.The Gross Figures indicate somewhere around 340 million dollars,second to none for the year.There is an illustration provided as to this films coercive abilities in the two columns along the side of the page.There is a goofs column and a factual/details column and much more.I have never seen so many different errors,details,and goofs at all and yet it sold like a barn on fire.The leveling off is this,the picture provided for a unreasonable assumption that in a manner of speaking was awarded for the ability to do so in its special effects.It does this by creating an idea of importance that some 70 different news broadcasts were used as a means to coerce public opinion,and that if you will is something like a picture within a picture The definition as to the cause effect of the press core and its influence is said to be the equivalent of the event occurring even as suggested only on a television screen.The real point is just how much does so much influence,really influence our daily lives.What in fact is reality?Were paying for it,we certainly have the right to know.This consequence due to non-sense is further highlighted with a series of other questions.The picture being a unsupported position can then be asked what is being encouraged if the premise as to the film is ridiculous? For one thing boasting and showing off and for another,power over another is assumed.That is both blatant in its underpinning as well as seductive.The seduction is provided in the scene where the female who is a exotic dancer is preparing to marry Capt.Hillard.She does a seductive zip my dress up with her angel,who is no more than maybe 9 or 10 years old.I think that that kind of suggestion is inappropriate even bordering on improper.Little boys like Little girls are innocent and though it is suggested that the girls grow up faster then boys,it is the boys who are rebellious. That scene is mean as it is suggestive and even provocative because parents should know better and when they do not provide for the child some moral fiber as to conduct they allow for a fast lane idea which allows a deviate basis as to conduct.Though there is more to suggest all I can say that deviant conduct is not about sexual proclivities it is about crime and a problem in society,all stemming from the child's upbringing.This is not a simple idea and neither is what this film is selling.Hollywood is not such that we should know these back-lots and warehouses lest we stumble upon the next academy award. The special edition provided for the actor Harvey Fierstien making like a Pink Flamingo and planting one on Jeff Goldblum,to everyones surprise.Its not too cool and Iam glad it wasn't the special edition that aired in the theaters.It is difficult to judge performance however the main stay of the film seemed to have actors playing parts but that was the jest of it-It was not much more than that and though this may not mean anything it always seemed that when suggestions were finally set in motion they were objected to inappropriately and out of time.There is a disjointed idea about importance,honesty and this picture and never the twain shall meet.Iam not kidding this really is a very stupid film.The timing and appropriateness of certain comments seemed to be emphasized when the aliens are closing in on closing us out and then we learn that we knew all about them.I don't know but things just had a hard time adding up-the aforementioned columns with the errors and details perhaps will shed some light on all the problems this film exhibited.",Independence Day
271,alicespiral,Keep telling yourself its only a movie,10,17 February 2007,"Its full of holes,its unrelated to anything logical but its a movie made with the intention of Entertaining People. Happily it wasn't full of technical jargon which could give my brain a hernia.It just got on with the main business-how many people could be killed I watched it on DVD and its now 10 years after.I couldn't help but think of how Blair and Bush would have coped with all this! Now that we have computer games on DVD it looks just like that-a computer game. You could ask a million questions about the plot-like when one of the aliens speaks its in English! The explosions are great-but with major cities being zapped out all over the globe the reality is it would have caused massive Earthquakes and floods to say nothing of a communication breakdown.In other words no single computer would have worked. But logic wasn't the name of the game here. Entertainment WAS and I enjoyed it-in fact I'll watch it again",Independence Day
272,mfisher452,Some great special effects but not much else,2,24 September 2003,"Readers of Arthur C. Clarke's classic ""Childhood's End"" will recognize the opening of this film, because that novel started in a similar way: Gigantic alien ships enter Earth's atmosphere and hover over our major cities. But oh, what a difference. Clarke's Overlords look like Satan but are a wise, kind and noble race. Under their stewardship, the human race enters a Golden Age of peace and prosperity, later to undergo a great cataclysmic transcendental transformation that foreshadows ""2001."" Too bad they couldn't be bothered to make that story but instead made this one: A lame, uninspired eco-fable with a few spectacular special effects and one or two good ideas, but basically a violent mess. (Possible spoilers) An alien race shows up in our skies. In the process, they use our communications satellites against us (apparently they can cross interstellar space but can't deploy their own satellites). Their great ships hover over our major cities (how do they know which ones are the most important? How do they know what the White House, etc., is?). After a day or two (why did they wait?), the ships activate beam weapons that destroy entire cities. In a ridiculously contrived scene, the aliens communicate telepathically with the U.S. president; this is so the audience can learn why they have come. They plan to occupy our planet, strip it of its resources (I guess we humans aren't raping our natural world aggressively enough), and then pick up and move on to the next planet of lamebrained autochthons. But a few American fighter pilots and a computer whiz team up to OUTWIT AND DEFEAT AN ENTIRE ADVANCED ALIEN RACE THAT HAS THE TECHNOLOGY TO CROSS INTERSTELLAR SPACE. Go figure.Not only the basic plot is laughable; the film is also blighted by the totally illogical behavior of most of the human characters, not one of whom manages to rise above caricature. Bill Pullman plays a totally underwhelming U.S. president and the wonderful Mary McDonnell has very little to do as the First Lady except die. Judd Hirsch tries to be funny but is actually rather offensive as a Jewish alte kakker. Jeff Goldblum plays his nice Jewish son, who was once married to the ultimate Catholic shiksa (Margaret Colin) and still pines for her; she is now a presidential adviser. Will Smith's role comes closest to that of a real person; he is a fighter pilot. Viveca A. Fox is his luscious girlfriend, but you have to figure she has more mammaries than brains when she goes to her regular job as an exotic dancer with a monstrous spaceship hovering over L.A. Later on, they get married; I guess this is meant to reflect the fact that people actually have done impulsive things like get married in the middle of a war to try to prove that life goes on, or to declare their love when the husband is a soldier and is going off into mortal danger; but here it does nothing but interrupt the flow of the film. Harry Connick plays the U.S. Air Force's stupidest fighter pilot. He makes me wonder how we prevailed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Brent Spiner plays a caricature of a mad scientist who is the project leader investigating one of the aliens' fighter craft, which was THE alien spaceship that crashed in Roswell in the 1940s. Robert Loggia plays a caricature of an Air Force general. Randy Quaid plays a caricature of a burned-out alcoholic pilot who was actually abducted by the aliens during one of their scouting visits to Earth years before. He gives his life to destroy an alien spaceship in one of the film's most ludicrous scenes. And so it goes.It is true that any computer can emulate any other computer, but in these days of computer literacy, most viewers of ID4 will have personally experienced compatibility problems with their PCs: Programs that won't run correctly, or at all, under their particular version of Windows, etc. Modern corporations have platoons of engineers who do nothing all day but struggle to keep their networks on line. So it stretches credibility way past the breaking point when Jeff Goldblum's character USES AN ORDINARY LAPTOP TO INFECT THE ENTIRE ALIEN COMPUTER NETWORK WITH A VIRUS THAT DEACTIVATES THEIR ENTIRE DEFENSIVE APPARATUS. I would love to have been at the story conference where they came up with that gobbler. It must have been real desperation time. Either that, or the writers have nothing but contempt for the viewers. And they must have run out of money on the pyrotechnics and had nothing left over for the alien special effects, because the aliens are astonishingly lame and unconvincing.Modern CGI technology is now advanced enough that 'Childhood's End' could be successfully put on the screen. I hope that someone does so; unlike this turkey, it may actually be worth watching.",Independence Day
273,KillerLord,A Beautiful Action Flick!,10,29 September 2008,"Many people seem to have a problem with this picture. Some people do not like it because it is an action movie. Some people do not like it because it takes a well established, tried and tested plot of hostile aliens, rather than the friendly alien like ET. Some people have a problem because of the eventual method that is used by one of the lead characters of the movie in order to bring down the defense system of the aliens. But I do not find any of this too objectionable to down rate this movie as much as I have seen it has been. The story starts with alien space ships taking strategic positions across the various major cities of the world. We see an amazing effect of the city being engulfed by the shadow of the mammoth space ship hovering over it. And then, people are divided in opinions about the intention of these spaceships. Of course, it is clear from the kind of positions the ships take that the intentions are more hostile than friendly. But yet people literally throw a welcoming party for the aliens and of course pay a price for it. Some of these things have led to severe criticism from many viewers and critics. But let us put these aside for a while and see what happens next. The alien ship fires an incredibly powerful weapon that leaves the city in wreck. The sound and sight of this destruction is the strength of the movie. The movie is about war and it is war that this movie shows beautifully. And the next thing you have is an attempt by the best fighter planes trying to take the ship out. But they realize that there is a computerized shield that protects the ship. The movie follows through and finally shows the computer wizard realizing that a computer virus can disable the ship's shields for enough time so as to allow an obliteration of the ships. Again, many people have criticized this. Well, the argument goes that a civilization so advanced could not be weak enough for a virus. But there are many things we do not know about this civilization. Let us not forget that it our tendency to think in a certain way that eventually led to the creation of viruses. Did the aliens think in the same way? Mostly not! Thoughts, ideas and civilization, in general, would have advanced completely differently for them and they surely would not have even heard of a computer virus. So, I personally feel that this idea is not as bad as people are calling it. For smooth fight sequences and computer graphics, this movie is in a different league altogether. I cannot think of a better way of doing all the action sequences. Critics may argue that there are loop holes in the plot and yes, some of these loop holes are strong enough to ensure the movie does not go down in cinematic history, but I still would like to give it a ten on ten for I have found the merits overwhelmingly more striking than the demerits. A beautiful action movie indeed!",Independence Day

275,michael-3204,Sets a high bar for disaster spectacles,8,6 July 2015,"If you're looking to poke ""Independence Day"", it gives you plenty of ammunition, including an abundance of clunky dialogue, some cornball characterizations (and a few actors who crank up the corn to 11 -- namely Harry Connick Jr. and Randy Quaid), occasional poor CG, boring creature design, and a miraculous magical plot contrivance that is supposed to save the day for us humans. I think all of that is compensated for by the giddy, go-for-broke exuberance with which the movie amps up the scale of destruction, even while keeping the story tightly focused on a handful of nicely played characters who the story brings together smoothly and effectively. Amidst the dialogue groaners and the fake-looking fireballs, it's easy to miss all the big and small things the movie does right -- especially, of course, laying waste to New York, Los Angeles and Washington D.C. in a thrilling cross-cut sequence. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum play off each other better than I would have expected and they are supported by an able cast who create a credible ensemble, one member of which actually dies (something disaster movies seem to have forgotten how to do of late). Though the creature design was pedestrian even at the time, the set design of the alien ships remains imaginative and visually compelling. All in all, this film is a blast.",Independence Day

Most obvious was the dearth of ""hi emotion"" moments which are the high notes of a really good film, when the Adrenalin pumps and the endorphins flow.2. Which made me dig up a copy of this movie which I rewatched and thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. Acting, writing, direction, hi notes -- all here. This film is a 9 or a 10.

Anyone expecting any sort of patriotism from this film should have their eye's and mind rechecked. It doesn't offer enough for you to feel any sympathy for the characters. It DOES offer enough action and special effects to thrill you however. So this begs the question. Does all of the technical know-how and eye candy substitute dialogue? Should every film in the future like Godzilla, Battlefield Earth, Start Trek: Generations, The Phantom Menace, continue to exist where the only reason why they were even made is to a) exploit the audience's weakness for mind-blowing FX, or b) build on an ego?ID-4 had some good moments, when the invading aliens were in the picture and they use their weaponary. Then we're involved with the heroes. Harry Connick Jr. for lack of better words was retarded in this film and had no place in it. Hence the ego statement earlier. At times the people in the movie were frightened from the alien experience, then zany, then happy, then sad again. Do they even know that nearly a third of the world is in ruins? Does Will Smith even remember that his ""so we are led to assume"" buddy Harry Jr. died just seconds ago when he pulled out a tacky one liner ""Welcome to Earth."" at the aliens?ID-4 is a brainless movie attempting to bring out good feeling of patriotism just like Armageddon. The fun factor isn't all too well with this one. Some characters were just a bit too dissappointing and annoying for me to bear.

279,RichardKleiner,This film doesn't deserve anything higher than a five,2,13 May 2008,"Independence Day may be the best example of what I know as ""Bad Hollywood"". Although I not consider myself such an expert in movies as to spot an excellent screenplay, this movie may be an easy choice for noticing a bad screenplay.Why, do you ask? Well, let's sum up this to five scenes or situations with a memorable quote from each.#5 TV NEWS ANCHORMAN-""Once again, the L.A.P.D. is asking Los Angelenos not to fire their guns at the visitor spacecraft. You may inadvertently trigger an interstellar war"".Apparently, people in the US are stupid enough to think that with a six bullet revolver they can inflict damage to a spaceship that covers the entire sky and could easily squash one half of a city if it landed on it. Or at least, that's what the Network executives think.#4 CONSTANCE (Before leaving David and his father alone in the Oval Office) ""Don't touch anything.Even if it was allowed that a White House employee let civilians inside the place where the President works, there still should be some security, don't you think? Whatever person that may be allowed to enter the Oval Office may have his own personal political agenda and vandalize the place, or at least take a little souvenir, from a fountain pen to the desk itself. But that seems to stop both characters after the instruction of ""Don't touch anything"".#3 UNSPECIFIED FARMER (After pesticide has landed on the wrong field) ""If your father doesn't come in 20 minutes, I'm hiring someone else"".What a threat! If I was the farmer, I would be personally furious, and would have said something like ""When he comes, I'll junk his stupid biplane and beat the living hell out of him with the fuselage parts"". But this one gives him twenty minutes to come, considering hiring someone else. Again, if I was that farmer, I wouldn't consider it. I would hire someone else right away! #2 JULIUS ""It's Air Force One, for crying out loud, and still he gets sick!"" This time, the previous two civilians manage to inconspicuously enter Air Force One without previous authorization, just because they told the President to run away. No matter the heroics, I'm pretty sure the President never lets anyone with no business on board the plane to just ""shoe in"".#1 PRESIDENT WHITMORE ""Today we (the world) celebrate our Independence Day"" The final line of the most hated speech in Hollywood cinema by every single anti-American in the world. I personally don't have anything against the US, but still this rather globally view of an American holiday may result a little bit insulting.I've left out some quotes as I don't remember them literally. Still some scenes are probably some of the worst in a script and in a movie.For instance, Steven (Will Smith) and Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) are discussing about him leaving her, while an alien spacecraft is over their skies, just as if nothing is happening aside from a dog barking in the yard. The United States have three of those huge ships above three of their most important cities. Still every other country has only one ship above it's capital, including Russia, a much bigger country with other cities besides Moscow (like St. Petersburg or Stalingrad).If you could make a game of drinking a shot of alcohol for every stupid line you find in the movie, you would need two bottles.There were stuff I liked. The effects of course, are state the art, but that doesn't redeems the lousy script (whose weight was the action sequences and nothing else). The fighter planes sequences were actually very good, as I love battle scenes, and also the mother ship sequences. The kneeling down sequence in the locker room stole a chuckle.The movie overall it's not as bad as others, but it's still very bad.The script is for idiots who have never seen a movie (not just about US politics or Earth disaster movies, but overall any good movie). The performances, coming from otherwise good actors, are forced and completely embarrassing. The famous score by David Arnold, while spectacular and good, is too much for the movie. It's too dramatic and over the top for rather meaningless scenes. It may be that the music works better without the movie.It's over patriotic tones are almost obscene. This is rather pathetic, knowing the fact that co-writer/director, Roland Emmerich, is German and by the time this movie was being made, he still had his German accent ""Zis mofie vill be great"".It's not even fun to watch, except for the action sequences.While some may disagree with me and consider it much better, I would object to giving the movie ten stars, as there are far better alien invasion movies around and this one has major flaws (again, the whole script). Even as I was entirely crazy, drunk, high or all of the above, I couldn't rate it higher than 5, but I'm pretty sure it deserves a 2/10 (one for the effects, another for the action sequences and that's pretty much it).",Independence Day

Well, look no further than the obscure cult hit Independence Day to satisfy your patriotic yet culturally sensitive desire for alien ass- kicking. What can you say about Independence Day? It's like a birthday cake that explodes in your face. You sit there smiling and licking the frosting off your cheeks saying, ""Mmm... cake!"" Then you realize that you're covered in frosting and you want to eat something more substantial and nutritious. But that doesn't mean that exploding cakes aren't awesome! Independence Day is the best exploding cake that will ever give you a frosting facial of fun!Bill Pullman plays the president of the world ...ahem... the USA and when he learns that giant round discs are entering Earth's atmosphere, his eyes narrow a bit out of concern but his presidential poise is not shaken. You see, President Personality is just biding his time until he gets to fly a fighter plane and face off against the telepathic cockroaches himself. But the rest of the world goes batspit crazy and the alien invaders waste no time in letting the human race know that their paranoia is quite valid as they proceed to show that they love to blow s*** up. Jeff Bloomingold is here and his job is to wear glasses and say smart stuff. Will Smith is here too and his job is to offer the viewers the kind of wholesome blackness that's just edgy enough for you to go, ""That's what I'm sayin'!"" without getting a look of shock from your grandmother. Robert Loggia even has a job here. It's up to him to give a gravelly voiced delivery of all the dire implications of what's going on. Or is that what's going down? If you're a semi-elderly viewer or just a complete square, this is where you are grateful to Will Smith for providing you with some clue as to what's cool. Or is that what's hot? Anyway, for those who thought show-boating couldn't be charming, you might want to witness Will as he evades and ultimately doops an alien aircraft using nothing but puns, a parachute and an eject button. Will Smith's trash-talking will have you basking in redemptive glory after having lost his best friend mere seconds earlier. It's for this reason that you can forgive the rehashing of all too familiar Star Wars ace pilot jargon that occurs in the same action sequence. A pilot yells, ""There's too many of 'em"" while another yells ""I can't shake him! I can't shake him."" Equally forgivable is Smith giving references to two other alien movies within ten minutes of screen time.

281,Laitue_Gonflable,Good enough,6,9 July 2003,"It's been a long time now since Independence Day was released, and indeed a long time since I first saw it, and I have since seen it at least three more times. Each time I watch it I can't help but enjoy it but, increasingly so, also can't help but laugh at the triteness of it all. While it is essentially a fantasy story about fighting for your life and winning, it is all SO cute, and SO perfect, and SO convenient that you can never take it seriously.Obviously, it doesn't ask to be taken seriously but there are certain parts that really make you cringe. Firstly, I have to say that, as an Australian, I find it a little ludicrous the central American-ism of it all. Naturally I would assume that, if aliens were to invade Earth, our survival would most likely rely on the US, but I don't feel that the movie deals with the rest of the world in a large-enough scale. It does mention Australia, and England, and the Iraqi desert at times, but only briefly, and completely inconsequentially, and I always think that if they wanted to include them at all, they could have delved slightly more deeply into international cooperation and communication, or otherwise just omit it entirely and just leave it to implication that the entire planet is under threat. As it occurs, the references and brief scenes just come off as tokenism and it's frankly quite annoying.But apart from that little irk that gets me every time, the film is entertaining escapism. Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum and Randy Quaid make enjoyably unlikely heroes, while Bill Pullman pulled off, to me at least, a surprisingly good performance as the President. And it is enjoyable and it is triumphant and it does leave you with a good feeling, so at the end of the day, what else really matters?I just thought I'd put my thoughts to the keyboard.

283,jmmustchin,Awesome disaster-action movie,10,18 November 2018,"Independence Day is (in my opinion) one of the two greatest disaster movies ever made, alongside Deep Impact. The movie begins on July 2nd, when an enormous alien space craft is seen passing by the moon. The US military soon detect the anomaly. A series of city-sized craft are released from the mothership, and take up position over many of the world's major cities. Electronics expert David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) decodes an alien signal indicating they are going to attack. He manages to warn President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) and flee Washington - just barely escaping the city's destruction. The heat rays in the alien craft obliterate all of the major cities that had craft parked over them - and almost all of their inhabitants. They then begin moving from city to city, intending to exterminate humanity. The survivors must regroup, band together and fight back against the alien invaders.The movie is very exciting, with brilliant tension (especially in the half hour before the cities' destruction - man, is that a breath-holder!). The acting is splendid - especially from Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. The movie is also brilliantly plotted. It has a considerable air of mystery about it, which adds to the delightful experience that watching it is.But the special effects in this movie are INCREDIBLE. Quite honestly, this movie contains among the best - and certainly most real-looking - effects I've ever seen (the only movies I've seen with more real-looking effects being the first two Jurassic Parks). They're so real, they're almost scary.And, by the way, I highly recommend viewing the Extended Version. It's better - and makes more sense.",Independence Day

287,crash21,Entertaining but unbelievable,8,29 June 2015,"I will admit, I have loved Independence Day ever since the movie came out. The movie has a good story with a great set of special effects.In the beginning; when the when the SETI guy hears a radio signal while he's listening to REM's song ""It's the end of the world as we know it"", I call that a classic moment. Then including Jeff Goldblum's entry to the movie and the aliens sudden invasions to blow-up the cities. The fight back is rather entertaining, but the movie starts going down once they go into the whole Area 51 alien myth (a place that in real life isn't even called Area 51 officially).I love the movie up to the the stuff with Will Smith, his character has some of the most ridiculous macho-man scenes, in rather unbelievable action scenes along with his tribute to the tobacco companies. Along side Jeff Goldblum's saving of the world with an overnight written computer virus for the aliens is rather unbelievable, especially since he starts this immediately after he was tripping around drunk.If anything, a movie like Independence Day is 100 times better than movies like E.T. and Contact. Although, Independence Day always makes me think of a quote from the movie's producer (Bill Pay) who made a quote in a classic Discovery Channel documentary ""Inside Area 51"": ""I, in my heart, would like to think that there are aliens at Area 51, but don't really believe it until I see more.""",Independence Day
288,JosephPezzuto,Reel Look: Independence Day,6,4 July 2015,"""Welcome to Earth!"" Sci-fi disaster flicks don't get any bigger than this 1996 blockbuster, oozing destruction and explosions left and right on practically every frame. The forty-seventh highest grossing film of all time, it was at the forefront of the large- scale disaster film and science resurgences of the mid-to-late 1990s. But do the effects outweigh character? Let's take a look. Director Roland Emmerich takes us on a roller coaster ride in saving the world from non-peaceful extraterrestrials of whom, rather than the friendly aliens from 'Close Encounters' and 'E.T.', are bent on planning to decimate the very existence of mankind with their monstrously menacing mothership, where in one sequence the White House is blasted to smithereens. The film also features an all-star cast: Bill Pullman (as United States president Thomas J. Whitmore playing a Bill Clinton-esque persona, alongside the Hillary-esque First Lady portrayed by Mary McDonnell), Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson, an MIT-educated computer expert, chess enthusiast and environmentalist, the cool, charming and cocky Will Smith as Captain Steven Hiller,an assured U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18 pilot and Randy Quaid as Russell Casse, a widowed alcoholic redneck and Vietnam veteran who claims to have been abducted by the aliens a decade before the present Martian invasion and of whom eventually sacrifices himself to save mankind. As far as it's concerned, it's just a spectacle-filled summer popcorn flick that presents a visually slick and fast-paced adventure, boasting expensive special effects and large-scale action sequences that appears more of an actual character than anyone actually in front of the camera, borrowing liberally from H. G. Welles' 'War of the Worlds', 'Aliens' and every sci-fi invasion film in between. Poor on character development but dripping with all-too realistic visual effects, 'Independence Day' nonetheless thus resulted as an international smash-hit, and remains a big and loud sci-fi extravaganza, exploding with gigantic visual grandeur of stunning visual proportions that were, and still are, out of this world.",Independence Day

292,dutchs-1,Why all the pseudoscience?,7,1 June 2016,"Much as I like the film from an action standpoint, I give it 7 stars for being full of just plain stupid science fiction clichés. An object one fifth the mass of the moon would show up from its gravitational effects long before getting anywhere close to Earth. Then it sheds a fleet of ships 15 miles in diameter that station themselves over major world cities. Ships that huge would be almost impossible for anything short of a nuclear weapon to damage, plus big enough to house fleets bigger than any nation's air force. But no, they have to have shields, too. Then it turns out the aliens have - you'll never see this coming - telepathy, too. In desperation, the President orders a nuclear strike. A ship 15 miles in diameter and a mile thick would suffer a hole maybe a couple of miles across. Something that, on the scale of that ship, would just buff out. But, no, the shield protects the ship. It's not like they'd be likely to have a defense system capable of shooting down any incoming weapon. And of course, there's something big and secret at Area 51, where we have an alien ship under study. I'm surprised they didn't work in the Bermuda Triangle and the Maya calendar. Meanwhile, the First Lady has been fatally injured and turns up at Area 51 to say good-bye. Ridiculous. There's this huge underground lab with all sorts of equipment, and not a single person with any medical training? Not even someone with combat medic training? She's dying. Operate, already. She can't end up any more dead than if you just sit there and do nothing.When the mother ship popped into town, the captive ship at Area 51 turned on, to the joy of everyone because ""we couldn't replicate their power source."" So then Jeff Goldblum decides to fly it by hooking up a terrestrial laptop. So if the alien ship used unknown power, how did the terrestrial PC communicate? Because terrestrial computers use ordinary electricity to send signals. The much ridiculed assumption that the aliens lack firewalls and computer protection pales into insignificance against our not being able to start up the alien systems when they can obviously use electricity.Oh, spoiler alert, we don't all die.",Independence Day

The characters here were poorly drawn, the American flag-waving a little excessive, Bill Pullman gives one of the WORST ""rally 'round the flag"" speeches ever (he should see Kenneth Branagh's St. Crispin's passage in ""Henry V""), and a severe drop-off in the second half of the film.  This could have been a great one...I was also struck by how incongruous a couple Pullman and Mary McDonnell were.  And, I was amused by the thought that if all exotic dancers were as attractive AND resourceful as Viveca Fox, the question of who will be the nation's first female presidential candidate is resolved.  Oh, well...what happened to the sense of discovery or wonder that infused the early SciFi films of the 50s and 60s, where real questions about progress and humanity were raised?

Best sequences were of the cities destruction  but surely a more effective way (neutron radiation?) could have been devised to wipe out mankind with such advanced technology? Apart from the effects sequences the film was full of plot holes, completely unbelievable & predictable and had an unbearable 'gung-ho' American attitude. There were references to Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Dr Strangelove' as well as more than a passing similarity to the 1953 film version of H.G. Wells 'The War of the Worlds' and 1977's 'Star Wars'. All of these films were far superior.Absurd sequences include the following: knocking the alien unconscious  then later the same alien is virtually invincible and seems to be much larger; Air Force Ones's very narrow escape from Washington (and the fact that the President would be allowed to stay in The White House until the last moment); the fact that the spaceships were so indestructible & fast and that there were so many of them versus the air force jets; the absurdly easy way in which an Apple PowerBook was able to interface (remotely) with the alien's computers and shut down their force shield; the way in which the alien craft conveniently did not crash on top of Area 51 when it was brought down; the idea of the President piloting a jet like Luke Skywalker; and the ease with which all the alien craft were brought down around the world when it took the entire might of the USA air force to destroy the one above Area 51 (even without the force shield).

300,lwjoslin,1776 meets 1957,8,15 August 2003,"ID4 is ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"" with a budget.  But it also owes a great deal to any number of other, earlier alien-peril/sky-fi flicks. Most obvious among these is ""The War of the Worlds,"" including the unsuccessful use of the Bomb and the ultimate demise of the invaders by means of a virus (albeit a computer virus this time).  ""ID4"" also borrows from the ""Star Wars"" saga, mainly the massive dogfight battles and an against-all-odds, intrusive attack on the Death Star-esque mothership.  Despite the spectacle of the destruction of entire cities, the movie is tremendously upbeat.  Ironically (since director/co-writer Roland Emmerich is from Germany), ""ID4"" celebrates a lot of traditional American values: bravery, heroism, self-sacrifice, helping one another in the face of disaster, resourcefulness, love, loyalty, faith, the Bomb and the reluctance to use it, marriage, family--and ham radio.  Emmerich also showed a similar grasp of basic Americana in ""The Patriot,"" though his remake of ""Godzilla"" is about as non-Japanese as could be imagined.  Predictably, a great many critics sneered at the movie for its embrace of such ""old-fashioned"" values.  They preferred that summer's ""other"" alien-invasion flick, ""The Arrival.""

Technically, they were very well done, but uninspired. They had a huge challenge, making a stupid plot into a visually interesting movie, and failed.The ""science"" in this pitiful space opera was consistently stupid. Spoiler (as if a movie this bad and widely-seen could be spoiled): Computer virus? Give me a break. The only way those aliens could have failed would have been a War of the Worlds defeat by infection -- a virus that actually hurt the aliens themselves. Sure, it's been used before, and isn't very biologically plausible, but it's not as stupid as jet engine technology defeating starship technology.The acting was decent, but the movie would have been more fun if it had been terrible. That would have at least given the movie some camp value.Comparisons: The plot of The Fifth Element was silly, but not a ""same old thing"" story. The visual effects in it were sometimes well-made, and sometimes cheesy, but always interesting. Independence Day's effects were well-made, but still not interesting.Independence Day came out around the same time as the excellent The Arrival, and almost entirely overshadowed it.

I am 16 now and was only 8 when it was released so I didn't really understand it, but having watched it again recently now older and maturer I get the plot and I think this movie is very well written, acted and directed. So overall it is a great movie. It never gets boring for a minute and moves very qucikly with some simply fantastic special effects shots, such as the devastation of New York, Washington and LA along with some great air battles and suspense moments. The plot is simple. Millions of aliens in giant spaceships are moving through galaxy after galaxy consuming every natural resource in its path, moving on afterwards and Earth is next. Jeff Goldblum figures it out and warns the President, Bill Pullman to evacuate the main cities as soon as possible. However by the time this happens its too late. People are so silly and panic driven that they all get blown to smithereens. The survivors around the world (inlcuding Will Smith and Randy Quaid in one of their greatest performances!) then try and try to bring down the ships. They try just about eveything until they finally figure out how to do it.Anyway this movie is brilliant and deserved to do well at the Box Office considering the amount of effort put into making it. The rating should be in the 8.1 or 8.2 region as far as I'm concerned, not 6.0. The movie as I've already said moves fast and the effects are great but the best part of it are the performances of the actors and the script which I think are both flawless. The scenes where they're talking about there plans to bring the ships down are found difficult to understand by some people but I found them very easy and they are certainly well written. The main characters being Smith, Pullman, Quaid and Goldblum are great and this movie is great!Go watch it! 10/10",Independence Day

Independence Day is a real collection of brilliance, combining the typical B Movie story of the 1960s with the technology of the 1990s, and Roland Emmerich's magic wand of directing blends it to perfection!The story is your typical sort of B Movie thing, Aliens arrive, cause trouble, so we kill them, the end. But the way its executed is what makes it unique to other films of similar genre, and all of these points are entirely plausible. The Aliens seem plausible, the plot seems plausible, the way we destroy the aliens seems plausible, the characters and their backgrounds seem plausible, so generally, this film doesn't stray too far from reality, which makes it better than other films which would have us believe that we destroyed the aliens using pop-tarts catapulted from the side of Mount Rushmore.Overall, a really good film to watch, although it can be quite scary for some younger audiences as well as the use of bad language and battle violence, its just a great little film to watch, just sit back and enjoy the ride! :D",Independence Day
309,yourfavoritecritic,Serviceable with Excellent Craftsmanship!,5,25 February 2021,"Released in 1996, Independence Day is directed by Roland Emmerich and stars Will Smith, Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum. The film tells the story of an alien invasion that threatens to wipe out all of mankind.
Having never seen Independence Day but being familiar with some of Emmerich's other work in the late 2000s and 2010s, I was looking forward to checking this film out after hearing so much about it for years. Sadly I didn't connect with Independence Day the way I wanted to, however, there are certainly aspects to the film I can appreciate. It's easy to tell there was a lot of love poured into the craftsmanship of the movie; the various models used and the combination of practical and special fx really makes this film pop. Although some of the cgi is a little dated given that it's been over two decades since the film was originally released, much of it still looks fantastic and I must praise the filmmakers as they weren't overly reliant on it to tell the story. There were moments during the two-and-a-half-hour runtime where I thought I was watching a film that released maybe a ten years ago and not in 1996. I'm sure the fx was even more mind-blowing back in the day but it's truly commendable that this film has stood the test of time in that department and is most comparable to an early Spielberg film or an original Star Wars movie.Herein lies one of my biggest complaints about the film, even though the special effects work behind the movie definitely gave me a Star Wars vibe, so did its story. There were times where I felt I was watching some long, lost Star Wars film that took place on earth and that always didn't sit right with me. I love Star Wars as much as the next person and I'm sure Emmerich took inspiration from those big, dumb, space movies but I wanted so badly for this film to separate itself and be its own thing rather than relying on what's come before. I knew what I was getting into and wasn't expecting much in terms of substance, was just anticipating a fun alien invasion film where I could just turn my brain off. The movie certainly has fun moments, but it wasn't enough to hook me for its entirety.
I didn't hate Independence Day, nor did I love it, I found it to be a very middling film that I don't know if I see myself watching again outside of a couple of highlights. Although I appreciate the work put into the film, there wasn't a whole lot else that had me hooked. The acting was fine, the script was alright and the dialogue serviceable given this type of film (I wasn't expecting Sorkin-esque dialogue). Everything about this movie was totally fine and I can see why it has maintained a steady amount of popularity through the years, it was just a film that I couldn't connect with, even though I desperately wanted to and for that reason, I am giving Independence Day a 5/10",Independence Day
310,JWJanneck,Mindless drivel.,2,11 July 2007,"Boy oh boy. After a long time I saw this movie again---several years ago I watched parts of it on TV in a hotel room, and all I remembered was my incredulity at (SPOILER AHEAD) the president actually getting into a fighter plane himself to personally face the aliens. Lord almighty. Anyway, the thing was sitting on a disc somewhere, and I thought I'd give it another try, maybe it really wasn't that bad after all.Boy was I wrong.It actually turned out to be WAYYY worse than I even remembered it. I suppose watching it out of the corner of my eyes while preparing some talk slides or whatever I was doing made me miss the truly horrible acting and the absolutely preposterous screen writing of this cinematic monster turd. Bill Pullman's career should have ended right there and then. He is a pretty lame actor, but this was beyond bad---I have honestly seen better performances in middle school plays. The rest of the cast was mostly rubbish, too, although it's difficult to say because their characters were laughable. But nothing hurt as bad as Pullman's baby face affecting toughness, and failing. He is not alone, though, even the extras overact in ways that oscillate between really annoying and outright laughable.Another reviewer here explains the score of ""only six"" by assuming that most people here saw the movie on TV, when it should be seen in the cinema. I suppose that might be true for someone who is mainly interested in special effects, grandiose camera movements, and lots of explosions---there is lots of those in this movie, and they are most likely better enjoyed on a larger screen.From my perspective, a score of more than six is hugely overrating this nonsense production, which is not best viewed in the cinema but rather not at all---at least for those of us who enjoy actors acting, and who think that ""suspending disbelief"" does not mean shutting any brain activity whatsoever.Good things?

Yes, I know he has had a few flops like 10,000 B.C and Godzilla, and even 2012 to some people, but I think Independence Day is one of his best movies. I'm saying that because it is so good all around. For example, the aliens. It's great how the alien ships are so incredibly huge (15+ miles in diameter). In some alien movies the aliens are in tiny ships and they go so fast that you aren't able to follow them. But Emmerich's version of the aliens is huge and slow, so that isn't a problem here. Anyway, the main aspects, as always. First off, the acting. Not the best. Sure, there were people like Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman, and they were pretty good, but some of the people like Miguel and quite a few other small characters it seemed like they had no acting experience whatsoever. None. Zip. But the main characters like Smith, Goldblum, and Pullman made up for it. Mostly. Now the special effects. For a 90's action flick, they were really good. To today's standards, they would not be good at all. But they are amazing for 90's standards. In the 15+ miles across ships, there are so many little lights and openings and such, and that most likely means rooms. So that would mean there are probably 10,000+ rooms, not even counting how many floors there would be. Detail like that is not always something you come by in movies these days. Speaking of the aliens, this movie had some really awesome practical effects for the aliens. That means someone put more than one day of effort into making this, which is always good. The special effects people did a wonderful job in this movie.And now, the writing. I can't say it was the best ever, and it was kind of cheesy, but I am willing to let that slide. Some of the lines were just not needed at all, and if you got rid of all of them, the movie would be about 5 minutes shorter. Things like ""We need to pack up"" isn't needed. It's kind of obvious when there's an alien invasion that could wipe out the entire world, it's kind of obvious. And other times, there were supposed to be awesome punchlines, but they come out flat and bland because the actors couldn't execute them. But really, that's the only thing I really don't like about this movie. Fourth, the characters. I didn't think this was a good idea, but I didn't care that much because it all ends up making sense. There were four different families/groups of people. There were the people in Captain Hiller's (Will Smith) family and group of friends, and also Russell Casse's (Randy Quaid), along with President Whitmore's (Bill Pullman), and David Levinson's (Jeff Goldblum). If there were only 3-4 people in each group, I'd be OK with that. But there were at least 5-10 characters in each group, and that's a lot to bother keeping track of. It just takes away from the movie. And for the fifth, the plot. Some of it is original, and some of it isn't at all. The part that isn't original at all is the fact that a bunch of aliens have come to destroy Earth. You see that in about 85% or higher of alien movies. So nothing new there at all. But the part that is original was how Hiller and Levinson (Smith and Goldblum) took down the alien mother ship. I won't tell you exactly how because I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say it involved a lot of awesomeness. And lastly, the cinematography. The way Emmerich decided to display the alien spacecraft coming out of the clouds and pretty much anything that involved the spaceships and the mother-ships was just awesome. There was a definite sense of danger and threat in all of those shots, which was nice as well.Overall, I really liked Independence Day, because it is a great and enjoyable movie that I would watch again anytime. 9/10. And it sure is a lot better than 10,000 B.C and 2012. Anyway, thanks for reading and check out some of my other reviews. See ya!",Independence Day

Not to worry though, since the film, like in a cartoon, shows the Mother Ship as stationary in the sky, so Will Smith just flies up to it with no need to fret about oxygen in the vacuum of space and no need to worry that the aliens will notice that their computer system has been hacked or that one of their fighters is making an unauthorized approach.",Independence Day

316,emvan,Mind-Numbing Stupidity,2,27 July 2000,"Of course, it's hard to explain why this is one of the stupidest movies ever made, a non-stop cavalcade of egregious plot howlers, without spoiling some of the plot points.  (OK, here's one: if the aliens have multiple tentacles, why did they design spaceships that can be flown with two hands?)  Great sf has *never* been about turning off your brain and not questioning the patently ridiculous.  And everything that's stupid about this movie actually serves to make the story *less* interesting (e.g., instead of having to figure out how to fly the alien  spaceships, just turn the key and go!). This movie was a big success for three reasons: it rips off some classic images from written sf (such as the immense spaceships appearing over world cities, from Arthur C. Clarke's _Childhood's End_), it has great SFX, and the good guys win.  For  many, that was enough to  overcome the putrid screenwriting.  The  filmmakers were not so lucky with _Godzilla_ -- and if there's any justice in the world, they'll never be allowed near a camera again.",Independence Day

Someone had made a comment that this movie should be viewed via the ""Big Screen"", I don't agree, the story line itself is strong enough to carry the intent right through to the ""Boob tube"". This film boasts of an all-star cast and follows through on its promise.

319,roondogbb,An excellent blockbuster that's far superior to its sequel.,9,30 April 2021,"I really want to write a review that's aimed perhaps more to those who saw the sequel of this movie prior to watching the original upon which it was based. The general perception (mine's included) was that the sequel was a horrible blockbuster that was inferior in every way to the original. To judge the original based on the sequel would be wrong.1996's independence day was the breakout movie for Will Smith and it's a simple story of alien's invading earth. Now what makes this blockbuster different from many movies of this type that came before it and after it (including the sequels) it didn't just rely on a ton special effects and stereotypes to draw people to the cinema. It had the ability to make a wide range of characters who at the beginning of the movie are spread across Washington DC, New York City and California. The writers make us care about them, their outcomes, we feel their pain, their frustration etc. They're not just cannon fodder for the interstellar aliens to wipe away without a thought. I grew attached to many of the characters due to great performances by both the adult and children actresses and especially charismatic nature of Will Smith. Even though aliens might seem like a wild idea. I really believed that this might be how people would react to a global invasion. Its grounded in a way other films aren't.The special effects rely as much on minatures as they do on CGI effects but believe me. They still stand the test of time well. If anything they look a little more realistic than some computer generated effects I've seen. But they're not perfect. But alas I'm not watching movies only for CGI. In recent years (on disney plus) it seems the movie has been upscaled and released in HD so if you've seen it in the past you have the opportunity to see it more clearly than ever before. I first saw it as a kid on VHS. Now it looks way better. Please watch this movie before going onto the second movie. It's not the godfather, it's not the avengers in regards to CGI. But it is exactly what it needs to be, in order to tell the story of an alien invasion, a heartfelt, humorous, interesting look at the possibility of aliens invading.",Independence Day

323,compi24,"Review Of ""Independence Day""",6,19 February 2012,"""Independence Day"" is a 1996 Roland Emmerich film starring Will Smith and Bill Pullman. Now, let me preface this review by saying that I'm not really a fan of Roland Emmerich movies. I usually find them to be heavy on special effects, rather flimsy on worthwhile narrative substance, and shoddy in terms of character development. Now before I go on, I know what you're thinking - ""Well what the heck do I care about those last two things, all I need is explosions."" That's fine I guess. It's just that I'd rather have a well crafted story featuring explosions that endanger characters I actually give a crap about than the aforementioned. Now with that said, is ""Independence Day"" the former or the latter? It's a little bit of both. This movie is not total bad but it does have it's moments. Thankfully the good moments outweigh the bad ones. Yes, the character development is rather nonexistent. This is mainly because of the fact that there are way too many characters in this film altogether, so even the slightest hint of any sort of character arc is almost impossible/undetectable. The plot is rather stale, and there are a handful of plot holes and inconsistencies throughout, but there isn't really any dynamic of this plot that is so flagrantly bad one can't sit through it without feeling entertained. I had mixed feelings about some of the lines in this film. Some of them were pumped with so much 90's action cheese It made me want to gauge my eyes out with a pinecone, but there were others that made me laugh/smile some. As most Roland Emmerich films go, the special effects end up looking unbelievable and it's no different for ""Independence Day"". The fact that this film came out in 1996 is still a shocker to me. The acting is great in some places, while lacking in others. Bill Pullman had one of the best performances in the film, as did Jeff Goldblum. Overall, It's apparent that ""Independence Day"" is one of Roland Emmerich's best films, if not his best, and it is indeed very entertaining.",Independence Day

325,derekauthor,The Last 'Fourth of July',10,21 November 2005,"What an excellent, different approach to the science fiction/apocalyptic thriller genre!Spectacular special effects highlight this interesting film (the first from director Roland Emmerich) about aliens who want to take over Earth by killing its human inhabitants -- which include Bill Pullman (the U.S. President), Mary McDonnell (the First Lady), Will Smith (a fighter pilot), Jeff Goldblum (a cable man who has a lot of smarts), and Judd Hirsch (his father).The movie is not only exciting and scary, but also touching and funny (Hirsch, Smith, and Randy Quaid provide the most effective sources of comedy relief). Tingles going up your spine cannot be helped when the aliens attack the major cities (i.e. New York, Los Angeles), and the overall warm, feel-good feeling cannot be helped when Pullman gives his climactic speech to some of the surviving Americans.A real good time!",Independence Day
326,silva-w-pius,spectacular,6,22 April 2014,"It certainly doesn't possess the witty repartee of a Woody Allen, or does raise big philosophical questions like a Stanley Kubrick and doesn't even possess the technique or score genies of a Sergio Leone, but what Independence Day lacks in those areas, it more than makes up for it in; special effects wizardry, slick, epic fast paced action sequences and fun, humours performances, that once assembled, combine to make Independence Day a film that is a eye catching, heart pounding, awe inspiring Saturday night extravaganza that will never fail to entertain. Almost from the start it's clear to see that Roland Emmerich burrows extensively from all godfathers of Alien encounter films that came before; from the way the Alien space craft arrives in the sky surrounded in a plume of stormy clouds like scenes from the remake of War of the Worlds, the very look of the Aliens themselves clearly draw comparisons with Ridley Scots 'Alien', then you have the possible extinction of the human race to deal with, similar to The Day the Earth Stood Still. Some may say this is a signal of lack of imagination and originality on writer Dean Devlin part, but the way I look at it, imitation is the sincerity form of flattery, and I see Independence Day as more of a allusion or a homage of the highest respects to those past greats, rather than a mere cheap carbon copy (Well costing at 75million and grossing over 800 million, more like a very expensive and successful carbon copy). Being a typical big budget Hollywood film the premise is as simple as ever, a massive fleet of alien space ships arrive on earth after travelling billions of light years, but there isn't a ET amongst them, these guys mean business! And they didn't come to earth for friendly game of stuck in the mud or a casual stroll in the park whilst sightseeing; instead they are came here to destroy it and everyone on it. But once again, with this being an American Hollywood feature, the only guys equipped to save the world is the president (Bill Pullman), a computer genius (Jeff Goldblum) and a highly skilled jet pilot (Will Smith). Queue the waving of the flag, handing out of American pie and an Elvis Presley greatest hits album. But there nothing wrong with a little bit of patriotism, but Bill Pullman gives the customary great American speech about unity and courage, and the rebranding of an American holiday into a global holiday, Independence Day does take patriotism to a palpable extreme, often venturing into the irritating and ridiculous as it makes every other country seem incapable of coping without out their help. But I digress, after the US army seems incapable of penetrating through the Aliens shield, with all their bullets and bombs, Jeff Goldblum being the computer genies that he is has the genius idea of simply disarming the shields – wow give the Einstein an Nobel Prize right? Well one problem, to administer the computer virus that will infect the mother ship that will in turn disarm all the other ship's shields for around two minutes, they have to get up close and personal to do so – queue loud mouth, charismatic Will smith. To say that Independence Day was high concept film would be a massive understatement; it would be the same as saying Beetles were just a rock band. But I feel films that get labelled as high concept always get such a bad rep. What's wrong with appealing to all four quadrants of the film market, isn't watching films supposed to be an inclusive, communal experience. A film can bring together different; races, religions, genders and ages, surely that something that should be celebrated and encompasses everything that makes cinema so magical. And watching Independence Day was truly a magical experience; you just have to look at the performances, well the performance of Will Smith, who stands heads and shoulder above everyone else, in a film that made him an eventual global superstar. Like I said, he was loud and charismatic, making his character so enticing and exciting to watch. I simply love the scene when the Alien crash lands and tries to get out of its ship, only to be punched in the face by Will Smith, ""Well come to earth"" which would probably go down as one of my all time favourite move scenes and quotes ever. His performance was almost as big and spectacular as the special effects even though they are from 1996, I feel they easily outdo some modern day big budget films such as the embarrassingly bad Olympus has Fallen. Independence Day is a truly enjoyable fantastic film that rightly deserved all its finical success; defiantly looking forward to seeing it again.",Independence Day

The man simply cannot direct, period.Advertisement was through the roof during the summer of '96 promising non stop special effects and an unbelievable science fiction story.Unfortunately, special effects were the only thing that was available in this film, since the story is completely cheesy, stupid, and just plain unremarkable.The three leads, (Will Smith, the cocky and smart mouthed fighter pilot, Jeff Goldblum, the cable employee who cannot drive a car and relies on his father for transportation yet, comes up with the virus that save humanity and Bill Pullman, the clueless president of the United States who doesn't even know about Area 51) are simple caricatures of cheesy 70's disaster movies from which they are based. None of them are remotely believable in any way whatsoever. Everyone thinks that Will Smith was terrific in this film, however, I feel he was a lot better, in the superior 1997 science fiction film Men In Black.Another point how could Steven Hiller, (Will Smith) find his stripper girlfriend in the middle of a supposedly destroyed Los Angeles after ""borrowing"" or actually stealing a helicopter from the most idiotic guard in the history of mankind?! Or better yet, the United States itself would not be able to survive after it dropped a nuclear weapon on it's own backyard as they did in Houston in the film, just another laughable oversight by the filmmakers!The ""story"" if there is one, involves a nonstop invasion from outer space, and the destruction of our planet.It's just another humans vs. them science fiction film that has been done hundreds of times in the past, with far better results.Want a better film with a similar premise, try watching 2005's War of the Worlds, directed by the great Steven Spielberg with a far better storyline involved. None of the characters are remotely interesting in ID4, and one of the characters played by Miss Doubtfire's Harvey Fierstein was so annoying, that it was the only time, I smiled to see the end of that irritating character.But, the real thing that makes ID4/Independence Day such a terrible film is the completely ridiculous notion that one measly cable repair man with a laptop computer can disable the aliens shields to allow the United States and other countries to take down their spaceships. (And people thought the ending of War of the Worlds was unrealistic!)This is definitely one of the most unbelievable endings to any film ever made, and completely insults the intelligence of every moviegoer who had to endure this film.ID4 rates one star out of ten.

Its only hope is in becoming a cult-hit someday, and tragically it's not quite bad enough for that, as the special effects are as great as the script is horrible.In terms of the larger culture of the Clinton Presidency, this movie also had the odd distinction of being one of a few big films that portrayed a young, vibrant male president with a non-existent or terminally injured first lady that was about to make him a free man. Where did THAT come from?!?!? And is there some underlying lesson we all should infer about Hollywood's attitude toward Hillary as Clinton's First Lady angles now to be the next President?

331,MovieMusings,Great spin on essential theme; must see & think,8,7 June 1999,"First of all, let's dispense with the negatives.(1) Typical American ""we're number 1"" drivel, but what's new? Get over it. (2) Some weak main characters. Awfully cartoonish at times. (3) Too much convenience. Will Smith's girlfriend finding him across the destroyed nation, gimme a break. (4) Fill in your own (and, sure, there were plenty from which to choose).For those who want a summer-time fx popcorn movie, no complaints. It delivered.For thinkers, the essential theme is overcoming the dark side, as seen in films like Apocalypse Now, the Star Wars story (they shout it in your face throughout the trilogy), or Falling Down (Robert Duvall, Michael Douglas).The protagonist sees in the antagonist his own dark side. The decision to overcome the dark side usually means some form of destruction of the antagonist by the protagonist, whether in symbol or literal death, to confirm the rejection of temptation to give in to the dark side.This film symbolizes the alien nature of humans in earth's history. One fellow wrote a review here mentioning the invasion of Mexico in the 16th century; one may also consider what they native North American folks must have felt when the Europeans arrived. Or even how animals feel when they are displaced by ""aliens in flying machines destroying their homes to take away the resources"" (gee, folks, the crop duster character...).This movie is telling us to feel about ourselves the way we felt about the alien threat. Shucks, they came in the first place because they had consumed their planet's resources. Doesn't that sound like us?! (deforestation, water and air pollution, are we that oblivious to what's happening?) War has involved pillaging resources for thousands of years, from fighting over share of the hunted herds to fighting over the land to cultivate to fighting for the gold...And, let's not even begin to talk about colonialism and slavery...Notice also that the crop duster is the one ""worthy"" to destroy the aliens by sacrifice; he seems to judge himself at the same time, and as it were justifies his killing them by dying with them.There is a whole lot in this film.Compare the presidential characterization in this movie versus, say, The Rock.Or, how about the scene where Will Smith punches out the alien - preposterous, we might say. But, think about it -- if the creature is carbon-based, and if the whole universe came from one big bang start, why can't it be as fragile as earth-bound carbon-based forms? We have this idea that, if we ever met an alien, it must be stronger - why? who's ever authenticated a meeting with one to say?If you missed all this (and so much more, but there's a limit here!), you may need to watch it again.",Independence Day

The survivors devise a plan to fight back against the enslaving aliens, and July 4th becomes the day humanity will fight for its freedom. July 4th is their Independence Day. I just like movies with destruction, dogfights, and powerful alien spaceships. The special effects were outstanding, acting performances were excellent, the action was awesome. Buy the Widescreen DVD of the film, because the TV version cuts certain scenes or even changes the dialogue.But for this movie right here, is a masterpiece. It kept me on the edge of my seat for total excitement throughout the entire movie!!Anyway, this movie is a must-see, and hopefully there will be more disaster movies in future.Independence Day gets 10 stars",Independence Day
334,m_a_singer,"The ""goofs"" section doesn't tell the whole story...",1,2 January 2004,"Never before have I seen a film with such grossly mismatched reverse angle shots - these clowns can't even handle a dialogue scene competently. Combine that with a level of implausibility that overwhelms within the first 20 minutes (gee, we not only don't evacuate the President with alien spaceships overhead and *leave his daughter to wander unsupervised around the White House*, but everyone and his dog can wander around Area 51 at will!), an oblivious disregard for it's own script (stealth bombers flying over an ""evaucated"" city that conveniently left all of its lights on), and what appears to be a total lack of geographic knowledge, and this is one huge, stinking, stupid mess. How anyone can like or recommend this is beyond me. Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith do get a few points for their improvisational throwaways, though those stand out as they are the only lines in the film that sound like they were spoken by human beings. (And I've since found out that at least one joke in their ""spaceship sequence"" was lifted from an old Warner Brothers Daffy Duck cartoon, which is probably why it stands out as good.)",Independence Day
335,blackasp98,Excellent film,10,27 August 2006,"OK the premise is yes,earth has to defend itself from the harboring aliens coming to injest everything on the planet.But the one thing about the story,is that one Randy quaids role was a fighter pilot,if you remember the line from the major who was turtoring the would be pilots.Your about to get a crash course in modern avionics.For quaids role he did fly a jet in NAM not Korea,and he did hold a pilots license in a jet so using a modern jet would be but not difficult at best to fly.As for the virus the aliens didn't know if their technology would be superior,i am guessing they felt real confident about taking the earth with no problem,not realizing that the scout ship found at area 51 was from the fifties,so with lacking news from the scout,about technology they thought no problems taking over.The story and characters were excellent,a huge cast of veterans and new faces which made the film very desirable.I for one loved the special effects,and you have to remember some of those takes could only be done once,which is pressure on the film makers of emmerich and devlin.They did win some good awards for the results of plot and special effects,which made some ground breaking openings in other films.I hope emmerich and devlin will come to the audience with a new story and kick butt effects,as for godzilla,not bad i thought doing the story over again was a bit cheesy,but the effects took my breath away.Great work roland bring us some more.",Independence Day

Bill Pullman is a little stilted as the President, and gives a speech that was vote corniest piece of dialogue in a film. Jeff Goldblum is on autopilot, essentially doing his Jurassic Park persona all over again. Judd Hirsch provides much comic relief as Jeff's crotchety but wise old man.No-one watches a film like this for Oscar-winning performances or soap opera dramatics though. While there are indeed some daft moments - the aliens with all this technology, and even with knowledge of OUR technology, have clearly never heard of firewalls or AVG - it more than delivers in the thrills department, evoking the spirit of 50s alien invasion movies, particularly the 1953 film The War of the Worlds.",Independence Day

Sure, it was packed with a load of great images, but frankly I expected even more, since it was supposed to set new levels for special FX (and it did not). But I can put up with that. What makes this a god-awful movie, in my opinion, is the pathetic look at technology we are supposed to go through. I firmly believe that sci-fi movies, as unlikely as they can be, should have decency and SHOULD NOT show downright ignorance -- but then again, how many times are we supposed to be presented with space ships that make noises in empty space? Here we are supposed to learn that aliens whose technology is thousands of years ahead of ours still use floppies, program their computers in our programming languages (despite the fact that they have a completely different alphabet and speech) or in a compatible format anyways, and that we can upload a VIRUS to their HUGE computer when Windows viruses can't affect machines that run a different operating system like Unix here on Earth! Sorry guys, I cannot get into something downright laughable like that.

339,brownish33,ID4 = One of the coolest action films EVER!,10,20 October 2010,"so, once again I'm reviewing a movie that i grew up with. i was a child of the 90's, and i distinctly remember 3 films my mom bought on video when they came out: Mission Impossible, Twister, and ID4. ID4 was my favorite of the 3, and still is. there is a lot more to this film then just the special effects. its got heart. thats why i like it. there is also this kind of innocence to it, a child like sense of wonder that has only been seen in films like the original Star Wars. it doesn't take itself ultra seriously but seriously enough for you to feel for the characters. Jeff goldbloom is one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him in this. Jurassic park and ID4 are 2 of my favorite action films so seeing him in this as well was a great treat. will smith, before he became huge with ""Men In Black"" the following year, was also great and funny as well. bill pullman is very good as the president, he definitely looks like one here and is very likable and perhaps a bit too ""calm"" when the aliens take over. if that were me i would have been going crazy, yet Pullman's president stays strangely calm and collected throughout. amazing! we need a president that is that cool under pressure! harry connick junior makes a brief but memorable role as the ""biggs"" character for this movie (for those star wars fans out there, you know what i mean). there were a lot of parts in this movie that seemed directly lifted from the original Star Wars. the giant saucer ships are like the death star, the F-18's have replaced X-wings and likewise the alien attackers have replaced Tie Fighters. you even have a unlikely hero like Luke skywalker in randy quaids character, especially at the very end in the plane.the movie has enough laughs and suspense to keep you going and is very well cast. the action however is simply amazing. you must remember, this was in a time when CGI had not yet taken over cinema, so computer effects were used at a minimum. but that is what makes the special effects in this movie GREAT! CGI today is terribly overused to the point where movies have come to look like video games. they look awful. the effects in the 80's and most of the 90's still used practical effects using models and miniature's for the action. and boy did they do an amazing job with ID4. the ships, particularly the mammoth command ships, are a site to see, especially if you have an HDTV on bluray. it is MASSIVE. they cover the cities like a huge shadow. it was obviously a real ship they used, not lame phony looking CGI. and the effect would not have looked anywhere near as real or scary if CGI was used. the explosions were also real. when the white house blew up, or the empire state building, or congress, those are REAL explosions, and WOW did it look impressive. you just don't see that kind of explosions today. take for example the newer Star Wars prequels. EVERYTHING looks fake! every set was blue screen and looked incredibly smooth and unreal. almost nothing was a prop or real set, it was just horrible. why don't they just go back to the way they used to film special effects? it looked 1 million times more real and actually were almost TOO real for comfort! again, they just don't make them like they used to and its sad.another thing to note is David Arnold's INCREDIBLE music score for this film. no, not that retarded REM song. i mean the film score itself. its very heroic, big, EPIC. it really makes you root for our heroes when the triumphant pro-American theme starts playing. it really gets your heart pumping with excitement when you couple the amazing action scenes with Arnold's superb score. the film wouldn't be anywhere near as good without it. parts that kind made me laugh was when they are planning the attack with all the countries, and when they show Russia, this very slavic sounding version of the ID4 theme is heard, complete with deep male singers and tambourine HAHA. this part was very old school. not to go overboard with the star wars references, but there were many moments in the score i noticed where it sounds very john William's-like, but thats fits this kind of movie perfectly.in the end, this is one of my favorite movies and despite what cynical reviewers may say, this is a great fun night out at the movies if there ever was one, right up there with original Star Wars trilogy! now go out and SEE IT!",Independence Day

344,Oblomov_81,"For all the pizzazz, a very generic film",6,25 August 2001,"With all the money spent and earned, you would think that ""Independence Day"" might offer something different from other run-of-the-mill action movies. Not so. Despite the gung-ho attitude and Will Smith's sense of humor, there's really nothing unique about it. The aliens are given no background whatsoever; all we know is that they have the power to blow things up with powerful rays. The story is standard shoot-em-up with several interesting action sequences thrown in to keep our MTV-damaged attention on the screen. Yes, I did say ""interesting;"" I won't try to be a snob and say that none of the action scenes impressed me. In fact, a lot of them did. But I walked away from the film with an empty feeling inside, as if I had eaten a bowl of pasta without any sauce.Back in the mid-90's, audiences attended these things in droves, watching the same homogenized schlock from May to August. It can easily be argued that not much has changed in the last five years, with ""The Mummy Returns,"" ""Hollow Man,"" and anything else that would insult the intelligence of a five-year-old still holding the #1 box office spot. But there are glimmers of hope, with idealistic films such as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""American Beauty"" pulling in cash from the audience. Then again, such movies could be showered with all the success in the world and it still probably wouldn't pull Hollywood away from making routine movies like ""Independence Day.""

It's schlock. It's stupid. And it's a hell of a lot of fun. Some thoughts- 1.) The blatant rip-off of Star Wars and other sci-fi films is laughable yet forgivable. It still works.2.) I don't think for a second the director, writers, or producers, had any intention at any step of the way to create a serious sci-fi film on any level. They wanted to create an entertaining sci-fi film.3.) If the ""Yay! America saves the world!"" subtext is too obnoxious or offensive or overdone to some I say so what? I don't see anything wrong with it. In fact I love it. And I believe the vast majority of the audience did as well.4.) The film has a lot of problems that require you to check out of reality for a little while. Once you do that you're fine.5.) I've never seen so many instant fighter pilots step out of so many RV's in my life.6.) Apple laptops can't upload viruses to alien motherships.7.) A feel good sci-fi flick is not so without a cute kid wearing a baseball cap backwards.8.) The battle scenes between the alien fighters and the FA-18s are perhaps the most cool ever.9.)

Every alien in the whole species comes towards Earth to attack, and eliminate every being on the planet, so that they can consume every natural resource and then move on to another planet.  Main defenders are the President (Bill Pullman), who is in charge, David Levinson, a cable guy (Jeff Goldblum) who finds out how to get through the alien technology, and Captain Steve Hillard of the Air Force (Will Smith) who hates those aliens shooting green s**t at him.

Whitmore), the aliens should have said that they were there to retaliate for the Earth's shooting down of their exploration vessel, the one in containment at Area 51.The dialog could have been ... Pullman: ""Why attack?""  Alien:  ""You fired the first shot"" ...and the rest could come out in conjecture.  The alien motivation would have been more personal and sadly justified.Easy Fix 2: A simple scene where Jeff Goldblum (David Levinson) is told that 99% of our microprocessor technology came from the captured alien ship.

I was unfortunately suckered into seeing this over-commercialized over- hyped pile of mindless junk. Forgetting that this is the 90's and during the summer special effects and action are all that's required to draw people to the theaters. A plausible well written story with good drama, tension and excitement are not necessary for the brain dead of our society who continue to throw away money on this junk every year which means we will continue to see more garbage like it every year. This film is not that bad and I wouldn't detest it so much if it didn't earn so much money. I keep hoping people will tire of these films and spend their money on something better or will never see the end of junk like this. The first half is not too bad and the image of the huge spaceships that cover entire cities is quite scary and does have dramatic impact. Once we get to the underground secret lab and the hidden space ship the film goes down hill faster than you can say ID !? The clichés pile up starting with the millionth time since Watergate on film that our Gov. is keeping secrets from the people even the Pres., then of course we have to have at least 1 gooey slimy gory alien surgery scene and as far as the special effects I saw nothing in this film new or impressive that we haven't seen since Star Wars which is now over 20 years old. Then we're expected to believe that as advanced as this allien invader is their technology has not improved in the last 40+ years that they wouldn't detect one of their old spaceships is manned by man and infiltrating their brain center and that we could learn to fly it in a very short time or that it would still even fly !? It's too bad the producers couldn't find some creative writers to find a more scientific or imaginative way to destroy the invaders.

356,Winds_of_Destination,Great sci-fi movie,8,9 August 2007,"Since it's release in theaters 11 years ago, Independence Day has taken a lot heat. While I personally disagree that this movie is so horrible, it is easy to beat up the film seeing that its directed by one of the most boring directors of our time, Roland Emmerich.However, I believe this is his finest work. The first act is all about the build-up of the alien invasion and the attacks. This takes about fifty minutes, which also develops many (too many) characters and their places in the apocalypse.The attacks are good, but it is not unexpected. The special effects give it its credibility, and the second act begins the day after.In the wake of the devastation, mankind is limping on to survive, all main characters personally affected in someway by the attacks. While everybody does a good job bringing out the emotional side of the attacks, Will Smith is the only one that degrades this. After battling the aliens and failing, he has a close encounter with an alien and reacts unrealistically, punching it and sarcastically greeting it. Then he's dragging it through the desert, screaming at it because he is missing a barbecue. HELLO?!? This is an alien race far superior to our own and it has single handedly brought mankind to its knees, and all he can do is yell at it for ruining his day? His performance is plausible but not his role. Thank God this is the only thing that I did not like in the second act.After Will Smith brings the alien to a secret alien research facility in Area 51, the doctors decide to perform an autopsy. The autopsy scene is a classic. It is probably the best sci-fi scene I have EVER seen. It could fit into a 50's classic, and makes the movie so great.At the end of the second act, they finally figure out how to take down the alien's shields and destroy their monster-sized spacecraft. This is where the lousy third act begins.July 4 is the opening of the third act, in which they round up as many pilots as possible. One is my least favorite character, a guy named Russell who claims he had been kidnapped by aliens 10 years earlier. The guy is lackadaisical cornball. He has one good line (Hello, boys. I'm back!!!!). All pilots around the world, including Russell will be in the ultimate battle. They will fight the alien ships while Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum plant a virus inside the mother ship. This is sadly the only interesting part of the third act, the rest of it from before being a cornball of clichés.The interior of the mother ship is so breathtaking, I actually found myself wishing somehow their ship would malfunction and they'd be stuck inside, forcing them to venture through the space frigate for about an hour in a style reminiscent to ""Alien"". But seeing that the movie is already 2 1/2 hours, I guess they decided to not to.Jeff Goldblum's and Will Smith's chemistry work wonders while they're in the mother ship, and every moment inside it is really good.The movie shortly ends after their departure from the mother ship, so it pretty much comes to a screeching halt. The world is still in ruins, and Emmerich leaves us to ponder how humanity will get back up.All in all, the movie manages perfectly for 81% of the movie. I would've given it a 9.0 if it weren't for Will Smith's comic relief in the second act, Russell, and mainly clichéd third act. 8.1/10.",Independence Day

Yes, the ""plot"" makes no sense and seems like something a 5 year old would come up with.  There is also cheesy dialog that only Titanic can match- another flashy dud.  I still can't bring myself to label this as ""the worst movie I have ever seen"".  Why not?  Because it is, in some ways, refreshingly different.  It also has, despite what everyone else says, some originality if you put the clothes-pin on your nose look closely enough at this stinker. If you see this after the World Trade Center attack, you'll see people coming together in the face of adversity...just like they do when they are faced with overwhelming odds against them.  I had seen this back in 1996 and thought that it was unrealistic that people of all different backgrounds and races/classes pull together and help each other in spite of their differences.  It turns out I was wrong because that is exactly what happened on 9/11/01.  The U.S. military are not the bad guys, for a change.  The main characters are not believable, but they are awesome role models for our young people.  I think that's great!  There is a minimum of profanity or sex either, which is a welcome change.I'm going to go out on a limb here and probably offend a lot of people, but I thought this movie came at just the right time for the USA.  We didn't have a good role model, IMHO, as a leader, so it was refreshing to see a too-good-to-be-true leader as a president in a movie.Despite these good points, it is still a mess of a movie with an awful plot and terrible dialog.

Many people think that during July 4th sappy movies about old people should be seen. Well I say no that's not true, this movie proves that you can have some butt ugly aliens and still be patriotic.    I wish that in real life our President had as much enthusiasm as the movie president did. If nothing else the portrayal of survival and just how human beings wanted to survive, was unbelievable. We've all seen movies like Armageddon, where space debris threatened to take human life; but what people don't understand is that aliens (Roswell or not) might be our next real problem (who knows???) and why not show the liberation or will to survive than with a movie of this caliber. I say, outstanding.   What the president said ""if we survive this July 4th will no longer be just America's independence day; but a day for all of the world to come to gather and celebrate."" (not a direct quote but close to it.) I give this movie two thumbs up and than some!!!!",Independence Day

(and as if this is not bad enough, will smith punches the alien in the face and says: ""welcome to earth"" ... second worst moment in the movie) i made this point before in signs, but what about just bullying the earthlings to give you all you want ... you must not even work than not sure what those resources they wanted were but there are a lot of unpopulated planets, where you can find a lot of resources to ...seriously, how long did it take the ships to get to all the cities they should destroy ... if they travel at that speed, how much time were they traveling from the last planet they destroyed? from the human side: the army would have tried a shot even before knowing what the aliens want - they work this way - shot first, ask later such big ships would not have been able to sneak the earth without being noticedwith the arrival of the aliens the American president would have been in the deepest bunker his security people can find no one would even let the president get in a fighting jet and attack the aliens. since he is the supreme commander it would even be irresponsible of him to do this. his job is to command and coordinate the army efforts, not to do things which can be done by trained specialists (not wanting to implicate that a president actually is an useful supreme commander ...)just imagine the Russians saying: ""the Americans have found a way to fight back -- yuppie"" - lol. the Russians and the US never trusted each other and i don't think that the end of the world would have even a minimal chance to change this and the happy end: ohh, come one, this one was so cheap it merely gets rang 3 in the worst moments list: the apple virus (with helpful ""uploading virus"" message) wrecks the entire fighting force of the aliens, after of course our heroes manage to fly an alien interceptor for the very first time (which moves way quicker when they fly it as when the aliens do ... the aliens must do something wrong ...) and sneak in the mother ship (funny, try to land on a military airbase and they will shot you down without the right codes)",Independence Day

Bottom line, anything and I mean anything starring Will Smith is automatically a candidate for the worst film of all time. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich got their comeuppance however.

Frankly I wasn't impressed with the special effects. I was impressed with the writing, directing and believe it or not the acting. Bill Pullman's performance was outstanding and Will Smith, who always has a huge screen presence and intense charisma acted very well. All sci-fi/action flicks get tons of criticism for acting. Why? Because most of those people don't like sci-fi/action, that's why. Also because a retarded element of this world seem to dislike movies that have a big budget and sci-fi/action films often do. Independence Day has better acting than most films that are nominated for Oscars. Just because a film is boring enough and stage play like enough to be an Oscar contender doesn't mean it has good acting.

This film shows the gullible public's desire for more wham bam and less plot. This big, dumb, glossy blockbuster designed for mass appeal is massively appalling.

Not many movies came out with as much hype and excitement as this one and it lived up to every minute of it. 17 years later and with talk of possible sequels coming there is that excitement buzz once again. The special effects broke new ground on how an alien invasion could actually look like with 15 mile wide ships that cover entire cities. Yet the best thing about the movie is the fact that its not all about brawn but brains. For a movie that is 2.5 hrs long it grabs you for the opening scene and doesn't let up. 17 years old and it keeps getting better and better. Can't wait for the sequels in 3D!!,Independence Day

I can't add much to the other negative comments that have already been written about this film except to point out another plot problem: beings who were thousands of years more advanced than we are probably would've dealt successfully with computer viruses before, not to mention have had components more advanced than/incompatible with ours...

The movie follows 3 main characters, the heroic and young US President, the highly skilled Jet Fighter pilot and the tree-hugging and extremely smart Scientist. All of them will combine their forces in order to kick some major Alien booty.You'll love Independence Day if: You like nicely done and very, very, very, VERY, big and loud explosions, dogfights between UFOs and Jet Fighters, over the top heroism, typical Hollywood characters and cheesy one-liners... did I mention the loud BOOMS? Get a big bucket of popcorn, turn off your brain and just pretend you are a 10-yeal old kid that just wants a bit of Hollywood Humor, great special effects, big aliens and big boobs... oh, forget the last one, wrong movie. I've got to admit that some scenes really touched my black, hellish and tasty heart despite them being way too typical... you know, over the top bravery, a bit of romance, etc. I also have to admit that I wanted the Aliens to win... sorry fellow humanoids!You'll hate Independence Day if: You want realism and good characters. Logic literally takes a backseat in this movie... a movie where a race of EXTREMELY advanced aliens traveled millions of light years only to show us, the Homo Sapiens, how stupid they are despite their superior technology. They get killed in all kinds of stupid ways that are far from realistic or at least believable. Even their initial strategic placement over major cities has no meaning... I mean why exactly do the aliens want to destroy the White House and not a military base with nuclear missiles??? Do they hate big fancy buildings or something? Next the characters are the usual typical bunch. The extremely heroic US President, the Jew, (therefore smart), scientist and his old pops, (I loved that guy!), the honest lap-dancer, a black jet fighter pilot, (therefore Macho & too ""Hip-Hop""), the nerdy secret scientist, (I hate this stereotype), and so on and so forth. The biggest problem is that while most actors do a good job they once again play themselves, like Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. I really wanted to avoid saying this but this movie is way, way, WAY too conservative, almost Disney-ish and maybe a bit too ""GOD BLESS America!!!""FINAL VERDICT: Popcorn Movie (4.7/10)[+] Great SFX like massive spaceships and even more massive explosions.

376,youaresquishy,Truly awful - skip it,1,28 March 2006,"This is a great example of a plot-driven film whose plot is absolutely awful.Jeff Goldblum is often an interesting actor, Bill Pullman can sometimes be very good, Randy Quaid is often funny, and Will Smith has a certain charisma, but none of them can save this steaming pile of you-know-what. I can't believe any of them agreed to do this script. They must have somehow got strong-armed into doing this. Clearly the director shares a lot of the blame here. In a movie like this, the only good parts are the violent parts and the parts in which things get blown up, but some of the explosion scenes were very poorly done. For example, in one scene, from the trajectories of the cars that are ostensibly being blown down the street, it is clear that they are just being dropped into the screen from above. It's hard to believe that anyone would agree to direct or act in a film based on this script.Characters are killed without first being developed at all, resulting in the viewer not caring so much when they die. The story is stupid in about three different ways. There's no way to suspend disbelief because it's so stupid. At no point during my viewing of this was I unaware that I was watching a movie--and a very bad one. The script is cliché-ridden and childish, designed for an audience of children and mental invalids. I had always thought of Vivica Fox as kind of pretty, but she is looking pretty ugly in this one. Trust me, you can skip this one. Don't rent it, don't buy it, and don't waste time watching it.

The all-too-familiar Alien Invasion plot is revived with a series of twists thanks to the eye-popping, Award-winning special effects (the spaceships are flawless!). The 3 leading characters steal the show and make the movie fluid and likable. David Arnold's unforgettable and sweeping score also contributes positively to the film's atmosphere (leading to nominations in a number of institutions). Randy Quaid is hilarious as the alcoholic Vietnam vet volunteering in the fight against the invaders. It also manages to sidestep Sci-fi clichès since there is NO single leading character that show the way to battle the Aliens.But there are flaws as well: the human stories are very dumb and sometimes nonsensical; the movie is overlong and takes a while to get started, and the over-the-top patriotism in this movie sometimes gives the movie a slightly cartoonish feel. There is a high number of needlessly stupid and flat supporting characters.Despite of that, the movie became the most successful movie of 1996, earning more than $300 million in the US and over $500 million worldwide.

I don't remember the exact details, but I remember that there was a movement that was pushing this movie as a big deal.So much hype back in the day...Back when it was released in 1996-ish, I thought Independence Day was a fairly satisfying movie. It didn't have the most original plot in the world (aliens attempt to conquer Earth and it's up to the humans to repel them - where have we NOT seen that one before?), but it was still a thrill to see the special effects, thrilling aerial battles, and whatnot. Some ten odd years later, the movie has lost much of its luster, but not so much its fun element.Those ""exciting"" special effects? They still serve a purpose and they're still okay, but nothing special. The plot is somewhat thin and the slow scenes are fairly slow enough to get you out of the mood. Even the tense moments seem predictable and it's not due to repeated viewings. Despite all this, it's still a fairly decent popcorn flick worth killing a night if you have nothing better to watch. It's not a sophisticated movie, it's not a masterpiece, it's just a fun little action flick with aliens and lots of explosions.Independence Day is worth a look if you're looking for a quick fix of action movies, but anyone looking for high art should look elsewhere.

Unfortunately, I couldn't go to the theater during its entire theatrical run and after I acquired the VHS copy on sale a couple of years later...I really came to regret not seeing it earlier.10 years later, this movie still delivers the goods. I've seen this so many times, yet I never got bored of it. But why do people rag on it now (and even then for that matter)? Good question, honestly.I think they need to go back to their little Harry Potter and Shrek 2 movies, because THIS is the definitive blockbuster extravaganza. And not only that, I think it goes a little beyond that as well (and I use the word ""little"" VERY loosely).This movie had the unforgettable moments (that were parodied or rehashed later on), the incredible acting talent, the clever lines, the then-contemporary music and orchestrated score that still works very well in the movie, the incredibly cool alien designs, the perfect pacing, the very well drawn characters who were all proved integral to the plot, and the dynamic climax!I won't even bother outlining the plot, since practically everyone reading this knows how it goes anyway. But it was one of those things that was good in theory and even better in execution, no one has made a film like this akin to it until Luc Beeson released the Fifth Element (equally good in my eyes, never got tired of watching that one either).Since then Emmerich and Devlin went on to create the unforgivable Godzilla (which I thought was good as a kid, but not anymore upon a recent viewing) and so on. But back in the good ol' days, their baby ID4 was one of the good films that made the summer worth waiting for. And to this day, i'm STILL waiting for a GOOD summer blockbuster to come in and entertain the hell out of me ever since the turn of the century. But until then, i'm still watching my classics.

Now, in 99, it was just your basic big budget Hollywood popcorn movie. I wasn't into analyzing movies back then and thought this was one of the best movies ever made. Looking back on it, and having knowledge of the real SETI program and countless other space scientists, I found it to be an implausible, inaccurate, and unreal flick. But it's sci-fi, so it doesn't matter.But my comment could be used in how the filmmakers forget their own logic and use it to advantage: referring to the chase scene in the Grand Canyon. If the ships had shields, how could a parachute penetrate? And in that very first dogfight, the alien ships preformed excellent maneuvers. In the second, when they really needed it, they just stood still and blew up. And you'd think with an alien colony as advanced, as they were, they'd have developed virus protection. Of course, if they did we'd have no movie.But aside from the plot holes and flaws, the fxs were something to watch.

385,Alan One,Filmmaking driven by special effects and advertising,2,20 October 1999,"After watching Independence Day, and the surge of adoration from American youth that followed, I wondered if the previous generation looked on with as much horror when the same happened for Star Wars.  I hope not.Where to begin on how awful this movie is?  The drama is propped up by dozens of unlikely situations.  We're supposed to cheer as the dog jumps through the door, narrowly missing an early death by fireball.  Would the fireball really stop at the door and preserve everyone inside?  Would their oxygen not be consumed?  Later, not only a stranded fighter pilot, but a horde of RVs stumble on Area 51, just in time for the president's arrival (whose wife has just been rescued by the fighter pilot's girlfriend).  This is the worst kind of stop-gap scriptwriting.The plot tries to make up for the gaping holes with extraneous material.  We are told with loving detail what the aliens look like, how their biologically-active protective suits work, of their telepathic abilities. How many aliens to we actually encounter face-to-face in the film?  You got it -- one.The attempt at generating tension in the first half hour is utterly ludicrous; every person on earth has seen the previews of the White House and various other buildings being blown to smithereens by the aliens. Before the opening credits role, we know a war's on.  Why pretend we don't?Independence Day was one of the first in a disturbing trend in cinema in the 1990s, culminating, I think, with The Phantom Menace: filmmaking driven by special effects.  The attitude of the film is, ""We do this because we can, not because we should.""  This inevitably leads the plot astray and dictates what course the aliens will take.  Wouldn't it be much more efficient for the technologically-advanced aliens to engineer a human-killing super virus? Sure, but then there wouldn't be great shots of L.A. getting vaporized.Equally offensive is the needless off-target moralizing of the film.  It suggests that the war is about ""independence"" -- come on, guys, isn't really about survival?  The theme at the end is one of unity among the different nations, but it's a unity that consists of the U.S. telling the other guys when and where to shoot.  And if that's what unity is all about, then we've been getting along great for the last 50 years.",Independence Day

The story is okay, a bit too all-American hero rightly stuffed to take seriously but okay. Jeff Goldblum's dad was meant to be lovable but I found him annoying. I liked Will Smith's girlfriend; a lot. The special effects were good. You just know all the dogs and children are going to survive but who would want them dead?

388,sherbetsaucers,At Least America Saved The World,7,6 February 2007,"When I first decided to watch this movie I had a very clever idea. Why not, I thought, invite around some friends, and rather than watch this movie quietly, absorbing all of the pathos and dramatisation on screen, encourage them to talk through it, recording what they say and picking the highlights out to use as the bulk of this review. A fantastic idea with but one draw back. You couldn't understand a word on the Dictaphone. All I was left with was my friend Carole saying ""At last, Will Smith"" as 24.29 minutes into the movie we see the star, Jeff Goldblum being told that the thing they are sticking on the ship he is about to fly in is ""the strongest radio transmitter we had. It'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus."" my friend Dean proclaiming 'that looks like a big metal d***o' and my good self booing loudly at the line, spoken by British officers, '""It's from the Americans. They want to organise a counter offensive."" ""It's about bloody time! What do they plan to do?""'. Come to think of it that may well have been the witty highlight of the night Let us move to the plot. *Takes a deep breath* Actuallyicantbebothered. *Gasps* I decided when describing the plot it was best not to waste time with spaces, besides it already has enough gaps in it, and I could plunge right into talking about the cool special effects and set pieces.Actually, that's not totally fair. For a start the version I watched had 8 whole extra minutes of footage, which translates as Independence Day: Now With Added Trailer Trash. However, I enjoyed the added trailer trash. Suddenly I find myself actually caring about the family in their mobile home. There are also some added scenes with Jeff Goldblum, which is never a bad thing in my opinion. Thanks to adding in this extra footage, a few bits of the movie make more sense. Although no, they still don't explain that whole computer uploading thing. I can't get mine to notice my printer, and these are Aliens for crying out loud! So special effects. Wow. They still look amazing. The blowing up of the White House is now part of movie history but the amount of love and attention that Joseph Viskocil, head of mechanical effects puts into destroying things is a joy to behold. Not only the special effects but also the visual effects as well. My favourite being the canyon chase with the F-18 and the Alien space craft. Roland Emmerich had the guts to shoot the entire chase in daylight. There really is no margin for error here and yet it still rips along at a fantastic pace, not once giving the audience a chance to really question what they are watching. This movie set out to be a summer block buster, and it really, truly is.Amazingly enough, the acting isn't too bad either. Will Smith gets to finally take on the part of action lead hero but having done his time as The Fresh Prince his timing for those oh-so-important one liners is spot on. Jeff Goldblum, who in my eyes can do no wrong, does no wrong. Unfortunately, their better halves in the film suffer from the fact that they are, well, women in an action movie. Margaret Colin, who initially seems independent and feisty gets to basically keep the home fires burning (though the Aliens also do a pretty good job of that one) and look all impressed when her man comes back having done the job and chomping on a stogie. Vivica A. Fox also has very little to do as her exotic dancer, despite driving around in a big truck at one point and picking up survivors. The fantastic Mary McDonnell gets to die and that's about it for female roles. Judd Hirsch in support as Goldblum's father is hilarious, while Randy Quaid, the washed up bum of previous note, is just a bit annoying. However, Bill Pullman as President Whitmore is perfect. I want to like him, I want to believe in him and, after he gives his speech (I don't think Thomas would mind being paraphrased) I want to follow him to the gates of hell. I would like to point out that I think it is Pullman who manages to make me like that speech. Read it on it's own. It could not be any more bombastic if it tried. I would like to point out that that statement comes from someone pretentious enough to use the word bombastic.The rest of the supporting cast fill their rolls admirably, and surprisingly enough you never feel that any of the cast are ever fighting for the screen. Unlike many 'modern' high effect movies (it was made way way back in 1996) the live action actors are never upstaged by what is happening around them, and here I think lies the true strength of this movie. If a viewer doesn't care about the people on the screen then they cannot connect with their plight enough to have any real suspension of disbelief. When you go to Alton Towers you know you're not going to fall out of The De-atomiser, or what ever attraction it is you chose to loosen your bowls: however, while you are riding it, there is still that fear, that adrenaline rush. You get that because you connect with the moment. In Independence Day you connect with the characters. You care about them and so you care about the fate of the world. It's because of this that all these years later the effects still bring a grin to your face.",Independence Day
389,alfCycle,"Big, dumb and fun",6,15 May 2017,"This is an example of a big, dumb summer blockbuster that's also quite entertaining. As a kid in the 90's I couldn't get enough of this movie. I've probably watched it about a dozen times in my life, but watched it as an adult for the first time recently in preparation for the sequel. As a kid I didn't really see all the flaws that this movie has, and it does have many! I just really enjoyed the spectacle of it all. I can still enjoy that spectacle, but the weak and often ridiculous plot points definitely stand out now as an adult. This movie is full of cheese, which makes it both fun at times while inducing eye rolling at other times. You can't really take this movie too seriously without realizing just how stupid it is, but if you turn off your brain you can have fun with this movie. I think it's able to keep itself from crossing that line into the overly obnoxious that most of these types of movies often go crashing through (ahh-hem Michael Bay!). The special effects still hold up pretty well, especially when compared to other movies of that time frame.

In fact, i don't even NEED to summarize the plot. It's your average E.T invasion film, but feels like the biggest one of them all (for the 90s at least).

393,Motoko,The greatest science fiction film ever. Not.,3,28 January 1999,"Where shall I start? Do I begin the America bashing now or after I've ridiculed this films shallow and laughable effort at entertainment. Probably best to get it out of the way now I guess.Now if there are any Americans out there reading this then I'm sorry. I really am. I don't want to have to do this. I'm not xenophobic. I don't have any political complexes. I'm not in the habit of insulting the people that come from the land across the Atlantic. But please, you have to accept that this is tripe. Of the highest possible order. It's success merely proves that the best way to get an American to get behind something is to appeal to that little bit inside them that loves their country. If a film is full of praise for the USA and even vaguely shows it's national heritage being ridiculed (a shot of a collapsed Statue of Liberty usually does the trick) then any self-respecting yank will root for it. And that's it. This film calls to the most xenophobic part of any American and wrenches it to the forefront. As a Brit the most obvious, and insulting, element of this to me is when those two officers from the RAF receive the American plan of action. In a tone of hero worship and admiration they cry ""It's the Americans!"" Well hallelujah. At last we're saved. My ass. I'll bet those two were called Reginald and Jerry and usually partook in cucumber sandwiches and high tea at their house in the country with a butler and 20 servants. When they're not playing cricket that is.And then there is the film itself. Utter tosh. I wouldn't feel so cheated if it was just uniformally bad. At least then I could watch it in a so-bad-it's-good sort of way. Instead I thought the first act, before the initial attack, was quite good. The slow drawn out tension and what-the-hell-is-it paranoia were nicely handled. There was a suitable sense of invincibility about the aliens that suited the film. But then it collapsed. Emmerich and Devlin spent so long on the setup that they had to race through the pay-off. Glaring implausibilities, which I can usually overlook in a good film, just made it worse. For example: when Smith's girlfriend makes it out from the rubble LA is destroyed, laid to waste, ruined, wrecked, crushed. All except four palm trees. Priceless.Then there is the supposition that crop dusters, cargo pilots and others, including the Pres' himself, can learn enough complex air warfare tactics to hold off a group of advanced alien fighters long enough for the mother-ship to be destroyed. Presuming of course that Goldblum can connect his laptop to the central computer when you can barely get an Apple to talk to a PC. Balderdash. Trashy characters. Bad script. Insensitive stereo-types. Shall I go on?The end result is a film I'm ashamed to have on my video-shelf (it was a birthday present so I can't really give it away). Starship Troopers, an even trashier sci-fi flick, walks all over it because of it's obvious tongue-in-cheek nature. Serious films like Bladerunner and Star Wars grind it to dust. I believe one commenter referred to it as the best science fiction film for fifty years. I would recommend he has a psychiatric session.

This film has nothing to do with America, though. Why? Because if air force personnel behaved like Will Smith(who ruins every film he's thrown at us in:Wild Wild West, MIB,etc.), and every ALIEN computer system was as easily virus-ed as the one in this flick, and--oh why bother picking at this sorry excuse for suspension of dis-belief? How about breaking ALL laws of physics? To wit: If you hit something with a nuke, just the concussion wave alone, will blow it pretty badly out of shape--forcefields or not!, If you are in a tunnel and there is a massive wave of fire coming towards you--say your prayers cause fire flows like water--and explosions fly pretty damned at the speed of sound or faster! If you have a lap top that is not plugged into a LAN, you aren't going to be able to infect squat, let alone an alien computer system.

398,herbstnebel2ss,War of the Worlds updated.,9,4 July 2004,"Upon viewing Independence Day I immediately noticed that it was basically a remake of The War of the Worlds (finally). Initially the Earth is the victim of a devastating attack by alien beings. Faced with extermination mankind forgets it's petty quarrels and unites to battle the other world invaders. As in the War of the Worlds, conventional weapons are useless and even nuclear bombs have no effect. Finally a ""virus"" helps ensure a successful outcome (as opposed to bacteria). The acting in this movie is nothing great. Character development is just so-so and stone faced Bill Pullman is a bad choice for an inspiring leader. What really makes things happen are the dazzling special effects and David Arnold's sweeping score. Roland Emmerich's fast paced directorial skill keeps the story moving in spite of the B grade acting. However Randy Quade's portrayal of a chronic alcoholic is outstanding. This seems to be a favorite role of his, to the point that he's being type cast. All in all this movie is entertaining, enjoyable, and even patriotic. I highly recommend it.",Independence Day
399,Mackiatoe,"Epic, Thrilling and Awesome Special Effects!",7,21 February 2012,"Wow. This is one of my favourite films of all time. Not because it's a moving, meaningful, heart warming or terrifying film. It's a full on thriller with epic destruction scenes and a classic '50's storyline.I'll start with the bad. 1)It's a tad cheesy. Things that people say and some of the sequences are a bit clichéd, but it's easy to out aside. 2)The storyline is VERY predictable. Alien ships come along, BOOM, rebuild of forces and a big final battle. But hey, thats the storyline that's made some other great films, right?And now the good. Lots of it in fact... 1)It's utterly, incredibly, EPIC. The suspense of watching the ships arriving over the cities is really awesome. The destruction scenes are amazing. Watching everything get blown up is actually pretty cool. Sometimes, I just feel the need to watch those scenes again just for how epic they are. 2)The special effects are amazing. It just looks real. I'd dare say that some of it comes onto levels of which Avatar is on. It's scarily realistic. And it's quite a marvel to, with just how big the ships are. It's in your face and incredible to watch. 3)The storyline is a thriller. Suspense, action and a bit of romance. It's the usual Roland Emmerich. Each of the characters don't even know each other until these aliens come and destroy everything. While it's predictable, it's fun. Man throws everything it's got at the aliens, and then one simple phrase (catch a cold) changes everything. It's not entirely believable, but then again, the entire story is made up so little mistakes don't really matter. So, if you want an epic Sci-Fi thriller with amazing special effects, suspense and the best destruction scenes I have ever seen, this is the one for you. Don't take it seriously, it's not realistic. Most films aren't. This though, is already a classic, and will always be one of those 'great films'. It makes my top 10 films of all time easily!",Independence Day

402,EllisDee,Can't blame them for trying to camouflage this garbage as something great,4,5 October 1998,"""Independence Day"" was one of the most disappointing movies from 1996.  The trailer looked promising, especially with the clip of the alien ship disintegrating the White House, and I thought that this was going to be a serious movie.  However, Will Smith and Harvey Fierstein are in it; so I should have known better.  Also, if the human race is about to face extinction, I think people are much, much more likely to fight out of self-defense rather than out of patriotism.  That little pep rally speech from Bill Pullman really undermined the movie.  The virus angle was kind of interesting, if not terribly plausible.  Though it would be very likely that a spacefaring race would have some kind of protection against computer viruses, it's still possible that the aliens never used computer viruses on each other so they never developed anti-virus software (or they did have such technology, but it wasn't able to detect human-made computer viruses for one reason or another).

And OF COURSE it is possible for us humans to run it without having the handbook ready.Oh, MY! I gave this movie a four out of the ten stars available here at IMDb. Reason: I gave it ZERO for the story line (it really, REALLY gives science fiction a bad reputation!!!) and four for the fireworks. The F/X boys and girls really did a wonderful job on this movie - and the effects is why I saw it again tonight on TV. And to remind me why I was so extremely disappointed about it when I saw it in the theaters.One more thing: American patriotism and nationalism is really running high on this one. Way too high.",Independence Day

OK, so if you want a realistic movie of how Aliens came with force in numbers to kill all the humans without so much as a ""How do you do?"" Good luck with that. I mean since we have never had alien contact, what do we know? Nothing! Independence Day is not necessarily incorrect. It is a reasonable suggestion of what could happen, if aliens from outer space were real. Independence Day was a fun good movie, all the actors played their parts well, the script was fun and stoic.

Alien space ships target tourist attractions before military but again, beautiful spectacle. This movie has great performances by every actor with so much charisma. Not one character is unlikable.

419,Kyle Westphal,"Maybe the Aliens Came to Earth to Destroy The Makers of This ""Movie""",3,16 December 1999,"The Plot: Predatory aliens are coming to destroy Earth and it's up to Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum, Lord help us, to save the planet. That's basically it for a ""plot"".My Critique: It's unfortunate that one of the largest grossing films of all time also happens to be one of the stupidest. ""ID4"" is perhaps the granddaddy of all bad science fiction/special effects movies in the blockbuster-driven 1990's. It has it all, as far as blockbuster go. ""ID4"" has no real story. Aliens come to Earth and blow up things. Earth (or rather America) fights back. More things blow up. Between things blowing up, we have pitiful attempts at filler, such as a stripper saving the First Lady.The screenwriters opted for minimal character development. The Characters don't actually have much to do with the ""story"", they're just there to yell stupid one-liners and ""No!!!!"" whenever something blows up.
In place of story, special effects are used. To me, the special effects in ""ID4"" aren't even good. In the entire movie, we only see one alien. The Oscar winning special effects are mainly of explosions and ugly, gray, alien destroyers, which all look the same to me.But perhaps the main thing ""ID4"" lacks is a message. When I say message, I don't mean a moral lesson. Instead, I mean that the movie doesn't have a point it's trying to make. All great science fiction, and most movies in general, have a point to them. In ""2001 : A Space Odyssey"", the point was that man cannot rely on computers. In ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", aliens were coming to destroy Earth, like the ones in ""ID4"". However in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", the aliens were trying to teach humans a lesson about nuclear war, as was the point in many sci-fi movies from the 1950's. In ""ID4"", though, aliens simply want to destroy humans. They have no motivation for carnage.It's a true shame that a movie as stupid, thoughtless, and flashy as ""Independence Day"" is one of the highest grossing movies of all time.My Rating : 3",Independence Day
420,dreamlessv,Terrible,5,21 February 2000,"The first time I saw this movie four years ago, it became a religion for me.  However, looking back on it I realize Independence Day was the the queen mother of movie glitches. The characters are way too stereotypical.  Just look at Will Smith's character.  The aliens were probably what killed the movie.  If they are so primitive, how do they build such huge, high-tech spaceships?  The design was vile and looks like one of the rejects from Alien. With bad acting, glitches galore and the excitment level of watching chromosones divide, pass it.",Independence Day
421,willsons-2,A surprisingly entertaining movie,10,20 April 2010,"I remember seeing this movie at the cinema, amidst all the hype that surrounded its initial release. I left the cinema somewhat disappointed.Some years later I came across the video and not expecting much sat down to watch it again. This time I thoroughly enjoyed it and in fact it is now one of my favourite films.Notice that I did not say it is one of the best films. It is not. The plot is wafer thin at times and many sequences are highly improbable (such as the survival of the dog in the tunnel with the fireball). The acting is is uneven. Most of the characters are not well developed.But it is fun. It is entertaining. The interaction between Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith is a joy to behold. It is a fun feel-good movie (despite all the death and destruction).",Independence Day

And only 3 people have the guts to save humanity before it's wiped out: a pilot (Will Smith), an eccentric scientist (Jeff Goldblum) and the President of the United States (Bill Pullman).After rereading my original comment which I wrote long time ago, I've decided to rewrite it as I see it now. This is pretty much brainless entertainment just for teens and sci-fi movie lovers. Don't except to see Oscar-Winning stuff, just turn off your brain and relax. It suffers from many flaws and most of the action and lines are cheesy, but those are only minor details. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the fun. 6 out of 10.",Independence Day

There are some many things wrong with this movie, but because of that it is memorable and, in an odd sense, enjoyable. The plot is basic, the dialogue is painful and the characters are all over the place, a common attribute of Roland Emmerich. Even the action is somewhat dull (except for the destruction of the big cities by the alien ships, that stuff was pure awesomeness). Besides all the hate, it is very lovable after you peel away the awful outer layer. It's really painful, but it is perfect in the eyes of those who can see it's horrific nature and relish in that fact.",Independence Day

Ok, the movie had terrific special effects. It had a lot of explosions and cars flying. I tell you what, go rent Die Hard and Star Wars and save yourself the trouble of this silliness.Will Smith displays his strength by knocking out an alien that later takes out an entire lab of armed men. (Note: the ""Alien"" was really just a suit with the real alien inside. How do you knock a suit out?) Jeff Goldblum proves that defeating a superior aggressive race is as easy as the sound of a modem connecting. (To what, I have NO idea) Randy Quaid does some interesting slow-motion stunt flying.

It may be far from a gritty and realistic movie but with so many elements blended into it such as action, air combat, explosions, a huge star cast, a feel good story and totally awesome special effects, it has to be one of the best movie efforts ever made. Despite so much content, the viewer never gets saturated with too much and everything has a major part to play.

This is a movie where you just turn your brain off, and just enjoy the fun ride it is, and root for the humans, and especially the Americans (:p) to win over evil!...The movie I must say has a lot of memorable moments... A lot of them comes from the great special effects. I remember when watching this as a kid, I was woved by the effects, and they still look pretty good to this day!

Independence Day is one of my favorite movies, and I have a TON of trouble finding what people hate so much about it. It shows something almost no movies show nowadays, the better side of human nature, the coming together to take out the larger threat that threatens to destroy them all.

430,radiopal,Problems... but overall... I liked the movie,8,15 February 2004,"Possible Spoilers!!!ID-4 was, in my estimation, a fantastic movie.  Yes, there were problems, the Marines being everywhere, forgetting about the U.S. Navy and Air Forces. Not to mention that the only aircraft that the U.S. Military seemed to have was the F-14 Tomcats.  Okay, that was a huge hurtle to get around, but the quality of the story telling allowed me to over look that.I've heard people talk about the imcompatabilty of computer systems.  And that it would be impossible for a computer to interact with others.  Huh? What do you think that the internet is?  Not to mention networking?  Not a real problem as long as there are protocols set up to interact with the two systems.  And David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) had plenty of time (and know-how) to set up the necessary protocols using his MAC and the alien fighter computer system, after all Dr. Okun (Brent Spiner) and his staff had several years to diagnose and determine how the ships systems work together.The plot weaknesses, I can't think of any right now, weren't enough to distract me.  As a matter of fact when I first saw the movie, after I got out, I turned around and bought another ticket.  (And took several friends to see it - and they're still friends... so I'm glad that they also liked it).It's a good movie and one that I watch at least once a quarter.

Great action, some truly funny moments, great space flights, does not bore you at all. HOWEVER, this movie has some HUGE shortcomings. Dialogue - uggh. Bill Pullman as President - yech. Too many stereotypes and caricatures - do the blacks and Jews really need to be the Hollywood cookie-cutter? Sickening. And of course, the biggest 'eye-roller' of them all - giving an alien spaceship a computer virus. Was this plot piece thought of the same folks fell for the Ugandi Prince email scam?? Anyone with half a brain knows you can't just ""give"" something a computer virus - they aren't air-born germs...

From Godzilla 2000 to 2012, Mr Emmerich has made the majority of a career of making movies on the edge of largest as possible. He has created a model that has allowed the return of disaster movies and it started with Independence Day.The movie depicts a struggle between humanity-reeling from devastating attacks and highly advanced alien invaders. The story follows a select group of these survivors enduring attacks on a genocide scale. Mr. Emmerich was able to put together an all star cast to complement the Oscar-winning visual effects.Bill Pullman leads the cast as the President of the United States, a steady youthful figure who falls into the standard profile of a cinematic President. Jeff Goldblum continued his trend of playing the scientist figure who suffers in life due to his lack of emotional expression. Will Smith in a role that cemented his meteoric rise to acting stardom plays an air force pilot. Costars include Robert Loggia, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid and musician, Harry Connick Jr.While the movie's theme coincides with it's release weekend, July 3rd; the movie itself tends to pay homage to films such as Star Wars, The Day the Earth Stood Still and other classic science fiction movies. This is done primarily through familiar camera angles and setups that were pioneered during the classic era.While Mr. Emmerich's cast does a good job of moving the plot forward and showing appropriate emotion as needed; Independence Day shows it's weaknesses during predictable plot twists and the lack of a singular identifiable antagonist. The movie now nineteen years old has stood the test of time and compared with today's blockbusters still is able to show it's quality.",Independence Day

Normally these things turn me off to a movie. But ID4 is too much fun, I don't care how bad it is.
Paying homage to 50's invasion movies, 70's disaster movies, Star Wars, War of the Worlds, etc., ID4 digs right in as huge alien saucers drop into our atmosphere and hover ominously over the 30 most explodable landmarks in the world. They soon reveal that they're - gasp! - unfriendly and start wiping out humanity city by city. The rest of the movie follows several groups of characters trying desperately to come up with a way to fend off the slimy visitors.The fx, of course, are top-notch. There are a few battle scenes that are amazing. The acting isn't all that hot, but Will Smith is his usual perky self (I enjoy describing Will Smith as ""perky""), and Bill Pullman brings what he can to the presidency, including a scene late in the movie in which he rallies his attack pilots before the final battle; this over-the-top monologue is by far my favorite movie speech ever.

Will Smith was his usual self funny and entertaining.  While the realism may be a little hard to take, (spoilers) laptops compatible with alien technology a virus drummed up in a couple days that can disable the ships etc.  It wasn't really meant to be taken as an extremely scientifically accurate movie.  Just a fun alien invasion movie where humanity has to come together and fight off the aggressors, a little over-used subject maybe but what isn't these days?  At any rate this rehash was pulled off very well.  One thing I would like to say though is to all those posting complaints about the Americans always find the answer.  This is a movie about Americans made for Americans so why would they go all that way and then have say, to pull a country out of the hat, the British win it for them? (no slight to the British intended at all in that) That would be stupid!  I'm not an expert on foreign films but I doubt there are a lot of British films that show German's winning it or French films that have Spaniards winning so I think these ""America always seems to do it"" arguments are rather unfair, especially for a film such as this one which is a work of total fiction.

451,sevenof9fl,One of the Best Movies of All Time,10,30 April 2005,"Yes, I know some of you don't like it; yes, I know the critics trashed it, but I think the critics missed the point: it's the best parody of alien invasion movies that's ever been made; it's just serious enough to apparently fool a lot of folks. It even comes complete with Brent Spiner's send-up of his own image (Data, Star Trek NG) as Area 51's mad scientist, Dr Oaken (sp?), Randy Quaid's parody of Crazy Cousin Eddie in the Vacation movies, Jeff Goldblum's send-up of the eccentric nerd, and a whole cast of familiar stereotypes from other alien movies.The ""deal"" with this movie is that if you're not a Sci-Fi fan with a history of watching classic Sci-Fi movies, the arcane references will most likely fly over your head.There's something for every Sci-Fi fan, lines and references lifted straight from ""War of the Worlds,"" ""2001, A Space Odessy,"" and several others.Watch the movie with a sense of humor and tongue planted firmly in cheek, and if nothing else, set yourself up for a hilarious and sterling performance by Will Smith, in one of his first high visibility roles.That alone is worth the price of the rental.",Independence Day
452,maddymoo,good fun,7,13 November 2005,"I like disaster movies which involve cities whose landmarks I can recognise, and especially ones involving stuff falling from the sky. I also like stories involving aliens (regardless of credibility). Therefore, despite various silly bits, I do enjoy Independence Day.My main criticism: Patricia (President's daughter) does not react to the violence and horror surrounding her. I don't think we even see a tear in her eye. Does she get upset when her mother doesn't reappear as planned? No. Does she get upset when her mother dies? No. Okay, this is meant to be a feel-good movie overall, but as the other characters get into their emotions, why can't she?My other criticism is the neatness/coincidence factor, where Jasmine stays at the bombed base, Steve goes to the base - ta-da, reunited! And Jasmine just happened to rescue the First Lady. Oh, I bet Mr President was pleased by that! (Does Steve get to be a NASA dude now? He deserves some kind of reward!) I know these points are trivial really - Patricia is not a major character and the Steve-and-Jasmine thing is an important part of the heart-swelling, tear-jerking atmosphere - so I should stop whining and just enjoy the film, yeah? I think the aliens are great - just scary enough, shades of 'Alien' (or rather, HR Geiger) in their design. Also a bit repulsive (the tentacles) so we can go ""ewww!"" with a clean conscience.There are probably deep meanings in this film, ""a moral of the story"", but I can't be bothered finding them. It's a ""good guys win"" vehicle, with a bit of American patriotism thrown in (they'd have to, given where most of the action takes place). It's good fun, and for this film I don't mind the soppy happy ending.",Independence Day
453,Ivan-28,I'm pleased to read so many bad reviews,4,11 March 1999,"I've been reading the comments and am very encouraged to read so many reviews trashing this stupid film. My co-workers loved this movie and think of me as a snob for revealing what a piece of garbage it is. No need for me to reiterate why I think it's so bad. The reviews before me did a much better job than I could.I am disheartened, however, to know that it made a ton of money and will encourage Hollywood to spew out more swill like it, instead of thought-provoking science fiction like ""Contact"" and ""Blade Runner"" because those type of films don't make as much money.To those of you in power in Hollywood, PLEASE LISTEN! Read these reviews and learn. If you're going to spend a lot of money on terrific special effects and a star-studded cast, spend some money on a terrific science-fiction writer (for a change) and let him/her write what he/she wants with no or little studio interference.

Even though I liked this movie, I didn't think it was great. The special effects where good, but I expected them to be mind blowing but they weren't, Twister's effects were better. Also the movie was too long and the beginning was boring. Another thing that disappointed me was the aliens they weren't scary or creepy or imaginative like the ones in aliens.

The actors are a wide variety of good actors, and yet here, they show no chemistry. For instance Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum are two very fine, capable actors. But they share the screen in what should be the dramatic high point of the movie and it comes off as overacted and cheesy. The whole film is poorly conceived, poorly directed, not thought out at all, and has fine actors giving their worst performances ever. Bill Pullman and Mary McDonnell as the president and first lady make watching grass grow exciting. Skip this film. The sad part is I was excited to see this when it first came out.

It plays upon some good themes, more than action. It examines the true meanings of relationships we have with other people. There is a drunken father who has lost the respect of his children, mostly his oldest son. There is the ambitious wife who leaves her husband to maintain the growth of her career. True, some stereotypes lurk about, but the film is all about putting aside petty differences and concentrating on what is truly important. Oh, and shooting aliens.",Independence Day
458,crazymanmichael,"Silly, inept, but actually quite a lot of fun",6,14 July 2013,"Independence Day is one of those films that virtually defines ""willing suspension of disbelief"". The amount of ""will"" involved is substantial, but taken on those terms, it can actually be an enjoyable film (though fluffy enough to stuff a mattress). I wonder why I am inclined to give more latitude in this regard to some movies than others. It's a puzzle. Armageddon occupies approximately the same stature as Independence Day, and I was more than willing to be savagely dismissive of the former, whereas the latter gets a much more cushioned clubbing. Both films suffer from essentially the same maladies, cartoonish, one-dimensional characters, enough action-movie clichés to choke a hippo, and plot holes larger than the spaceships themselves (which are pretty f-king huge.) These spaceships (which appear to be about a mile or so in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion and no apparent way of staying in the air--more on that in a moment) appear one morning over the major capitals of the world and... well, do nothing. Circling F16s, radio greetings and cute halter-clad teenage girls holding up ""Welcome to Earth"" signs garner no response. But David Levinson, a rogue scientist played by a suitably befuddled Jeff Goldblum, detects a synchronized radio pulse linking all the ships together and realizes that they are counting down to... something. Something pretty sinister, he assumes. Turns out to be true. The aliens, it seems, are bent on destroying humanity and taking over the planet. The aliens unleash their weaponry, destroying many of the earth's major cities and all seems lost, until Levinson and cocky air force pilot Steven Hiller, played by Will Smith, hatch a plan to pilot a captured alien saucer to the ""mothership"" in orbit around earth and disable the master computer system coordinating the attack.Plot holes and other absurdities abound. IMDb lists almost two hundred ""goofs"" for this film (which must be near the record, I would think.) Anachronisms, plot holes, character errors, audio-video unsynchronized, continuity errors, crew/equipment visible, errors in geography, factual errors and revealing mistakes all indicate that this is something rather less than high art, as a work of cinematic craftsmanship.MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS: By far the biggest plot hole is nothing less than the central plot device by which we earthlings defeat the supposedly technologically far superior aliens. Goldblum and Smith commandeer a two-person alien saucer (this is the one that crash-landed in Roswell New Mexico in 1947 and has been in storage at Area 51 ever since, according to the film) and fly it to the alien mothership. There they upload a computer virus into the mothership's main computer system, thus disabling the entire alien attack.Bear in mind that a computer virus is really just a computer program like any other, the only difference being that a virus is deliberately designed to do something nasty (to be completely technically accurate, it's unclear whether the program in question is really a ""virus."" A computer virus a program designed to self-replicate and spread to other connected systems, hence the name. The ""virus"" in the movie is certainly an example of ""malware"". Does it self-replicate and spread? Unclear.) The point is, to write a virus requires not only a thorough knowledge of the system it is to run on (so you know which vulnerabilities to exploit,) but also an ability to program in a language that system understands. A program written for a PC will not run on a Mac, and a program written for Linux likely won't run on either. Okay yes, that's not entirely accurate; but I'm trying to make a broader point here, that being: what are the odds that someone could write a program that would run on a computer system designed by ALIENS? Or use the appropriate communication protocol to upload it? Do the aliens use TCP/IP? What are the odds that any malware could, within seconds, completely disable an entire multi-node command and control system for an whole fleet of spaceships? Oh, and in a blatant example of product placement, the laptop used to upload the virus is a Macbook. Good thing the aliens use Apple computers too, huh? END OF SPOILER So,why do I hang onto this movie (yes, I do own it) and actually give is a decent rating? Because actually, it's rather fun. Yes, it's stupid, juvenile, ineptly made, ridiculously plotted and acted, and contains more holes than Swiss cheese, but taken on its own terms (one could almost call it camp), it's really quite an amusing couple of hours. Some of the shots of the alien mothership are actually kind of cool, too. Watch for Brent Spiner (Data on Star Trek TNG) as a quirky, neurotic Area 51 scientist who's been in the lab so long he has no idea relate to actual humans.Oh, and just how DO these spaceships stay in the air? One can assume they must weigh an awful lot, but they are able to float like soap bubbles above our biggest cities without doing any damage. Simple physics, i.e. Newton's Second Law of Motion, would demand that some sort of downward force be required to support all that weight. In physics terms, there would be no difference between supporting the ship's weight in the air, or on the ground, and that downward force would be borne by whatever is underneath. Even some sort of ""levitation beam"" would still need something to push against, and that something would be the ground below. In reality, the saucers wouldn't need to deploy their ""primary weapon""... the weight of the spaceships alone would crush the entire city beneath them. I suppose you could argue that a sufficiently advanced alien civilization could have mastered some sort of anti-gravity technology, thereby nullifying the Earth's gravitational field in the vicinity of the ships. Maybe so. I rather think Einstein would have something to say about that. I know: nitpicky.",Independence Day

460,PeterJasonQuill,Better than I was hearing,10,24 June 2016,"Independence Day is one of the many classics that is still good to this day, but even so people are saying it is cheesy, or even bad. Some people are even saying it is cheesy, but incredibly likable. Personally I don't find this movie the tiniest bit cheesy. It is very enjoyable and packs action and destruction. Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman's characters are developed very well and their development really fits in with the story. The acting was really good, and all the characters definitely do feel like there is an alien invasion. And the storytelling and scripting was really good and it definitely puts together a masterpiece of a movie.My one complaint though is that the plot goes quite slow at first, but it picks up quite quickly and gets the excitement and mayhem going.Overall, this is a very enjoyable sci-fi action and adventure movie packed with disaster and excitement.

One viewer wondered why the hijacked fighter would have been allowed inside the mother ship, contrary to what most would have considered the alien order of battle.Also, every time they make a scifi picture, LA always gets demolished. For the life of me I can't understand why they destroy LA time and again. Don't the movie makers like where they live? They ""intrinsically"" destroyed Houston in this one with an atomic weapon aimed against the invaders. So they should try destroying Houston by itself like they did with the killer bee picture in 1978, and leave poor LA alone.

I do not know why the aliens would send any type of ""message"" that the humans could receive. At zero, the invading aliens propel a laser pulse from positioned destroyer ships that demolishes various major cities on earth including DC, where the President originally is. The idea, I imagine, is to reduce morale and make it easier to kill them all! To prevent their annihilation, while at Area 51, one American scientists proposes a plan to the President who arrived by Air Force One with him to give the alien computer system a virus. This virus will bring down all of the alien shields so that the united human counter-offensive can use some of their own weapons, i.e., a nuclear missile. The Americans discovered previously they were not able to penetrate past them; after the first strike the President ordered the military to launch a nuclear bomb from a grounded armored vehicle that had a visual of one of the destroyers in sight. The missile was not able to pass its shield. The scientist and a soldier commandeer a captured enemy jet stored there, at Area 51, and successfully upload the virus into the mother ship by flying the jet into the mother ship's docking bay and connecting to their computer system. With their shields down, each and every of the invader's ships is taken down. All the humans had to do was remove their shields.",Independence Day
463,Chris-268,A sad commentary on the insecurity of a nation.,1,5 July 2000,"This piece of tripe was one of the worst and most offensive movies I have ever seen. 0 out of 10. Negative numbers, even. Was there one, single original idea in the whole film? Not that I could spot. The aliens were a bald faced copy of H.R. Giger's ""Alien."" Their fighter craft were knockoffs of those used in ""War Of The Worlds"", released more than 40 years prior. The idea that a computer virus could be used to defeat an alien technology millions of times more advanced than our own is insulting to anyone with half a brain. It's been done, and the idea comes off as badly here as before. (Read ""3001: Final Odyssey"" by Arthur C. Clarke.)These points alone aren't enough to ruin a movie completely; they merely add to the ridiculousness of it in this case. When ID was released, I read an article in Time magazine that talked about the psychology behind the movie. At the time, the United States had run out of Enemies. The Soviet Union wasn't a threat anymore, and the Middle East had already been pounded into submission during the Gulf War. There was no one for us to pick on, to show our overwhelming superiority to. Sensing the void, Hollywood created a new enemy in the race of planet conquering aliens seen in this film. And they made that enemy seem so invincible that it's all the more remarkable in the end when the macho Americans are able to defeat them single-handedly. Yes, it is the good old USA that saves the day, all by itself. Wil Smith's machismo is nauseating. In a movie that doesn't take itself so seriously (Men In Black) this kind of acting is entertaining. But not here.I am an American, and I take pride in America. But this movie exemplifies everything that is wrong with our outlook. We shouldn't have to build up our self esteem by pretending we are so superior, even to alien races who have conquered space. From a credibility standpoint, this is absurd. Like so many bad sci-fi movies, the producers never stopped to consider the unlikeliness of the scenario. Without going on a tirade about ""alien paranoia""- that is, the belief that extra terrestrial life forms are always hostile and want to steal our planet- I'll just say this: to say that the ""Melissa"" or the ""I Love You"" virus would be effective against their technology would be like saying that a couple of guys armed with pea shooters could take out an entire Panzer tank division.Don't waste your time with this. Watch an intelligent sci-fi movie, like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", or ""Contact."" Films like that make you think; ID4 makes you want to sink back in the lazyboy, crack open another beer, and say ""Hot dang, we kicked some alien a**!""",Independence Day

For instance, the parts that look like a sketch based on Henny Youngman bits (a Jew and a gay go into a bar...), are Vader and Solo any less cliché? The parts that strain believable? Metachlorians anyone? Fantasy-based sci-fi, which has the feel of being directed by a German (haven't confirmed this) who pulls his cliché cards the way Capra pulls happy endings out of the tears.But -- from now on the whole world will celebrate July 4th as Independence Day? It's about bloody time the Americans took the lead while the Earth gets blown to bits? Yay the Americans saved the day? Insulting to the world, and embarrassing to any American with a brain. Needless to say, the flag-waving survivalist Winnebago across the desert crowd wouldn't be embarrassed by this movie.I often wonder if more Americans have been a broad (transgender) than have been abroad, but regardless I live in a huge multicultural city where you never hear American without bloody in front of it.

466,Irakli28,"Very expensive, but still cheap",3,18 August 2000,"Some latest American films remind me of big `burger'-like sandwiches: too many things amassed in them, no traces of taste and a question `how can anyone eat and even swallow such a big piece of?' Well, to be honest, ID is definitely not the worst film of the decade, and even of the year and it's a good evolution for Mr.Emmerich after Moon 44 and Universal Soldier-like second rate flicks (some say his  debut was the best film of his career, unfortunately, I have not seen it). But this cannot justify the immense success of the film. The thing is that the director has calculated the formula of success with American audience (patriotism + freedom + democracy + lots of special effects + couple of stars + little work for viewers brain + simple and predictable story so that the audience feels happy that it can foresee the next move of the plot=lots of money=good film; if you add to this science fiction elements it may become a super blockbuster, if you add a couple of serious problems and exclude aliens you may even get an Oscar nomination ) and if the film is blockbuster in USA it almost always earns a good money in the rest of the world, but than, this is not art, not even entertainment, its just an arithmetic.Now about the film itself. This is not a science fiction. Some other term should be invented for the film like this, because it sounds almost ridiculous, OK, I see fiction, but where the hell is science? Real science fiction books or films use some invented or fantastic world to show some all human problems, this doesn't mean that all SFi films should be as serious as films of Tarkovsky or Kubrick, but Independence Day goes beyond all imaginable limits of cliché melodrama, cheap action film and hurrah-patriotic propaganda (when watching ID sometimes I even suspected that German Emmerich mocks at excessive patriotic feelings of some Americans  his last film `Patriot' goes even farther in this nationalistic fields of glory-but if this is a satire it is a very subtle one and most people take the `God bless America, land that I love' part of the film rather seriously). Of course, some may say `the film is what it is - pure entertainment, want serious themes? go, watch Fellini', partly it's right, and entertaining side of the film is not that bad (effects are good, the first part  `the chess game' till the `checkmate' is rather engrossing and I may say that on the level of the entertainment I liked it, than, especially after air plane attack scene, goes blah-blah-blah). When I watch a film like this I often ask myself wouldn't it still be a blockbuster if the storylines were better developed, dialogs were wiser, characters were not that schematic? Ok maybe you earn a couple millions more in USA if you make the American president to save the universe, but what we, non-Americans done to deserve such a torture? I think its mainly fault of critics and ordinary viewers. The first should have burned such film for its bad taste and low level, the audience should demonstrate that of course it likes entertainment but it doesn't mean that entertaining film should be stupid and flat. But the main problem is that Americans themselves are obsessed in finding `messages' in the films. So, what is the message of this one?AMERICA IS THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD, it saved the world from feudalism (`The Patriot'), and communism (there are more films on this subject than I can remember) , now it saves us from all possible enemies from Islamic terrorists to Godzila (by the way, it may shock some, but I LIKED GODZILLA, at least there was not that much flag waving and it seemed to be  more pure entertainment than pro-American and pro-militaristic propaganda). If the ID stayed within the limits of `Martians attack' and disaster films, it would be pretty acceptable but here all these is mixed with enormous dosage of `America, America, God shed his grace on thee' and `Rembo-Rocky-A Few Good Man-stand up and fight' turns.

472,coolmule,Excellent first hour let down by Yankee doodle dandy cheesiness in the last act,7,4 June 2003,"******Warning, Spoilers*******This blend of 50's alien visitation flick, 70's disaster movie and 90's UFO paranoia has received a huge amount of criticism on this site. Undoubtedly some of it is merited, but much of it is unfair. Firstly, for it's first hour Independence Day is excellent. It comes closer than any other film to showing what the reality of massive alien ships suddenly turning up would actually be like (a mixture of mass panic and euphoria) while at the same time plays like a military technothriller, with lots of tense scenes in command centres, submarines and the White House. The shots of the alien craft arriving over New York, Washington and LA are hugely impressive and ominous, while the frequent use of TV news broadcasts lends the whole thing an air of believability (for more of this check out the 10 minute mockumentary on the DVD). Also, a great sense of tension is built up by Jeff Goldblum's character's discovery of the countdown signal.
The payoff of all of this is the second reason the film is worth a look, namely some of the most impressive visual effects you are ever likely to see. Even seven years on the shots of the White House and Empire State Building being obliterated are astonishing (although undoubtedly helped by the fact that they taker place in darkness). The effects throughout the rest of the film are excellent as well, and use a nice mixture of CGI, models and puppets, rather than being a total CGI fest.So far, so good, and if the film had continued in this way it could have been a brilliant, dark sci-fi epic. Unfortunately, the last half of the film is crammed full of some of the most jingoistic, cringeworthy, America-saves-the-day dialogue you are ever likely to hear. To be honest, most of it is so bad that it's not even offensive, just hilarious - it's impossible to keep a straight face when Bill Pulman's President gives his 'Our Independence Day' speech. The English public schoolboy RAF pilots are equally good, for all the wrong reasons - ""About bloody time, what do they intend to do?"" - absolutely priceless!! Thoroughly bloody good chaps, all of them!While it is possible to just laugh at the above examples, some of the other scenes towards the end of the film really do grate. I'm thinking here specifically of the downright patronising shots of arabs and africans celebrating the destruction of the alien ships courtesy of the good ol' US of A. The rest of the last hour is littered with dialogue which may not be particularly offensive, but is just plain cheesy.As for other criticisms which people have mentioned, well, yes, the plot is full of holes, but so are the plots of films like The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark (how does the Falcon get to Bespin without a hyperdrive? How does Indy survive the journey to the Nazi hideout on the outside of a submarine?). The fact is that it's a tribute to 50's B-movies, and therefore like Star Wars and Indiana Jones it's plot shouldn't be scrutinised too closely. It has a sheen of reality, and that's enough. And as for saying that it started the trend towards big budget special effects at the expense of acting and story, well that's been said since King Kong came out.As for the rest, the acting is OK, nothing special (although Will Smith does have some pretty funny one liners), with the music serving it's purpose without really being memorable. This film is very much a product of it's time - REM are on the radio and the X-Files is namechecked. This means of the course that the World Trade Centre is still a part of the New York skyline and it's a little disconcerting, post 9/11, seeing famous New York landmarks being obliterated. Still, the film is worth a look - just enjoy the excellent first hour, then pause the film, go and have a few beers and proceed to kill yourself laughing through the cheesy awfulness of the second hour!Rating - 7/10",Independence Day

I can think of a lot of films which have worse acting in them: I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, SCREAM 1,2 AND 3, THE MUMMY, THE MUMMY RETURNS, TWISTER and THEY, those are a few that come to mind.Is America capable of making a film which doesn't centre on it's self???",Independence Day
474,Close_The_Door,Unbearably ridiculous,1,29 April 2006,"I cannot believe that so much money was spent to create this monster. I watched it last night for the first time (some 10 years after its production). I recall when a friend of mine, who attended to a faculty of cinema, was ""obliged"" by her professor to watch it, because Independence Day apparently succeeded in exorcising some widespread fear. But such a collection of stereotypes makes authors of pulp-literature blush. The USA saviors of the world; the infamous CIA agent; the Jewish scientist; the scientist who cannot keep contact to reality; the alcoholic Vietnam veteran; the sexy although honest lap dancer; the career woman;the intelligent generous president; the tough black ""hip hop"" soldier; the pure and smiling first lady;... I couldn't help bursting laugh out loud when I saw Will Smith knocking the alien, or looking for his wife and finding her at the first attempt, in the middle of a destroyed city. Still, It becomes very sad then to watch this disaster movie today, after 9/11 and seeing the Twin Towers still.

THe acting was lackluster despite an all star cast. The film was too cluttered, it jumped from character to character too much and had no focus.

Saddam and all his terrorist ilk need to see this both for the capabilities it shows of American technology against those who would threaten us with their box-cutters, spears and camels.

The only difference between ""Independence Day"" and ""Top Gun"" is that the 2 adversaries were humans and aliens instead of Americans and Soviet pilots. Independence Day is really just patriotic drivel in means of plot and adventure. But the film comes into its best moments when the action sequences hit the screen.

481,algjgg,One of the best all-out action films in history.,10,27 August 2007,"I was 6 when I first saw this movie. I really didn't understand it because I was in my early youth. My dad told me when we saw it the humans were fighting to get toys back from the aliens. I thought it was awesome so I saw it with him. Eleven years later and I love it even more. From my understanding, it could very well be one of those movies that is so gripping and well thought out that it makes us celebrate our greatest holiday ever, Independence Day, even more. But lets get right to the point: it is that darn good.The story is about Mankind desperately fighting back against an alien civilization that has destroyed every major city on the planet. Their main goal is to exterminate Mankind and take over they're natural resources. Roland put together a very strong story with excellent character development and acting. Will Smith, Bill Pullman, and crew put in star-studded performances. But like every movie there has to be some things that aren't so good, but lets start off with the good:1: Acting was amazing and the drama was nice.2: Special effects in this movie blew everyone's mind on how the future of movies would look and this movie certainly delivers.3: The action is unbelievably unreal and that what makes this movie stand out.4: Character development went to most of the main characters.Now the bad:1: There were some cheesy moments in the film that irritated me. For example, when the alien tried to break into the President's mind, and it was killed, the President instantly knew the alien's main objective. ""I saw. . . .his thoughts. I saw what they're planning to do."" Sorry that doesn't cut it. There are some of these cheesy moments but they don't cut away the awesomeness of the movie.2: Little screen time for the actual aliens themselves. You see them almost a total of 15-20 times when the movie is nearly 3 hours. It's OK to have them undercover in their ships and battling the squad planes, but how about a little more interaction themselves.3: They should have saved this movie until the new millennium. That way it would have looked better and truly overlook every movie hence forth.Overall, this movie is really amazing and it's groundbreaking nature can't possibly be ignored by any SciFi fan. 10/10",Independence Day
482,Hellmao,Popcorn,5,11 August 2005,"Director Roland Emmerich blends the essential ingredients of the patriotic blockbuster cocktail  loads of action, family values, national identity, religious faith, cool heroes, very recognizable evil, and a happy end. Any alien invasion movie has the right to be completely stupid and maybe even the duty to be completely illogical. In this matter, Independence Day really delivers. Miraculous last second escapes by an airplane, a spaceship and even a dog, explosions in space, the earth rotating with monster speed, extremely bad aiming aliens who can travel light years and use a doomsday machine only to get tricked and beaten by Jeff Goldblum. Yes, the celebrating-stupidity-list for this one is impressive and at one point we can clearly see the Fresh Prince of Bel Air smacking a guy in a rubber octopus outfit in the desert. Unfortunately, Independence Day has not much more than that. The destructions of Empire State Building, Capitol and White House do look good on a big screen, but so does a giant marshmallow man. Paul Verhoeven showed a little later in ""Starship Troopers"" what irony and sarcasm can do in movies with alien enemies. Here we only see fast food simplicity. A big bag of Popcorn. Besides, a key role in the final victory belongs to a lunatic, saving the world through personal sacrifice in a suicide mission to beat the technically far superior enemy invaders. It's all a matter of perspective.",Independence Day
483,kcdl,Crud,4,11 November 2006,"When I first saw this movie I had a great time (I was 15). I saw it twice in the cinemas.However later I got it on video and only then did I realise how bad it was. I really does get worse and worse (yes I watch a few times to make sure! I'm a sucker I know). Now normally I can ""turn off my brain"" but only to an extent. There is a point when I movie is sooo way out that you can't ignore it.It has one good point and that is the special effects. Even then you HAVE to see it on a big screen to get a sense of scale.I shall attempt to list the bad points *spoiler*: 1. No suspense. You know right from the start how it is going to turn out.2. No internal consistency. These ship can cross interstellar distances a fantastic speeds and yet they take ages to get into position. The small fighter ship can reach the moon in less than a day and yet they have trouble keeping up with fighter jet. The alien fighter's were pretty just weirdly shaped jet fighters in the way they moved. Thus the dogfights scenes were just like any old war movie, when they could have made it exciting and different. So no tension there, they just looked evenly matched apart from the shields.3. Corny as hell and just soooo American and patriotic. Puke.4. The dumbest plan in history. Apart from the virus thing, what the hell are they going to do about millions of tons of spaceship hit the ground? 5. Boring subplots, namely the crop duster pilot.6. Almost entirely 2D characters with perhaps a couple of exceptions.Eh, what am I wasting my time on? I'd be here forever.In conclusion only watch it if you've never seen it before, you can turn off your brain and you own your own movie theatre.",Independence Day
484,prfrmr,"Not the best film writing ever done, nor Pullmans' best work",5,12 January 2007,"I didn't particularly care on the whole for this film. Even though I watched it in its entirety, it had a few funny scene moments I give credit too.The comic interaction between Will Smith & Jeff Goldblum gets your funny bone tickling at times, with Goldblums' classic, ""Oops?? What's this oops???..."" And the scene where Smith is dragging the dead alien through the desert, rambling and gripping about some barbecue.Bill Pullman certainly wasn't allotted the greatest performance of his career with this so-called provincial presidential role - given a slightly weak and mediocre script he was forced to make do with. Bill is a very fine actor and film star---however this role certainly didn't do him much justice. But again, this tends to happen quite a bit under Hollywood film-making, regardless how much cash producers finance into bigger name projects. Generally it was just the case that millions were bank rolled into what ended up here a mediocre screenplay. Will Smith is given some good characterization to play with, as his adrenalin-pumped, street-witted personification projects. But again, its become his stereo-type with most of the high roller characters he's previously played, and in later films.Overall -- the action and special effects could have been far better CGI generated, had the producer and crew put more effort into lessening the cheesiness of the alien attack scenes - which from a classic 60's or 70's B movie point of view, probably would be acceptable. But this film is supposed to be modern day. So the half-baked effects do not do it much justice. Very entertaining for the 13 and younger crowd. But for die-hard or serious comedy film-goers, this one gets a slight thumbs-down for so-so screenplay, effects, musical score, and overall direction.PEANUT",Independence Day
485,thenachoman,Still as optimistic and inspiring as it was in 1996,10,27 July 2012,"I was 14 when Independence Day came out in 1996. Being a boy, into war games and sci-fi, it is perhaps no surprise that I loved it and went to see it about five times at the movies (no small achievement when you're a kid with hardly any money). At the time it was to me, the perfect movie. It had a great storyline, non-stop action, humor and incredible special effects. The love interest stuff went over my head of course.Fast forward to today - July 2012. I am much older, and hopefully (?) much wiser. I've seen loads and loads of films since Independence Day. My tastes have become more sophisticated and I know much more about how films are made and why they made in the way they are. I've also become much more cynical about movies - unfortunately - and I guess that is somewhat inevitable with age.Independence Day was on TV the other night and I thought 'what the hell - I'll watch it again.' I was a bit wary of doing this because I was fairly sure that I would hate it. I would be embarrassed that I liked it as a 14 year old. This has already happened to me with other movies I've watched as an adult that I loved as a child. But I loved this movie so much that I wanted to give it a chance. Maybe at 29 I would still enjoy it as I did 15 years ago.By the time I had finished watching it I felt like I was 14 again. I was optimistic and hopeful about the human race - again. Screw the Global Financial Crisis - we can beat it! Yeah climate change is a big worry - but we can beat that too! Yeah! And I'm not joking either. I felt so good after watching this movie that it felt like I'd been injected with a shot with Anthony Robbin's personality.How does a popcorn flick like Independence Day do this? Yes, I liked the humor, especially Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsh. Yes the special effects stand up pretty well. The pacing is pretty much perfect. The script isn't amazing but there is some good dialogue in there. Even the president's speech wasn't as corny as I remember.The reason I think Independence Day is such a great movie is that it is imbued with a sense of optimism about mankind. I don't think it's forced either. Movies are a reflection on the politics and history they are produced in. Independence Day was made in 1996, a time where the world was generally at peace and hopeful and optimistic about the future. It is hard not to get carried along with the confidence and optimism in Independence Day. My cynic turned off after about 30 minutes and by the end I was cheering along with everyone else. Maybe harder. It feels like it's been so long since there has been any news in the world to be positive about.In 2012 the world has changed a lot from 1996. America is no longer the superpower it was then. 9/11 and terrorism still cast a shadow. Most of the world is in recession. Climate change is becoming a reality. Some think it could get worse. There isn't a great sense of optimism at the moment. Watching Independence Day again renewed my hope in mankind, like many great movies do. The cynic in me wanted to laugh at the idea of the world uniting together, mock the idea of Israelis and Syrians fighting side by side, and ridicule out of a crop duster pilot giving up his life to take out a city sized alien space ship. But the 14 year old inside me won out - that idealism and optimism was still there - thankfully. I can't wait until movies like this are made again. That will mean that we are again moving forward with a sense of optimism and confidence about the future. And Hollywood movies will begin to reflect that. Maybe we will work out how to beat climate change. Or maybe the world economy will start booming again. There is a lot to look forward to. Great films help us rediscover our sense of optimism about the future. And Independence Day, for all its flaws, is one of them.",Independence Day
486,ethansanders-40501,An enjoyable romp,8,11 September 2016,"I'm not a fan of director Roland Emmerich, he is essentially the German Micheal Bay as all he does is make poorly made special effects driven blockbusters without any intelligence or fun. Plus he mad a certain 1998 film so bad I will not mention it by name ( hint-it rhymes with Modzilla). There's nothing wrong with doing spectacle driven action films so long as there is heart and entertainment value. This is where Independence Day comes in, a film that has a lot of charisma and charm. Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith are enthusiastic leads who manage to keep you interested even when something isn't blowing up and the film is fully aware of how dumb it is and therefore embraces it and has fun. As a result the audience has fun too. Obviously you see a movie like this for the spectacle and this film delivers as the effects still hold up even today and the action scenes are exciting and energetic. The first act build up manages to keep the viewer hooked as it climaxes with some of the most outstanding explosions ever caught on film. Followed by a fun dogfight sequence. However the film does stall during the second and first half o the third act with only the alien autopsy being interesting. However once Bill Pulmman gives his patriotic speech the film kicks into high gear once again.",Independence Day

Step forward Will Smith, who says ""...I've seen what these can do.."" and so on.Erm, no Mr., Smith you got SHOT DOWN by one, remember??

489,MarkB-11,Patriarchy and Patriotism,8,7 November 1999,"There is an undercurrent today, rumbling about that men aren't particularly needed in that 'old-fashioned' way. That primal level defenses simply are a thing of the past. Well, to my mind, that kind of mind-set presumes an awful lot. I am watching, with some trepidation, feminist thinking degrading our forces simply on the 'why-not' premise of women requiring that all situations be made level for their abilities, whether those abilities in fact exist. The result is droves of men, good men, leaving the services, because the premise is flawed and the execution is destructive.Independence Day is a text entirely to the contrary and thus, entirely to my liking. It is vital that women /not/ need to put themselves utterly into harm's way, for they are a priceless resource. ID4 takes this completely seriously. The result is a rousing war movie, one that stirs the blood. There is some simplification of the situation, a potential impediment that seems necessary when a film maintains a wide viewpoint through its entire length. However, even given this, focus is also kept on a limited number of key individuals, whose interaction and ability to come together are key to whether they will succeed, or fail.This is in many ways an old-fashioned movie, in that there are no permanently disturbed characters, no one's sexual hangups are explored, selfishness and self-absorption are put aside. Thus it is not 'edgy'. I say, good. Ordinary folk have too much living to do to bother with films that endlessly navel-gaze and woolgather. There is no moss growing on these people and I'd like to see people in real life being just as courageous.So, if you want deep thought, go see something else. If you want to see people responding to crisis and see it done with dispatch and brio, see this film. Highly recommended.",Independence Day

Maybe someone uploaded a plot-retardant virus into the script during filming.(2) Actually, i would have found the virus bit to be lighthearted, ironic, or funny IF the rest of the movie was in the least say, appealing, or personable.

It was fun and dumb, and great to watch with family and friends, as long as you don't expect something like Aliens or Predator.Now to get into the details, the movie is casted perfectly, especially Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith as the stars. The script is well written with some of the best one liners of all times. The story is not particularly original, but not cliché to the point that it is not enjoyable. The acting is good and unlike most science fiction movies now a days (I'm looking at you Michael Bay) the characters are like-able.

Hard SciFi this isn't, although its still up a few notches from the 50's SciFi movies that are its historical roots.Stereotypical or thin characters are required when you have that many actors involved in scenes, although Jeff Goldblum's character, and that of Judd Hirsh as his Dad are quite good. A director makes a choice on the focus, it could follow one character or group of characters and alter the scale to near human dimensions. Tom Cruise in War of the Worlds comes to mind. But more often, particularly if box office receipts are a major concern, it is SciFi as spectacle, and in that realm, Independence Day works very well indeed.I'm just thankful they didn't include one of those ridiculous scenes where the hero blows up the control panel to open the airlock door.

Not to mention that the movie had a great cast of characters in in. Jeff Goldbloom is cool, along with Will Smith. Some people say this movie is overrated, I actually think it's way underrated.

What will we do?Filmmakers of Independence Day have their own opinion about it. And I have my opinion about their opinion. So:It's very funny to look at the nation that as one stand against evil (brutal, awful, terrible, ...) aliens. It's very funny to watch the American President personally fights the foes and manages (is that right word?) F-16 (F-26, F-117 or what was that device)! It's very funny to discover that American Presidents have the same feelings as ordinary people have, the same problems and the same rights (but why they can't have lovers then?).

ID4 contains EVERY cliché you could ever expect in a film like this. It's like the script writers sat down in front of a computer and deliberately chose the most frequent, least surprising lines for every moment. I'll never understand why people spend millions of dollars on special effects and then forget about the script, when a good script is in no way more expensive than a bad one. This film is worth seeing to get some good laughs. That is the only reason.

Sad huh? Well later we find out she's alive. Yipee, then later she dies. I didn't care at that point.I consider myself a proud American but sometimes waving the banner is just tacky. During the final showdown the rest of the countries on the planet Earth were waiting for the Americans to start attacking the aliens before they moved? Even going so far to illustrate the point by having a Foriegn commander literally sitting on his rump and jumping up to scramble for an attack once the US says its a go. What kind of self serving patriotism crap is that?Although there were some Highlights such as Brent Spiner's quirky scientist, Randy Quaid's Cousin Eddie in a plane (oops didnt mean to point that out),and the excellent work that the talented ensemble cast did (in vain) to save this movie.I'm thoroughly surprised that this movie stuck to the film, and For my money, I would just as soon watch an apple brown.",Independence Day

The special effects were overwheming(in a good way) and the acting was excellent.  Too many times a movie's special effects will have to carry a poor story line to make a good movie.  Not so with this one.  I can honestly say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It screems for a sequel!  I hope that happens, but I have not heard of any thing on that front.

The good guys win and the aliens are destroyed. But see more deeply than this. It's not perfect, i admit. I didn't like the scene where Will Smith pretends that he didn't know what's happening and then look up and see the big UFO. VERY BIG.

I know this is a Will Smith's movie and it's gonna be about him for the most part. That's where all of the attention is gonna be at when you're watching the movie about the aliens. You are gonna get different perspectives but it can last for longer periods. I don't like how each scene is predictable and how badly acting the actors and actresses are. Each role is dry and nobody never questions why the aliens are attacking them? It's just one of them badly written action packed movies that's only good for cinema.

Will Smith is in his classic character here, full of his usual pep and one liners. The others put in good efforts as well, I particularly like Goldblum's role as the cable repairman.

First we have the walking Jewish stereotype of Judd Hirsch, the wisecracking black stereotype of Will Smith, the stereotypes of every other section of humanity (those foolish New-Agers, don't they realise that wanting peace makes us susceptible to horrible electric death?), the terrible action movie cliches, the complete disregard for the most basic laws of physics, and finally the fact that this movie is deeply insulting to everyone who is not an American (i.e. most of humanity).  I really don't think that there is any excuse for irresponsible film-making, but then again it wasn't ME that made hundreds of millions of dollars on this.  Oh well, my fault for watching this nonsense, I suppose.If you are ripe for some stupid, pointless entertainment (and it IS visually spectacular) then shut off your brain and rent this film.

Next is the popular whinge that 'the Americans save the planet ....again'. Now I'm not American but I imagine - and correct me if I'm wrong - that the $75,000,000 budget was mostly made up from American money, so hell yeah, they paid for it so let them be the heroes.Finally, the fact that it borrows all its plotlines from other, earlier more groundbreaking SciFi. Well the movies that lend these themes were at the forefront of the SciFi era. So it was easy to be original.The other main complaint was President Whitmore's address immdiately previous to the climactic battle, ........ well I have to give you that one.

This Director likes destruction and effects, which are amazing and really makes you feel like you are in there, like you are living it. Storys which are about destruction and pandemonium unite people. Everybody got one concerning and try to focus on it and help each other.

530,finglonger24000,A surprisingly good alien epic,8,23 July 2005,"I found Independence Day to be a complete treat. It was surprisingly good alien epic that I have hardly ever seen. The fair script and the good acting carry the film.It starts off with city sized alien ships that come to earth from the moon and hover above Washington D.C., New York, and Los Angeles. The cities erupt in horror, and by nightfall, the ship destroy the city with giant laser blasts.Its an emotional roller-coaster from beginning to end. A story about the world putting away their differences for a worthy cause: to stop the aliens. Its something you don't see these days.There were several clichés in the film too. Like Will Smith being able to learn how to drive an alien cruiser just after seeing how they maneuver in battle. I thought that that was kind of stupid.But the graphics were spectacular. its easy to see how the film won the Oscar for best graphics. And the aliens, which aren't computer animated, were cool and believable. But you never really get a good look at them (but its was the same in Signs). Its spooky at times as well.Its also politically incorrect. The cliché of U.S.A. saving the world is funny and a little predictable.But if you can't like this film, filled with epic aerial battle scenes and emotional scenes. Its extremely likable, sad, and original. I would recommend seeing it just for the incredible story and where it drags out to a great finale.So no, its not the best movie ever, but its a damn good one all the same.",Independence Day
531,jac-44480,So Cheesy its Good,8,16 January 2017,"Aliens invade Earth's atmosphere using giant space ships with impenetrable defense shields. Modern human military technology is no match against the advanced space ships. As the aliens make final preparations, humans scramble for alternative solutions to prevent annihilation.This movie is an action-comedy featuring an ensemble cast, and a script that is filled with clichés, parodies, and some of the cheesiest dialogue in movie history. This movie is ultra-jingoistic with blind patriotism being a main theme throughout. Although extremely silly, the cheesy dialogue is highly quotable with numerous one-liners that keep the viewers constantly entertained. The special effects are outstanding, and there are plenty of intense action scenes with lots of explosions. Despite the ridiculous plot holes, Independence Day does not take itself seriously and makes fun of itself at every chance.The two lead characters are Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Smith portrays a macho-military tough guy while Goldblum is a stereo-typical computer nerd who uses intellect to solve complex problems, but can barely tie his own shoes. Both leads give strong performances with plenty of memorable one-liners.Perhaps even better, the main supporting cast played by Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, and Harvey Fierstein. These three deliver some of the movie's funniest moments and quotes. Quaid plays a doofus crop-duster who suffers from PTSD and claims he was abducted by aliens. Now he wants payback against the aliens for his past experiences. Judd Hirsch plays the stereo-typical Jewish father of Goldblum's character, and the dialogue between the two features endless dry humor. Hirsch plays Goldblum's selfish, helpless, panicked co-worker who's natural response to the news of impending doom is to contact his lawyer.Then we have the government characters to include Bill Pullman as President, Robert Loggia as head military general, Adam Baldwin as second officer, James Rebhorn as CIA adviser to the President, and Brent Spiner as a crazy government scientist who works in Area 51. Spiner's character is particularly funny as he frequently goes off on long tangents about scientific stuff that nobody else understands. Other supporting roles, particularly the ones played by women, are not very funny or memorable, although I liked Margaret Colin as Goldblum's ex-wife and their constant bickering.By the end of the movie, all of these characters are forced to work together to come up with solutions on how to defeat the aliens. The final cigar-scene shared between Smith and Goldblum is a classic moment, where both characters display excellent chemistry for two guys with polar opposite personalities. Another highlight of the movie is Bill Pullman's impassioned speech to the troops and pilots, which is a remarkable moment for a character who is otherwise boring.",Independence Day

I saw this movie when I was 14 and thought it was a lot of fun. I thought the ""alien beating"" strategy they come up with at the end was absurd but even then it was funny, somewhat shocking and had beautiful effects that haven't gotten old even today. I think the director did a wonderful job with the mediocre script he got and besides not every fantasy and science fiction movie has to be ""Metropolis"" and carry some overarching message for all of humanity. The cast was great and very entertaining. Plus Sometimes you just want to see Will Smith punch an alien in the face, a president flying a jet fighter and a big @$$ starship blasting NYC away in a single shot.This movie is supposed to be seen as somewhat of an impressive parody not a serious ""what would happen"" movie.To all of the people giving bad reviews, would you watch a fireworks display with such a critical eye?",Independence Day

The characters are plain, each one depicting a specific segment of the population or stereotype, in an attempt to be politically correct I guess. I can't believe so many people went to see this film, and I absolutely can't believe that some people actually thought it was a great story. Sure, the special FX are good, but not THAT good. Summer action movies should be exciting AND interesting to watch. This one is almost painful to endure. Finally, What is this fascination that Americans have for tough-guy, real macho, butt-kicking, U.S. Presidents? In this movie (and in Air Force One) we witness the President flying fighter planes (or punching terrorists) and giving the bad guys what they deserve. Oh, Please!

But of course, the aliens couldn't possibly win because firstly, they aren't human and therefore must be evil, and secondly, the Americans must always be seen as brave, dynamic and intelligent; the saviours of mankind. It is this kind of overly patriotic, flag waving, 'America is the greatest country on earth' attitude that winds people up. A bit of humility wouldn't go amiss sometimes.Aside from the usual 'isn't America brilliant?' theme, the film has a dreadfully predictable story-line, a corny script and woeful acting. I suppose the best thing you could say about it is that the special effects are slick. But even then, this doesn't add to my enjoyment of the film. The alien ship may be an impressive computer-made creation, but that's still what it looks like; computer-made. It doesn't look real.The mark of a good film is if you are still talking about it in the pub a few hours after you've left the cinema, or even at work the following day. My mind started to wander less than half an hour into the flick. If there has ever been a more shallow and meaningless film in cinematic history, I have not seen it.Independence Day is without doubt the worst film I've ever seen.",Independence Day
541,creedrock2003,The President Flies a Fighter Plane at Alien Spaceship,1,23 April 2005,"If this alternate title had been chosen, I would've avoided the loss of two hours of my life and had an extra $9 in my pocket. If you set aside the fact that the aliens in this movie use Macintosh-based computer systems, the Prez hops into a fighter jet AS THE PILOT, and Will Smith punches an alien unconscious in his downed spaceship...this movie is still horrible. Aliens come to earth to sap it of it's resources,a nd to accomplish this, of course, the aliens have to destroy earth's inhabitants. The enormous spaceships gather above major cities around the globe and WAIT THERE DOING NOTHING FOR DAYS. Then, they start to blow up stuff we recognize (not military targets, just useless tourist attractions that will make us sad). Does blowing up hte White House really accomplish anything? Does it terrify Earth's inabitants? the giant spaceships do that just fine. How about attacking military installations capable of fighting back? They can't be stopped...or can they? What's next?...Not Six Flags over Nebraska!?!?!?! The solution to Earth's dilemma lies in the Apple Corporation's operating system for home-based computing. Simply walk into an Apple store, grab a Powerbook, fly into the enemy spaceship (how, you ask?....naturally by piloting one of their spacecraft 200 years ahead of earth technology on your first try), mess with their hard drives using an earth laptop computer (I'm not kidding), and wham-o!!!...Aliens start dropping like flies! Not an ounce of creativity, or originality, or brain-power was used in writing this drivel. I enjoyed all the stereo-typical characters brought together to fight...the drunken former pilot, the hotshot young stud pilot, the computer geek, the kid, and the most powerful man we gots...the PRESIDENT OF THE US... YEAH BABY!!!It plays like a 10 year-old's idea of ""a really cool thing that happened once."" Horrible. Don't see it.",Independence Day
542,brandonleewainscott,Mediocre but Classic,7,18 March 2015,"This film is on the whole not very good film. It has its moments, but is mostly mediocre action, but it is entertaining. It's just far too melodramatic IMO. I like the top secret program that even the president is ignorant of, a concept in a story I wrote, but the sci fi is just far too Hollywood to be good. Enough time is not devoted to that. The acting has its good qualities with some of the actors, and some of the characters have a likable quality, while others have this sort of, again, overly dramatic caricature. The father who sacrifices himself to save the world is not overly dramatic in itself, but even a nice touch. One of the better ones even. But the way he does it, with all the ""come to mama"" and ""I'm back, boys!' is just hokey. It really makes you cringe like you do at a person who tries to hard to be funny. But when I cringed at this, the moving moment made up for it. I hate to be using the same words, but it was a bit too feel good an dramatic. All of a sudden the world was just all friendly and kumba-ya? Pfft. But it's a fun movie. I'll watch it many times, just because it has that classic 90s thing to it. Will Smith is his usual self, an actor I do not tend to like, though he has his talent. But he's likable, though I am not sure he is the great actor he is made out to be. Some people are like that. You can hate their acting, but like them. On the acting the acting is not great actually, but it may be the horrible script. Watch it over and over, but far better stuff out there.",Independence Day
543,Ellen_Addie,One of the better high-concept movies,7,26 August 2008,"The things that make ID4 watching is that something is always going on. There are plenty of one-liners and the one-dimensional character all have their peculiar personality traits and quirks. The action scenes are impressive and in fact this film has the largest number of miniatures ever built. That record will probably never be broken because digital technology is limiting the use of miniatures. If you can let your hair loose and just want to enjoy a light movie without letting the America is Great propaganda get to you, ID4 is for you. Are there stupid things that happen in ID4? Sure. Checked reality lately? Stupid things happen all the time. But so do heroic things. As well as evil. Typical fare for the ancient tragedies. I believe ID4 carries on that ancient and honorable tradition: entertainment. And viewing it as a work of art, I must say that I was impressed over and over again while watching this film: where most of the studios would have wussed out or flinched, these film makers didn't. They stepped up to the plate and tried to beat the ball to death over and over again with their bat.",Independence Day
544,gmcvay@patriot.net,Mothership Connection? Not so much,1,19 December 2005,"**Possible spoilers** A significant number of the comments already posted here say quite defensively that this movie isn't meant to be Shakespeare, that it's just a Big Dumb Action Flick (hereinafter BDAF), that, in effect, if you just stop thinking, this is a really fantastic movie that showcases all-American values, goddamnit.If you want to see a BDAF, though, there are so many that are done so much better... and ID4 steals from most of them. And if you want to showcase American values, there are so many that are so much better than segregation. Yeah, the Dynamic Duo here is half Will Smith (and describing the plot sounds like the setup for a bad joke: ""A Jew and a black guy walk into a spaceship...""), but the love stories -- a massive weak point, and that's saying something, because this baby is rife with weak points -- are neatly segregated: Will Smith with Vivica Fox, Jeff Goldblum with the red-haired shiksa. There was no way we were going to get a ""Space Monsters' Ball"" scenario with Fox playing the careerist ex-wife and what's-her-name playing the stripper. (The Hispanic kids only get screen time at all because their dad is Randy Quaid.) A white guy entertains Smith by making fun of Jesse Jackson (mercifully, the character bites it shortly after), and there is a tasteless joke about violent Los Angelenos; on what planet is that supposed to be funny?When I watch a BDAF, I expect certain things from it, and one of those is good directorial judgment about which characters get screen time. In a BDAF about aliens, we paid good money (actually, I watched this on cable, but you take my point) to SEE THE FRICKIN' ALIENS. The ones that get the most time on screen are dead! The only live one we see (other than the incredibly stupid ones in the mothership) gets punched in the head, then awakens conveniently right in the middle of an autopsy at Area 51 (of course), where Brent Spiner reveals that these guys don't look like Alien-Predator hybrids at all; the Alien-Predator thingo is just a ""bio-mechanical suit"" (H.R. Giger would cry) covering up a much more boring alien inside. Actually, Spiner's brief performance was the one thing about the film I can say without reservation I liked. After all, geeks have spent many years dressing up and pretending to be Spiner; it's only fair that Spiner should return the favor by dressing up as a geek. (Question: If the alien is communicating by resonating the late Dr. Okun's throat, where is the deep, booming voice coming from? Dr. Okun doesn't sound like that alive... oh, never mind.) I'd also like a BDAF to be a bit less, well, homogenized. Even the dog that outruns the tunnel fire is the most boring and domestic breed in existence: the yellow Lab, a staple of minivan and SUV commercials. Bill Pullman is suitably bland, if too young and brain-dead for the part. Even the Token Gay is played by the safest, cuddliest gay guy in US entertainment: Harvey Fierstein, who has been assimilated by the mainstream-culture Borg in much the same way as Smith himself.Throw in a bit of product placement for Coke and Apple (although the laptop does appear to be running a very specialized Linux interface, one with helpful dialogs like ""Uploading Virus""), and you've got a completely forgettable movie. At least, I hope to heck it's forgettable. I would hate it if my brain actually bothered to store this.Of the many things wrong with this movie, though, perhaps the most disturbing on a bent-reality level is how much Jeff Goldblum, in rumpled hair and nerd glasses, resembles a young Allen Ginsberg. That's just wrong. In the ex-wife relationship-confrontation scene, I expected him to burst out earnestly with, ""I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked"" etc. It couldn't possibly be sillier than the actual dialogue.",Independence Day

However after recently catching it on television I must confess I thought it was an excellent movie.  Despite what critics say the characters are well developed, and we the audience do care about their fate.  This movie has it all: romance, action, humor, drama.  While some may complain about parts of the dialogue being cliche, I believe that would take something away from this film.

Of course, there are plenty of clichés and if you take the time to do an in- depth analysis, you will find a few plot holes (however minor). But the film overall is really good. The cast is really good at exhibiting emotion (with the exception of Will Smith who always acts like a comedian). SPOILER ALERT: I really felt it when the President's wife died or when David and Constance were discussing their divorce. The movie also really deserves it's Oscar for best special effects. That shot of the White House blowing up is SO good, you wince (not because the effect was bad, but because it's the freakin' White House being blown to smithereens.) The film borrows elements used previously by other alien/sci-fi action films but it also has many unique elements. I mean, how many action movies nowadays take almost an hour to develop characters before getting to the main action? (That was a good choice, on behalf of the film, BTW. I was pleasantly surprised when watching it for the first time.) Bottom line, the film has it's cheesy moments, but it is very entertaining, fun and even heartfelt at times. I loved it.

552,DerKill,What do you do if you're the president and aliens just leveled every major city in the world?,1,16 October 2013,"The aliens just showed up in several giant flying saucers that measure 15 miles in diameter. The saucers each positioned themselves over a different major city in the world and simultaneously leveled them. What do you do if you're the president? Will you order a massive nuclear attack to repel the aliens?Nope, the president in Independence Day thinks that it's premature to use nuclear weapons at this point. He wants to try and take down the 15-mile floating saucers with air-to-air missiles. You try it and it didn't work. Every fighter jet is wiped out in a matter of minutes. Meanwhile the flying saucers are moving on to destroy more large cities. What do you do? You're going to order the massive nuclear attack nowright?WRONG, but the president thinks that one nuclear weapon may be used on one alien ship as long as not too many people get hurt by it. You fire and detonate a nuclear missile against one of the 15-mile saucers, but the saucer doesn't go down. One nuke didn't work. What do you do? Do you try more? How about 10, 30, or 100 nukes? What do you have to lose? No, the president thinks that it is now hopeless to use any weapons. He wants other options. At this point, one of the president's aides decides that now is a good time to inform the president that the United States is secretly in possession of alien technology in Area 51. You go to Area 51 and use the alien tech to hatch a one-time plan to disable the shields of the flying saucers. But their shields will only be down for a few minutes if this works. Now, will you please order the massive nuclear assault when the shields go down? It's our last chance. You'll do it, right?WRONG again, the president would rather try conventional weapons in this one-time effort to save the Earth. You send your last fighter jets to fire air-to-air missiles at the 15-mile flying saucer. The missiles manage to scorch the outside of the saucer, nothing more. All is lost. Hold on, one guy crashed his plane into the middle on the saucer, which caused a chain reaction that destroyed the entire ship. Waitare you kidding me? The aliens built their 15-mile wide impenetrable flying saucers with a weak point in the middle that, if touched, destroys the entire ship. That can't be right. Why would they do that? That's worse than the bad decisions the president was making. THE END.",Independence Day

It was a fun movie, definitely, had it's comic relief, it's quirks, it's action, it's good lines, it's 'bad' lines, but overall, it wasn't an epic movie. I have it in my collection, and wouldn't mind throwing it on here and there, but it wouldn't be a must-have-if-I-was-trapped-on-an-island type movie. Actually, no, it would be. Why? Because it's a really good movie, and BECAUSE it's not an epic, you can watch it more than once without feeling an overabundance of 'epicness'. I can't watch Lord of the Rings too often, because it's really long, but also, it's too much to take in casually.

Bill Pullman seemed to have a tiny smile throughout the film that said, ""Don't take me seriously folks; I'm having a ball!""  And Will Smith was just being himself.  If you don't take the movie any more seriously than the actors (most of whom are very good at what they've done in the past), you could indeed leave your brain at the door and still enjoy it.

This movie will entertain you but it will not move you.  This isn't an art film or a great film.  It is simply a very big dumb movie with lots of stuff blowing up and bodies flying around.  An entertaining big dumb movie, as these things go, but a big dumb movie nonetheless. Overall, ID4 moves along at a fair pace, the action sequences are generally fun to watch, and the characters play well together.

At the same time, I sat through the entire movie, transfixed in horror at how terrible it was. Worse, years later, I was compelled to watch it again, knowing precisely how awful it was the first time around. It didn't get better with the second viewing.

560,dairylanddon,"3 Good Things, 1 Bad Thing about... Independence Day",7,9 October 2008,"ONE GOOD THING: The sheer ""popcorn movie"" spectacle of Roland Emmerich's Independence Day makes it highly watchable. The film is one of the first of its era that embraces modern special effects to ""remake"" old movies, which couldn't be made better at the time. Although similar (or derivative) of it's predecessors, it fills the screen with an ensemble cast and delivers disaster scenes you couldn't walk away from if you tried (dog out-running an explosion excluded).ANOTHER GOOD THING: The sheer panic/confusion/indifference felt by the different characters is an interesting bit of character study. Some people welcome the aliens with open arms, while others pack the freeways to escape major cities, and still others are sitting at strip clubs regardless of what's going on.EVEN ANOTHER GOOD THING: The famous destruction scenes of the national and international monuments culminating in the explosion of the White House are quite possibly the finest of their kind.ONE BAD THING: The wooden performances elicited by Emmerich (10,000 BC) are all quickly overshadowed by the inclusion of the Randy Quaid character. Why in the world is ""Uncle Eddie"" (National Lampoon's Vacation films) in this movie fighting aliens? He is heavy handed in his delivery and should of had his character cut out during initial re-writes. Without Quaid (and Harvey Fierstein's over-the-top comic relief supplied for the Jeff Goldblum character) this movie immediately improves its rating by 2 stars.OVERALL GRADE: C+OTHER MOVIES WITH SPECTACULAR DESTRUCTION SEQUENCES: The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Twister (1996), Poseidon (2006), The Poseidon Adventure (1972), The Towering Inferno (1974), Cloverfield (2008).",Independence Day

Everything about it. I've only ever broken 1 tele in my life and it was while enduring this crap that it occurred just after a moment involving Will Smith and an alien which was the final straw. It starts off OK and to my disappointment never really gets going and then insults to an unbelievable extent. There are moments in this film which you really cannot believe and leaves you thinking 'haven't i seen this kind of crap before but on a budget of a fraction the size and better?'

It contains some of the best massive destruction scenes ever filmed, but the development of the plot is kinda stupid and sometimes offensive - like the Empire State goof -. I went to see this wanting to watch great special effects and i got it. I only hope Emmerich and Devlin would hire an actual screenwriter next time they make a movie, The Patriot sucked. ID4 is NOT science fiction. SCI-FI contains some explanation of why things work the way they do, like in 2001. This movie boasts great fx and action sequences. The problem does lie with stereotypical characters. However the scenario of fighting back the apocalypse is something we can all root for.

They succeed unhindered.  Billions of people die in horrible deaths and life as we know it has ceased.Meanwhile, in America, Will Smith cracks jokes, people get married and everybody is really happy.  Even the dog didn't die!Now, here comes three Americans to the rescue: a moronic wisecracker, a drunkard, a U.S. President who looks like a used-car salesman that just turned 30, and, of course, a brilliant scientist who nobody knows is brilliant!In a few hours, the scientist has it all figured out: create a computer virus and put it into the mainframe in the mother ship! The Aliens use Microsoft too, after all! And we don't have to worry about security or passwords!  Heck they won't even see us flying around! And even though they have psychic powers, we will be undetected!  When we are done, we will just fly back to Earth.  And the Aliens are so stupid that they don't use Norton's Antivirus software!The wisecracker chips in by figuring out how to fly a 40-year old alien spacecraft that he never saw before (and which was conveniently found in - where else! - Roswell). Then the drunk and the President decide to fly around a little and destroy those big ships.  The Americans have won again and tell the rest of the world how easy it really is.  Just recruit the local neighborhood drunk and send him straight up into the weak spot (never mind that the ship is as long as Manhattan Island and has  death rays that can obliterate an entire city in seconds).    Heck, you can get rid of a few neighborhood drunks too while you're at it!At one point in the movie I shuddered a scream!  Hollywood has done it, they really have done it!!  They have succeeded in lobotomizing America.Where's Ed Wood when you need him?",Independence Day

Not only I don´t like the characters, but the plot was sillier than a Ren & Stimpy episode.  How could it be possible that we could stop an alien invasion from a group of extraterrestrials that came from  a place that is millions of light years far from Earth in just four or three days?  How could it be possible that I have an antivirus program here in Panama and they didn't?  What did Jeff Goldblum want to tell me at the end of the movie when he finally accepts the cigar?  That since the aliens could attack us in any moment we shouldn't worry about such things as lung cancer or contamination?  I never thought I will say this, but please, even ""V"" is better than this movie.  The only thing I like about Independence Day was that Will Smith's dog didn't die. Really! he was the only character in that movie that deserves to continue living.  And I don't know for what, because with everything we are doing to our planet I don't think we'll survive until the day real aliens come to visit us (if they aren't here yet).  An advice, rent Mars Attacks!, sit back, and enjoy laughing at the human race.

You actually see real colours and the sun, not to mention clear skies before trails became the norm.

A typical dumbed-down Hollywood cartoon of a film, designed to appeal to the 18-24 yo demographic. This ""film"" consists of so many blatant stereotypes, unbelievable situations, horrible acting, cheesy special-effects and an ending so far-fetched that it would strain credibility to a 4 year old. I will not go into detail on my comments to the above, as they have already been well-described in many other reviews and I will not waste the readers time. However, I will conclude with one other point about this movie which really irks me. It is the blatantly loud, pro-American jingoism that permeates this film. It is so over the top that it is embarrassing, and I say this as a proud American. How I yearn for a return to the old American virtues of humbleness, quiet pride and the ""can-do"" attitude of the past. The in-your-face flag-waving, posing, posturing, rudeness and general ignorance of other peoples and nations shown in this and many other simplistic films of this nature is quite pathetic.

Solid cast, sweeping musical score, excellent special effects even today, great one liners, massive destruction of cities, fighter jets battling flying saucers, what more could you want?

582,NotoriousJMG,Why this movie doesn't suck,7,30 October 2005,"Okay, well, perhaps it does suck. At least, as far as things important to other films, such as acting and plot, go.

This is a buy your popcorn, sit your behind down, and prepare for a mind-numbing assault on your senses that will have you screaming like a primitive caveman during the final battle sequence type of movie. This is ""Independence Day."" Sure, you have to suspend reality quite a bit, when you consider things like: 1) A Marine fighter pilot dating a stripper and the two of them living a ""normal"" suburban life with her son in Orange County. 2) The President of the United States and a strung-out drunk climbing into F/A-18s to blow the aliens away. 3) A mid-90s Macintosh PowerBook logging into a sophisticated alien network that probably has better than 2,048 bit encryption. But watching that ragtag wing of F/A-18 Hornets and F-16 Fighting Falcons blow the hell out of the alien battleship over Nevada at the end of the movie is worth every hole in the plot. Watching Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum light up cigars as they blow the mothership away is worth every moment of stiff acting (although we could've done without Goldblum's reprise of the ""Must go faster, must go faster"" line from Jurassic Park). So there you go. If you're a movie snob, this one isn't for you. But if you're a true fan of the movies, you will love this movie from the opening shot of Neil Armstrong's footprints being shaken away to the ending images of burning alien battleships across the planet.",Independence Day

And, I gave it a 5 because I think that I appreciate on Roland Emmerich's effort put in this movie. But I still have complaints of the movie; the first one is that Roland Emmerich's is in my Most Hated directors list; as well as Uwe Boll, and the second thing I need to talk, the game adaption. It has major flaws in the game.It was about alien saucers coming from space, entering to earth and suddenly, taking over Washington D.C.

That's it for good things.On the other hand, it's disgusting for non USA people.Lemme get deeper on this: the entire movie's idea is ""lets make 4 of July a celebration for everyone."" Who cares other's countries independence? They do not worth as much as ours, right?. Seems to support USA's government external policy, ""let's keep forcing other countries to do what we think is best for them"". USA is the bulliest country of the world. Some of their people are even so naive to think they're doing some good to the world. It's even offensive.Another quote was something like ""-Oh, the American's have a plan. -It was about time."" Some Messiah Complex for a country.And, of course, the only main character to die (besides the fact that like half of the human race is gone) is Pressident's wife... and that happens because she didn't leave when she was told (way too b-class).Some naiveness is seen on the movie too. The guy who just happened to known the president is the guy who will save the day... I mean... Come on! Wake up! We're not talking about some bunch of scientists working for years. We're talking about a guy who in a day learns to program alien machines, find a vulnerability and make a virus!In all, a fun movie, but kinda insulting if you're not from USA.P.D.: I know, down-votes coming from USA, up-votes from the rest of the world.",Independence Day

He plays the typical black man with an attitude problem. Stereotyped in my opinion. The actor that steals the film for me is Jeff Goldblum. His character is witty yet heroic.

Tonight I told myself ""let's give it a chance"". I was expecting a super-turbo action, brainless movie. What a disappointment! The effects are great, OK, but there isn't suspense, there aren't strong emotions nor real ""heroic action"". Maybe Americans skip an heartbeat seeing the White House blown up, but I'm not American. By the way, the ""americanocentric"" view makes me smile. If Americans would really think this way they couldn't be the most powerful country of the world. From a logical point of view, it's an astonishing piece of junk (yes, it's what I was expecting in this way: brainless). I'm a programmer and the idea of a virus is simply idiotic. If scientists were unable to understand the power source of the captured alien fighter (the chief scientist of Area 51 tells that they were even unable to turn the power on until the alien forces arrived to destroy mankind, and all the ship's instruments started to work!), it's impossible they could understand the logical principles of the computer[s] aboard, nor the programming language to code a virus. Even knowing the computer[s] aboard would not imply knowing the computers aboard the main ships: imagine working on an embedded system built in a  Tomcat; knowing it would not mean that you can code a program for, let's say, a mainframe. Anyway, if someone understood everything being a genius monster with an IQ of 938 and a lot of positive imagination, the character of Jeff Goldblum couldn't learn how to code that virus in a matter of hours! ...And what about that hilarious portable Mac ""negotiating with host"" and ""uploading virus""? Well... Let's forget the virus. Could someone explain to me why the fighters piloted by a bunch of non-professionals, overnumbered by technologically superior alien fighters, even without shields, manage to win the 2nd air battle? Probably they would crash the planes simply trying to take off. What about the captured fighter? If it crashed in an accident killing two crew members, how could it fly smoothly? Stop. There are lots of stupid things like these in the movie, but, as I said, I was expecting them. What I wasn't expecting is the complete lack of powerful, heroic action scenes.

I would imagine that Stephen Hawkings head would simply explode as soon as the opening credits started. I would also imagine that someone like Charlton Heston would clap gleefully throughout, while collecting a lap full of drool the whole while.I would mention all of the holes in the plot line and every scene where the trillion to one odds are defied, but the good people at IMDb limit the length of these reviews.The portion of the movie where the world gets pummelled with laser beams is well done (graphically and acoustically) but the rest of the film does an ever higher quality job of making you wish you were dead (see 2nd paragraph).I just kept waiting to see Jeff Goldblum put his Microsoft Alien Virus '97 CD into the drive before uploading into the (strangely compatible) alien computer system (cough - from his laptop).So I rated this movie 2/10, and the only reason it didn't get 0 (or less) was because of the somewhat entertaining special effects.",Independence Day

This is because when the movie was first seen, blowing up buildings from the sky was not a reality....it was very very cool. After the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centres taste in action films, particularly American taste, has changed radically.The remarkable element of this film is that it managed to satirise the war with Iraq before it even happened, let me explain:In the film America has some big buildings destroyed by a force they do not understand and are threatened by, and of course they assume that the rest of the world is threatened also without really asking them! Then America saves the day with the President leading the troops from the front line, the only solution is to totally destroy this new life form. Surely this film represents the George Bush dream world in which he, and preferably Will Smith, save the human race.The truth is, this film could be re-released today and modern critics would slate it for being unsubtle American propaganda.

He is after all a goof-ball ham. He destroyed Robert Conrad's prideful series reputation of the original 'Wild Wild West' with his purely irreverent mockery of the 'Wild Wild West (1999)'. Robert Conrad personally accepted the Razzie Awards for that despicable turkey of a movie to express his disgust about what was done to his source material by the Prince. Sources seem to differ who has top billing for 'Independance Day', the Prince or Bill Pullman. Even the TV Guides on cable indicate the Prince has top billing so I didn't want to watch the movie. I did finally watch this movie on cable with great apprehension and preparing to barf at another performance by the Prince, but I was not disappointed. The Prince was heavily surrounded with such real talent during the movie that his presence in the movie didn't have a deleterious affect. United States Marine Officers do not swagger down the flight line. They do not whine and have tantrum.

This film is the ultimate summary of everything wrong with Hollywood. It's as if Roland Emmerich deliberately tries to place every single cliché he can find in his films. And as another reviewer said, he's one of the few directors in Hollywood (along with Michael Bay and Paul W.S. Anderson) who have everything they need to make a decent blockbuster. A great cast (JEFF GOLDBLUM!), decent effects, and enough money at their disposal to feed Africa for a month.OK, now the film.... Horrible No redeeming qualities to speak of.

Here's the entire film: Aliens arrive, Aliens attack, Will Smith's girlfriend, child and dog escape a massive fire-blast that kills hundreds of people in a subway (but the dog made it, thank god!....seriously, that must be the most cringeworthy cliché ever committed to film) a wooden door protects them from the nuclear heat blast, Will Smith beats up an alien and drags it around the desert for a bit, (I'm not sure who was in more pain during that scene, me or the alien.) they go to Area 51 where they meet some hermit, chronic- masturbator mad scientist, some other stuff happens, then the President of the United States gets up in a jet with the all the rest of the boys to take out the alien ship threatening the American way of life. YEE HAH!The people who have a hard-on for this movie will tell me that I took it too seriously, but it's actually impossible to take this film seriously. It's like a bad joke, so bad that it's funny how horrible it is and then you pause and think about it and all of a sudden you realise how troubling it is that something like this ever was green-lighted by a major studio. If you haven't seen it, don't. If you have seen it and were as troubled as I was, you're not alone.

603,GalaxyGal,This is Not the Movie You're Looking For...,8,5 July 2006,"My husband and I have a 4th of July tradition--after watching the local parade and having a cookout, we go home to watch ""Independence Day"" so it ends just in time to watch the Boston Pops on the Esplanade and fireworks on TV. Like Galadriel's prologue in ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" I've probably memorized President Whitmore's ""We will not go quietly"" speech--yet another iteration of Shakespeare's ""This day is called the feast of Crispian"" soliloquy/speech.And now for something completely different...possibility of spoilers ahead for ""ID4"" and other movies.If you're looking for an alien-invasion movie with rigorous internal logic, this isn't it; try ""Contact"" or ""The War of the Worlds.""If you're looking for a serious science-fiction movie with inactive humor circuitry, try ""The Andromeda Strain.""If you're looking for a science-fiction movie with great character development, try Kubrick's ""Clockwork Orange""--but don't tell me about your nightmares or PTSD symptoms. I warned you.If you're looking for a science-fiction movie with an evenly-balanced political world-view, this isn't it. Hmm, which science fiction does? Try ""1984"" (either production), or ""The Matrix,"" or ""A Clockwork Orange,"" or ""Gattaca,"" or ""Equilibrium""--oh, I'm sorry! They're all dystopias; my bad!If you are looking for a funny, poignant, feel-good science-fiction movie to watch right before ""The 1812 Overture"" and fireworks--this is the movie. My essay's title is a riff on Obi-Wan's subtle Force-filled comment to the storm-trooper: ""These are not the droids you're looking for.""I read nearly 70 comments posted for ""ID4,"" and I have the feeling that a large number movie watchers and commentators, have either missed the point, didn't catch the details, or just plain Don't Get It.Firstly, something about David: his father makes a casual remark as they're driving to D.C.: ""eight years at M.I.T. and you're just a cable guy?"" It seems that both Julius and most people have missed the clue-- David's not just a run-of-the-mill cable guy; that should have been evident when he popped the micro-mini directional antenna on the car's roof. I don't know if that's real or just a good prop idea, but I'm sure that, if it weren't a global crisis, the men in black from the NSA and CIA would be visiting David for his antenna after the brouhaha died down.Also in the You Just Don't Get It department: Did *anyone* notice that David's name is David? Hello?! Small guy outwits a huge, unstoppable force that no one else can beat--does that remind you of anything, like, maybe, Goliath? Or, Sauron gives everyone of importance 'special rings' but forgets the little Hobbits, two of whom are unnoticeable enough to slip into Mordor and destroy the One Ring. Do any of you know what allegory or metaphor means? David's virus is the rock he uses to take down the alien Goliath-- Steve and the alien craft are the slingshot, but they're important.For the people who complained about a 'human computer virus' infecting an 'alien computer system.' I'm no math or computer whiz, but I do know that to measure and calculate, one has to have numbers, and in prehistoric times, most humans used their digits. And one has to have something that can hold a tool to make things, therefore, hands (and feet, or analogous appendages). If you measure stuff, you need a system to record measurement, and here we go--we use Base 10; if we had 3 fingers and a thumb, we'd use Base 8.In electronics, there's 0 and 1, two conditions, ON or OFF. Many programming languages exist, but all that code devolves back, is ultimately translated into electronic commands. David's specialty was signal clarity, strength, and the antenna dishes' configuration to receive signals from communications satellites--in abstract terms, encryption-decryption. That's how he discovered the countdown embedded in satellite transmissions--not literally decrypting their code, but finding the *pattern.* For someone to solve a puzzle like that, all one needs is to figure out the base system of the alien computer system; if Congress pays $30,000 for a hammer, then Area 51 probably has a Cray or two for David to run cracking algorithms on, between getting the idea of 'catching a cold' to the officer shooting the soda can off the wing of the alien craft. *We* didn't see the process, and in reality, it'd probably take more time than those people had, but it's a *movie,* and everything gets simplified and compressed; if you want realism, watch a war documentary on the History Channel.This movie is less about the whole plot and more about scenes setting up events, more about parts than the whole; some people take dominoes or tiles and set them up to fall into complex and pretty patterns, and that's what this movie does. Each scene may be weak, but each falls into the next to create a pretty (or in this case, an explosive) whole. Yes, there *are* clichés--but each scene uses the *right* cliché for the desired emotional effect.Summer blockbusters aren't meant to make people think, they're meant to get butts into seats and bucks into studio bank accounts. Huge explosions do that; scary aliens, energetic dogfights, last-minute rescues, tear-wringing deaths, and coincidences piled like thick frosting do bring people to the cinemas.About the dog's stereotypical leap-to-safety: Do you know how many people would have raised a ruckus if the kid's dog was fried in an explosion?! Of course the plucky unmarried mom with a can-do attitude has to have a heroic dog! Of course the dog has to find the First Lady! Of course they're clichés, but they're the *right*cliches for an action-adventure summer blockbuster movie!! For all the weaknesses in plot and characterization, I give ""Independence Day"" 6 of 10 stars; but for the overall whole look, design, and feel (props, miniatures, alien design, casting), I give it 8 of 10 stars.",Independence Day

Despite the total 'V' ripoff.The second half hits rock-bottom again and again and again... I thought Will Smith was going to be the worst element of the movie. I was wrong. He was actually quite fun to watch. The rest is a disgrace, most probably due to the script.Many people think that this movie waves too much with the american flag. I think not. The americans in the movie act like they've never come near the word intelligence.""Yeah, we have this really really really really awesome huge big spaceship. How to shoot it down? Sidewinders?

Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against americans, it would just be nice to see more of the rest of the world. I can't speak about this movie without mentioning the poor plot. Jeff Goldblum was very drunk at one point in the movie, then, he suddenly sobered up in a second and coded a virus on his mac. I thought more of the aliens would be nice, maybe they could've had some aliens land to survey the planet closely. Why the aliens didn't just nuke the planet as soon as they arrived, I don't know. No wonder channel 5 (for our non-british chums, the fifth free TV channel, which hardly anyone can recive properly, which offers utter dump 24 hours a day) managed to get it.

611,tho-3,Independence Day - outstanding work of the cinematic art,10,22 November 2006,"Personally I think this is the best movie of the 90's.But then I think South Park is the best TV show of the 20th century. Followed by Twilight Zone and Star Trek tying for second and third place.While there's no accounting for taste in art, I can make reasoned arguments for my choices.The people here on IMDb who hate this movie and provide negative comments probably have their reasons too, but mostly they say stupid things. For example, the one vituperous reviewer who lambasted the film's ""less-than-impressive CGI effects"". Well, duh, they didn't use very much CGI as far as I know. They did special effects the old-fashioned way. This schmuck is complaining about reality not being very realistic?And if box office is any indication of excellence, then the stats are on my side and prove the nay-sayers are tasteless boobs. Make that witless, tasteless boobs. Independence Day is one of the highest grossing movies in history, worldwide sales topping a billion.Admittedly ID4 is one of those semi-rare movies that people either love or hate. And in this case hate with a passion. Why? I'm still trying to figure that one out, but so far I believe the whiniest critics are just your stereotypical jaded art critics: self-centered pseudo-intellectuals with attitude who pounce on any flaws in anything they personally don't like just to show off their own vapid superiority. What do they want? Yes, the movie has flaws, but it also has a lot of plot, a lot of heart, and a lot of action. Dialog? I make fun of the dialog myself... so what? The worst criticism I can lay against the writers is that a lot of the dialog is inane... just like real people talk! That just makes it more realistic. Have any of these critics on here ever listened to how real people talk? In some cases the dialog is sooo frigging inane in ID4 that I marvel at it's brilliance. Or chutzpah.""What happened, mommy?""""I don't know, baby""As for the Apple-alien hook-up... my god, have we become so inured to the miracles of science that we calmly overlook or accept miracles like anti-gravity and kvetch instead about mundane technicalities? Yes, the Apple-alien computer hook-up is a plot hole... so what? I can easily explain that away a billion times easier than I can explain anti-gravity. I happen to know a bit about both.Again. Are there stupid things that happen in ID4? Sure. Checked reality lately? Stupid things happen all the time. But so do heroic things. As well as evil. Typical fare for the ancient tragedies. I believe ID4 carries on that ancient and honorable tradition: entertainment. And viewing it as a work of art, I must say that I was impressed over and over again while watching this film: where most of the studios would have wussed out or flinched, these film makers didn't. They stepped up to the plate and tried to beat the ball to death over and over again with their bat.And you know what? These film makers did it with a hint of humor.

612,laryan,"Sometimes, you just want to have fun.",10,5 July 2003,"""War of the Worlds"" has a history in America.  Based on an H.G. Wells story, it caused mass hysteria during the depression when first broadcast as an (unannounced) radio play.  The 1953 movie of the same name has long been considered a Science Fiction classic.  ""Independence Day"" is the 1990s, Hollywood version of the same story.  There are no real surprises on this three day journey of technically superior aliens invading and destroying the earth, but the trip is well worth it thanks to a great ensemble cast, terrific special effects, and a quirky script.Will Smith heads the cast as Marine pilot Captain Steve Hiller, a one-liner kind of hero whose goal is to be an astronaut, but he is challenged as the star of the picture by Jeff Goldblum (playing David Levinson), the MIT techo-geek who first realizes the threat of the alien ships.  In a wonderfully woven (and very convenient) plot, their lives entwine with those of the President and a drunken crop-dusting Russell Casse. Judd Hirsh and Harvey Fierstein also shine in supporting roles.But perhaps the special effects are really the star as the aliens rampage and thoroughly destroy Washington DC, New York City, and L.A.  As I said, there are no real surprises, but sometimes you just want to kick back and enjoy a movie.",Independence Day

This is an example of the worst that America has to offer - gun-ho nonsense that can only appeal to the simplest of minds (and, I guess, kids). I'm not a movie snob - I love many action films - but this is pitiful. I don't mind 'taking my brain out' as part of the entertainment but this is unacceptable.

Well, I guess it is genius to a certain degree to progressively stack the crap higher and higher as the film goes on. It did take some kind of planning for a film to start off as an entertaining concept and get progressively stupider and more moronic as you go. Pathetic one-liners, terrible performances, actors clearly embarrassed to be there... When you've got Jeff Goldblum embarrassed, you've accomplished something with his career. Bill Pullman, non-actor, as President of the US, with his goofy, no eye contact, sheepish wimp performance donning a flight jacket. Randy Quaid, doing the worst ""heroic"" death in the history of cinema. Will Smith searching for and finding his wife, apparently the only survivor of her entire city. What a lucky coincidence!

It's not like we'll need it in the midst of fighting an interstellar war.To give you an idea what kind of slack-jawed Neanderthal moron preschool lobotomized chimps liked this movie in the theater I was in... there's a scene where a wave of fire is engulfing a tunnel filled with cars. People are dying by the thousands. There's a dog who somehow figures (ridiculously) in all of this. The dog makes it to this maintenance exit in the nick of time to be spared.

However, a ten it is for me!! I must have originally stumbled on it on cable (never saw it in the theaters), and have been hooked on watching it many times.Of major import is the fact there is absolutely no gratuitous violence at all. Of second major import is the humor; third are the special effects...all of which make it highly entertaining without worrying about having to leave the room because of some awful something ""coming up"" I just can't stand to see. (Even the dissection scene is quite fascinating to watch.)The relationships between the characters are what keep me coming back and back again to watch. Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith are so terrific in that space ship--great chatter/dialog, delivered perfectly. Judd Hirsch and Goldblum in that car ride to Washington DC are just absolutely perfect. The continual positive forward motion of the story line embedded within a series of scenes focusing on emotional relationships engaged me deeply, in reflecting on my own life's relationships, resolved and unresolved. I also had a good laugh watching the stereotypes of ""the American hero"" vis a vis the other assembled military groups around the world--so perfectly portrayed how we see ourselves as the ""saviors"" of humanity. One wonders if/when that would/will ever be the case...but for now, we are talking movies and not reality. David Quaid is as always remarkable; absolutely believable in a character role that has been portrayed a million different ways. Vivica Fox is just fantastic--a great performance, and she is truly a role model and heroine for many young women. Adam Baldwin is excellent as that ""unbelievably cute guy"" in uniform, perfectly groomed, in completely control, doing and saying all the right things. The relationships between everyone are a pleasure to watch unfold. All of these roles may be considered cliché by many, but I enjoyed seeing them nonetheless. Science Fiction gives us the luxury of going beyond our normal circumstance into new territory in order to work out emotional ""stuff"" within a completely new and interesting framework.

The only difference between ""Independence Day"" and ""Top Gun"" is that the 2 adversaries were humans and aliens instead of Americans and Soviet pilots.

We found the video at the thrift shop yesterday and brought it home, because I'd always wanted to see it, in a tepid sort of way. It's very, very good, despite being just a touch too heavy on Star Wars references. It's about as funny as a movie can be that's about big ugly vicious things trying to kill us all. I like it because Will Smith got turned down by NASA but ended up flying a spacecraft after all, and married the girl, and gave the poor little boy a father. I like it because the crazy drunk whom everybody laughed at recovered his self-respect, and his loving but exasperated son got his father back even as he lost him. I like that Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch played the parts of my husband and his dad. I like that the president, a former fighter pilot evidently uneasy with the dirty compromises of politics, gets one more chance to fly away from earthbound ambiguities into a clear sky and a straightforward mission. I like that Jeff Goldblum's ex-wife starts to wonder if ambition has perhaps led her away from something really worth doing, into something that only looked worthwhile. I like the silly moment when Harry Connick, Jr. appears to be proposing to Will Smith, and the thought plainly crosses his mind that if these aliens really do manage to take over the earth and kill everybody, at least he'll be spared having to talk his way out of that one. I like that the First Lady is assisted by an exotic dancer who admits that she ""voted for the other one.""

It is proof-positive, much like Paris Hilton, that even the most execrable thing can be made to look good if it's got enough money thrown its way. That said, I thank God this type of schlocky, pseudo-scientific ""sci-fi"" movie seems to have died out. So, what's wrong with it? Here are the highlights (THESE CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS): Lasers cannot be weaponized -- especially into noise-making kinetic type weapons.There is no need to try and weaponize a laser. A lot more damage comes from good old-fashioned kinetic and chemical weapons (bullets and missiles). A truly advanced race would just rail gun us into oblivion from well above the Earth's atmosphere.Which brings up this point: why come down to the surface to attack? I mean, really? How much fuel is it worth to get a close up of the White House, when a well-placed (and free) asteroid can do much more damage? Remember, these are beings that can travel between stars. Moving a big rock, even a galactic-sized rock, should be a trivial matter for them.And, of course, the ""comeback."" Any race that kicked our collective arses so hard in the initial encounter would not be taken down by the remaining scraps of the world's militaries. Even with their ""shields"" disabled.All that said, if you're in front of the TV on a rainy afternoon, and this tripe is on screen, you'll probably get sucked in and you'll like it. Kudos to Emmerich for creating such consumable packaging. If you want a great alien invasion story, read Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's Footfall. THAT'S a book that is crying for movie treatment.

629,joekohl1981,"Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!",9,24 July 2020,"Independence Day(or ID4 as it shorted to) was a huge sci-fi blockbuster released in 1996. Essentially a modern remake of H.G. Wells War of the Worlds, this movie involves the ultimate alien confrontation as massive alien warships show up all over the world, and engage in a coordinated attack that leaves human kind in ruins. Soon, a determined group of survivors all over the world put their differences aside to retaliate against the invaders, thus making Independence Day not just a holiday for America, but for all people. Updating mankind's savior from cold virus to computer virus, and including scenes from the urban legends about area 51, and containing dogfight scenes borrowed heavily from Star Wars, it was panned by some critics for bankruptcy of ideas. True, ID4 is not the most original film, but it's still a lot of fun, featuring a stirring soundtrack by David Arnold, ground breaking special effects, Will Smith's motion picture debut, and contains a good message about all mankind standing as 1 people, making it one of the last sci-fi movies to touch on that topic since The Day the Earth Stood Still. This film is not particularly intellectual, but for a Hollywood popcorn flick, it's one of the best the mid 1990s had to offer. I love it, and if that's a bad thing, then so be it. Followed 20 years later by Independence Day resurgence, but it failed to duplicate the success of the original.",Independence Day
630,DetJohnMclane,Quality,8,10 December 2012,"Independent isn't really the word for this fabulous blockbuster.The story line is a mish mash from a large collection of well established works... ""War of the worlds"", ""V"", ""Earth vs. Flying Saucers"" and even a stab at ""Battle of Britain"" with its arcade game attempts at portraying a collosal aerial battle. Capt Jimmy Raven is depicted as juvenile, which may be a slap in the direction of US ""friendly fire"" pilots, whilst the rest of the world's forces are shown as comparatively professional and ill equipped.Bill Pullman sticks to his role of US President in a perceived public image, and doesn't attempt to use a more likely and realistic manner. The alien visitors are treated as friendly until proved hostile, but the glaring warning signs are ignored.Wll Smith plays Will Smith with his usual flair.However the ""Area 51"" theory is handled quite well, even if Brent Spiner is kept in without a leash as Dr Okun, as if to say ""forget Mr. Data let's be wacky"".If you have a large screen, or better still an LCD project, you will thoroughly enjoy the effects.",Independence Day

632,king_prawn_shaun,Best enjoyed with a sausage sarnie!,10,17 January 2016,"An excellent 'Bridget Jones' style chick flick starring the always irritating William Smith. Set in the mid nineties we see earth visited by a large number of obnoxious aliens. Arriving in America unannounced and lacking visas, passports and other travel documents, the aliens are turned away. Angered by the decision the aliens start to get a tad rowdy, blowing things up and generally becoming a nuisance. This kind of bad behaviour isn't to be tolerated, not in America and certainly not in China who as we know are a very respectful race. Someone needs to tell the aliens enough is enough it's time to pack up and go home or apply for a travel visa through the correct channels. The stage is set for a hero and we are treated to four of them. A pilot (Will Smith), a scientist (Geoffrey Goldbloom), a paranoid schizophrenic (Randy Quaid) and hilariously the president of America (Bill Pulman). Smith gets the ball rolling by catching an alien an dishing out a viscous beating, knocking the terrified alien unconscious and fracturing it's cheek bone. Smith high on a mixture of adrenaline and painkillers teams up with Goldbloom and steals an alien ship in a bid to destroy the aliens mothership. With Smith and Goldbloom gone, it's left up to our schizophrenic and the president to lead the world in a battle to end the anti social loutish behaviour of the aliens. Quaid clearly very confused and possessing no flight training what so ever, attempts to leave with the aliens, driving a plane up to the aliens ship he screams 'hello boys I'm back' indicating he is on friendly terms with several of the aliens or has simply been drinking heavily. Tragically however his lack of training forces him to lose control of his plane at a critical moment crashing into the alien ship causing an obscene amount of damage and countless alien casualties. Eventually the aliens tire of the hard line approach adopted by the American government and simply toddle off home, tails between their legs but pride very much intact. A must watch film for the whole family and an Oscar winning performance from Quaid!",Independence Day

They did not, in fact this film was worse than I remember it.This film has some of the most awful dialog I have ever heard in a film. ""Welcome to Earth"" (What the heck?) Who actually says this garbage? Then the ending of the film is one of the most prosperous events in movie history (A cable employee destroys the aliens with a laptop computer) PLEASE! I only wish this film was on the all top bottom 250 films of all time! I guess with good marketing even garbage can smell great to unsuspecting audiences! Will Smith proves he can play in equally bad movies after this one! The president is as big a caricature as the 43rd idiotic president.Independence Day gets my vote for one of the worst movies of the 1990s.",Independence Day
634,adeyinkaamole,Great Movie,8,19 January 2016,"Great Action Movie. Really Enjoyed it Fantatsic Awesome Good Wonderful Excellent Maginificent Movie Worth Seeing Great action Movie.I have to say that this movie panders to my particular taste, which is to say it has a well crafted story for our times, good acting and just the right blend of New York atmosphere mixed with a sci-fi feel. The other main issue is drugs. I personally have partook in the search for an intelligence enhancing substance and it was quite believable to watch Bradley Cooper transform from a bohemian-slob to a brainiac-overacheiver. The characters were well written and thought-out. The situations were too close to home for me to ignore. The character driven story was exemplary to any current sci-fi films.The tension was akin to any good crime drama but the plot kept it teasingly interesting. Why didn't I hear of this book? Anyways, Eddie(Bradley Cooper) is trying to meet a deadline after breaking it off with the love of his life(Abbie Cornish),and is on a downward spiral. He runs into an ex-brother-in-law who appears to be a druggie, but is actually involved in designer drug production, and is ensnared in a plot that leads him from the Russian Mafia to Wall Street. The science behind this movie is very believable and I applaud the producers for being brave enough to bringing it to the screen",Independence Day
635,absartist,I've Seen Much Better!!,3,17 September 2021,"I have to admit this movie has some stunning special effects for the mid 90s. It has some memorable one-liners and memorable characters even though the are the usual social, racial, and vocational stereotypes. Pretty much on the one-dimensional side. What this movie does well is look spectacular on a 50-inch LED 4K TV with a kick-ass sound system. Not only that, but it does a considerable job of building tension at the beginning of the movie. You can actually feel the arrival of the aliens and the countdown to their attack.After the wanton acts of destruction on America's landmarks from the Empire State Building to the Capitol Building, the spectacle is over. And this is where the movie starts to sputter to a halt. Where there should be character development there is just brief exposition on the invasion itself. There is no reason, no rhyme to it. Just murder! Where is the logic to it? At least Invasion of the Body Snatchers (a more superior film, by the way) had a reason for the global holocaust. To be fair, there is very little character development if you count the former Vietnam fighter pilot that has gone Coco Bananas after being allegedly ""probed"" by them only to redeem himself at the last act sacrificing himself for the rest of the squadron. Anyway, what's the savior of the human race in this movie? A computer virus! A goddamned computer virus initiated by a cable repairman! Unexpected, yes! It is plausible? Hell to the NO! How does one know if the alien technology can be effected by said computer virus? Not for nothing, doesn't Roland Emmerich know anything about the affects to using thermonuclear warheads in the atmosphere? Electromagnetic contamination, blast radii, and fallout? Just saying.This is a popcorn movie, a resurrected version of the 70s disaster films with it's cartoon character cast created from other movies. For example, Jeff Goldblum has recreated his Dr. Ian Malcolm persona from Jurassic Park (another superior film, I might add) and Will Smith's Mike Lowry vibe from the Bad Boys movie. In conclusion, this movie could've been better developed and less like a modern version of the movie ""Earthquake"" with aliens and alien ships. It just a spectacle and nothing more.",Independence Day
636,foggiarulez,Action raised to a power,10,28 April 2006,"This is what I mean to be a pure action movie.If you like this genre, in 'Independence Day' you can find all you need to enjoy: large-sized explosions, dogfights, general destruction, great special effects. It has a very good cast, as we can see actors like Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Randy Quaid and many more, all of whom are great in their parts. It has great direction, which involves you so much that you would never say runtime is 145 minutes. And finally, David Arnold's original soundtrack is simply wonderful. All of that set on the magnificent background of aliens' invasion. It also shows important values, as fighting against difficulties never giving up, a value that is progressively fading away in actual society.Most people condemn that movie calling it 'A typical American action movie', I reply them just to put their brain out of window and think to enjoy. There are movies supposed to make think and grow, and movies supposed just to entertain. This is one of them. Without enjoy life is gloomy.In my opinion this is one of the best movies of the decade, a milestone in the field of action cinema.",Independence Day

It is a classic with the same basic plot line as most other space invasion movies, but the characters work well together and there is just the right amount of comic relief for the movie not to become too serious. It's great to watch for the first time, and the second viewing often has the same effect. It is also good to watch when one does not want to pay too much attention to the movie, but at the same time you can still understand what is going on.

641,boz75,Brilliant sci-fi movie - one of the best ever made!,9,20 February 2007,"This film in my opinion is a classic sci-fi movie that will always have a place in my collection. It is based on aliens who move on from one world to the next who have conquer and conquest on their minds and our world, Earth, is targeted. It has very good action scenes, humour and fellowship, cool special effects(that even to this day are excellent), and I personally loved the different mix of characters. There is 1 main quibble for me - the virus that is uploaded to the mother-ship. I had to sweep that fact under the carpet because it is more unlikely than me winning the jackpot on the lottery, than someone who could successfully upload a virus to a supposedly state of the art alien space vessel..using.. windows 95 or even 3.11 maybe? lol. However despite that, it gives the story of humans uniting together to accomplish a single goal despite our differences - simply to survive. A great tale and I cannot see why action,adventure or sci-fi fans would not enjoy this film - so if you fall into this category, watch it as you will not be disappointed. For people who have other film categoric interests, I would still recommend that you check this out to see what you think, as it is a very good film and still may have some entertainment value for you!",Independence Day

I got the sense that most of the people watching with me were cursing themselves for wasting five bucks and two hours.I, however, was struggling to contain my laughter at what was one of the best comedies of that summer.The lines are corny. The people are caricatures. The acting is over-the-top. The plot is full of giant holes and even bigger clichés. And yet, somehow, the people on the screen seem to be taking it all seriously. It's hilarious. The only thing that could possibly make it better would be the MST3K crew... but they'd almost be redundant.In short: It's so laughably bad, it's actually good.To make it even better, the action sequences and visual effects (particularly by the standards of the time) are pretty good.If you're looking for a serious Sci-Fi disaster movie, don't bother.If you're looking for an overtly funny parody of a Sci-Fi action movie starring Will Smith...

The characters were quite shallow, that´s the biggest problem. And I can´t help but I find the american patriotism somewhat comical in the movie. Last time, for example, when I watched it, I ended up laughing my head off during the president´s speech. It was fun, yes, but I don´t think it was meant to be that way.

And that's only if you're willing to ignore the incredibly horrible plot, and all the holes therein.The part that makes it at least somewhat tolerable is the special effects. They had a great team on this one.  Now... how come they couldn't put those people, or people like them, to work on the plot?The basic idea is simple:  A race of aliens come to earth to conquer it, and the human race fights back.The problem with this film is HOW the humans fight back.  Using 50 year old alien technology, Jeff Goldblum, a satellite TV repairman, creates a computer virus to shut down the mothership's shields.  Apparently, this ""Advanced"" race of alien beings use Macintosh Computers, never upgrade their software, or change their passwords, or try to communicate with ships that are trying to dock, before allowing them to dock.Then there's the Hillbilly crop duster, played by Randy Quaid, who jumps himself into an F-18 Hornet, and is able to fly it, quite well, right away.

I like the idea of disabling the alien's computers by a computer virus, that was created without any research and uploaded to the mother ship via unknown interfaces. Who's gonna buy such a rubbish ? The creators absolutely ignored the gravity effects of such a huge ship residing at the orbit. An exclusive use of F-18's by earth defenders and their incredible (impossible) maneuverability is just one more example.

It was 75 million and the film looked like pure gold. Complaints are how unrealistic it was! One of them was that at one point the president of the united states of America is in a plane shooting down reptile looking aliens with invisible shields around an alien warship the size of new york.

It never tries to be intelligent and it never acts as if it was intelligent, wich is something that must be considered.ID4 doesn't want to bring us a smart and philosophical story, it doesn't want to make us think about anything after we left the cinema and for sure it doesn't want to make us think while watching the film.It is a pure popcorn film which wants only one thing: To deliver scales of destruction and battle unseen till that time. And thats what it did.I remember the day I saw this film in cinema and the first alien ship flies over the skyline of LA. I also remember the firestorm sequence and the aerial battle sequences.

The special effects are terrific at times, particularly the attacks on iconic landmarks such as the White House and the Empire State Building. The actors have fun in their roles, especially Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith as the satellite genius and amazingly talented pilot respectively.Roland Emmerich's film, although great fun, contains several unbearably cheesy moments. One which springs to mind is the President's call for the world to declare July 4 as their independence day. Many of the battle sequences, although visually great, seem unrealistic. The dialogue is also poor for the most part.Watching it now, many of the film's elements seem stereotypical, although it is difficult to tell if this is because of the several similar films since, trying to replicate the success of Independence Day. It is a prime example of the thrilling action films we have become accustomed to.

It's spectacularly self-centred at times (e.g. 15 spaceships over the world, at least 4 of which are over American cities!). The few foreign characters are reduced to cartoon caricatures of their nationalities (e.g. the two British pilots (shown in short 'cut-to' sequences) speak with the sort of public school accents that show up in American sitcoms all the time, such as the butler in 'Fresh Prince', & make most British people I know cringe).  At times it appears that the producers picked out nationalities that they assume are top-of-mind (Iraq, Israel, Japan, Russia & Britain feature most prominently) for the American audience (or at least fairly low-brow elements of it) and then sterotyped them.
I can accept that, in an American film, it's the Americans that save the world. But the impression you get from the film is that no-one else even TRIES to fight back.  Yes, the other countries do join in the fight, but NO-ONE else shows any initiative.  Would it have been disruptive to show the President consulting with the UN, or to show a Chinese or French plane being destroyed while trying to attack the space ship?Still, it seems silly to complain about national stereotypes in a film that's chock-full of all sorts of stereotypes.  I kept expecting Jeff Goldblum to start talking about chaos theory, and Judd Hirsch even manages to get in an 'Oy Vey'!  None of the writers or actors seem to have had to stretch too far, but Smith & Goldblum make an effective enough team.That said, I still quite enjoyed the film.  It's not high art, but at least it made me laugh.  Thanks Will...",Independence Day
664,gail-fuji,This made Will Smith BIG-TIME!!!,9,24 March 2012,"Will Smith is one BAD dude in this movie. And btw, the movie wasn't made to raise the bar for all other movies. It was made strictly to entertain, and for the millions that went to see it opening weekend, it did.Considering this was one of the biggest blockbuster of all time i think it proves that some people just want to have fun in a theater. I don't want to see some Academy Award winning movie every weekend. I want to drink my soda, have some popcorn and watch stuff blow up and in the end the US/world comes out on top.I'm disappointed in how many people don't understand this and continue to complain about it's bad acting, which wasn't that bad, Old predictable plot(If you where surprised by that when you saw it, I'm amazed you can type enough to write a bad review), and finally it's attempt and drama(which was a good attempt and at a handful of times worked). Nevermind all that, just have fun, that's why that made this film, and that's why it did so great.If you don't like it then, just sit down and watch face/off and stay away from Vin Desiel movies.",Independence Day
665,projectxclan,Better then the score it currently has.,10,26 June 2012,I love to watch Will Smith. I have seen this movie so many times and it never gets old. This movie is great for everyone in my opinion. There may be some violence and harsh language but even a kid in today's world sees and hears much worse. I write my review because i see reviews that make little sense. OK OK i wont rant on and on about low scores but if u rated this lower then 5 you just maybe hit your head sometime way too hard. 1 thing to notice is wiki i believe lists the gross profit of this film to be almost a billion dollars. That's crazy for a mere 6-7 stars. watch and enjoy. 10 out of 10 for one of Will Smiths best films. I believe this was his first big screen block buster appearance,Independence Day
666,saturn0009,It Just Doesn't Get Any Worse Than This,1,26 May 2004,"Before he became an over-inflated egotist, Will Smith was actually a likable guy. He was a fairly talented young rapper (DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince) and a gifted, comedic television actor (""The Fresh Prince""). It wasn't until he started starring in trash like ""Independence Day"" that his welcome began wearing thin. ""Independence Day"" does nothing to redeem Will Smith. In fact, 1998's bomb did more to reinforce the notion that Will Smith should have remained in television rather than going into motion pictures.But I can't pick on Will Smith for this mess alone: remember, it takes a village. In the case of ""Independence Day"", it took many months of pre-publicity and advertising to pitch this bloated, idiotic, absurd story to audiences. It worked, given the fact that its opening weekend grossed an astounding $36.1 million at the box office. But just because something is popular doesn't mean it's good. (""Independence Day flopped with critics.)Essentially a poor remake of H.G. Welles' ""War of the Worlds"", ""Independence Day"" offers the same story line with a few modern twists and variations on the original storyline. Yes, Roland Emmerich's version contains ground-breaking special effects--visuals that defied existing technologies at the time, rightfully winning awards for their breakthrough brilliance. But you get a much stronger remake of ""War of the Worlds"" with M. Night Shyamalan's far superior ""Signs""--also loosely based on the original tale--sans the spectacular effects. Why? Because ""Signs"" gave us characters to actually care about and a claustrophobically atmospheric screenplay soaked in mystery and suspense. ""Independence Day"" merely assumes we are even the least bit interested in its characters and could care less about plausible plot development.By the time Will Smith and company take the helm near the end of this wreck, we are asked to believe they can figure out the same alien technology attacking the earth to stop the invasion. I didn't buy it. Neither should you.Leave ""Independence Day"" on the shelf where it belongs.",Independence Day

The whole experience was so realistic, it really made you believe it could happen. In short this is the best alien movie, anyone could watch, with anyone at anytime.The best thing about the movie showed the reactions of people around the world, to probably the biggest thing that had ever happened to earth. The TV news, the car jams, the president's message. Everything was so well done, that it just couldn't have been done better. It is also visually the most stunning movie since star wars.

It's so well paced that you can suspend disbelief easily as the film races along. It's also a supremely artful movie with references to Star Wars, Close Encounters ( It's a wonderful counter to Spielberg's sentimental and tacky rubbish ), Alien AND Aliens, 2001, Airplane, The Right Stuff. And these were just the one's I spotted. Films are for kids. Remind yourself of the kid in yourself and luxuriate in this wonderful film.

672,craigstealsheep,Misunderstood,8,22 November 2005,"My, doesn't that title sound like a pop album. Anyway, this movie was misunderstood. First and foremost, it is a movie. Yes, it is unbelievable, but it is a movie! Second, America is usually considered the strongest country in the world, which I'm sure will be getting many arguments there, and the movie was made in (gasp) America, so naturally the focus would be in America. When you see a British film, where does it tend to take place? Uh... Britian? And who tends to be the protagonist? A British guy? Now, I know this may shock many people, but this was a good movie. It was very entertaining, suspenseful, and actually pretty clever (for what it was, don't worry). The special effects were amazing, and the acting was bearable (which is all you need in an action movie). They weren't trying to make a deep, philosophical movie, or important one for that matter. No, they were trying to make a movie. A summer blockbuster, and that is all. They exceeded that and made one that is still remembered 5 1/2 years later. Now tell me that isn't something. Name another movie from 1996 off the top of your head. I'd have to think about it, but this would be the first one to come to mind.Everyone probably knows the story by now, but just in case: Aliens invade Earth and blow the crap out of everything in existence there, well, except for some pretty people, and the world must stand against them. This movie does include other countries, granted it is for one scene, but many like this don't as if America is the only country in the world, i.e. Mars Attacks. The Americans have an alien ship, via the Roswell incident, and because of this, CD's and those crazy com-put-er things were invented. But also because of this, Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum (who is the best actor in the movie, I don't care what you say, he seems more like a real person than Will Smith or Bill Pullman, and he is a good actor. Oh no! This Craig guy is crazy for thinking that!) fly the ship to the mother ship, which is above the moon, and blow it up with a nuke. It is not the virus that destroys it, it is the nuclear missile that is shot inside of the ship. The virus just shut down the shields.The virus: It actually does make sense. The aliens took over using the satellites that we had for TV and such, so everything involved with them was not working well. Because they were using the satellites, all Jeff Goldblum had to do was hack into the satellite and that would let him into the alien's internet provider (which, ironically, was Earthlink) and give them a direct connection. So they emailed a virus to the aliens and bam! it destroyed their systems. Ever had a virus? It can be that bad. I believe Jeff went into the future and got the real Y2K virus, not the one that actually went out, the one in the crappy TV movie that made computers explode into people's faces and kill them. So the virus, which could have just as easily been uploaded by a PC, made their computers crash. The Technical guys could not come in time to fix it, because all they had was a few minutes to fix the computers, and they had to have their Starbucks or their day would just suck. And then, BOOM! Jeff and Will barely escape before the big explosion, Earth wins, and a firework show ends the movie. The End.",Independence Day

The good points: 1-The movie maintains good emotional distance not letting the audience lose the plot. 2-The movie was skillfully directed. 3- the acting was brilliant [ especially will smith ] 4- The movie is a technical masterpiece [ the sound and the graphics and the effects are simply great] 5-The fight scenes were skillfully executed. 6- The movie has inspirational quotes. 7-The movies is a visual spectacle. Roland Emmerich's artistic background as a sculptor has helped him. The bad points: 1-One that stands out is the lack of resistance of the alien computers to the virus. 2-The spaceship is not detected till it crosses the moon.Well thats all the bad I could figure out.

690,soundlessmelody,I laughed. But not in a good way.,3,5 July 2009,"To start, let me admit that the only reason I watched this movie was James Duval* (and the fact that it happened to air on the Dutch TV today). I do not generally like action movies, and while I can see that the special effects and destruction scenes may redeem ID4 in the eyes of people that do, I personally just couldn't get over the laughable plot.Yes, to be fair, I laughed - but it was the incredulous laugh of someone who can't believe his eyes. The scene that almost killed me was the one with the 'British' soldiers in the Iraqi desert. I'm not a native speaker, but despite all the 'bloody's and cups of tea that were tossed in for good measure, I don't think those actors were, either. I thought it couldn't get worse, until the naked, spear-brandishing African primitives showed up. The local McDonald's obviously had been photoshopped out, lest the viewer might think the Americans brought anything other than peace and democracy to the world....But really. I dislike neither America nor its inhabitants, but you *have* to realise how your overblown patriotism must look in the eyes of those with a more, erm, objective view on things. In fact, if the movie makers had been a bit more sensitive to actual history, they'd have had the alien ships exploding while our heroes were still desperately trying to come up with a plan, leaving everyone dumbstruck until someone finally realised, 'Damn! The Russians beat us to it'.Now *that* would have been a funny joke.Everyone already commented on the general ridiculousness of the main plot line, so I'll refrain from doing that. But let me just share one pet peeve that no one seems to have mentioned so far: the portrayal of science. In the actual world, scientists are intelligent people who know stuff you don't. In ID4 world, scientists are stupid, giggly weirdos who fail to make actual progress until the President and his cable guy decide to come barging in (in a sterile area, no less, supposedly spoiling decades of research, but who cares what those geeks are doing). THEY FAILED TO REALISE THAT THE PATTERNS ON THE SCREEN WERE A COMMUNICATION SIGNAL. I rest my case.Then there's the romance. The Will Smith/Vivica Fox romance was decent, though completely compiled from stock dialogue and clichéd scenes, but at least you get to feel like they deserve each other and vaguely hope for a happy ending for them. But Jeff Goldblum's character getting his wife back? She dumped him because he didn't do anything extraordinary, wants him back now that he's saved the day, and he happily encloses her in his arms as the credits roll - why doesn't he tell her that 'sorry, but she never accepted him for who he was, and it's too late now'? Do the writers really intend to convey the message that you truly only deserve to be loved for what you do, rather than for who you are? I'm sorry, but that doesn't seem very romantic to me.So, maybe I am overanalysing, because ID4 is really just a no-brainer, blah blah. But somehow, I can't see the fun of watching a movie while desperately trying to keep my neurons from firing - one might as well watch a movie with one's eyes closed. ('OMG you haters, you were just expecting WAY too much, if you had closed your eyes throughout the entire movie you'd have given it a 10/10!') By the way, you know what else killed me ded? This exquisite piece of irrefutable argumentation I stumbled upon in the comments: ""Ok first of all the only people complaining about how bad this movie was are from other countries. here is a news flash for you. the US saved England's butts in world war 2.""______ * Yes, I know he's not that great an actor, but girls can be superficial too.

698,reystevens,independence day,9,28 March 2007,that movie was really good i love the action and it was also funny sometimes.Its funny when the alien dies in the desert.I rate it 9 because i find they exaggerated when like they called the worlds armies to help when their where other ones in other countries.The actors where good like WIll SMith and that guy in Jurrasik park 1-2 and the fly.Actor wise it was good i liked the effects they used like with spaceship the white house blowing up.They should make a second one where this time we go and attack some aliens since they attacked us they make up something like they had a planet and only the strong ones would leave the planet or something like that.It would be pretty fun to se indenpence day 2 but they would have to make it again on the independence day or else the movie would make no sense.It was no the best movie but it was a really good movie.,Independence Day
699,jmellitas,What a disappointment,3,18 April 2007,"Well, I can't honestly give this film a good review despite being a fan of Will Smith (well, he can be very annoying at times though and is better suited to other films) and Goldblum. The actors in it are not my favourites and this combined with what appeared to very bad acting really ruined the film for me. Bill Pullman, Robert Loggia and Adam Baldwin were absolutely awful. Was it just bad directing or just simply bad acting? Bill Pullman acted like he was in a comedy. His face expressions hilarious at times. I mean does he ever know when to put a serious face even at the thought the earth is about to end? I mean what was going on in his head? What was going on in the Director's head more importantly as this has some of the worse acting I have ever seen in a film. As for the story line, the thought of a virus being uploaded to a revolutionary alien ship like this was so unrealistic it made me laugh. What did they use again, a floppy disk? Is their security firewall that lame? Seriously? Who writes this crap? I could have walked out of the cinema at that point alone had it not been for some really good special effects which was the only factor to grab my attention. As for a single missile destroying a giant UFO that would kill an entire city if was to collapse on the earth, I don't think much thought went into the ending. I also like how Will Smith can just to fly an alien spaceship. I mean, is he from the matrix? Watchable for the special effects only. Everything else was a let down and I mean a serious let down. Now I like blockbuster films with special effects as much as anyone but it still needs to be believable and also well acted. This lacks this.",Independence Day

The creatures - ""Alien."" Attacks on the giant ship, AND the mother ship - ""Stars Wars."" Using lights on a helicopter to signal ""friendly signs"" to the aliens - ""Close Encounters"" (and then it gets blown up - hilarious! and the pilot of the helicopter is the same actor in the same role in another movie about ""friendly aliens"" - 1984's ""Starman.""). ""Data"" from ""Star Trek - Next Generation"" as the crazy scientist leader of Area 51. Bill Pullman, AKA ""Lone Star"" from ""Space Balls"" as the President. Randy Quaid as the ""suicide pilot"" blowing up the big ship - same as Slim Pickens straight out of ""Dr. Strangelove."" ""War of the Worlds"" (giving their computer a ""cold"" like the aliens dying from earth ""viruses""). The early scene of Randy Quaid's kids in the trailer park watching an old B&W movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" Jeff Goldblum from ""Earth Girls Are Easy."" ""Star Wars"" type dogfights.

And it isn't because i have any one specific problem with it, but more a compilation of little things that add up to one big lackluster let down. When i first saw this movie i loved it. but i was young and foolish. this movie is really bad from start to finish. the idea is there, and sometimes you get a glimpse of how this could have almost been a good movie. but bad plot structure, and a poorly written script ruin it.with that said i just cant justify giving it any lower of a score, because even with all of its flaws it can be entertaining to watch the first time. watch it if you want, but don't expect much. unless you like cheesy-sci-fi action movies with will smith. if you do, this is a 10/10 for you.",Independence Day

Ok it took over $300 milion at the box office, but that is hardly suprising given that the Hype machine was in top gear months prior to release. And I must admit I was as much a sucker as the next man in being conned by it. Apart from the huge plot holes the character stereotypes and the embarrassing cringeworthy flag waving, what is most annoying is that it could have been so much more. In one scene when entering the Alien Mothership, we see thousands upon thousands of ground troops waiting for invasion. Why couldn't we see any of that. Instead we get Will Smith and Randy Quaid from the acting school of the Inept! Have always had this down as THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER, EVER, EVER SEEN!!!!!

707,Alltheginjoints,Better Now than Ever,8,4 March 2010,"I first saw Independence Day on laser-disk on 35 inch CRT. I watched ID4 for the millionth time on a 50 inch plasma on Blu-Ray in February of 2010 and Independence Day is a better movie now than it was all those years ago. If you have not seen Independence Day yet, then now is the best time to do so If you are watching this movie to find the meaning of life, you will not find it in this movie. To watch ID4 you have to suspend belief because there are parts to this movie that just don't make sense. For example it is far fetched that a human computer could upload a debilitating virus to the mother ship when in 1996 you could barely have Macs and PCs communicate. Even when the movie is 14 years old, the effects still are very impressive. When you see the Capitol Building building shatter into a million pieces, the feeling was the same in 2010 as it was in when the movie first came out.

709,Glimmer_Twin,"""Indepence Day",3,21 February 2005,"The plot in ""Independence Day"" isn't exactly hard to describe; some kind of alien race has decided to try to take over Earth, and after destroying most major cities in the world and crushing all counter-attacks, the U.S. finally prevails and kills them off. Any movie that can be explained well in one sentence - and I imagine that last sentence was pretty much the whole script - has a problem to start with. But, there are many simple action movies that still manage to be entertaining, given that they have a certain level of self-awareness (a movie like ""Die Hard"" is a good example). This movie, however, has the self-awareness of a two-year old. Not only that, it also over-uses every last one of the pathetic clichés that so many people connect Hollywood disaster-films with these days - flag-waving, macho guys trying to be funny (and failing miserably in the process), a score that is basically centered around different versions of the U.S. national anthem, the underdog who gets beaten down but prevails in the end, thus achieving the American Dream, the leader who is really not a man of politics, but a man of action, and of the people - everything. Watching a movie like this is interesting, because it is actually so dumb and totally unaware of its own absurdness that you can't parody it; it's already a parody of itself.The acting is bad, based on the fact that every character in this movie is insanely predictable. We all know within the first two seconds of seeing them exactly how they will behave until the very end. Of course Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), the alcoholic Vietnam veteran (who is the underdog I mentioned before) will get his revenge at the aliens who abducted him ten years before the attacks, of course he will prove the one's who have taunted him for so long wrong, and of course he will sacrifice his life for the sake of the United States of America - not the world - to become an incarnation of the archetype of the American Hero. Being a European, I have absolutely nothing against America myself, but it's no wonder how large parts of the world has a bad image of it when stuff like this is what they are basing their opinions on. (It's true that the director of the movie is actually German, but movies like this are controlled by studios, not directors.) All the other major characters' actions are just as predictable his Russell's, so I'm not going to go into them.You are not supposed to take movies like this too seriously, and I don't. But large parts of it is so mind-numbingly stupid that it ends up being provoking. There are tons of logical plot holes; one of the biggest ones being how Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith) and David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) manage to first travel into the alien mother ship, using one of the alien vehicles, obtained in Roswell, New Mexico in the '50s (the vehicle is located in Area 51 - where else?), and then downloading a virus into the main computer, causing the shields of the ships attacking Earth to go down, which allows the human forces to strike against them. This is absurd in many ways; first of all, don't the aliens have some kind of scan for spaceships entering their mother ship? Their technology is so ridiculously advanced there's no reason they shouldn't have one. But most of all, how the hell can Levinson just hook up his portable computer to their main computer and download the virus in a matter of seconds? These creatures have shields powerful enough to withstand any human weapon, but they are totally defenseless against a guy with his home computer? Normally, I don't find plot holes like that all that disturbing, but there's so many of them in this movie, you just can't help but. And in addition to that some special effects are really poor.Movies like ""Independence Day"" is the reason so many people detest Hollywood these days. It's dull and predictable, and has absolutely nothing new to offer. In addition to that, what it actually does offer, it offers in such a way that it feels like the heads of the studio responsible for it is actually sitting and laughing at for buying something as absurd as this. Sadly, the joke isn't on them, seeing as how this movie grossed more than $800 million worldwide. Maybe the human race does deserve to be annihilated after all.",Independence Day

The speech given by the President in this movie is so moving that it gives me goose bumps even to this day, every time I watch it. It is patriotic and shows that even in the adversity of an alien invasion the President uses every available weapon to protect our country. He is a great example that the current and future presidents should follow. I know this is just a dream for a president to actually act like a hero. But, we are all allowed to dream aren't we? I recommend that this movie be watched by everyone in every language. It is vitally important that we face the fact that someday our whole world is going to be in danger and we will have to work together to overcome our mutual enemy. Something similar is happening right now that is a prime example of this with terrorists attacking all over the world. We need to work together to stop the bombings and bring peace to the world.",Independence Day
714,jareduf,Classic Fun That Never Gets Old,10,28 July 2006,"Today the idea of aliens coming to earth to take over the world has become ""cliche."" But Independence Day was the first of its kind that took the darkness out of this genre. This is not to say that the movie does not have its sad moments, but this incredible cast brightens up the day.Bill Pullman plays the lovable fighter pilot who has become President. Jeff Goldblum plays a computer genius who is still in love with his wife (Margaret Colin), but are separated by professional differences. Jeff Goldblum's character, David Levinson joins up with his dad Julius (Judd Hirsh) in which the two add comic relief. Will Smith plays Captain Hiller who's dream is to fly a spaceship and lives with his striper girlfriend Jasmine (Viviva Fox). The list of great characters goes on and on. Each of this incredible cast's story will be affected by the alien invasion. They must put aside their differences in order to save the planet and in the process learn to respect each other. This theme is metaphor for life that in time of crisis, human beings can come together for the good of mankind. Overall just a great movie that constantly adds a new twist to the story. This movie is not trying to win an academy award but, if you take it for its worth, you will have a great time.",Independence Day

717,bardylis,The spoiler warning is just for another movie I talk about,4,25 May 2006,"Independence Day, a rehash of the 50's movie Earth v The Flying Saucers, is undoubtedly one of the most misunderstood movies of the century . . . Oh wait a second, no it's not.If you've ever seen the above mentioned 50's movie then you should be able to accurately guess the basic plot outline of this movie, if you haven't then you probably can still figure it out, aliens come, we don't understand why they're here, they blow us away, we figure out some way of beating them, beat them and go out for a big pancake breakfast to celebrate. The 50's movie had a few things going for it, such as paranoia about Soviet attack and air power, and a recent surge of interest in UFO's and the paranormal.ID4, in the 90's, couldn't capitalize on those, since the Soviets were gone and UFO's were just mainstream pop-culture by now, so the filmmakers decided that they would make the film overly patriotic, practically gushing sentiment and pride, as a cheap way to attract viewers. Here's a good rule of thumb, when a movie has to appeal to ones sense of patriotism just to get you to even think about going to see it, don't go see it.There are other irksome things about this movie, Will Smith's one liners, the absurd alien attack plan, the inaccuracy about Area 51(for starters Area 51 is not the airbase's official name), endless unsympathetic characters, and let's not forget the absolutely moronic way that the hero's disable the alien shields. If memory serves me, In Earth v The Flying Saucers we discover that a specific radio wave that causes the Saucer's guidance system to malfunction, while it's a leap of faith to believe that a simple radio wave can have such an amazing effect on a device designed to guide a complex spaceship across countless light-years, the thing they came up with in ID4 is absolutely unbelievable.On the plus side the special effects look great, even after all these years, which alone is a good reason to at least catch the movie when it's on TV. And certain elements of the movie work well. The destruction of monuments and cities is as unnerving as it should be. But it's just too little to make a difference.All in all not very good.",Independence Day

Sorry, but I'm able to look past that and see a good movie. People have a go at the script - but it works. There are some plot holes, but have you ever seen a film without one? People have a go at the acting - I saw nothing wrong with it. People say it's very 'God Bless America' and yes it is, but if it was 'God Bless The World' people would complain that it wasn't 'God Bless America' so really, look past that. It's got amazing special effects, great action, funny lines (Welcome to Earth is the best line ever! Though we have a family habit of repeating it every time we see an alien movie...), and it's a good film.It's not worth 10 out of 10 because it's not THAT good. But people are giving it 1 out of ten, and I have to say, come on, get over yourselves, it wasn't that bad.Anyway, it's not like any big budget movie has escaped the 'Haters'.See it, turn the volume up, laugh a bit, don't take it seriously.

And the CGI didn't even seem dated. The action in Independence Day was awesome. It never really slows down. There's a lot of destruction and a lot of people die in it. The soundtrack was really good.

724,vahramx,Worst movie that made a ton of money,4,24 July 2009,"Independence Day, regardless of its box office rank, does not qualify as even a respectable film. For a number of reasons, primarily the poor script, poor plot, and just plan lack of originality.I mean come on, do you really believe an alien species that is hundreds of millennia more sophisticated then us, is going to be so vulnerable to destruction that a mere suicide attack from a jet plane could render their entire invasion a failure? Not to mention that an alien species cannot possibly have an aggressive mentality for by the time they reach this state of intelligence they would have destroyed themselves, hundreds of times over.And if they are this intelligent they would have nanobots to recycle their own waste. And they could simply have gathered the resources of their neighboring planets rather than travel hundreds of light years just to destroy a potential form of entertainment.The script is cliché 1990's, it incorporates many of the variables that are reminiscent of that decade, particularly nonsensical war-cries that do little to improve the movie watching experience and serves only to give the film an additional aura of ridiculousness. I cannot help but imagine the entertainment potential this film had, if only it were let's saymore serious- a sort of ""War of the Worlds"" type of film, although that was also a very inaccurate assessment of alien intelligence.",Independence Day

Bill Pullman's speech as president was awful. Will Smith's character unbelievable. Subplots all overworked. The idea of Jeff Goldblum's character is quite ridiculous.

726,cjsmith,A brainless wonder!,2,22 October 1998,"It is movies like this that fuel the rest of the world's resentment towards America. Here you have $100 Million plus and the best that can be produced is a braindead, stupidly simplistic, bigoted story of how wonderful the USA is and ""What would the world do without us?"", complete with visually impressive yet emotionally devoid special effects.Contrary to this film's premise, the rest of the world would not be sitting around twiddling their thumbs waiting for America to save the day. Do we really expect that if a bunch of alien creatures that are smart enough to travel the universe and build incredible transports and weaponry technology decided they liked the look of our wee planet, that we would even have a hope of fighting back? Maybe you Yankees have an over-inflated perception of your abilities, but let's be reasonable here. Of course the film is about the triumph of the human spirit against all adversity, but really - how much more advanced is the super-evolved aliens' sense of ""species pride"" going to be? Do we really think twice when destroying an insect nest about the possibility of them getting us back?This film is riddled with incredibly dumb things. Even if there were some memorable characters (there aren't) and some moving moments (cheesy unsuccessful attempts) we would be prevented from enjoying them because the story is so foolish. I list a couple of examples:-An explosion that 'nukes' a city in seconds is not capable of being outrun and survived, in a tunnel, by a lone woman and the dog she loves very much.-Giant ships hovering over the world's major cities, when destroyed, manage to conveniently end up crashed out at sea, or in the mountains next to the city. Um, how?-A computer virus. How clever. Tell me, how did they link up with the mothership computer. Were the aliens conveniently using compatible computer systems and interfacing link-ups? Perhaps interested people could read Arthur C. Clarke's ""3001: Final Odyssey"" for an example of how this principle can be executed plausibly.Need I go on? I think not. I will simply conclude by saying that perhaps the makers of ID4 should think about what it was about ""Star Wars"" that moved them and millions of others a long time ago, and go back to the drawing board.Note: In New Zealand the promotional banners for ID4 contained a whopping great spelling mistake (""weren't"" spelled ""were'nt"") Was this the case worldwide?

The speed with which they find the solution to accessing the alien's ships, flying them and locate their weak spot is rather unbelievable.From a non-US point of view, I also think it is very arrogant to write a story in which, by some 'strange' coincidence, the date at which the world is saved from the alien threat is July 4, which just 'happens' to be the US independance day.",Independence Day

As soon as it started after a few minutes it began to come to mind that I was going to love this film. And in fact that's it. The actors' performance was inimitable. From that day on I didn't loose a Will Smith film or single. It was just like ""love at first sight"". And the story? What can I say? Just that it kept me 2 hours on the cinema seat without pop-corn to not loose any single phrase because of the crunching.

This dedication is even mentioned in the intro credits of the DVD. So from that perspective, the film is outstanding. It has the perfect blend of corn and context realism.The special effect are extremely well done. You can believe the White House and other major buildings explode in billows of fire, because large-scale models really ARE being filmed as they're pulverized. And the ingenious fire setup (explained in a DVD extra) makes the scenes convincing because it's real fire. There's no fakey looking CGI here that detracts from credibility.I think more people would enjoy the film if they'd view it for what it was intended to be.",Independence Day

It is a loose, incoherent, and half baked story and a collection of trite action sequences, cheap computer generated effects, bad dialog, and bad acting. Almost half the movie is like you are watching a cheap computer game in which people are rapidly clicking on joysticks, shooting at 'aircrafts' coming at them! To be fair, some of the building destruction scenes have impressive visuals and are well made.My main impression of this movie is that it no doubt has a strong element of propaganda for the Jewish and Israel. (ex: the sequence starting with a close up of Israeli flag.) America and the world is saved because of a few super smart Jews.

750,pkarpenko,"ID4 Accomplished All it Set Out to Do. No More, No Less.",9,16 August 2004,"Reading the other reviews, I cannot help but feel as though people are taking this movie and, in fact, the CONCEPT of this movie far too seriously. First off, let me come right out and say that ID4 is the best disaster film ever made. Say what you will about Towering Inferno, Airport, Earthquake or the original Godzilla, ID4 does it better. The concept of the disaster film is, in essence, very simple. Have lots of characters representing many aspects of society and perspectives, all dealing with a common evil (be it natural, unnatural, supernatural, etc.) The idea is that people come together in times of crisis to confront a common foe. To do this well in a film requires a specific directorial touch in that, because the concept of the disaster film hangs on its multiple characters and, of course, the portrayal of the actual disaster, these elements must be rendered flawlessly. ID4 does this.If there is one word to describe ID4's aesthetic, technical and directorial design, it's polished. The special effects, which were NOT cutting edge in the mid 90s (contrary to what most think) looked precisely right. There is really only one way to show a wall of fire rushing down a city, and ID4 pretty much nailed it. The result of using only what was necessary in terms of effects and nothing more is that ID4 STILL looks good, almost a decade later. Also, the writing is concise, funny and direct. Nothing is extraneous or boring. And as far as the characters go, each is given ample screen-time and kept track of throughout the film. This is harder than it seems and, actually, it's also the reason why Soderbergh's Ocean's 11 is as polished as it is. The characters are all kept track of properly. So ID4 cannot be judged on its realism or any other extraneous factor. It is a marvelously entertaining disaster film. Of course it's oversimplified, of course it's not scientifically accurate. But that's why we go to the movies sometimes.",Independence Day
751,ricrac-2,ugh,1,24 July 2006,"Most definitely the WORST film of all time.This is the type of tripe a nine year old schoolboy might dream of while playing with his power rangers. The plot is paper-thin with cheesy acting and dialogue. The defeat of the aliens is laughable also.I basically sat down really looking forward to this film as I have been a big sci-fi fan all my life and films of this type were thin on the ground. Unfortunately even though I have read 100's of brilliant sci-fi novels that would make great films someone thought this would be a better choice, though it can't have originated from a book...not a novel at least...perhaps a comic.This is Hollywood moguls at their worst, a few ""big names"" with special effect overload to make up for any depth.Come on boys, there are plenty of great books just waiting to be turned into screenplays (there have been quite a few better attempts recently)...give us the public some credence of intelligence please!!!!!",Independence Day

The acting in this film in really bad. Especially Randy Quaid's ""performance"" annoys me. Of course you would pick an alcoholic farmer to fly an F16 or whatever to fight the aliens. And can you really picture an American President himself jumping into a plane and flying off? No, he would be hidden away at Camp David or somewhere else, curled up into a corner. I know (or at least I hope) that this was not an attempt to make a movie that would win all (or any) categories at the Academy Awards, but still you have to look very hard to be able to find worse acting than featured in this movie. As for the special effects, they did look good when I first saw the movie, but they do not make up for the bad story line and bad acting.

Jeff Goldblum's injured genius is a character he plays well, and the banter between he and Will is fun. It's fun, funny, has great special effects, and doesn't drag you down with pretense. The critics posting such horrible reviews should lighten up and remember to judge a film within its own genre. If you're looking for highbrow substance, dramatic seriousness, dark characters, or ponderous subjects, you should probably watch indie movies, or those depressing films in which everyone is unhappy, no one wins, and no one gets the girl.

763,absolom7691-1,Rip off,3,2 September 2007,"This got a rating of three only because the special effects were great. The film is rip off from ""War of the Worlds"" (1953). They aliens come, we try to greet them, they blow us up, we fight but our weapons are no match for theirs, we try to nuke them and still no dice, we are at a dismal moment. At the end of ""War of the Worlds"" *SPOILER*, a virus (or many along with bacteria) kills the aliens, as they have no immunity to our parasites. This movie doesn't rip that off directly, but instead, they parallel it with a ""computer virus"" instead of a biological virus. I'm sorry, this was a poor attempt at something ""original"" by stealing from another great. At least ""War of the Worlds"" (2005) called it that and remade a great.This movie is action packed, with great CG (for 1996 standards) and some good flying scenes. Where it lacks is originality and the characters. Wil SMith is believable, but that is because he is playing his typical Wil smith roles. THe rest of the characters choke. Randy Quaid's character is a total joke, along with the character's kids. The worst still, is Jeff Goldblum's father. I get tired of him saying how much a schmuck he is and how much a schmuck is son is and how much a schmuck everyone is. I know his character is Jewish, but man, they play out the stereotypes at every angle. If I were Jewish, I would be upset with the gross stereotype the convey. Not all Jews call everyone a Schmuck 50 times over.If you are looking for something to watch with action and you don't want to think at all, this is the movie.

But this movie was just a great fun filled ride. Yeah a lot was bull like the virus and the crop duster gone F-18 but that is what makes a movie a ""MOVIE"".

For the majority of filmgoers, it works, because audiences don't like to think-  they like to stare mindlessly at the purty pictures while riding the dopamine high.

The actors were selected from a bin of dime a dozen Hollywood pretenders with formula characters.... Goldblum with his irritating one trick pony style of acting,... Will Smith introduces his regular guy super hero persona that he has regurgitated in every movie since,..(guys, acting means being a different person each movie). In general i got little impression of a sense of urgency or astonishment from the Hollywood pretenders, that ALIENS ARE INVADING!.It was impossible to overlook the countless obvious logical problems this movie had,... how did Smith know where to find his wife,... why did they have to get idiot volunteers to fight the aliens (the entire air force was gone, including retirees?),.. why didn't the missiles have the same explosive power each time as the final one,... how do you 'upload' a computer virus to an alien system without knowing their technology or protocol.There were just too many dumb script decisions,... Goldblum gets drunk and acts out because he's upset that fighting the aliens with Nuclear Weapons will hurt the environment(!), ...astoundingly idiotic,... The ""president"" decides to be a hero too, wow, there are no words to express how asinine that idea was,... The aliens have the technology to fly millions of light years in city sized ships yet they have to rely on our relatively archaic satellite systems in order to communicate with each other. I could go on and on and on.The fact that the entire premise or core idea of the movie was ridiculous, is no justification in glossing over obvious gaps in sense. Sci-fi movies are suppose to take us into fantasy, but not into stupidity. This movie was bad because not enough mental effort was put into it, quite typical of Hollywood. The sad truth is, that if this movie had been computer animated, say by Pixar, it would have been far more realistic and believable.",Independence Day
771,slywetfish,Let me tell you a story...,1,5 April 2009,"Once upon a time, Americans liked to elect morons as their presidents. This rather unfortunate phenomenon had the effect of prompting other morons to make films that justified the reign and actions of their moronic mentors. Independence Day, together with it's token tweeisms, heavily polished action - hero presidential figure, thinly disguised propagandist speeches and even the final 'We Wuz WRONG!' speech, the pretentiousness of which even an eight year old could see through, is a strong example of this. Humungous amounts of money were poured into this white elephant of a film - making project. $100 million I understand. No doubt financed by the kind of people whose interests it serves to nurture moronic qualities in the American public, these people had very clear ideas about how to use their bloated bank balances for the greater good. Hey guys, lets build some new, affordable social housing for the decent, hard - working (overworked) people of our nation. No. Okay. Lets build some new hospitals to provide the best possible care for the least privileged. Definitely not. Right. What about some more schools? How about channelling some funding into the most deprived, over - worked inner city schools? Don't be an ass. Err... okay. How about making an over - hyped, no - brainer scripted, shameless piece of hegemonic republican propagandist trash and wrap a bit of science fiction around it so all the geeks go?

It is a great movie for showing directly what it feels like to put aside petty differences for the time being. It reminds me of taking LSD: it takes for most people an extraordinarily strong entheogen like LSD to enter different ""spaces"" of expanded awareness; similarly, it takes an extraordinarily strong world event to bring people together.

776,iris_ayu,Independence Day- Two guys' cooperation,7,27 June 2010,"The two main factors of Independence Day are heroism and the spirit of unity. Actually these two factors are old acquaintances to many film-goers, but they can also move every person who watches this movie. Leading role can focus the power all over the world on saving the earth or human beings. This is the most excited thing in the world I think.Another theme which is usually talked in this sort of disaster movie is humanity. But there is a little in Independence Day, the shrinking violet Secretary of Defense, who is completely different with our young and energetic President Thomas J. Whitmore. Who can save the world? The answer is clear in every audience's heart I suppose.As for the golden combination, Captain Steven Hiller and David Levinson, they separately represent wisdom and courage. Two parts of a prefect saver. This method makes heroes more like an ordinary person by giving each part some weaknesses.David Levinson is a scientist without great aspirations. He has a simple life. He likes laying chess with his old father and riding bike. To him, the life now he has got is the one he wants the most, besides the part of he and his ex-wife. He has been in deep love with his wife even after they got divorced. His charming wife, Constance Spano, is a presidential assistant. Her busy work and his easy life make a sharp contrast in theirs daily life; this contrast is also the reason of their divorce. If Constance were not the Presidential assistant, I think David can't save the world because he has no chance to talk to the President. Captain Steven Hiller is an excellent soldier with a strong body and honesty. People would simply deem that Steven is a nice guy at the first sight of Will Smith's face. Jasmine Dubrow, Steven's girlfriend, who has a little boy and his father isn't Steven. Steven treats him like his own son. We can realize that in the scene of Steven went back to his base, he made a promise of setting fireworks after he accomplish his mission with that little boy. In the end of the final war, the boy watches the fireworks made up by remains of aliens' spaceship.One person breaks the code of aliens' communication and comes up with the idea of saving human beings, the other person has the ability of driving spacecraft, strong body to fight with a real alien and the courage to challenge unknown. These two guys make all the expectations come true. David's idea of beating aliens is implant virus into mother ship of aliens to make all spacecrafts 'get cold '. And it just comes from David's father's comforting words. From the very beginning, they two have no tacit understanding in the battle. I think their only tacit understanding is embracing their beloved woman as soon as possible after winning the war. Maybe love is the real theme of this disaster movie.We have another hero in this movie, the President. He wanted to be a President full of passion and energetic. But there was no opportunity before aliens' invasion of Earth. ""I'm a combat pilot, I belong in the air. "" This is my most memorable lines. Do you like this kink of president? A president attends a war in person, an act to inspire everyone's patriotism to protect their own nation. The President is a normal person, he loves his cute daughter. But he can not be an ordinary person because he is the President of the United States. He is responsible to the whole National; so he can't express his sorrow of wife's death completely.Aliens are poor, because they are usually beaten by American for strengthening National cohesion and proving the achievement in Special Effects. Everybody has a unique imagination of aliens, but most of them are aggressive. Nobody hates aliens; we all have sympathy for the weak and loathe aggressive part. If men invade other plant for its resource, audiences will also acclaim for men's failure. For example, in the movie Avatar, the audiences applaud for human beings' failure of invading Pandora.""Mankind, that word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united by our common interest. Perhaps its fate that today is 4th of July and you will once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression or persecution, but from annihilation. We are fighting for our right to live, to exist. And should we win the day, the fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declare in one voice we will not go quietly into the night, we will not vanish without a fight, we are going to live on, we are going to survive! Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!""This is president's exciting speech before the final war. And remember: we will not vanish without a fight, we are going to live on, and we are going to survive! Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!",Independence Day

It made me sad, sometimes a little scared, got me breathless many times, made me happy, and very, very EXCITED!Some of the lines even made me laugh. It was entertaining, suspenseful, had awesome effects and a lot of emotion, it was just so fun to watch that I'd love to do it again! :]So the question is, why do some people take it so seriously? Enjoy the freaking explosions, the epic virus and God, not to mention the Captain dragging the alien in his parachute to Area 51. This is not a serious movie, and it's perfect the way it is!

778,a_rm125,Great Action Film,7,16 December 2010,"In 1996 the movie Independence Day was released. Also known as ID4 this movie starts out with a scene of the first man on the moon and that the American's came in peace for all mankind. On July 2nd aliens from another planet enter the earth's atmosphere with their mother spaceship and many other smaller spacecraft attached. They plan to invade and destroy the world starting with all major cities. At first the Americans try to come in peace and send a message to the alien mother ship. They respond by blowing up the helicopter and all other surrounding aircraft. At this time president Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) learns by help of David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) that the aliens are using our own satellite system against us and will destroy the world in a short period of time. The president then orders everyone to leave the cities and prepare for destruction. Then the alien's strike they blow up and destroy major cities all around the world in their first attack. The United States set up a counter attack to destroy the mother ship when they learn that the alien space craft has a protective shield that none of our weapons can penetrate. U.S. air force captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is one of the only few survivors in this counter attack and he beings down a small alien space craft and captures an alien and brings him to a secret lab/ army base called area 51. The aliens continue destroying cities and president Whitmore is forced to engage in nuclear warfare with the aliens to destroy them. However the protective shield around the alien space craft cannot be penetrated by a nuclear bomb. Many of Americans have died at this point and the president and every other world leader is distressed. At this point David Levinson who figured out they were using the worlds satellite system against us realizes that the protective shield around the space craft's works off of an advanced computer system. By giving that system a computer virus the shield will be dropped and then the military can attack them. They plan an attack with the whole world on many different space craft because once the mother ship is infected with the virus then all the smaller ships will be also. Capitan Steven Hiller teams up with David and Steven will fly the recovered alien spacecraft from area 51 into the mother ship and David will implant the computer virus. The rest of able Americans and other pilots around the world are ready to attack. Once inside the mother ship Steven and David get locked in to the system and implant the virus. Their protective shields are now ineffective and the Americans begin to attack the smaller ships. They destroy them and then Capitan Hiller and David set off their nuclear bomb in the mother ship and they fly out in their spacecraft. The mother ship explodes into millions of pieces and David and Steven make a safe landing back on earth and return to their families. The aliens have been defeated. The central theme of this movie is heart and never giving up. The human race did not give up once on fighting for their freedom. Even after many counter attacks failed they proved that they were not going to go down without a fight and they all came together and worked together to save their world from destruction. Throughout this movie the sound effects of the explosions and the flying shrapnel and fire make this movie very realistic. After many counter attacks have failed you can see the distress on the president's face in a close up when he gives the order to nuke them. Overall this movie is very well written, action packed and very realistic. Watching this movie feels like you are really there and you become part of it because it is so intense. This was a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone.",Independence Day
779,AlvinBlah,"Take a second look, it's not that bad.",6,21 July 2003,"I have heard many people ripping into Independence Day as one of the worst films that they have seen in a long time, I disagree. In 1997 the film won an Academy Award for best visual effects, and was nominated for sound. For the time the CGI in this film was amazing, and the sound wasn't too bad, the nominations and awards were deserving. The film was also the movie that basically launched Will Smith's carreer into stardom, that says something too. I am having to write a college paper on the movie, which has caused me to watch the movie three times in one day, and I must say that the acting hold through the entire movie, and the storyline isn't as bad as one might initally think, The President isn't overly agressive, and violent minded, the aliens are obviously greatly superior, and there isn't too much time taken in Star Trek style explaining, rather the problems are shown to be solved or explained within the natural dialouge. Yeah, there are holes in the story, yeah this isn't the greatest movie ever made, and yeah some of the dialouge is corny, but remember it's an action movie, and made to be fun, not groundbreaking or earth shattering, just fun. And as a fun movie it has succeeded, when I saw Independence Day in theaters it was the last movie I ever saw where the audience actually cheered, when people cheer for characters how can it all be bad, besides, it's no Battlefield Earth...",Independence Day
780,davidmsika,Could this movie be anymore stupid?,1,8 August 2003,"If there was a contest to show one country's cliché and stereotypes in a feature film, and doing it without anyone involved in the creation process realizing it, I believe ID4 would win hands down.Everything in that movie reeks of stupidity...well, mostly the plotline and the dialog, but the actors go along with it and, even if it pays the rent (of their palaces) it must be hard sometimes to brush your morale standard under the rug for the brainlessness of that movie. To put things into perspective, since I write this comment almost seven years after the movie came out, I find it pretty amusing that this movie coins some of the most outrageous and ass-inine (hyphen on purpose) ideas ever developped for a motion picture such as using a mac to spread a computer virus onto an alien spacecraft, or showing aliens sustaining bullet wounds without so much as a blink and be knocked out for several hours with a single punch in the face or also - last one, I promise - the president of the US hopping into an f18 and flying like his last flight was yesterday...while no one questions why, yes WHY he knows how to fly one of these birds...In summary, I think ID4 deserves to be #1 of the bottom 100 chart. Yup, even worse than from Justin to Kelly because the latter is shameless and open about its mediocrity, riding on just enough hype to last through the summer and appeal to acne-ridden teens, but at least it's honest and it's not trying to treat the audience as a mindless pack of idiots incapable of realizing the 2 hour long shortcoming that ID4 represents. <rage fading>",Independence Day

OK, perhaps not the very worst, Godzilla was even worse, but it's still a terrible film. It should have been so good too. What better scenario could there be for a big budget sci-fi film than the invasion of the Earth by an alien race? It started off quite promisingly too, the first half hour was quite enjoyable. But then it deteriorates into typical Hollywood 'movie-making-by-numbers' drivel. There's the ridiculous comedy moments such as our hero Smith punching an alien after a spaceship crash, the washed-up, drunk ex-serviceman who will come good in the end to save the day, the implausible ending, etc, etc. The excruciatingly over sentimental scenes that all US films seem to insist on torturing the rest of us with (such as the scene with the president and his kid, or the nauseating speech to his troops) are almost unwatchable unless you have a particularly strong stomach or a handy bucket.

Start with a big, supposedly awe inspiring special effect of some destructive force(giant radioactive lizard, resurrected Egyptian sorcerer, devastating climate change, long dormant volcano becoming active in a major metropolitan area, newly sentient combat jet wreaking havoc on home soil, etc, etc, etc) . Then show people fleeing in terror from this force. Enter some young, handsome/beautiful protagonist who, unlike the herd of fleeing people who are unceremoniously slaughtered, survives the onslaught by virtue of, I don't know, their box office drawing power. Finally we come to the inevitable ""climactic"" conclusion where our hero manages to overcome/defeat this force by way of a completely implausible plot contrivance(in the case of this movie, a computer virus created by an earthling on an earth computer being uploaded to and working on an alien computer system). In order to enjoy these movies you have to forget all the movies exactly like it that have come before it and disable your higher reasoning abilities.

789,williamdebenham300,6.9 - Are you kidding me?! This is the pinnacle of global cinema!!,10,23 February 2014,"To rate Independence Day a 6.9 is an absolute travesty. The film set new benchmarks in the sci-fi genre and redefined the 4th of July celebration in the USA. To say that Will Smith's performance as a family man who dreams of becoming an astronaut is weak and one-dimensional, is an insult to any Oscar award ever won, both in the past and in the future. This film defined Will Smith's career and cemented him in history as the greatest actor there has ever been. Bill Pullman as the US President is a casting choice of pure genius and it would be fair to say that this is the greatest depiction of a Presidential role ever portrayed in a cinematic production. The President donning a jumpsuit and flying with his comrades to join the front line against the aliens epitomizes the sentiment of the founding fathers of the United States of America. Furthermore, it was this film, and this film alone, that inspired Barack Obama himself to run for office. Jeff Goldblum also gives an extraordinary performance that would indeed cause aliens to flock to Earth to witness his acting, had it not been for the outrageous 6.9 rating.To conclude, Independence Day is an artistic masterpiece and sheds light on the harrowing security flaws of our world. We now realise who can be counted on; Will Smith, Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum, and all thanks to the directing perfection of Mr Roland Emmerich. 10/10 and the rest.",Independence Day

Jeff Goldblum holds his own as always as the intelligent one, and Will smith will always be an excellent comic relief and action character, the film portrays an array of other wonderful actors, even the amazingly talented Harry Connick Jr. has a small but well played part in the film.

Not too scary for the little ones and still enough exploding landmarks to keep even the most twisted inner child entertained for the 2 1/2 hours.No, the Empire State Building wasn't portrayed technically accurate, and you can see strings attached to the aliens in a couple of shots, but they look more realistic for the closeups than some Shrekian Toy story ""Space Edition"" like some of the other sci-fi movies of late.CGI aliens all look like video games instead of movies and ID4 really had that slimy, natural alien look and feel judging from the generous heaping of oozing secretions while Data does his Alien Autopsy (Brent Spiner from Star Trek NG plays one of the socially inept scientists living sheltered at area 51).I've seen ID4 hundreds of times, and it is still better than the remake of War of the Worlds done almost a decade later.-HW",Independence Day
798,nicely-73758,"Loved the original movie, not so with versions circulating now.",4,25 March 2017,I enjoyed this movie in 1996 but the version they are showing on TV now is missing a lot of detail and has been edited to be almost unrecognizable. It's a darn shame what has been done to this movie. It has been horribly edited and misses some truly potent scenes. Very disappointed.,Independence Day
799,jakenbake_5,some good sfx in one of he worst movies of all time,2,17 April 2006,"I'm assuming that the tag 'one of the biggest grossing films of all time' is a typo and they really mean one of the grossest films ever made i am by no means anti American but the flag waving patriotism here is stomach churning, the dialogue pathetic and the characters and coincidences so unbelievable as to render any suspension of disbelief impossible.2 stars for some good special effects- if you must see this steaming pile of crap fast forward through all but the sfx set pieces -what a waste of time ,money and some very fine actors ( Jeff goldblum, will smith, Mary McDonnell )",Independence Day
800,mgsomaonline,Fantastic movie i have ever seen,8,16 May 2017,This movie is basically related to aliens who want to come on earth and want to take their wisdom on earth. For that they also torture the human beings. The actor john smith's role as aircraft pilot is very impressive. ALL characters are look like a real and i have enjoyed very much watching this movie. It also give us a message to work for our country or human beings.,Independence Day
801,mommyrosey,First Rate Sci-Fi,8,26 October 2005,"This movie, as correctly perceived as a modern ""War of the Worlds"", still has me glued to the TV whenever it is on. The plot and FX are especially good even though the movie is riddled with errors during its making. The choice of actors really worked for this movie.Some people outside of the United States have not seen it as just entertainment unfortunately. Considering the movie was made with American dollars and in Hollywood, would it not make sense that the heroes would be American? Should they have been from the Nederlands (a fine country, by the way)? Wherever a film industry is located the heroes represent that country. Should Mad Max have been Chinese?From a pure point of entertainment ""independence Day"" satisfies. It was apparently filmed for the U.S. market in mind but, of course, given to the world for entertainment and nothing more.",Independence Day
802,tsavi,It is the best movie!!!,10,14 November 2005,"I think that this movie is great. I liked this movie because I'm into all the high tech command centers and military and things like that. Ronald is a very talented director and i think his newest film ""The day after tomorrow"" is another, Hollywood, big budget film. I really think that his films are great. I highly recommend anyone who likes action and science fiction to watch this film. I can't see why other people may not like it. I do not know who wrote the music but i think that the music along with the special effects were tops!!The only criticism i have is- we should be able to see more of the aliens. Everyone should watch this movie. It's the best!!!!!!!!",Independence Day
803,jbpoff,"Amazing script, amazing acting, amazing screenplay...",9,15 October 2006,"ID4 easily stands as one of the best of the 90's, a time when sci-fi and patriotism were not easily accepted.How does one appeal to the masses screaming for realism? First, barrage them with a cast of competent, well-known actors. Now that you have everyone's attention, actually follow through with a script meant to encompass each and every one of those actors. This is where most movies fail, sometimes miserably, but not Independence Day. Must-see movie for anybody willing to keep an open mind. Remember, it's just pretend.I have only one complaint, (which is extremely rare, believe me) and that is the acting of Harvey Fierstein. Almost comparable to that of Jake Lloyd (Anakin Skywalker). Almost.",Independence Day
804,hiroefujita,Save the world!,6,7 January 2006,"Independence Day, the film represents one of the typical American national characters with a simple way. Aliens attack our earth in order to take our freedom. First, the President of United States hopes that it is the best way of living to develop a friendship between aliens and mankind. However, the attackers continue to invade the earth. There are no hopes for our children in their future. Therefore, we, the Americans, have to fight against the enemies.This film contains several interesting points of the present world situation. People make an effort to create a good relationship between each countries but we have not found the answer yet. As a result, people have been killed at this moment unfortunately. I like this film because it shows the possibility to make a blight future for us. It cannot be always seen a happy end for everyone, but we can challenge to create the new world. This film gives us some energy to find the way. The positive attitude is the most important for us to break down the bad circumstance. I felt that I could save the world after I saw this film.",Independence Day
