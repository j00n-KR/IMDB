0,TheLittleSongbird,Brilliant family entertainment!,9,16 November 2009,"While I try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, I do think the rating for this film is too low. The film is absolutely fantastic in all departments. I will admit, there are some bits that are quite scary due to some scenes that are amazingly dark. The film does start off slowly, but when the film fast forwards to twenty six years later, the film turns into fast-paced family entertainment. Other than one or two scary scenes and the slow beginning, I could find very little wrong with Jumanji. The story is great, very intriguing and filled with humour, scares and poignancy. The cinematography and scenery are constantly breathtaking, and the special effects are extraordinary. The film is aided by a hilarious and poignant script, spirited direction, atmspheric music and the fact that it goes at a very fast pace. Even the acting was great, with Robin Williams in one of his best performances as Alan Parrish. While he is subtle in places, the director allows him to be funny, which is what he does best. Bonnie Hunt is good too and she and Williams have great chemistry, and Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst are cute and lively. Plus the ending is nice and satisfying. All in all, I love this movie, even with its very minor problems, it is non-stop fast paced family entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Jumanji
1,Leofwine_draca,Passable at best,5,23 April 2018,"I remember when JUMANJI first came out back in 1995. I was 14 at the time and much more interested in the books of Stephen King and movies like THE EVIL DEAD than watching a kid's film like this. Now, more than twenty years later, I've finally got around to watching it and I have to say that I'm less than impressed. This is one of the movies that helped usher in the 'CGI adventure' template of the family-friendly Hollywood blockbuster. A couple of kids find a magic boardgame and play it, with the end result that they release a bunch of CGI jungle creatures which rampage around their house. The film has a slick look to it and it doesn't help that the CGI has dated badly over the years, with the monkeys looking particularly bad. The story itself is extremely limited and features some cheesy sentimentalising. There are some funny moments courtesy of Robin Williams, who just about holds things together with his usual brand of madcap high-energy overacting, but this is passable at best.",Jumanji
2,SnoopyStyle,wild CGI destruction gets repetitive,6,22 May 2015,"In 1869, two boys bury a mysterious dangerous wooden chest. In 1969 Brantford, New Hampshire, young Alan Parrish gets picked on by bullies. He finds the box in a local construction site. He opens the chest to find a board game Jumanji. His father is sending him to boarding school. He is about to run away when his best friend Sarah Whittle comes by. They play the game and Alan is pulled into the board game. Twenty six years later, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) buys the rundown mansion planning to open a bed-and-breakfast. She brings her niece Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter (Bradley Pierce) who lost their parents in a car accident. The kids find the board game in the attic and start playing it. Alan (Robin Williams) is released. They track down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) to finish the game and bring all the released apparitions to an end. Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) was a friend who worked at Alan's shoe factory and is now a cop. The game brings out big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) who looks like Alan's father Sam.The basic idea of a board game that comes alive is one with great possibilities. I wish that it is more than just a series of crazy CGI destruction. I wish that the players needed to use their brain power to solve clues. The constant escaping from one thing to the next gets a little bit repetitive. They start piling on top of one another. Williams is not quite as lovable as expected. Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier are kind of fun. There is an uncontrolled quality to this children's movie.",Jumanji
3,Hitchcoc,Quite a Lot of Rapid Movement,8,29 December 2016,"I worked for several years at a bookstore. I remember when the children's book ""Jumanji"" came in. The book jacket with the reckless monkeys was very catchy. It was a very short book, so I have a feeling that some liberties were taken with the plot. There had to be a ton of extrapolation. This is a rapid fire movie which at times takes a bit of industry to keep up with. There are rules to the game and for me, they are very hard to follow. There is also a time element that is in play here. Robin Williams, as usual, plays his character to the hilt. The kids are pretty good as well. I'm sure this would appeal to a younger audience. There is no time for attention spans to expire. The computer generated graphics are wonderful, to be sure. Those monkeys are really the stars of the show.",Jumanji
4,boblipton,Welcome To The Jungle,8,31 January 2021,"Despite the revival of the title, and the pleasantly updated remakes, the 1995 version of Jumanji remains a movie I can look at when I want something fun and undemanding. While there are some problems with it, including the CGI that looked fake even back then, and some lameness in the improvised wrangling between Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, it has Williams near his peak, Kirsten Dunst during her child acting phase, Bebe Neuwirth - not enough of her - and some pleasant Peter Pan symbolism with Jonathan Hyde playing Both Williams' father and the hunter trying to kill him. In other words, there's a moral to the story that actually works.Most though, it's the good humor of the piece, alternating with the inexplicable cartoon violence, like when monkeys ravage David Alan Grier's patrol car, when vines drag it off, or when Miss Neuwirth makes her way home, only to find the house reduced to a jungle mess. Everyone works hard, the show operates almost all the time, and if it's not great cinema, it's well made cinematic junk food of the happiest sort",Jumanji
5,Prismark10,Jumanji,6,20 February 2020,"Joe Johnston won an Oscar for special effects for Raiders of the Lost Ark. His directorial career is very much to make entertainment movies like his mentor Steven Spielberg.Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and Rocketeer are Spielberg type movies with heavy reliance on effects.Jumanji was released in 1995 and carries the CGI monster mayhem of Jurassic Park. Yet look closely and you can see elements of Gremlins, Back to the Future, there is even some Home Alone.Jumanji is a devilish board game that young Alan Parrish plays one night in 1969 and he disappears. Twenty six years later, two children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) find the board game in the attic of the Parrish's former home they have moved into.As they start playing it, strange things happen and the adult Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) returns. The game unleashes mayhem in their town such as a lion, mangy monkeys, dangerous plant life and a stampede of rhinos and elephants. A big game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) is also looking for Alan and they must play on until the game finishes.Jumanji is adapted from a book. It is a strange mixture that is aimed at children but has dark themes among the zany action. Judy and Peter have recently lost their parents. Alan was bullied and lacked parent love from his father.The movie has some uneasy violence. I never understood why Van Pelt was hunting Alan but at one point he goes to a gun shop and swaps his hunting rifle for a lethal top of the range one.It is a big effects driven film but Jumanji the movie itself lacks coherence.",Jumanji
6,claudio_carvalho,Dangerous Boarding Game,7,19 June 2015,"In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called ""Jumanji"" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan's father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. ""Jumanji"" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90's. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Jumanji""",Jumanji
7,classicsoncall,"""What do you mean, the game thinks?""",7,15 October 2021,"What are the odds? The last movie I watched and reviewed here was ""One Hour Photo"" with Robin Williams; in it, his character's name was Seymour Parrish. In this one, he's Alan Parrish. It would have been a stretch, but in the movie released in 2002, wouldn't it have been weird if Alan changed his name to Seymour, and his mental disorder been blamed on going crazy in ""Jumanji""? I know, kind of dumb, but it's stuff like that I think about.Well, I went about this the wrong way. I watched 2019's ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" a few months before this one. I had never seen the original when it was first released, but it was made convenient by showing up on Netflix, so I figured I'd give it a try. I thought the picture was fairly entertaining, making for a nice evening of family entertainment. For 1995, the CGI was pretty good, except for those darn monkeys, they just looked weird. The stampeding jungle animals were exceptionally well done, along with all those creepy vines reaching out to trap unsuspecting participants in the board game. After a while, the action gets kind of frenetic and somewhat repetitious, but all the players held up their end well.I guess my next move would be to check out the films that came out in between this one and 'Next Level'. No rush, but it would be interesting to fill in the gaps.",Jumanji
8,gavin6942,A Fun Family Adventure,7,6 January 2016,"A young martial artist is caught between respecting his pacifist father's wishes or stopping a group of disrespectful foreigners from stealing precious artifacts.I believe I first saw this film when it came out in theaters, and it left a pretty good impact on me. Even culturally, I feel like it has left its mark because people still remember this one -- even if they have never seen it. The idea of a board game that takes on a life of its own is brilliant, and well-executed here.Apparently this film was seen as the next step in CGI following ""Jurassic Park"". Arguably, ""Jurassic"" is still better, but it probably had the bigger budget. For the mid-1990s, these are some great animal effects. Rarely are they surpassed today, and generally we see things much worse (yes, I mean you, SyFy network).Bonus: Kirsten Dunst before most people knew who she was (though I believe this was still after ""Interview with the Vampire"").",Jumanji
9,lee_eisenberg,I guess that life is a game of chance!,7,14 October 2005,"You know the drill: young Alan Parrish gets sucked into a board game called Jumanji, returns when a brother and sister are playing 26 years later, and has to battle the animals that wreak havoc on the town. It all seems pretty simple, but they play some neat tricks with it in the movie. As the adult Alan, Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but still makes the character admirable. With good support from Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and Patricia Clarkson, this is a pretty interesting movie. I will admit that the monkeys looked pretty fake, but we can't dwell on that in this movie; the point is to enjoy oneself while watching it.Oh and one more thing: from ""Jumanji"", I learned the difference between alligators and crocodiles.",Jumanji
10,jboothmillard,Jumanji,8,9 September 2005,"I used to love this film as a kid, it was and still is a really good fun family film, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids; Jurassic Park III). It is basically about a board game with a life of its own that can transport the players into the terrible and some scary parts of the jungle. It is 1969, and young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds this board game, Jumanji, in a building site, not too far away from the show factory owned by his father, Samuel (Jonathan Hyde), and starting the game with his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) is soon sucked into the game, while Sarah runs away being chased by its African bats. 26 years later, Aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) with her niece and nephew Judy (Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (The Borrowers' Bradley Pierce) have bought the old Parrish house. Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game. While playing they encounter hunter Van Pelt (Hyde again), monkeys, Peter turns into a monkey for cheating, a stampede of many large animals, rapid growing poisonous and hungry plants, quick sand, a lion, crocodiles, mosquitoes, spiders and an earthquake. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!",Jumanji
11,ccthemovieman-1,Maybe The Best Ever For Just Pure Entertainment,10,17 February 2006,"Among the thousands of films I have viewed, this movie would rank near the top for sheer entertainment. That's not saying it's the best-made or most intelligent or scariest or funniest or features the best effects, etc. etc. But combine all those and you have a film that's tough to beat when you're looking for 100 minutes of escapist fun.The film features some wild computer-enhanced special effects that were new to its day, but now about 10 years later, it's no big deal. In fact, some of it, such as the lion, look pretty hokey compared to the stuff that's out there now. To me, it was story that was the lure, anyway, not the special effects.Because it's so much fun, this is one of the fastest-moving films I've ever viewed. The time flies by. It's not to be analyzed or given much thought, because it's so ludicrous. You just go along for the wild ride in this fantasy-adventure and get a bunch of laughs and thrills along the way. That's one of the big attractions of this of film: the excellent combination of adventure and comedy.Are there annoying things in this movie? Sure. To me, it was Bonnie Hunt's occult beliefs and too many OMGs and the overdone character of the hunter (Jonathan Hyde). Other than that, I loved the film the first I saw it and every time afterward. I've probably viewed this movie as much as any, simply because it was so entertaining.Robin Williams, David Alan Grier and the two kids, Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce, were all great people to watch and share this adventure with. Now THIS is entertainment!",Jumanji
12,BA_Harrison,A treat for fans of family fantasy fun.,8,24 February 2008,"As a child, Alan Parrish becomes trapped inside Jumanji, a magical board game he finds discovers buried in a building site. 26 years later, Judy and Peter Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce), two orphaned kids living with their aunt, discover the game in the attic of their new home and begin to play, freeing the now-grown-up Alan (Robin Williams) in the process. Unfortunately, they also release a host of dangerous animals, deadly plants, and an unstoppable bloodthirsty hunter. Their only hope of survival is to finish the game, whatever the risks.Action packed, funny, heartwarming and even a little scary in places, Jumanji is an excellent family adventure for the whole family, and one that, thankfully, doesn't rely solely on its special effects to impress (a good job, since quite a bit of the CGI is looking rather dated). The story is engaging (with a nice time-travel style twist at the end), the cast is great (with Williams managing to give one of his less irritating performances), and once again director Joe Johnston delivers a final product that, whilst not a classic, is still thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Jumanji
13,moonspinner55,Recommended only to those who find elephant destruction awe-inspiring,1,9 July 2001,"It took four--count 'em, FOUR--screenwriters to conjure up this adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg's book about a man imprisoned in a supernatural board-game, freed by two precocious tots, setting off a chain-reaction of incredible disasters. Muddy, confused sideshow is mindlessly busy, held together for the most part by the special effects. The film is slickly designed to appeal to hyperactive kids, yet it hasn't an ounce of brains--or any sensitivity to the humans or animals involved. Directed in a soulless, sledgehammer style by Joe Johnston and starring Robin Williams, sadly at his lowest ebb. * from ****",Jumanji
14,dbdumonteil,a game not like the other ones,6,11 June 2003,"""Jumanji"" is a quite original movie which the main attraction are outstanding special effects. They're extracted from a fair screenplay that becomes a little diabolical when it shows us the rules of the game ""jumanji"" and when the fierce creatures appear suddenly. It's a pity that the director, Joe Johnston doesn't emphasize enough on the dramatical side of the story and on the dangerous side of the game. Moreover, he obviously meant to tell this story in a comedy tone. It's a good idea but not very well exploited. You especially laugh when the sheriff appears and when he makes blunders. He's only a decorative character who plays a minor role in the plot. It doesn't stop the movie to contain irresistible moments. At the end, this movie is a good entertainment that remains confined to a plain familial comedy.",Jumanji
15,michaelRokeefe,This game is like no other.,5,10 December 2002,"Roll doubles and look out.  Elaborate special effects highlight this tale about two kids who release an imprisoned player trapped for decades in a supernatural board game. Story line is quite stupid, but this is so much fun to watch. Robin Williams does his thing. A young Kirsten Dunst is charming in this preview of her future talents. Rounding out this mish-mash of a cast are: Bebe Neuwirth, David Alan Grier, Bradley Pierce, Bonnie Hunt and Jonathan Hyde in a dual role. Special effects and sight gags are redeeming.",Jumanji

17,hitchcockthelegend,"Throw the dice and take a turn, Jumanji made the critics gurn.",7,4 September 2010,"Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and based on Chris Van Allsburg's short story of the same name. It stars Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Jonathan Hyde. The story is about a weird board game that when played unleashes hazards from the jungle with every throw of the dice. Once you have started playing you have to finish the game for normality to be resumed.Simple in plot and coming off as an excuse to show off some impressive effects - said the critics - Jumanji defied the critics of the time to become a box office winner and a family favourite. Enough of a favourite to spawn a sequel (Zathura 2005), an animated TV series and a board game. In truth the film is reliant on the effects to entertain, with the cast (all competent and enjoyable) merely lurching from one perilous throw of the dice to another. But to call the film shallow is wrong and ignorant. There's flecks of bad parenting, peer pressure, grief and bullying, while the impact of a missing child on one town is a noteworthy addition to the story line. You wonder if those critics actually paid attention during their free viewings?Yes it's berserker family fun, but it's not without worth in the writing either. Besides which, for the action set pieces and the laughs, they alone mean the film has its merits. 7/10",Jumanji
18,poolandrews,Very enjoyable fantasy adventure.,6,16 March 2010,"Jumanji starts in 1969 in New Hampshire in New England where a young boy named Alan Parish (Adam Hann-Byrdd) & his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy) starts playing a strange board game called Jumaji that Alan found buried in the ground earlier, Jumanji turns out to be magical & Alan is sucked into the board game while Sarah runs off. Twenty six years later & it's 1995 & Alan's old house has been empty for years until now, until young brother & sister Judy (Kirsten Dunst) & Peter (Bradley Pierce) move in with their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), the two youngsters find the Jumanji game & start playing it themselves as all manner of creatures & climate events begin to appear as does Alan (Robin Williams) who has spent the last twenty six years trapped inside Jumanji & is now an adult. The only way to reverse the effects of Jumanji is to finish the game so with a now adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) the four players must battle whatever Jumanji throw's at them including Lions, Monsoon's, giant Spider's & a stampede...Girected by former special effects man Joe Johnston this oddball fantasy adventure is actually pretty good but there are one or two things that ultimately drag it down to merely a very good film rather than a great film in my opinion. Based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsberg the film is apparently quite different & the two main character's here Alan & Sarah don't even appear in the book, Jumanji is a hard film to categorise as it mixes various ideas & themes like a bad childhood, finding redemption, standing up to your fears, fantasy, sci-fi, horror & comedy. At 100 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace, once it gets going the situation just keeps getting worse & worse as all the chaos & mayhem escalates beyond anyone's control with all sorts of animals running around & the theme of facing your fears is an ever present one. I am not sure there is another film quite like Jumanji & to find something so original & different in a mainstream film is unusual but the CGI effects scenes, the lack of character depth, the refusal to do anything with the plot other than destroy a house & an ultra happy ending which goes on forever that gives every character in the film the best most happy ending is pure Hollywood that was not needed & a slightly darker ending in keeping with the slightly darker tone of the film overall would have been much better. To be honest apart from great set-pieces & the basic concept there's really not that much to Jumanji at all, it's rather shallow & it's attempts at depth are pure heavy handed Hollywood cliché but it's fun & very entertaining while it lasts, just a shame about the last ten minutes really.Jumanji was made just as the CGI computer graphic revolution was taking off back in the mid 90's but the effects do hold up rather well actually, from huge plants to an impressive stampede of Rhino's & Elephant's through a house to a huge Lion with the mischievous Monkey's probably the only real weak effect. As a fairly light hearted fantasy adventure with some darker overtones there's a few amusing moments including a bemused policeman who's car is slowly & systematically trashed & as a whole the film delights in needless destruction & mayhem which is no bad thing. There are some laughs & a few scares as well & I could definitely see Jumanji appealing to both older & younger audiences.With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 this had a very healthy amount spent on it with most going towards the effects I would have thought. Filmed in New Hampshire & British Columbia in Canada. Despite being known as a manic performer Robin Williams is pretty restrained here & his brand of psychical comedy isn't used much, Kirsten Dunst is one of the few child stars to go on & have a successful adult career while the acting generally is pretty good.Jumanji is a unique fantasy adventure that I think would appeal to both children & adults, my only real problem is the sweeter than sweet happier than happy ending which is pure sentimental Hollywood at it's worst. With an ending more in keeping with the rest of the film Jumanji might have got a seven from but as it is it gets a six, good but not great.

Years later, two more children find the game and continue where Alan left off.This film takes a simple idea and fills it with wonderfully executed fantasy. The CGI - this was one of the earliest films to contain extensive computer generated effects, principally to bring various animals to life - still holds up well, but the excitement generated by the rapidly deteriorating circumstances of the protagonists takes second place to the character progression of Alan, his friend Sarah (as an adult) and Peter and Judy, the later children.All the performers do well, but Robin Williams excels in a part which particularly suits his barely reined in mania.Jumanji has heart, and is a hugely entertaining family movie.",Jumanji

Every dice roll erupts something new from its supernatural fury. In 1969 Alan Parrish is sucked into the game before a friend's eyes. 26 years later he returns thanks to two kids who inhabit the house with their caseworker and discover the game. Intriguing plot boils down to images that descend from the game. Monkeys, lions, elephants, rhinos, spiders, crocodiles, thunder, and a game hunter seeking Alan's life. Repetitious with inventive production but perhaps too scary for young children. Directed by Joe Johnston who previously made The Rocketeer. Robin Williams as Parrish pulls through due too established background information that led to his trauma. Bonnie Hunt succeeds because her fear seems real. She enclosed herself against society until she is reluctantly recruited for the game. Against it is the film's conclusion where Williams and Hunt know perhaps too much. Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst are the standard children that are merely targets for whatever emerges from the game. Jonathan Hyde has duo roles both as the father of the children as well as the safari hunter, but neither role sparks much life. Ideal take on board games and a theme of fear that accompanies each role of the dice. Score: 6 / 10",Jumanji

Not only does it hold up, but my appreciation for the film may be higher now than ever. Having everything you could want in a film; a great premise, lovely characters and they're journey through the story, with splendid acting by all parties and an abundance of heart. Williams and Hunt have terrific chemistry and I absolutely love the resolution. Having them get to go back and re-live their lives together and wanting to meet those who helped them make it possible.I love everything about the board game in the film.

In fact, I always thought Mork and Mindy was where he did his best comedy. This movie is about a boy who disappeared while playing a board game. His sister who was playing at the time saw him disappear into said game and is basically a bit crazy later in her life thanks to this incident. Two children find and play this game one day and to their surprise the boy who disappeared has reappeared thanks to a roll of the dice. They now have to continue to play the game as things begin to pelt them, animals run amok, and a determined continually hunts the foursome down. The effects are okay for the time, but they are the type of effects that are in to many movies these days. The type that looks like they are there, but at the same time they do not. The comedy is okay, Robin Williams does not get as worked up in this one as he usually does in his films and you also get to see a young Kristen Dunst. This one coming out after her appearance in Interview with a Vampire. David Alan Grier also stars as a cop who gets caught up in the game as near the end the game really begins to cause quite a lot of chaos. Still, it is an effects driven family film so the story is a bit shallow.

27,JamesHitchcock,Exciting Family Adventure,7,30 December 2008,"In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called ""Jumanji"", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished.Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human.The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like ""Dead Poet's Society"" or ""Good Morning, Vietnam""- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality.This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor.Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the ""Narnia"" stories).Fortunately, any moralising in ""Jumanji"" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of ""alternative timelines"". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10",Jumanji
28,Smells_Like_Cheese,A fun and adventure filled film fit for the whole family!,8,29 November 2003,"I just used to love ""Jumanji"" as a kid. This was what was Oscar worthy to me, because I loved the special effects and Robin Williams. Even though I think I over did it with the Oscar worthy thoughts, still to this day I enjoy ""Jumanji"". It's a great family film that will make you feel good and have fun with.Robin Williams plays Alan, a boy who when he was little and had a horrible fight with his father plays a game with his friend, Sarah, and the game happens to be cursed causing Alan to get sucked into the game until someone else plays it. Sarah freaking out by just what happened runs home and no one believes her leaving Alan behind for decades in the game. When a new family moves in, Judy and Peter and their Aunt Nora, they find the game and start playing and release Alan who has just survived decades in a jungle. When they realize that they must finish the game to make the horrible curses it brings go away, they find Sarah who is now the town loony, and must play it 'til they finish. But can they do that with all the spiders, elephants, lions, tsunami, vines, stampedes, and an angry hunter? You'll just have to wait and see.This is a great movie for the family and I'd highly recommend it for a good watch. It's just a fun fill adventure with great effects and some fun performances by Robin and Bonnie and a very young Kirsten Dunst. So sit back, grab the popcorn, and enjoy ""Jumanji""! 8/10",Jumanji
29,MovieAddict2016,"An excellent family entertainment achievement, with the keyword family, not just kids.",9,17 August 2002,"The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children's book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die!Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter  I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families.",Jumanji

The horde of other dangers released from the game like runaway wild animals, gigantic mosquitoes and pesky bats can only be stopped when they finish playing the game. Alan Parrish (Robin Williams), Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst), Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) and Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) are the four main characters playing and trying to finish the game, but as each of their turn passes, new dangers are released from the game. This leads to an endless supply of wild adventure, thrilling chase scenes, and crazy comic relief (i.e., monkeys driving a motorcycle). These nonstop action are highlighted by incredible special and visual effects. Serving as co-stars are the kids' aunt Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) and police officer Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier), who are unfortunate enough to get caught right in the middle of all the chaotic events surrounding the board game. This lead to hilarious scenes and priceless reactions from the two as they see the dangers like giant crocodiles and man-eating plants before them.

34,Lejink,Not board,6,28 August 2014,"Watched this on TV where it was aired as a tribute to the late Robin Williams. It's an enjoyable family-entertainment fantasy adventure with Williams playing a grown man who as a boy was sucked into a mysterious, dark board game called Jumanji, freed years later by a couple of young children who happen upon the game when they move into Williams's character by this time run-down house. Along with Williams also fully-grown girl friend of the time Kirsten Dunst, the four of them brave everything the game throws at them to finish it and free Williams to return to his old life.And does the game throw everything at them! Crazy monkeys, a roaring lion, a jungle which comes to life, hordes of stampeding elephants zebras and rhinos and one very persistent big game hunter. A veritable special effects fest, while the plot amounts to no more than awaiting the outcome of the next roll of the dice on the board, it all makes for good clean exciting fun and who amongst us as never enjoyed playing a board game as a child. The back stories about Williams being bullied as a child, having a fractious relationship with his dad and his adult wooing of Dunst are lightly drawn but all of course resolved happily ever after by the end.Williams is fine after he makes his delayed first appearance, portraying yet again a child trapped in a man's body just as he did in a line going back through Peter Pan in ""Hook"", ""Popeye"" all the way to his breakout part in ""Mork and Mindy"". Dunst offers good support and the kids aren't too gauche and sentimental either. Nice to see ""Cheers"" Bebe Neuwirth get a decent part too.I wouldn't call it Robin Williams defining role but as an update on the old children's matinée features, this was an entertaining feature made the better by Williams engaging performance.

35,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Some interesting ideas aren't ever fully explored, but there's still fun to be had here.",5,10 April 2018,"There's some interesting stuff in 'Jumanji (1995)', mainly surrounding the melancholic situations of the two now adult players of the eponymous game. These are people who are both scarred in their own way after having their childhoods uniquely stolen by the seemingly 'fun' thing they're now forced to revisit. These themes are never fully explored, however, even to the point of being bizarrely backtracked upon. As such, the piece never properly lives up to its potential, an issue persistent across all of its motifs and even its mythology. It seems strange for the central conceit to revolve around a board-game when it wasn't a pre-existing property and even the characters in the wholly unnecessary, mystery-and-tone killing 1960s-set prologue claim to not have played one for five years. It also barely feels as though it has real any impact on the proceedings of the plot, despite the fact that it's its sole driving force. The occasional set-piece is still somewhat fun, though, even if most of the effects fall flat in retrospect and the flick is generally all over the place. 5/10",Jumanji
36,g-bodyl,A Dazzling Film!,9,21 October 2008,"I liked Jumanji. It is way better than I thought it would be. The story starts out with the burying of a game in 1869. It is then uncovered by a boy named Alan, 100 years later. As he is playing it, he gets sucked into the game until someone rolls a 5 or an 8. That happened 26 years later. Now along with two kids and a woman who was playing the game with Alan in 1969, Alan has to finish the game despite all the creatures appearing out of the game. The special effects are amazing. They were effective and used well. The acting is decent. Robin Williams did a good job as he usually does. I did think that Hunter Van Pelt could've been more realistic. The music is pretty good.

38,lesleyharris30,"Inspired Performances mostly make up for a Mediocre Screenplay,",7,24 November 2015,"Jumangi is a good movie with a reasonably well written storyline and a fantastic cast. It's an entertaining film that boasts a fun and unique storyline that the kids will certainly enjoy, even if the effects are outdated, and the performances can be appreciated by all ages, Robin Williams delivers a very dedicated performance, which shows how great of an actor he really is, he easily could have phoned it in for a film like this, but he refused, his scenes with Bonnie Hunt are the films highlight, their chemistry is outstanding and brought this film from a six to a seven for me. As far as the story goes, it's very mediocre, it moves too slowly for a while, and suddenly too much is happening all at once, it tends to drag on certain plot points and relies on bringing the characters back to the board game too frequently. The characters are poorly developed and none of them are a single bit relatable, the film gets too dedicated to its weird plot that it dosen't take the time to make the four main characters human, we are given very little information about their life before they discovered Jumangi, and because of that it makes their journey a lot less compelling. It's jam packed with flaws and kids will certainly enjoy it more than adults, but Jumangi still has this irresistible thing about it that makes it a lot of fun to watch, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film, for Robin Williams alone, it's worth the watch. Two kids must finish a dangerous board game with the help of two adults in order to save the world from its destruction. Best Performance: Robin Williams",Jumanji
39,A_Different_Drummer,No No No -- its a 10,10,31 December 2013,"This is one of those films which sort of faded into obscurity at time of release but will I believe over time be considered a classic. I have seen it over a dozen times. And, for the purposes of this review, the reason I mention that fact is to ask the obvious question... why? And the why is because of the narrative. It is nearly perfect. Heck, it may even be perfect. If you are going to create a hi-CGI fantasy about children, geared to the child within (so to speak) you need to jump down the rabbit-hole is a convincing way, so that there is no hope of return. This is the essence of every good ""fantasy"" from the beginning of time, from Peter Pan to Alice In the Looking Glass to the Matrix. Once you are in, it is hard to get out. And that hooks the audience. What better way to establish such a narrative than a kid's game with ""turns"" and ""dice""? Where each roll gets you in deeper? Also a great chance to watch to watch Robin Williams and Dunst before he/she became too old to play these roles; and Bonnie Hunt (great!) before her film career imploded.Postscript 12/14 -- with the recent passing of Robin Williams I wanted to add the following, especially after another viewing. First, it is one of the most perfect fantasies Hollywood has done since the invention of color film (keeping in mind that the best fantasies hail from the 30s and 40s). Second, and I know his fans will not agree, possibly Williams' best work. Early in his career, and he got a chance to play a boy in a man's body. Is there a more perfect role for him?? Hunt did not have what you would call a wide or varied film career but she is pitch perfect here, and matches Williams note for note, emotion for emotion. And Kirsten Dunst, another controversial figure, seems to have had a backwards career, with her impact dwindling as she aged. The highlight of her career may have been kissing Spiderman, but her face holds the camera here in every scene she is in, and she too is pitch perfect. Massively un-appreciated, one of the greatest films in its genre ever, right up there with Harry Potter or Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast.",Jumanji

From this perspective, the film is outdated and naive, but still quite fun. Robin Williams does not shine with his full splendor, but he is certainly better than in ""Night at the Museum"", with which this film has a lot of similarities. Kirsten Dunst is very good in one of her first major roles, but just one year after ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" this role is too bleak to leave a stronger impression. I didn't see all of her movies, but from what I did, the role of Claudia is unquestionably her best and I doubt she could ever outclass it.

42,ironhorse_iv,It's time to play the game. You can't move until somebody roll 5 or 8.,7,3 January 2013,"Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. ""Jumanji"" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.",Jumanji
43,The-Sarkologist,An entertaining adventure movie,6,20 May 2013,"The thing that grabs people about this movie is the computer effects. They are supposed to be of a very high quality and very realistic. I must digress at this point because when I saw this movie recently I discovered that the effects were not as great as they are made out to be. In fact, the lion looked quite out of proportion and the monkeys looked quite fake. I think that they pushed themselves to a point where they could not do any better.Even though some of the effects were quite irritating, I did enjoy Jumanji. It is an adventure movie with everything, a stampede, deadly insects, lions, floods, earthquakes, and even a psychotic hunter with a very big gun. What makes this adventure movie different is that it is not set in the middle of Africa but rather in a quiet New England town, that is quiet until all of these things are unleashed upon it.The film begins in 1969 where little Alan Parrish is running away from bullies. He goes to his father's factory and notices a chest in one of the construction sites. Opening the chest he finds the game Jumanji. He takes it back home and plays it with his friend at which he promptly disappears. Fifteen years later, another two children find the game and decide to play it and release poor Alan Parrish. Having done that they realise that they must finished the game and revert everything back to normal.The interesting thing that I see in this movie is the difference in the time between 1969 and 1995. In 1969 everything is nice and everybody is friendly, with the exception of the bullies. Business is booming and the town is lovely and clean. This changes in 1995 for when Alan walks through the town we see a very different place. The once clean town park is now a squat for beggars, most of the shops have closed down and the Parish Shoe company has been abandoned. Alan Parrish spends 16 years in a jungle to emerge in a world that has completely changed.As is typical of Hollywood, everything reverts back to its original form at the end, which deludes us with the idea that we can return the world to the good old days. This is something that we cannot do. The pleasant memories of our past will always remain there, and as is seen in Jumaji, not everything about the past is all that pleasant. We can look forward to a time when everything is restored, but this restoration goes back to the time of the Garden of Eden. The perfect world of Eden will be restored, rather than our pleasant childhood memories.I still like this movie though. Robin Williams is not one of my most favourite actors, but he does not turn me off as actors such as Van Damme do. Rather, he is reasonable. It is not him that attracts me to the movie, but rather the story. The story is an adventure and it is what you get. Jumaji basically delivers what it promises.",Jumanji

When they start playing, they free Alan Parish (Robin Williams) who was trapped in the game when he was a child. Robin Williams is always fun to watch and he was very popular at the time, due to movies like ""Aladdin"" and ""Mrs Doubtfire"" and Kristen Dunst was a real talent as a young actress, none of the annoying traits of usual child actors. Of the supporting cast David Alan Grier is fun as a hapless Police Officer, as is Jonathan Hyde in duel roles as a hunter and young Alan's Dad.Defo worth checking out if you have kids, and more than enjoyable even if you don't.

One thing which people seemingly don't seem to mind is the character of Alan Parrish (Robin Williams), which he is quite selfish and self-centered, but apparently it's okay for the audiences.Overall the film does succeed on entertainment, and although slightly different than the 2017 version, this Jumanji is more family friendly and worth a watch.",Jumanji
49,filipemanuelneto,An entertaining family film.,8,26 June 2016,"This film talks about a board game set in the inhospitable jungles of Indonesia that recreates magically the dangers in the board, for horror of the players involved. Directed by Joe Johnston, the film has a script by a team led by Jonathan Hensleigh. The main protagonist is Robin Williams, assisted by the young Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce.Yes, the theme of the movie would make a great horror film but, in this case, we have a comedy. And Robin Williams was definitely the ""Mr. comedy"". Any comic role fit him like a glove and this film was no exception. Although his character have some psychological depth, because of the trauma of being alone in the jungle for decades, it only serves to accentuate the humorous slant of what he says and does. The script is interesting, simple and very imaginative. The story works, entertains and holds the audience. The film scares a bit in certain scenes, but never in an excessive dose for children. The scenarios are good and the special, visual and sound effects are excellent. Some creatures in the film are clearly false and have a funny look. The soundtrack is regular, not bringing surprises, but doing their part without blemish. This film was made to entertain the audience, in particular the families, and does it very well.",Jumanji

This time, i start another play right from the start and i found it still dull : the young boy appears a bit dumb, his wealthy family not better  And then, first comes teen Dunst and i'm really surprised how good she acted (as she never convinced me as Peter's girlfriend). Next, Robin gets in the movie getting out the game and the magic operates : i really like the way past, present and future merge, how the game expands to the big mansion into town. If the special effects looks very tired, the story is original, full of surprises and proves that a humble cast can do as fine as a multiple billion dollars one ! Robin proved one more time he was a never grown-up kid with a beautiful soul with kids and the key to childish fun ! So i had a great time with this small movie as it gives me all i ask to cinema : to find a way to leave (cautiously) my world behind !!",Jumanji
51,TheMovieDiorama,"Jumanji may have a cult following, but that does not necessarily mean the film is great.",6,24 February 2018,"Heck, ""classics"" like 'The Room' and 'Jack and Jill' have garnered a cult status...yet we all know they are abysmal. Fortunately Jumanji isn't that bad however, there are various stumbles that prevent it from being classed as great. Two young kids come across an ancient and mysterious board game known as Jumanji, where every move they make will affect reality. They must withstand and survive the onslaught of jungle madness and complete the game. If you were a 90s kid (like myself) you would've watched this over and over and over again. ""Wow! Look mum, check out the graphics on those monkeys!"". ""I'm scared of both exotic plants and giant spiders!"". ""When I grow up, I want to be just like Adam and get stuck in a board game!"". The point is, it's a story that evokes imagination and creativity. The fantastical chaos that ensues is one that younger audiences can truly appreciate and become enthralled in. Robin Williams owned the 90s in terms of family flicks and he does so again here. Comedic and yet somewhat emotionally involving. A young Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce gave fun performances, and that's exactly what this film is...fun! I mean what other film would you expect to see giant plants, a lion, monkeys and even a monsoon in your own house? Exactly. For older audiences and viewers who are revisiting the epitome of the 90s, you may view this differently. The narrative and plot are flimsy where character development is minimal and the budget was spent showcasing the visual effects which are now horrendously outdated (seriously, did not age well...). The plot just felt generic somehow, given the peculiar and original concept found within its source material. By the end, you have no emotional connection with any of the characters. Like I said, they are just a means to demonstrate the effects and creativity of the crazy wildlife. A perfectly good family film that really does not amount to anything. I suspect nostalgia plays a vital part in the overwhelming positive opinions.",Jumanji
52,matthewssilverhammer,I'd leave my wife for Bonnie Hunt...and she would approve this decision.,7,25 January 2021,"This original Jumanji is way more fun than I remember, a high-concept family adventure with rules so clear that the stakes are all the more compelling: finish the game, or the world stays a living nightmare. Other than the CGI, which is atrocious, this is a decent bridge for younger kids getting ready to watch Jurassic Park for the first time.",Jumanji
53,Anonymous_Maxine,"Little Man Tate disappears in jungle for 26 years, comes back as Robin Williams.",5,17 March 2009,"It's interesting to transport yourself back to late 1995 when Jumanji was released into theaters. The movie-going public was still waiting eagerly for another stupendous family adventure to follow Jurassic Park, which blew away audiences of all ages despite some grisly scenes. The badly disappointing Congo had been released earlier in the year but younger audiences were recently charmed by the animated adventures of Pocahontas, while more mature audiences were considering the implications of Outbreak and reminiscing with the brilliant re-creation of the 1960s in Apollo 13. Teenage audiences (which included myself) were mostly still running around the high schools quoting Clueless or ranting and raving about the (now primitive) technological wonders of The Net, although in my own circle of friends we were more interested in the techno- criminals in Hackers, the pure, unfiltered awesomeness of Seven and that amazing blonde who got naked in Species. Oh, and I was ditching school on an almost daily basis with one of the owners of this very website and sneaking over to Fashion Island and watching Ace Ventura over and over.Sadly, Jumanji was a definite step backwards in almost all adventure movie departments. The special effects more than anything else are a conspicuous regression, but the biggest problem is that the effects sequences themselves are so disjointed from the rest of the movie. It all starts with a quick sequence taking place in 1869 where two kids bury a magical board game called Jumanji in a wooden chest in the woods. This is about the extent of our knowledge of the game, by the way. There is a whole other movie that takes place before this one begins, without which Jumanji is left with a gaping plot hole. But no matter, the important thing is that this is a board game is so hellacious and fearsome that the kids fear for the soul of anyone who happens to dig it up in the future. No word on why they didn't just burn it.Cut to 1969, where a young boy named Alan Parrish happens upon the chest at the site where his father is overseeing the construction of his shoe factory. He takes it home and plays a game with his friend Sarah. The game pieces snap into position without being touched and move themselves once the dice are rolled, but even more amazing are the physical manifestations of dangerous safari creatures and other mayhem conjured up by the game. After Alan and Sarah have each taken a turn (Alan's even accidentally), Alas has been sucked off into Jumanji, wherever that is, and Sarah has taken off down the street, pursued by a squeaking mass of bats.Then we jump ahead again, this time 26 years into the future to the modern day (1995). The house has been empty for years and a new family move in. The two kids, Judy (a young Kirsten Dunst) and Peter find the game and begin to play, opening the door to Jumanji and bringing back things like lions and monkeys and Alan Parrish, now a grown, hairy man without the benefit of any human contact for the vast majority of his life. It turns out that the only way to stop the black magic of the game is to get to the end and say ""Jumanji."" And since Alan and Sarah were in the middle of an unfinished game for all of those years, they are now in the middle of a four-person game with Judy and Peter and they must all take their respective turns until someone makes it to the end. Sarah, of course, has suffered a life of diminished credibility ever since she claimed that Alan disappeared into a board game when she was a child. So much for the truth setting you free!The movie is structured as a series of special effects sequences involving whatever dangerous manifestation results from each person's turn rolling the dice. They all scramble frantically in the face of new dangers every ten or fifteen minutes or so, then the dangers disappear neatly for the next person to take their turn, and so on until the end of the movie. It's not exactly the most imaginative structuring going on here, but I will admit that the ending has a little twist that, while it includes one of the cheapest happy Hollywood copout moves in movies (they also pulled the same thing in Click), I would be lying if I said it wasn't at least a little heartwarming. Unfortunately, a lot of the movie is geared toward kids around 10 years old, the same age as the kids in the movie, but it also contains some imagery and some situations that kids that age would find much too frightening or intense. There is a scene involving giant spiders that admittedly look like nothing other than big plastic spider-puppets but that is still just as creepy as anything in Arachnophobia. So beware if you have a fear of creepy crawlies!I would be lying if I said the movie wasn't at all fun or entertaining. The story is told in an unconventional way, but it's also true that it's an unconventional story, which at least makes it a little more interesting. But in retrospect it's a little hard to get over how perfectly everything is arranged as a setup for the ending. The relationships between Alan and Sarah and between the two of them and the other two kids who, needless to say, are orphans, will seem a little too perfect for some people. The characters are not uninteresting and the performances are satisfactory, but unfortunately they all take second billing to an ambitious special effects team that doesn't seem to know when their half-baked digital creations are helping to drive the movie along and when they're just swallowing everything else up.",Jumanji
54,Vartiainen,Decent family entertainment,6,7 August 2012,"On the outside this looks like your average kids film with very little thought put into it, cheap special effects and under-performing actors. And I totally agree about the special effects, though for their time they were not that bad. But on the other two counts I couldn't disagree more, especially when it comes to the amount of thought that this movie contains. Because the basic premise of this film is actually rather interesting. Most of us used to imagine as children what it would be like if our favourite games came alive. Well, as this movie shows, there's a good chance that it wouldn't have been as fun as we thought. The board game Jumanji with its jungle themed monstrosities is by no means a walk in the park and the movie goes to great lengths to explore this idea about a game that actually forces you to physically beat it with the various game characters coming alive to confront the players. It's brutal, it's hard and in real life it would not be for children.Nevertheless, it makes for good solid entertainment. Add in some nice acting work from Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst, some rather creative action scenes and an antagonist in the form of a great white hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde) and you have a movie that will surely stick to you mind. This is one of those movies that I can freely admit not regarding as all that great as it has some flaws and inconsistencies, but which I will gladly watch again and again. Perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but even that is not entirely accurate, as the movie is not bad in any way. It's a bit cheesy and aimed for younger audiences, but it's still rather good at what it tries to accomplish. All in all I could easily recommend this to all those that enjoy good adventure films. It may not change your way of thinking or revolutionize your world, but you won't forget that you have seen it.",Jumanji

The cast do a great job of portraying their characters and the visual effects aren't bad for the mid-ninties. Some people say they don't like this movie, for whatever reason, but I think it's an enjoyable adventure that anyone would enjoy.This movie is about a board game. A very special board game. When two children play the game, everything that the their players do, happens to them. So when Alan's piece gets a card saying he has to wait in the jungle, he disappears, which nearly drives the young girl he was playing with mad. Twenty-six years later, two new kids play the game, and release Alan. Alan and the kids must get the other play to continue to game, otherwise they won't be free until it's completed.Best part of the movie: When Alan comes out of the game.Worst part of the movie: The spiders.Recommended for: Everyone.Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Amazing.",Jumanji
56,lisafordeay,Think of it as Night At The Museum meets a board game,6,2 March 2014,"Jumanji is based off a cartoon TV series that was made into a film in 1995 and stars funnyman Robin Williams who plays a man called Alan Parrish who as a kid played a board game called Jumanji which was been buried since 1869 with his friend Sarah(Bonnie Hunt)in the year 1969.But when Alan plays the game he gets sucked into it as his friend Sarah watched in horror as each time the player plays the game consequences occur and the only way to finish the game is to play the whole thing. Fast forward 26 years later in 1995 and two young children played by Kirsten Dunst (from the Spider-Man franchise)and Bradley Pierce who's parents died along time ago are now living with their aunt as their aunt bought Alan's old house.But when the two kids stumble across the board game as they hear the drums playing in the background in the attic,its up to them to try and finish off where the player left off and free Alan who helps them finish the game with his friend Sarah.But will they finish the game. Overall this film is really good until the very end which was sorta confusing for me. If you seen it you know what it is but it involves time travelling back to 1969 and then back to 1995 again. But still if you are a fan of Fantasy movies,Robin Williams and if you love something to keep you entertained on a lazy Sunday afternoon Jumanji is worth checking out.",Jumanji

The little boy sucked into the game reappears and decides to help the siblings so they can avoid the same experience he had with the game.This movie is directed by Joe Johnston (Captain America) and stars Robin Williams (Mrs. Doubtfire), Kirsten Dunst (Spider-man), David Alan Grier (In Living Color), Bonnie Hunt (The Green Mile), Jonathan Hyde (Titanic) and Bradley Pierce (Pokémon: Detective Pikachu).The storyline for this is so unique and contains fantastic characters that are easy to root for. There's a sadness and gloom over the movie as you root for every character's triumph. The CGI and action sequences are perfectly created. The cast is outstanding and I loved Williams and Greer in this. The dialogue is also very good as are the circumstances that need to be overcome. I'll also say every seen with a monkey in it is classic. Overall this is a brilliant picture that is an absolute must see. I'd score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",Jumanji
59,drqshadow-reviews,"An Entertaining Concept, Short-Changed by Poor Effects and a Stiff Plot",5,18 September 2018,"Your standard ""kids find a haunted board game in the attic"" jungle adventure. All kidding aside, Jumanji merits points for dreaming up a fun, simple formula that allows for all sorts of unexpected mayhem without completely losing track of reality. A little mysticism never hurt anyone, I suppose, apart from the random lady who was just stung into a coma by a roving band of gigantic, bloodthirsty mosquitoes.Robin Williams is a good choice for the lead, pairing his rough, burly figure with a boyish charm, which makes him both endearing to his young costars and physically appropriate for the action scenes. He doesn't have a lot of room to improvise, though, which is a drawback, and the ambitious special effects have aged very poorly. Hammy supporting work from David Alan Grier doesn't help the cause, fitting right in with the slow stream of hollow secondary characters, though Jonathan Hyde does deserve positive marks in a limited villainous role. It tries to reach for substance and heart, but in the end this one is just a simple slab of watery, kid-friendly action with an unusually good hook.",Jumanji

61,jimbo-53-186511,"Repetitive, but quite entertaining",6,23 June 2018,"2 kids discover a board game in a house that they have recently moved into with their aunt. They discover the power of this board game when all hell breaks loose after an array of animals from the board game come to life. They also release Alan Parrish a man who has been trapped in the board game for 26 years. Alan, the 2 kids and Alan's old friend Sarah must work together to end the game and finish what they started.For what it is, Jumanji is quite an entertaining film; there is plenty of noise and chaos and the idea that they must finish the game in order to return to normality does give the film a sense of urgency and makes Jumanji a fairly involving film (once it gets going). Unfortunately, a lot of what you see between point A and point B is repetitive (all the animals that come to life arrive for a short time, do essentially the same thing and then disappear). This cycle is repeated throughout the film which does make the film feel a little monotonous.On the flip side, director Joe Johnston (realising that he's working from a flimsy script) throws everything at the screen and despite being repetitive the film does have some exciting sequences and occasional moments of comedy. It's actually the energetic way that the film is directed that saves the film slightly as in lesser hands it probably would be a complete disaster.Williams was always good value to watch and puts in another fun turn here; although in the moment when he's released from the board game he comes dangerously close to 'overacting' but just about gets away with it I think. Jonathan Hyde also does well in a dual role (although he clearly had more fun with his role as Van Pelt). Williams is nicely supported by a young Kirsten Dunst and the likes of Bonnie Hunt, David Alan Grier and Bradley Pierce are also OK in support.There are some problems with this picture such as a weak narrative and poor special effects and I also felt that the effects side of the production was more important to those concerned than the actual story creating a style over substance effect - although the film is geared more towards kids so perhaps this was intentional. I also found the film to be a little contrived; Alan needs to find his old friend in order to finish the board game and despite 26 years passing she's conveniently living in the same house she grew up in as a child. Yes I mean it's possible, but it's also terribly convenient.Still flaws and all this is still pretty entertaining and it also has quite a nice ending essentially showing what would have happened had they not played the game in the first place. It's worth watching, but perhaps would have been better with a stronger and better developed story.",Jumanji

Robin Williams plays a basic Robin Williams character, i.e. a man-child. I never would have recognized Kirsten Dunst or Laura Bell Bradley as children without the cast list, but they both performed well. David Alan Grier did befuddlement just as well back then as he does now. Bebe Neuwirth and Bonnie Hunt did nicely, and looked very nice as well. The pace got a bit frenetic for me, though I understand that this was deliberate. The CGI animals looked fine in the distance but up close, not so much. I know we are spoiled by the unlimited effects in films today, but some of these, like the lion, looked terrible. I saw in the credits that they had Industrial Light & Magic, so I doubt it could have been done any better at the time. And some of the things in the ending did not seem to totally follow from the body of the film. It's probably worth checking out though, even today.",Jumanji

64,NateWatchesCoolMovies,In the jungle you must wait....,10,13 September 2016,"In the jungle you must wait, until the dice reads five or eight. So professes a mysterious board game possessed by dark magic to young Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd), a boy with no clue just how far an innocent roll of the dice can take you. From the first ominous drumbeat the game utters, until the last fading tones it plays the film out with, Jumanji is a giddy rush of pure adventure, with a refreshingly dark and primal side to its mayhem. Alan disappears from the 1950's and we fast forward 25 years later. Young orphans Peter and Judy (Kirsten Dunst & Bradley Pierce) are moving into his old family home, so fate (and those damn creepy drums) would have them find the Jumanji in the attic, and continue the game Alan started with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) over a decade ago. Suddenly every jungle creature, meteorological phenomenon and 90's CGI monster erupts from the game into their little town, causing a mess that goes beyond the word havoc. This includes a near feral middle aged Alan, now played by Robin Williams. Together with a most reluctant Sarah, the quartet try to stop the destruction, play the game, but mostly just survive this onslaught. Psychotic monkeys, mutant mosquitoes, an elephant stampede, monsoons, giant spiders (fucking shudder) and crocodiles are but a few of the wonders awaiting them. My favourite has to be murderous Victorian game hunter Van Pelt, played mightily by stage actor Jonathan Hyde, with a pith helmet and an epic mustache that would make Kurt Russell chortle. Hyde does excellent double duty as both the deranged hunter and Alan's stern but loving father, a tough contrast he handles like a champ. I admire the film's willingness to go creepy and dark, despite being geared towards kids. The danger feels real, the game has an eerie mysticism to it, a life of it's own that gives you goosebumps. Not often do family orientated films have a shred of real fear in them anymore, so let's count our blessings with this one, still holding strong today. The special effects are dated in places (those monkeys, man) and wonderful in others (that hardwood floor quicksand tho), but you have to cut them some slack, it being 1996 after all. Williams and Hunt have snarky banter that barely hides their love for each other, and it's one of my favourite on screen pairings he ever had with a gal. He makes Alan resourceful, kind and just a little bit crazy, but the guy did spend years alone in a treacherous jungle straight out of your nightmares, so that can be expected. Amidst the chaos you can look out for Patricia Clarkson, a deadpan Bebe Neurith and David Alan Grier as well. There's a lot of stuff crammed into the film, but never does it feel bloated or crippled by it's own weight, flowing nicely and taking time where it can to develop character and give it's human cast just as much to do as all the crazy jungle stuff. I'm surprised I never saw any of this go down as a kid, because parts of it were filmed blocks from my neighborhood, and CGI was scant back then, so much of it would have physically been there, large and loud. Maybe I did, and have since forgotten. I definitely haven't forgotten any of the film, though, and allow for repeated viewings whenever I have the time. It's one of the best, most thrilling adventure stories of its time and ages well as each year passes. Cue the drums.",Jumanji

66,gcd70,Highly imaginative fantasy fun,7,18 March 2008,"A most enjoyable surprise is this pure fantasy from special effects wiz Joe Johnston (""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" and ""Adventures of the Rocketeer""). Story concerns the discovery of a mysterious board game by a young boy, Alan, in 1969. When he and his friend Sarah begin playing the game, they unleash forces beyond their control that propel Alan to another world and send Sarah running and screaming from the house. Twenty-six years later, young orphans Judy and Peter find the game in a dusty attic and begin playing themselves, once again releasing power they cannot contain.Johnston has a ball with the limitless f/x possibilities made available by this innovative premise (based on the novel). Computer graphics and animation is astounding, and though several images are obviously artificially generated, the impact is still markedly effective. Johnston constantly surprises, and will have you on the edge of your seat, heart pounding, from scene one to the dazzling finale. Wisely too, he has mixed in some romping fun and a good measure of humour, to make this a memorable fantasy-adventure.Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt and the young support cast - led by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce - do very well, but all, including the usually dominant Williams, are outclassed by the visual expertise, which includes some impressive sets and art direction. Sound effects are also top notch.James Horner provides another thoroughly satisfying score to round everything off. One of the best, most imaginative films I've seen for some time.Saturday, April 6, 1996 - Village MorwellThis wild, romping fantasy-adventure is a must for young and old alike. Special effects wiz Joe Johnston presents a film dominated by spectacular visual illusions, illusions which even manage to outshine the normally prominent Robin Williams.The plot does have similarities to ""Back to the Future""', in that the board game gives the power to change history, as did the De Lorean in Robert Zemeckis' fantasy-adventure smash.Director Joe Johnston should really take full credit for fashioning this flick into a funny, frightening, full-on-fun-fest, with the undoubted help of an enjoyable cast (including Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce, Jonathan Hyde and Bonnie Hunt) and an ingenious effects team. Music is from a very capable James Horner. Highly recommended for a return viewing, especially at the cinema.Friday, August 30, 1996 - Video",Jumanji

Oh yes, that and the spiders, which are surprisingly lifelike. Even at 40 they still terrify me. So when does protecting our kids stop? I know for a fact that my niece and nephews would be more scared about having to clean up the big mess that's made once the kids start to play the game.The film can be forgiven it's bad CGI and to some degree, I suppose, I can let them off for the spiders, because it's absolutely brilliant. The perfect film to watch with all generations on a windy and wet Winters afternoon (Cushions should be on hand to hide behind for those of the fainter heart, especially when the spiders appear).It never gets boring and although elements could be described as dated, I wouldn't say that it's out of touch with life today.I'm sure there's a metaphor in its story for starting things without reading the instructions, but forget that and just enjoy it.There's comedy, a little romance, a whole lot of fun and who else could play a forty-something overgrown boy but Robin Williams, who must always be the first man-child to spring to mind, despite the list of other Alan wannabes.Tomorrow night I will watch 'Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle' (2017) and having seen it before, I know I will enjoy it almost as much as this one.",Jumanji

This has never been an amazing spectacle, but there are still several good points that make this a lasting film.At the time, people thought it was really only Robin Williams that caused this movie to get made. Sure he is the crown jewel like most of his films, but anybody else as the protagonist and the movie still would have been good. Not as good as having the late comic, but okay.In 1969, Branford, New Hampshire was a small, lovely town. The Parrish family was the most wealthy, owning the shoe factory. When Mr. Parrish says that he plans to send his son, Alan, to boarding school, Alan is angry and plans to run away. His friend, Sarah Wittell, arrives and they play an odd board game Alan found earlier in the day. Alan gets sucked in and does not get released until 1995 when his house's new residents (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pearce) pick up where Alan and Sarah left off.After Alan gets sucked into the board game and comes out, we get to know very well what happened in the 26-year gap. And old wives tale says Mr. Parrish killed Alan. In reality, Mr. and Mrs. Parrish thought Alan ran away. Mr. Parrish did all he could to find his son. All his time and money spent eventually led to his factory folding and the rest of the town losing business. This subplot is what I have always loved about this. Mr. Parrish barely shows his love to his son, but devoting everything he had into finding him is heartbreaking. When adult Alan (Williams) meets the new tenants whose parents died, more sadness is added. Unlike most Robin Williams films around this time, what ""Jumanji"" has is completely earned.This movie is not without flaws. ""Jumanji"" is a board game that just requires you to roll two dice. Dunst even points out that there is no skill involved. It would be better if there was more things to happen in the game. I get that mythical things get unleashed and the players try to stay clear, but that's not really IN the game. That brings me to my next point: half o the things the are unleashed from the game look beyond fake. CGI was not this bad in 1995!There are lots of movies that you loved as a kid but hate as an adult. ""Jumanji"" is not one of those.3/4",Jumanji

71,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An unique game related movie,7,4 August 2018,"The 1990s was a decade of a lot of experimentation. With the advent of CGI coming to the forefront, studios couldn't help but try to implement it into every production they had. Aside from James Cameron who was more or less the facilitator in this push, there was another director who was getting his experience with these kinds of special effects. Joe Johnston by the mid 1990s had a couple popular movies under his belt and was working his way to becoming a rather credible director. Having his name listed with movies like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989), The Rocketeer (1991) and served in the visual effects department for Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Johnston certainly had good stuff on his resume. So when this movie came along he was well ready for it, but for audiences, that was a risky bet. However that does not mean this movie isn't worth it.Based on a book written by Chris Van Allsburg, the same writer to The Polar Express, had quite the intriguing concept. What would happen if there was a board game that played itself and whatever moves were made were determined by the board? Sounds pretty crazy. Yet Johnston and his team of screenwriters were able to produce not only that, but a story about a boy who learned how to grow up by not running away from his problems. Alan Parrish at a young age is the son of a wealthy shoe factory owner but feels neglected. He and his only friend Sarah find a board game by the name of Jumanji and decide to play it. Of which Alan is sucked into the game until 26 years later when Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) rediscover the game and start what begun those years ago.There they meet adult Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) and Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) who join them in finishing the game. From there, things only escalate beyond the point of no return. A new turn produces more collateral damage to property and all other sorts of things. The same could be said for how these characters end up after the game is finished. Audiences will realize that the story of Alan largely plays a significant role in the progress of his home town and how it will affect other people. This also creates a good portion of emotional moments for the character and Robin Williams is also able to sell that well. The same can be said for Dunst, Hunt and Pierce who all add to the events that occur. All four of them also have great chemistry together, providing laughs and scares. Writers Jonathan Hensleigh, Greg Taylor, and Jim Strain all did a decent job building this story.The visuals to this story however are occasionally a mixed bag. If anything, the game mechanics to this interactive extravaganza is ridiculous. No matter what, so much goes wrong even if it seems like things couldn't get that bad. As an adult, it's completely fine to watch. However for younger audiences, this movie may be too intense and can be a little too much for a comedy adventure. Being sucked into a board game isn't all the cool sounding when you're stretched and distorted. And that's where the effects come into play. Being that it was still at the point where CGI hadn't been fully perfected there are still a number of areas that look untouched. Some objects are too light in color as opposed to their surroundings. They just don't mesh well and it makes them stand out even more. There are practical effects too, which look a little better but even they look slightly unrealistic.The most convincing of these visuals though was the cinematography by Thomas E. Ackerman and the set design. Having worked on Beetlejuice (1988) and later George of the Jungle (1997), Ackerman surely knows how to make adequate looking shots. Most of the film takes place in Alan Parrish's house and considering how out of control things become, not long after Alan's house doesn't resemble a house anymore. It gets that bad, that quick. Lastly the musical score composed by James Horner was nothing short of greatness. Believe it or not there is a signature theme for the game itself involving minor key music box notes and beating drums. Also the cues played for Alan Parrish are rather emotional too. It may not be his most profound or emotionally moving score but it still rings memorable chords.For a family adventure film, there are some moments that prove to be a little too intense for young eyes and the special effects haven't aged that well. Yet with credible performances by the main actors, high tension, and respectable music, this board game movie shows that game based movies can be fun, even if they aren't based on a video game.",Jumanji

I even had the VHS for awhile. This is a good movie to test your surround sound system to the limits. The book was good, and the movie is better, but the TV show sucked.

The monkeys look ""washed-out"" and so do some of the wild zoo animals; which is why most of the rest of the EFX are mechanical or use backdrops and mattes. Otherwise a very strong 10 would be my vote, as the casting works and the plot shows lots of imagination and flair. With a ""sly wink"" to ""Peter Pan"", Alan's father plays both his dad and Van Pelt the Hunter. My two favorite scenes are when the house gets folded in half and eaten by the monstrous plant, and when everything swirls backwards into the gameboard. I also love it when the house goes ""wild"" and turns into a swamp complete with nasty alligators. I do not like the scene where the little boy turns into a monkey with a tail. Young children may find it disturbing like the donkey transformation in ""Pinocchio"". ""Jumanji"" is suspenseful and scary but no one actually dies in the film. Therefore, it's much more enjoyable when viewed again. The only one who seemed to hate it was Roger Ebert, but it's only too scary for pre-schoolers. Most ""users"" love it! What ""scares"" me the most in this film: the bats, insects, spiders, alligators, and The Hunter. The sequel will not have the charisma of the late and great Robin Williams. I still miss him. He was a comic genius. If there was a market for it, I would like it to be re-imagined with better graphics like the old ""Star Trek TOS"" reissue.",Jumanji

77,Screen_Blitz,"Dated, but fun adventure for kids and adults alike",7,13 November 2016,"When Steven Spielberg launched 'Jurassic Park' in the summer of 1993, it broke major grounds in the visual effects department leaving everyone with their jaw dropping at the splendid computer-generated imagery of the dinosaurs. The success of the Spielberg brought birth to a new image of computer-generated effects as well special effects to the feast the eyes of viewers everywhere. This fantasy adventure based on the Award-winning children's book Jumanji by Chris Van Allsburg invites audiences for fun adventure in the jungle with computer-generated animals that hit a mark in the state-of-the-art territory at the time of its release, but unlike the superior Jurassic Park sadly look dated and unauthentic by comparison. That is certainly not to say however, that the fun of the magical fantasy excursion and the charm of the highly popular Robin Williams no longer remains. Set in 1995, the film follows a young boy named Peter Shepard (played by Bradley Pierce) and his sister Judy (played by Kirsten Dunst) who discover a mysterious game in the attic of the home 12-year old Alan Parrish (played by Adam-Hann Byrd) disappeared in twenty-six years ago. Upon rolling the dice, Peter and Judy unexpectedly release a thirty-something year old Alan (played by Robin Williams) who reveals to have disappeared into the game. Witnessing the magical powers of the game, Alan, Peter, and Judy team up along with Alan's old friend Sarah (played by Bonnie Hunt) to survive against the horde of jungle animals that threaten to destroy the town until someone finished the game.Lions, elephants, rhinos, monkeys, monsoons, carnivorous plants; all menacing obstacles our characters must overcome as the titular board game send their world in a mysterious jungle-like realm. It is a wild ride brought to life by the a smart execution by director Joe Johnston who knows the magic of Chris Van Allsburg's source material, and translation from book-to-screen by a screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh and Greg Taylor. But the question is ""has it aged well"". In terms of visual effects, the answer is sadly no as the computer generated imagery of the wild animals that release from the board game unfortunately fail to come to life as believable and striking as they did back in 1995. While the film's use of animatronics used on the some of the animals such as the lion have aged well in a way that can send shivers down your in the scene when the hairy creature threatens our young heroes, most of the effects look awfully dated and show evidence of a blockbuster flick released in the mid-1990s. Despite the lack of authenticity perpetrated by these subpar effects, the film luckily manages to stay fun and charming, especially by the comedic charm of Robin Williams who swarms in the movie with livelihood and humility as well as the rest of the cast including Bradley Pierce, Kirsten Dunst, and Bonnie Hunt. As the story progresses, viewers are in for a fair amount of dark, eerie elements including the death of the children's parents, Alan's broken relationship with his father, and the overall chaos that erupts from the game; all of which are enough to leave young children shivering. But with the fun-filled action uprooted in the adventure of the characters, there is still plenty for the family to enjoy.Jumanji may show its age in terms of the effects department, but is still a fun-filled adventure full of laughs, heart, and suspense to keep both kids and adults alike captivated from start to finish. Yes, it is disappointing that it fails to reach the roots of Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park; but that doesn't stop this fantasy adventure of being a friendly, fantasy spectacle.",Jumanji

The only one I liked. The only one that critics disliked. Jumanji, for some reason, was a film that I really liked. I'll admit some of it was a bit weird, but I really liked it. I liked it because of Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, two great actors. People don't give Williams enough credit and the same with Hunt. But I love both of them. I also think the film has great visuals and it's a triumph with entertainment. I can understand why critics would call it weird, but I really liked it. You may disagree with me. But there's something about Jumanji that I really liked but I can't think of what exactly it is.

'Jumanji' has lost its magic. It came across much better a few years ago, when CGI and special effects weren't as common as they are today. Unfortunately, with the film being so special effect oriented, it hasn't aged well. The effects are dated now and just don't have the same impact as they used to.Having said that, this is still a moderately entertaining film with an interesting and original plot, based on the 1981 book by Chris Van Allsburg.

85,blott2319-1,Rather stupid story structure,4,8 June 2020,"At this point, I think I've seen Jumanji 3 or 4 times in my life, and I kind of hope this will be the last time. This is not a good movie, and the same issues that bugged me about it when I saw it back in the 90s still bother me today. First and foremost, the story structure is weak once the game gets started. They have a good idea with the setup at the beginning, but by the time the dice are rolling, they abandon most of the story to simply spend time running. It's so repetitive as they roll the dice, wait for something to happen, scream when it happens, and then run for their lives. They try to weave in this theme of Alan dealing with his daddy issues, but his problem was a mildly neglectful and strict dad. He didn't damage the relationship, his dad did. So it is the father who needed to experience growth, not the son. As a result, punishing the boy who has already been struggling by sending him to rot in a jungle for decades is ridiculous.The plot also breaks down because it doesn't give a logical reason for them to wait so long in between die rolls. A smarter script would simply make it so they have to do something in order to deal with the problem that came out of the game before they can roll again. This is where the Jumanji sequels are getting things right. They have goals and missions to complete, rather than just rolling dice as fast as you can. The cast is fine, although I don't particularly like Robin Williams in roles where he has to be the straight man all the time. There isn't much comedy in this entire script, and he has the most tragic story, so he's not exactly joking around. Finally, while it might be a bit unfair to criticize movies from the 90s for looking dated, the CGI and practical effects look atrocious. It's amateur-level stuff and it only stands out more on a modern HDtv. I can't say that Jumanji is a terrible film, because it has some good ideas, and the framing sequence is actually enjoyable. It's just not that well-written and the overall execution leaves something to be desired.",Jumanji
86,IonicBreezeMachine,A strong adventure film with good performances and groundbreaking effects that makes it an engaging viewing for family audiences.,8,3 October 2021,"Set in 1969 in Brantford, New Hampshire, Alan Perish (Adam Hann-Byrd) finds a board game called Jumanji at a construction site after following the sound of jungle drums. Following a heated argument with his father about attending boarding school, Alan decides to run away but his plans are interrupted when his friend Sarah Whittle (Laura Bell Bundy) arrives at his home to return the bicycle her boyfriend stole from Alan. Sarah too hears the drums and Alan shows her the game, Sarah dismisses playing but when she drops the dice the pieces start moving and eventually at Alan's turn he is sucked into the game as Sarah is chased by bats out of the house. 26 years later Alan's former home, now empty and dilapidated, is moved into by two children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) and their aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth) Judy and Peter soon find the game and inadvertently continue the same game Alan and Sarah started in 1969 unleashing further jungle dangers into the world and eventually a grown Alan Parish (Robin Williams). Alan is met with the realization that not only is Brantford no longer a thriving town, but Alan's parents are now deceased. Alan is reluctant to play the game to finish it, but is eventually convinced by Judy and Peter to continue on and eventually bring in adult Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) who has tried to distance herself from that night in 1969. With each new roll of the dice a new danger awaits our heroes as they try to reach the center of the board.Released in 1995, Jumanji was one of the first major special effects heavy films to follow in the wake of Steven Spielberg's game changer Jurassic Park. Based on a book by author Chris Van Allsburg, the film came very close to being cancelled with Van Allsburg's film treatment convincing continuation. Eventually securing noted director Joe Johnston known for effects heavy family films like Honey I Shrunk the Kids, The Rocketeer, and the live-action segments of The Pagemaster, the film cast Robin Williams as the lead (a prevision of TriStar pictures) following consideration of numerous other leading men ranging from Tom Hanks, Dan Akyroyd, and Cheavy Chase to more ""what?"" choices like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. While the film was a hit with audiences, critics were somewhat more mixed on the movie with one of the more scathing reviews coming from Roger Ebert. The movie has in the years since its release become a nostalgic classic, even spawning an expanded franchise, and rightfully so because Jumanji is just fun.The cast is really good in the film with all the child actors feeling natural and relatable. There's also some good supporting work from noted character actors David Alan Grier and Bebe Neuwirth serving as great straight men to a number of comic set pieces, with a running gag about the increasing damage to Grier's car being particularly enjoyable. Robin Williams is well cast in the film as his natural comic energy imbues his presence with a youthful exuberance and he works well playing a child in a man's body (much better than similar attempts in the likes of Hook or Jack where he did something similar). The scenes of Williams looking over his hometown and father's factor are nicely atmospheric and resonate well at the emotional core of the film.The film is certainly episodic with the movie basically an excuse for a series of jungle based dangers ranging from Bats, poisonous flytraps, stampeding animals, or large spiders and mosquitoes with the dangers appropriately built upon one after the other with each roll of the dice. While this does make the movie feel like a showcase for effects sequences and not unlike a ""game"", the movie does give us enough stakes and character where we want to see them will the game. The chaos that erupts from the Jumanji board game is truly groundbreaking for the time mixing practical effects, puppetry, and computer generated imagery to bring its set pieces to life. Some scenes have aged more gracefully than others (the monkeys in particular look very rubbery and not quite right by today's standards) and there's certainly a level of intensity to the film that will vary in tolerance on a child by child basis (especially if they're afraid of bugs).Jumanji is a simple premise done well. With likable characters and exciting set pieces, it's a thrilling adventure for families that unleashes imaginative chaos upon our world in entertaining and exiting ways.",Jumanji
87,emasterslake,Robin Williams and his best movie role,7,2 January 2006,"I've been familiar with this film for over a decade.

Till he stumbles upon a mysterious board game called ""Jumaji"" a game of adventure and survival.

88,jaredmobarak,Til the dice read five or eight  Jumanji,6,4 January 2009,"Growing up, if asked who my favorite illustrator was, I'd always reply with Chris Van Allsburg. My elementary school years in Florida saw our librarian reading us many of his lusciously detailed books and I fell in love with the paintings as well as the stories. So when I saw that Jumanji had been made into a film, I was very excited. Watching it back in 1995, I think I really had fun, and revisiting it now keeps a lot of that childish enjoyment intact, even if the special effects may not have aged well. Going through the first little bit, a prologue if you will, I was completely in the dark, not remembering any of those moments. It's been even longer since I last read the book, but I want to say that backstory was added for cinematic effect, although I could be totally wrong there. Either way, it is a nice set-up, starting in the 1800's as two young kids bury the game in hopes to rid the world of it, only to be found again by Alan Parrish in 1969, transporting him into the jungle world for 26 years until two new children stumble upon its drumming.Special effects are a very interesting thing. Whenever you get groundbreaking, never been better graphics, they will never hold up with time  well maybe not never. I recall films from my childhood that were so vividly magical, yet when I revisit them now I can hardly understand what I could have been thinking. Stop-motion animation or blue-screen work that is a different tint or animatronic creatures feeling plastic, if it's fake it will look fake when you become accustomed to newer technology. This is true with Jumanji, but being a children's fantasy it doesn't hurt the replay value. Sure the backgrounds start to look flat, telestrating that an effect will be coming because you know there is a blue-screen behind the actor, and interaction with computer elements becomes forced as the humans don't quite match up when touching the objects not really there, but it still works. The lion is quite effective, the set-piece water and quick growing vines portray some realism, and really the only things that may be a touch off are the monkeys, (very cartoon-like), the stampeding animals, (definitely not in the same color scheme of environment with what they run through), the jelly-like plastic spiders, and the quicksand floors. Otherwise, you kind of give it the benefit of the doubt because I truly believe the story holds up strong and you will be engrossed in the plot progression, hiding the inadequacies of effects.The film is an inventive tale about a game that affects the real world. You role the dice and bring creatures from Jumanji into your own living room. It's a dark magic that rears its ugly head first by entrapping a young boy until the next player rolls a five or eight. His disappearance so frightens his friend, however, that she runs off and seeks psychiatric help over the next three decades to prove to her that it never happened. As a result, young Alan Parrish grows up in the jungle world of violence and fantasy, only to be brought back as a grown man when the new inhabitants of his now-deceased parent's house roll the dice themselves. Judy and Peter start to understand what is happening, and unlike Alan and Sarah, they read the second half of the instructions which state that only when the game is won and the word Jumanji spoken do the fantastical elements entered into their world go away. While it might not be ""real"", it is all very much alive and solid until the game takes it back again at the end.The cast resides in the tale very nicely, containing many familiar faces and effective turns. Alan, the boy trapped and returned, is played as an adult by the always fun Robin Williams. It's a somewhat more subdued role for him, yet the knowledge of all these creatures and having first-hand lived in Jumanji, allows for a little of his manic mannerisms to show up. But I think his relationship with the adult Sarah, played by Bonnie Hunt, works best. The two of them are very much still childrenone had been trapped in a fictional world and the other in her own head. Only now, so many years later, do they finally have a chance to grow upand with a very intriguing and somewhat surprising ending, they get to do so in more ways than you may think.There are also some nice small supporting roles, including Bebe Neuwirth as the present-day children's, (Judy and Peter), aunt; Jonathan Hyde as Alan's father and fictional villain Van Pelt, who is very much an embodiment of the father; and David Alan Grier as ""Soulman"" Carl Bentley. Grier is a lot of fun playing someone from Alan's past that becomes a policeman, with his new job putting him right in the mix of things in the present. The two roles that really make the film work, however, are the new game players played by Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce. Both are great as two youngsters who are battling their own fears about what is happening while also trying to be the ""adult"" figures to Alan and Sarah, keeping them on task to finish the game they started and hopefully bring their world back to normal.",Jumanji
89,hnt_dnl,One of my favorite 90s and Robin Williams' movies!,10,29 June 2020,"JUMANJI (1995) is one of those movies that I watched when I was younger and just latched onto and never let go. And it's easily one of my favorite Robin Williams movies. I was never that much into his films overall but Jumanji is most definitely a keeper! The movie is just really funny, heartwarming, and entertaining and one that the whole family can enjoy. It's a movie that kids can enjoy, yet it doesn't come across as just a kid's movie, if that makes sense. And that's a huge reason why 25 years later it still holds up to repeat viewing for me as an adult. The comedy doesn't feel cheap or cringe or silly. The movie doesn't tell jokes. The humor feels real. It's actual DIALOGUE among the characters that feels organic and a huge reason this movie is still relevant now. I also think that this movie is an early example where CGI actually works. I swear the effects in this movie somehow look more real than what you'd see in the average CGI-laden film now, which is actually most of them.The aforementioned Williams is pitch perfect in one of his most charming and persuasive film performances. Williams essays the role of Alan Parrish, a man who for 26 years was trapped in the board game called Jumanji. As a little boy, Alan was playing with his friend Sarah Whittle, played by a hilarious Bonnie Hunt as an adult. Alan gets released by a sibling duo Judy and Peter Shepherd. Judy is played winningly by Kirsten Dunst in a very early film role showing off her comedy acting chops and Peter is played well by Bradley Pierce. The film also features a funny performance by Bebe Neuwirth of Cheers/Frasier fame as the siblings' clueless aunt and a scene-stealing turn by David Alan Grier as the town sheriff. But a performance that I've REALLY come to appreciate over time is that of Jonathan Hyde, who actually plays a dual role of Alan's father but primarily that of big game hunter Van Pelt, who unironically traipses around a late 20th century modern town in 19th century hunting gear and an old world approach to everything. He's a hoot of a character.The main quartet of Alan, Sarah, Judy and Peter have tons of chemistry and I like how they bond over the course of the film as a sort of makeshift, fractured family as they all suffered from childhood traumas as Alan was trapped in a game, Sarah closed herself off from the world after the childhood incident and Judy and Peter lost their parents to a plane crash. Even though they are adults, Alan and Sarah never really were allowed to grow up, so they both have childlike sensibilities that complement the two actual children. The special effects were considered cutting edge for 1995 and still hold a timeless charm about them. I actually don't find many 1990s movies to have that charming re-watchability of movies from say the 1980s. But Jumanji is most definitely one that both charming and re-watchable.",Jumanji

91,Beta_Gallinger,"An entertaining, chaotic adventure, one which impressed me as a kid and still does now",8,4 August 2009,"I first heard of this successful family adventure movie at school in the late primary grades. It must have been new to the VHS format at the time (meaning I missed its successful theatrical run), and a student in my class brought a copy in for show and tell. I think I was interested in seeing it for months before I finally did. I remember watching it more than once on video in the summer of 1996. After those months of anticipation, I don't think I was let down, even if it did seem weird and scary the first time, with all the chaos. I guess I wasn't used to seeing that in films at the time. I've watched it again twice in recent years, after growing up, and both times, I found that it was still entertaining, unlike some movies I enjoyed in my childhood.In 1969, Alan Parrish is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Brantford, New Hampshire, with an upper class family. One day, after being ambushed by a group of bullies, he hears a mysterious sound of drums coming from a construction site! At the site, he digs up a box, where the sound is coming from, a box which was buried there 100 years earlier! Inside, he finds a board game called Jumanji, and takes it home. When Alan is at home by himself after a falling out with his father, his friend, Sarah Whittle, comes over, and he shows her the game. They begin to play it, not realizing how powerful and dangerous it is! Alan is sucked inside, and Sarah is chased off by bats that come out of the game! 26 years later, two kids, Judy and Peter Shepherd, whose parents have died, move into the old Parrish house with their aunt Nora. The siblings hear the drumming of Jumanji from up in the attic, and find the game. They start playing the game without a clue, just like Alan and Sarah did, and dangerous animals begin to come out of it! Also, Alan is finally released after being trapped in the jungle for 26 years! He learns that the year is 1995, and sadly, his parents have passed away. He must now continue the game with Judy and Peter, and reunite with Sarah. The four of them are all players now, and they must finish the game if things are ever going to go back to normal, which will obviously be very risky! The film starts well with the spooky 1869 sequence, when the box is buried out in the dark. After that, it's usually pretty good around the beginning. During the first of my two latest viewings, I remember finding most of the movie dull before Robin Williams comes in, but with my last viewing, I didn't find that to be the case. There isn't much humour during this part of this film, but there is some suspense. When Williams does make his boisterous entry, that's when the humour starts. After that, there's both excitement, with all the action and chaos, and humour. Williams provides laughs with his antics, but the film doesn't rely entirely on him for the humour. Sarah's reluctance to continue the game in 1995, the scene with Van Pelt, the trigger happy hunter from the game in a gun shop, and Aunt Nora and Officer Carl Bentley witnessing some of the Jumanji animals are also funny. Other merits of ""Jumanji"" include some poignant moments, good CGI effects (even if they're not the best, and have been topped since then), and decent acting, which includes decent child actors, unlike some films. All these things are what I think makes this film good family entertainment.",Jumanji
92,vip_ebriega,Brings back a lot of memories. Still a good ride.,7,4 April 2009,"My Take: A terrific special effects-laden adventure.JUMANJI is among those films I strongly remember from my childhood. Along with JURASSIC PARK and its sequel, JUMANJI is among those films I enjoy watching multiple times just to see creatures wreck havoc on a crowded street, monsters crawl in from the dark and other bits of special effects extravaganza. I strongly remember the elephants and rhinos stampeding around the crowded streets, a giant man-eating flower with vine-like tentacles, those messy (and weakly done CGI) monkeys with antics borrowed from GREMLINS, the crocodile and the shot of the house breaking apart. What I didn't remember was how faulty the dramatic interludes were.Which is exactly the point. JUMANJI is a wildly entertaining special effects extravaganza that works much better that way. Director Joe Johnston, who revived old-fashioned pulp adventures with THE ROCKETEER and later made JURASSIC PARK III so much better than it might have been, is such an accomplished action director. JUMANJI is a terrific and highly entertaining, if sometimes perilous, family adventure, though it does make several rest stops for back-stories and a bit of drama which sacrifices the pacing.The movie opens with two kids in 1969 with two kids curiously playing the titular game board which eventually unleashes African bats in the fireplace and sucking in little Alan Parrish (then played by Adam Hann-Byrd) inside the game. Forward 26 years later, someone else has bought the old Parrish mansion and the two new kids (Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce) dig up the old board game in the dusty old attic and give the dice a little role, and all hell breaks loose in town. With a little help from an older Alan Parrish (now played by Robin Williams) and his now older best friend Sarah (delightfully played by Bonnie Hunt), they try to finish what they started, unleashing more special effects behemoth after another. That's just about the ""plot"" of JUMANJI, yet I can go on forever with its visual treats. While the CGI doesn't live up to today standards (not to mention the totally unconvincing CGI monkeys!), but some of them in particular (including the terrific sequences where elephants and rhinos rampage around town and inside the mansion living room) still are eye candy. And, courtesy of director Johnston, there are still well-orchestrated moments of excitement. Stars Hunt and co-star David Alan Grier as a cop having a bad day provide the laughs. Despite some dull moments, which have a very major thing to do with its weak writing department, JUMANJI is still an amiable piece of entertainment. Still worth a look, but you might have the options of fast-forwarding to the really good parts.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Jumanji
93,one9eighty,Brilliant and beautiful family adventure film,7,28 August 2018,"A child living in an up-and-coming town in the 1960's discovers a crate which was buried a long time ago (1869 - as established at the start of the film). Inside the crate is a board game. One night, he and his friend Sarah, start playing the board game. The board game, however, isn't all it seems to be, as the children soon learn. Allan is sucked into the board game and Sarah is chased out of the house by bats. Twenty six years things are different. The town is a run-down ghost of its previous self, the disappearance of Allan is a folklore in which his dad supposedly cut him into pieces and hid his body parts, and Sarah is a psychic with emotional issues as nobody believed what she witnessed as a child. Allan's old house has new inhabitants. Orphaned children and their aunt are moving in. The children discover the board game and start playing. Unbeknown to them, they free Allan Parrish, now, much older. They also free the board game to continue its mayhem and chaos in a jungle theme. To stop all the mayhem and chaos they must first finish the game, to finish the game they need all the players, including Sarah. All the random events that the board game throws up come face to face with modern 1990's living. This is a great family film from the 1990's and is a lot of fun for everybody. It used special effect techniques at the time which were revolutionary but haven't aged that well. The story and plot too are a bit generic, but are by no means weak - just occasionally predictable (but hey, it's a family film, it's hardly going to randomly kill off half the cast). The casting and acting throughout was good. I'm not usually a fan of Robin Williams because I tended to find his approach a little to full-on and in-your-face, in this film however he has a wider array of emotions to show off. As well as Williams, there are stars of yester-year and the future littered amongst the scenes, notably Kirsten Dunst appears as a child actor here. It's clear to see why this was a blockbuster of its time.Beyond the obvious situations/events on-screen which younger audiences will primarily follow, there are more subtle events unfolding which offer a lot of depth to film savvy minds; such as multiverse's, fragmented realities, time travel, butterfly effects, inanimate objects with powers. Packaged the way it is, there is something for all in this classic. FTR, I'm watching this as an adult in 2018, prior to watching the current Jumanji film, although some of the effects in this original look a little dated, it's nothing that'll put you off. I can confidently say that almost twenty years after it was released, this film is as good as it was in the 1990's. 7 out of 10 from me, thanks for reading and enjoy",Jumanji
94,Stampsfightclub,This is family entertainment,9,3 November 2009,"When two children play a board game a man trapped inside appears and tries to help them finish the game as jungle elements from the game trouble the environment.Shown every Christmas, re-released countless times and still Jumanji never loses its touch with its viewers.This breathtaking imagination of a board game coming to life is as wonderfully exuberant as toys coming to life in Pixar's first film. The concept of a game coming to life is made even more exciting by encoding prospects of deadly animals such as lions, mysterious mosquitoes and violent talented monkeys. Everything is thought of and what a treat we have in our hands.There is now a new definition of family entertainment, known as Pixar. Since releasing Toy Story after this was released they have been dominating the box office with wonderful family tales about sentimental robots, cooking rats and racing cars. And to rewind the clock back 14 years this picture is to be hailed as the beginning of the end.A truly new concept with very little explanation required and a marvellous array of hormonal characters with breathtaking action and enough humour to make you smile, this was and still is marvellous.Family entertainment now either involves a boy with a wand, Harry something, or sitting in your living room watching Simon Cowell make fun of ordinary folk.The reprisal if you want to call it that of non-animated picture was in 2005 where Jon Favreau attempted a step up from this picture, by using the same concept of a board game coming to life and applied it with a sci-fi edge, set in space. Whilst there were moments of good action it boiled down to being a repetitive ideology of this 1995 classic with not enough quick wit and mistimed action sequences with an egregious sentimental intention of brotherly love.This has none of that. There are no overly soppy sentimental parts as the required drama is justified early on. The action continues consistently with first initial deadly elements before the stakes are raised. Van Pelt adds a sharp intake of breath threw his evidently evil hunter, which actually is never properly explained, but that is the point. Nothing is explained, events just happen and we can sit back and enjoy the fun spilling out from every angle.Johnston is the man in the know as the adventure flows with exquisite timing. The scene with the house flood is a perfect example whilst the monkey motorbike stage shows his ability to do comedy.This truly is a remarkable film and is worth watching again and again for its wondrous story, its lovable collection of characters and easy sharp mind. This is family entertainment!",Jumanji
95,Hollywood_Yoda,Jumanji! From Book to Film,8,2 July 2017,"As a child in 1995, this was one of the greatest adventure films for a kid in my generation. The book from where it came, was good, but the filmmakers made the adaptation pretty darn amazing. The fact that Robin Williams starred made the film better, as Robin was a huge draw to family films of that era.Who ever knew that Jumanji would have a cult following or that it would spawn an actual board game (nothing comes to life), and eventually a sequel in 2017. Too bad Robin isn't here to enjoy or be a part of the sequel.Bonnie Hunt also starred alongside Robin in this film as Sarah, but she's not quite as memorable. Sorry! David Alan Grier also co-starred as Carl the police officer, his acting was somewhat more memorable. One of the most memorable acting performances of the film was Jonathan Hyde as Sam Parrish (Alan's dad) and his dual role as Van Pelt (the hunter from Jumanji).In the end, it was a great film, probably felt more now by some since the passing of Robin Williams. But those of us who've loved the film since the beginning know he made the film what it was.",Jumanji
96,juliankennedy23,Roll the dice ... watch people die (well off-screen it is a family film),6,31 August 2019,"Jumanji: 7 out of 10: A cursed board game forces its players to keep playing till the end where every roll of the dice brings a new deadly horror into their world.The Good: Having a cursed board game that forces everyone to finish it or the increasingly deadly horrors will never go away is a great premise for a horror movie. Alas, this is a family comedy starring Robin Williams. The solution from the filmmakers? Make a horror movie and pretend it is a family comedy starring Robin Williams. And in that vein, they kind of pulled it off.I enjoyed myself watching this film. It works much better than it should. Jumanji is greater than the sum of its parts and much of that is due to the general concept of the film. With every roll of the dice, something new and wacky will happen such as giant mosquitos spreading a pandemic or a great white hunter in a large discount store hunting children with his newly acquired assault rifle. You know whacky kids stuff.Did I mention the quicksand floor right out of a Nightmare on Elm Street movie or the murderous knife throwing, gun-toting monkeys right out of Gremlins? Oh, and the now penurious hometown in the future is a dystopian time loop right out of Back to the Future 2. I am telling you if any particular scene isn't your brand of nightmare fuel wait a few minutes and someone will roll the dice and here comes the giant spiders or the rhino charge or Audrey from Little Shop of Horrors will come out to play. And Audrey shoots poisonous barbs like a Triffid as well as swallowing you whole and crushing police cars.The Bad: It is, however, a movie of its time (There is a lot of homelessness and looting two favorite 90's topics). There are unfortunately many things in Jumanji that haven't aged well (For example a gunman shooting up a Walmart style discount store) but for my money, nothing seems as dated as the Home Alone gags.You know this isn't the only movie from the nineties I recently watched that jumped on the Home Alone bandwagon. You would have thought that Mel Brooks' Robin Hood: Men in Tights would have put an arrow through the heart of that gag with its painfully unfunny Home Alone shtick that stuck out in a movie that had plenty of painfully unfunny gags vying for attention. But alas no. Here we are two years later and Jumani is still trying to ride that Home Alone bandwagon.The Ugly: Time often causes false stories to develop around movies. For example, there is an often-told tale that people were initially appalled by Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. They were, according to the tales, storming out of the theater in disbelief and tears. That simply is not true. The initial reaction to Episode 1 was positive. Only over time and after two direct sequels did people reflect back to how bad they felt the movie actually was.I bring this up because I am hearing people claim that the special effects in Jumanji were great for the time and we should not judge them. This is false. I remember seeing the previews for this film when it was released and my opinion at the time and those of others was the special effects looked awful. Time has not been kind to Jumanji's special effects, this is true, but they were pretty god awful at the time as well.What's worse is that they are bad across the board in so many different ways. Highlights from the practical effects include giant spiders that would not be out of place on a shelf at the Hobby Lobby around Halloween and a giant crocodile that would embarrass Disney's World's Jungle Cruise.Of course, the CGI takes this embarrassment to a whole new level. We have a lion that is oversized and simply doesn't look right, the stampeding rhinos and elephants featured in the trailer, (Though in all fairness to Jumanji, Peter Jackson's King Kong, which came out ten years later and had a significantly bigger budget, also managed to stage a horrible CGI stampede.), and of course the monkeys.The monkeys are the Gremlins of Jumanji in more ways than one. They inhabit not quite the uncanny valley per se but a different place where they wouldn't have been out of place in Who Framed Roger Rabbit hanging out with Bugs and Mickey. They are so cartoonish and poorly realized it almost seems an artistic choice. The creatures of Jumanji don't belong in this world so that is why they are so horrible distorted... that sort of thing.Monkey fur is very hard to do in 1995's CGI and the artists working on Jumanji clearly ran out of either money or time (or maybe both). Still, even with these handicaps, they miss the mark by a country mile. One would have thought they might have done some tests preproduction and then opted for a script change at that point.In Conclusion: The overall effect of Jumanji is a positive one. The script is generally well written and the acting is solid across the board with Robin Williams anchoring the piece and solid supporting turns by Jonathan Hyde (in a dual role), Kirsten Dunst, and Bebe Neuwirth in a role so thankless I swear the movie forgets she is even in it. I also liked the ending which was both positive and wrapped up a lot of loose ends such as the hundreds of deaths that result from Robin and the kids playing the game. You know good old family entertainment.",Jumanji

98,fernandoschiavi,"jumanji makes the obstacles of a game real, just as it happens in our imagination when playing with something we like so much, running away from our reality",7,30 January 2021,"The film was one of the sensations in children's cinematography, taking creativity to the thousandth power of the millions of children who experienced the nineties. With an unusual script mixed with different categories of cinema, the film is not only meant to entertain and amuse the audience. The director is concerned with bringing up several problems related to loneliness and bullying in youth, something that only today we fight more effectively to be eradicated. The film follows a balanced and fun script that uses your time and characters well for adventure, humor, action, mysteries and even with some nuances of terror at its climax, taking us on an exciting roller coaster of emotions as we delve deeper into Sarah and Alan, who have been isolated from the world for 26 years, need to join forces with brothers Judy and Peter Shepherd, two young children who have just discovered the mystical and dangerous universe of Jumanji.The mature part of the script by Jonathan Hensleigh, Greg Taylor and Jim Strain is the joke with the issue of youthful loneliness, which was already occurring with Alan and which is more palpable now with Peter / Judy, as it is an orphanage for both, a fact also affects adult Alan. His trip to his father's former shoe factory is a thorough demonstration of how cruel adult life can be and how terrible existence must have been for more than a quarter of a century on the continent of Jumanji. Even the issues of the game are subordinate to this feeling of desolation of the characters of both generations.
The film is directed by Joe Johnston, who has extensive experience in visual effects and usually directs adventures of great pace and full of nostalgic charge, having captained works such as ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989)"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)"". His skills yield fantastic fruits in the feature, with the frantic sequence of events balanced with humorous tones and character development enough for us to care for them. In the first act, director Joe Johnston presents two sequences of scenes in two different periods, one with two boys trying to get rid of the board and the other with the tragic consequence of a move, establishing right away how dangerous the game is and with that attract public curiosity. This choice of director shows the priority of the plot, since the script, written by Jonathan Heinsleigh, Greg Taylor and Jim Strain, chooses to highlight the course of the game and the obstacles it provides. A wise decision in the scope of entertainment, allowing even more the use of special effects and the construction of several action scenes, but not so much to create a rich plot where all the characters are well developed. In addition, some characters who have significant screen space, such as Aunt Sheperd, are ignored at the end of the film.Even prioritizing showing the game's development, this choice would only work with efficient special effects, otherwise none of the threats would seem convincing. Therefore, the director merges the use of mechanical effects (which use real props), such as, for example, the carnivorous plant that comes out of the fireplace, but also effects generated by computer graphics, such as monkeys that end up serving as a comic relief, the that it is not shown to be a correct decision, since the difference between these two resources on the scene is stark, with a feeling of strangeness. There is a mix of good effects with others that have aged extremely badly during the projection. Despite this, the production design is efficient in making the Parrish mansion an increasingly hostile place, inserting props on the stage that emphasize how the house is being taken by nature, reaching its climax at the climax of the work. Finally, the composer James Horner, who has worked in films such as ""Aliens"" and ""Cocoon"", creates a score that highlights the adventurous tone of the work.The fantastic aura established in the film recalls the style of telling that John Hughes used in his films. Jumanji's moral background is anchored in the usual themes of childhood fantasies: loneliness, the difficulties of maturing, the absence or emotional distance of his parents (the characters of Alan's strict father and the tireless hunter who chased him for years in the jungle of Jumanji, not for nothing, are experienced by the same actor) and the escape from reality. Be Alan and his evolution from an isolated child to an adult brutalized by the need to have been forced to manage alone at a very young age; be it Sarah, who became a paranoid and antisocial woman as a beautiful and popular girl - all the characters there suffer from growing up, including the couple of children of the new generation, who now live with their aunt after losing their parents in an accident. The game will end up serving as a catalyst for all of them to face their ghosts while fighting for survival in a world that has suddenly turned upside down and is now invaded by elements and situations that are beyond their understanding. Although very rhythmic and didactic, the script gradually intertwines these two sides and manages to give a minimum of dramatic weight to convince the viewer to buy that crazy story and cheer for those characters.However, what really captures the audience's attention is the great chemistry between the four protagonists and the choice of Robin Williams as the main character was the right one possible, since the actor's charisma is unparalleled, creating an Alan who conveys confidence when dealing with all the obstacles in front of you. But the merits are not only with Williams, Kirsten Dunst already showed his full potential to act, building a very ironic Judy with the others and Bonnie Hunt is able to show Sarah's traumas for having witnessed the disappearance of her friend when she was young. The chemistry, especially between Williams and the children, works from the first contact. Despite the presence of the renowned Robin Williams, much of the comedy stays with David Alan Grier, who is an adult policeman frustrated to see his dreams go down the drain. He sometimes exaggerates a little in some scenes, but maintains a good balance in general, bringing humanity to the changes undergone by the city after the shoe factory, its biggest source of income, went bankrupt. Returning from his ""prison"" to find this desolate setting, with his house occupied by third parties and his parents, who have passed away, yield singular moments of drama.Joe Johnston's direction inserts that blockbuster style that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg made popular in the 80s and made the afternoon sessions of the 90s so legendary, with a good targeting of various elements, such as dramatic charge, fascination and fear for fantasy, in addition to a light tone and a lot of excitement while not forgetting to develop each protagonist amid the confusions experienced in history. Jumanji has become a classic and is idolized by many people due to his adventurous style, full of humor and charisma and that still manages to lead us to walk through various emotions throughout the film, playing with puzzles and fantasies in an exciting and fun way.The interesting thing about this whole mess is the narrative ease with which Johnston manages to explore the entire Jumanji universe, without sticking to many explanations about the properties and origins of the game and simply introducing a footless and headless concept that sooner or later he starts to make some sense. The center is obviously in the game and in the deadly traps that it will launch against each player with each new round, freeing gigantic poisonous spiders, hungry lions, a wild herd of wild animals, or causing the ground to spill into quicksand, or causing rain. tropical species capable of causing a flood inside a mansion, including a free gift crocodile. This encounter between the western cosmopolitan of our reality and the savagery of an African jungle in the Jumanji universe allows the director to improvise situations of contrasting visual appeals, as well as good sequences of adventure and terror, such as the invasion of monkeys in the city, which take over off the roads and even ride motorcycles and dress like cops.The work barely explores the traumas of its main characters, but despite this, the script inserts elements in the plot that enable the construction of a message at the end to reflect both parents and children, showing the negative effects that a fight can trigger and regret that a harsh word to someone we love can bring. One of the phrases written on the game board is: ""for you who want to escape from your world""; of course this is taken literally in the story, but it perfectly represents the spirit of playing something captivating, especially in childhood. For this reason, Jumanji was so successful with the audience, because it makes the obstacles of a game real, just as it happens in our imagination when playing with something we like so much, running away from our reality. It is a very functional and simple adventure, which today seems to be an increasingly scarce case in American children's cinema, which ends up plastered in very detailed rationalizations, in addition to the lack of true charisma in its characters. Although he gets lost there, he understands that the basic thing about a film like this is to know how to build an initial suspense capable of arousing interest and then simply embark on nonsense without getting involved in much explanation. The beauty of being a child is in imagining, and imagination does not require logic, only courage and purity, and to play a game of Jumanji you only need to want, not understand.",Jumanji
99,aesgaard41,Incredible !,9,11 December 2001,"I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie.",Jumanji

In the meantime, they also free a man who has been trapped in the game for a long time and must try to convince him to help them end it.It's a movie which presents an interesting idea, that of a magical game which interacts with the world, together with the events that it triggers along the way. Its plot is good, slowly presenting events from the past in which the game is involved, going all the way to the present where most of the action occurs. It's not something that will blow your mind, being quite linear and sometimes predictable, but it does a good job in maintaining a good atmosphere, generating emotion, while also providing a satisfying finale.The characters portrayed are well played and likeable, making the adventure worthwhile. You get to care for their fate and this is a must have in such a movie. Robin's characters is the main attraction as far as I'm concerned, which manages to make you smile or laugh most of the time, without even trying too hard. His charm is well used in the film, especially in the company of the two kids.While I wasn't impressed by the animations and the creatures, I still have to give credit to the producers, judging by the year of the movie's production. They have done a great work though, managing to portray plenty of creatures using not so advanced technology, like we have today.It's a movie which I personally like. While it might have not aged as well as I hoped, it still has a story which intrigued me, brought plenty of emotions throughout, while being quite entertaining in the process.

Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good.There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid.With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him.Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him.What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film.Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good.",Jumanji
104,rebeljenn,Creative story but events/humour gets old quickly,5,31 December 2005,"'Jumanji' is a film about a board game that becomes real. It's an original and creative idea, but I think it gets old pretty quickly. By the end of the film, I had had enough of Robin Williams; Robin Williams is okay in small doses, but I find his humour in a particular film to get old pretty quickly. I felt that this happened in 'Jumanji'. It's probably a film that children will appreciate more than adults. There is some good humour in it involving jungle-related incidents like rampage monkeys and quicksand and growing vines. It's a creative and original idea, and it's one that they are going to do again but this time with a space-themed board game instead of a jungle-themed one. Kids will probably really enjoy it, but I think adults will get board quickly when faced with the same humour and same situations. Not bad, but not excellent either.",Jumanji
105,manitobaman81,Good,7,19 August 2014,"Great performances help to enhance this amazing story. This is one of those movies that Williams isn't only in for the paycheck. This is a story about a place most people might not be able to conceive, and Williams is one of the world's supreme artistic talents. Are there annoying things in this movie? Yes, like the overdone character of the hunter. The story is nothing special but exceptional performance from most of the cast, realism and the weird mood it puts you in make it a must-see masterpiece. In its category it is amongst the best. Williams carries this movie and saves it from being a disaster with his physical slapstick.",Jumanji
106,grahamsj3,"Underrated, I think",7,7 February 2005,"This film is a lot better than others have ranked it. It deserves more than a 6 average. I gave it a 7 and believe it's underrated. The basic story is that years ago, while a child, Robin Williams was transported into the game he was playing at the time and trapped there. Later, two other children find the game board and play it, releasing a now grown up Williams, along with all sorts of dangerous animals and vines and stuff. These things threaten mankind and it's up to Williams, along with Bonnie Hunt, to find a way to stop these things from killing off man. There's a good bit of suspense and with every move the heroic folks make, something counteracts it and things nearly always end up being worse than before. They finally determine that the only way to end the horror is to finish the game that Williams started all those years ago. Now, if they could only find the game board. This is a well written adaptation of a popular book, and I found it quite entertaining.",Jumanji
107,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,8,23 June 2014,"Fun family film about a magical board game that hosts many dangers that can only be stopped when a player finishes. The entire cast does their job well, but the only one not interchangeable is Hyde in a double-role as the main character's wealthy stern father and a big-game hunter (hint: intentional parallel). Entertaining from start to finish, but even children in 1995 were likely very aware that the scary creatures on screen were nothing more than special-effects—because of this, it's difficult to ever get lost in the delicious chaos despite all the funny moments and thrills. Still, despite its flaws, the story is interesting enough for the whole family enjoy and the film is good enough to be replayed every few years.*** (out of four)",Jumanji
108,Darkside-Reviewer,A Classic Robin Williams movie,8,16 July 2020,Jumanji was one of my favourite movies when I was a kid growing up in the 90s. I got the VHS for my birthday not long after it's release and I ending up watching it almost every weekend after the Saturday morning cartoons were over along with every other movie in my VHS collection.As an adult I still watch this movie every so often and I still enjoy it as much as I did when I was a kid only now I have a bigger appreciation for the unique story and the fun cast of characters which includes the late Robin Williams.Robin Williams is still the best part of the movie Williams always gave his best performance in every movie he was a part of and Jumanji is no exception. Williams brings his light hearted and fun comedic performance to his role but he also has some very heartfelt and serious scenes in the movie that really show Williams talent as an actor when Williams is on screen you can't help but laugh and smile that was always his gift on and off camera he was a great person to be around.This is a family friendly movie but honestly I think adults enjoy it as much as the kids do while the jokes are light hearted and silly there are some serious moments in the movie that only adults will really understand. Robin Williams unique style of comedy and physical comedy will have both adults and kids laughing till there sides hurt.This is the perfect family movie to watch and enjoy with popcorn and blankets on family movie night a true classic that remains one of best family friendly movies to come out of the 90s.,Jumanji
109,Min111,It's a dangerous game,8,23 January 2020,"This was a fantastic movie. Everyone likes this movie. It was very entertaining for a large part. It gets better and better, as well as more interesting as the movie progresses. It was all due to that board game of course, and what a board game it was. The game, gets very challenging every time, and I like how they somehow succeed. You, the viewer, too, are always waiting for their next challenge. It feels like you are also part of the game, as well as adventure. That's what I liked about this movie. The movie, Jumanji, was very entertaining from start to finish, and it gets more entertaining every time. My favourite challenge or game was the stampede. Some of the others were scary such as the guy that chases them later. I didn't like the spiders introduced in this game - I hated that. Basically, the game, Jumanji was a good game to see. I like the board game though - the way it looks. Really like the design of the board itself. But I always wondered where the game came from? And who or what made the game? These are some unanswered questions which I think needs to be addressed. I think there needs to be a new movie where it answers these new questions - that would be nice. I don't think it will ever happen of course. The actors, as well as actresses were brilliant, especially Robin Williams, who played Alan. His character, Alan, almost knew like what he was doing, and that was of no surprise considering he was sucked into the board game in the very first place.",Jumanji
110,raybennetthays,Classic with one of my favorite performances,10,24 April 2021,"Robin Williams is a master in this movie, and this movie is hilarious and fun! With some decent production value.",Jumanji
111,richieandsam,A great movie,7,14 August 2014,"JUMANJII loved this movie when it first came out and I still love it today!The movie is about a boy who finds a board game called Jumanji. When he takes it home and starts to play it with a friend, he soon realises that this is no ordinary game. He gets sucked into the game and is not released again until 26 years later 2 more kids find the game and release him. Now he is grown up and has to find a way to end this game before everything it releases destroys the town.Due to the sad passing of the genius that was Robin Williams, the TV channels have decided to show all of his movies. Jumanji was the first one I saw. The story to this film is like not her that I had seen before. It was an original idea (unless there is another film I don't know about) that was just so imaginative. It works really well and has a great adventure element about it.The effects are average. This was made in the mid 90s so that probably has something to do with it. The animals were obviously not real. You could see the lion was so mechanical it made me laugh. And the other animals were so obviously computer generated. But it was comical and that just added to the fun of the film.The acting was great. The main character was played by Robin Williams. He was as energetic and full of character in this role, just like he brought to every role he took. Other cast members were Jonathan Hyde, a young Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bonnie Hunt. Bonnie Hunt was brilliant. Her reaction and facial expressions made me laugh a few times in this. Another stand out performance was by David Alan Grier. David was so funny as the cop. His comedy timing was excellent and deserves a mention.This film really does keep you entertained throughout and is just a lot of fun to watch... Even now nearly 20 years later.I will give this 7 out of 10.Normally I end my reviews with a quote from the movie, but this time I just want to say how gutted I am about the news of Robins death. I am a fan of his work. I watched Mork and Mindy when I was a kid and grew up watching Jumanji, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam, Jack etc... There were so many great films that he made. I always saw Robin as so full of energy and full of life. He had one of the greatest smiles in Hollywood and when i saw an interview with him, he seemed so chirpy and happy. It just shows that in front of the camera, you never know what is going on in people's heads. I was sad to hear he had been suffering from depression. Depression is such a deadly illness. I know this sounds stupid, but I am gutted that I was not there to talk to him, help him. I hate to think that he felt so alone, especially as he had millions of fans all over the world that knew him on screen. He made the world laugh out loud so many times. Even through bad times in my life, watching his movies has put a smile on my face. Robin deserved much more happiness than he got. He gave so much to me and the rest of the world and it doesn't seem right that he should end his life this way. I will miss seeing new movies from him, but will always continue to go back to enjoy his old ones. Robin will live on in my house and he will always continue to make me smile. R.I.P. Robin Williams.",Jumanji
112,hellholehorror,Nostalgia,5,2 April 2018,Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005) is a slightly better version of this because the pace is a lot more frenetic and they have cut out some of the frustrating junk that was in Jumanji. Having said that I thought that this was entertaining after the pointlessly slow start. It could have done with a few trims in the middle and a bit less off the end too. Enjoyable through nostalgia and fun adventure that would be improved through a child's eyes. After a wooden start this improves to be an entertaining fantasy that is a bit too long.,Jumanji
113,DavidSim240183,A fairly lively jungle jaunt.,8,27 March 2005,"I think when Jumanji was released ten years ago, it was probably an attempt to cash in on the recent success of Jurassic Park. Both films have similar ideas. Using CGI effects to bring all manner of creatures to life. Although not quite as successful as JP, I still found Jumanji an exciting film.Beginning in 1869, in the town of Brantford, New Hampshire, two boys are hurriedly trying to bury something in the woods. This certain something doesn't take kindly to it, and protests in the form of jungle drums. Just before they leave, they pray for the poor soul who should ever find it.We cut to 1969, when young boy Alan Parrish is drawn to a construction site by the mysterious sound of jungle drums. It leads him to a chest. When he opens it, he finds a board game, JUMANJI. Alan has no way to know he is about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime!Showing the game to his best friend Sarah, they become enthralled in the game's seemingly magical powers. It's pieces move by themselves. Words appear in a crystal at the centre. And things have a tendency to come out of it when they roll the dice. Things take a nasty turn when after Alan rolls a 5, the game pulls him into it, where he remains trapped for 26 years.A new family move into Alan's home, Judy (Kirsten Dunst), Peter, and their aunt Nora (a woefully underused Bebe Neuwirth). The game calls to them as it did Alan and Sarah, and they end up releasing giant mosquitoes, a group of mischievous monkeys, a ferocious lion, and a fully grown Alan Parrish (Robin Williams).Alan barely has time to register how much time has passed when he realises there are more rules to JUMANJI then he thought. Everything that has come out of the game so far will stay in our world until a player reaches the end. But getting to the end is easier said than done. The more moves they make, the more dangerous things come out of the game. Reuniting with an adult Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), our foursome must tackle JUMANJI'S dangers and finish the game once and for all.Although there's not much to Jumanji plot-wise (a trait it shares with Jurassic Park), there are enough thrills and spills going on you'll barely have time to notice. No sooner have our heroes survived one deadly encounter, the film throws in another. That type of dynamic is really what drives the film, and there are times where Jumanji feels repetitive.But it has a decent cast to carry things along nicely. Robin Williams plays it relatively straight, but then I usually prefer his more dramatic roles to his larger than life ones, so it didn't bother me. And compared to most of the sugary shite he was churning out during this period, Jumanji was a nice change of pace. Bonnie Hunt adds some of her own comic touch, who's been left a nervous wreck after witnessing what happened to Alan as a child.The children are not that bad either. That's one thing I like about Joe Johnston's films. The children in his films actually have a shred of dignity to their characters, and are not nearly as precocious as they might have been in the hands of a less able director.Jumanji is certainly imaginative. We get quite a menagerie of creatures on display. Stampeding elephants and rhinos. Giant spiders. Man-eating plants and vines. This could all be a mite too scary for younger kids. But I first saw Jumanji at the age of 12, and I loved it. There are nice touches of humour throughout that help offset the scarier scenes. And there's a funny running gag about a policeman's car that gets slowly wrecked by the different things coming out of the game.Unfortunately, when it comes to the CGI, the effects are nowhere near as dazzling as Jurassic Park's dinosaurs. The filmmakers just haven't got the hang of using CGI. The monkeys especially look fake. And some of the animatronics could have been handled better. Those spiders are very jerky when they move.But the film more than makes up for its shortcomings in the action scenes. Joe Johnston seems to get a certain glee watching his CGI creations running rampant destroying everything, in much the same way Joe Dante did in Gremlins.It's certainly not a boring film. The indoor monsoon is my favourite part, where Alan has to wrestle a crocodile! It's fairly inventive too, when Alan nearly gets swallowed up after the floor turns to quicksand. And the earthquake. Brilliant!If you can simply switch your brain to autopilot and try not to think too much, you'll be in for a fun ride. Overall, Jumanji may be a bit shallow, but you'll find it difficult not to get sucked in.",Jumanji

115,lordzedd-3,Wish they had more Jumanji history,8,9 December 2006,"My only real complaint with Jumanji is where did this game come from? Who created it? I really wish they could have discovered more about the game's past, it's history. Then it would have made a little more sense. But I'm not saying I didn't like it. On the contrary, I do enjoy it very much, I think it's a cool buried treasure. The characters, the story, the effects all perfect. The cast does a great job in this movie and the concept of a strange magical board game works. I wish there was more monster animals. But the man eating plant and the giant spiders is enough to put it on my page. Robin Williams does great in this first monster movie, wish he do more. But that's just me. Anyway, in conclusion ladies and jelly spoons. This is an assume movie and you can do much worse then Jumanji. 8 STARS.",Jumanji

Funny thing is that my reaction of special effects fluctuates between two extremes, 'Gosh, it's hard to tell which part is digitally illustrated.' and 'It looks so fake haha.' when I look at the details.However, the adventures of four characters are exciting. Rhinoceros to crocodiles to mosquitoes. 'Jumaji' successfully brings the jungle to my room, all the settings and actions. How they escape from each assignment from Jumanji is interesting as well.

It is hard to see why. OK, the effects weren't at the level of Jurassic Park. What made this movie fun was the original storyline and the enjoyable performances. The actors are well cast in their likable roles. This is the perfect adventure film for youngsters. JUMANJI is one hell of a roller-coaster ride that I highly recommend. P.S.: Roger Ebert gives it *1/2 out of **** and says it is unappropriate for children. Why, why, why? Every kid I know adores this film. Some critics just don't make any sense.

133,coolantic,A Gem,9,26 June 2018,"Can't believe it's more han 20 years since I saw this. I'd taken my wife and daughter to the local multi to see Sense and Sensibility ( Bleaghh!). Jumanji was about to start on another screen and I was intrigued by the blurb so rather than go back home I purchased a ticket. So glad I did. I was treated to a hugely entertaining evening of good, old-fashioned story-telling .
Basically, the story, which starts in the 1960s, is about Alan, a lonely, ostracised boy who finds an old jungle-themed board game. He plays it at home with his one friend Sarah, a local neighbourhood girl. However, little do they know that the game is magically interactive. Each throw of the dice has a consequence, one of which is that Alan is banished to the jungle until someone throws a 5 or 8. But, as he is sucked into the playboard, his companion flees in terror leaving him stranded for 26 years. Moving forward to the present day, the semi-derelict house is occupied by two orphaned children and their aunt. Naturally the kids find the game and, by playng release the now-adult Alan. He is overjoyed, but then realises that the game must be completed if everything is to return to normal. And the first thing he has to do is to coax Sarah, regarded as the local mad woman, to come back and take her turn. Then follows a series of special-effects driven wild adventures, involving monkeys, bats, lions, a stampede, quicksand, killer vines, giant spiders, floods and a big-game hunter who's prey is - Alan. Needless to say, it all ends well and Alan and girlfriend are returned to their sixties childhood.
Now, I have never been a fan of Robin Williams. I think he was far too self-indulgent. But for once, he plays it straight. No impro characters or funny voices. His performance has, at times, a wonderful pathos. Especially when he realises his parents had died of broken-hearts while he was missing. In fact,the film has more than a touch of It's A Wonderful Life about it,in that Alan is ultimately able to rectify and adjust certain things once equilbrium is restored. Definitely one worth watching.",Jumanji
134,RhapsodyReviews,It's Fun.,7,27 December 2019,"Review:
'Jumanji' is a fantasy-adventure film directed by Joe Johnston. It is an adaptation of the children's book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg
This is far from a perfect film, but man do I still enjoy this film. It's very cheesy and a lot of things that happen don't really make sense. You just can't help but love every minute of it. I remember seeing this movie years ago and although the CG is quite dated, I had a lot of fun re-watching this after so many years.
The story centers on a supernatural board game that releases jungle-based hazards upon its players with every turn they take. As a boy in 1969, Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) became trapped inside the game itself while playing with his best friend Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Twenty-six years later, in 1995, siblings Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) find the game, begin playing and then unwittingly release the now-adult Alan. After tracking down Sarah, the quartet resolves to finish the game in order to reverse all of the destruction it has caused.
Let's talk about the characters for a minute. I really enjoyed all of them, but the stand outside are of course Alan Parish played by Robin William's and the other is Carl Bentley played by David Alan Grier. I really enjoyed his character and it was a lot of he was so funny! I really don't like Kirsten Dunst, and this movie still does nothing for her.
The movie has a pretty good mix of action, comedy and drama. Alan's story is pretty sad when you think about it, but what works so damn well here is Robin Williams. again! He's not his normal laugh out loud self in this one, but he definitely has a lot of one-liners that just work and bring a lot of heart to the film. The movie is so much fun from start to finish. I haven't seen it in years, and I'm very glad I watched it again. Although, it should lose points for having the creepy as spider scene!
Overall, this movie is a great movie. I loved this movie a lot as a kid and I still enjoyed watching it today. If you've gone out and seen the sequel or are planning on checking it out don't forget to check this one out first!

As I was 34, my first reaction was that there was too much screaming.But there's much here for an imaginative youngster (or oldster) to enjoy. The script is generally witty, and except for the screaming, parents will not be bored watching it -- and if they squint their minds eyes enough to remember what they enjoyed before puberty, they'll get a nostalgic rush.This is everything family entertainment should be.  And though it does involve the supernatural, it is presented in a negative light and none of the characters relish being part of it.",Jumanji

138,patrick_dunne,"Probably not perfect, but very fun",7,27 November 2005,"Jumanji is a highly imaginative and very fun movie. The visuals are good, and the story is creative and exciting.The storyline consists of a man being sucked into a board game. 26 years later, two kids find the board game and set him free. However, the game board has already released a few dangers, and those dangers must be stopped. The only way to do that is to finish the board game, and the animals (or whatever else was released from the game) will be put back into the game.There is action and minor thrills, and the movie emerges as being a fun experience. It's kind of creative, and it's an excellent adventure film.

140,AnishMisra,Jumanji Review,7,14 October 2017,"Jumanji is a film directed by Joe Johnston based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg. Now I wasn't quite excited to see the films considering the reviews. But I did enjoy Zathura, the spiritual sequel to this film so I deiced to give it a go. And to my surprise I was quite entertained by the film.Plot: Judy and Peter play a board game to some disastrous results.Story and direction: The film opens up with 2 children from 1869 burying something and saying that whoever opens this up may God be with them. I mean this scene was basically not necessary. The film could have opened from 1969 with our protagonist Alan Parrish. We see Alan's world where he is bullied a lot and hides in his father's shoe factory. There we are introduced to Carl who I think was not necessary for the film in the first place. Then we see Alan taking the Jumanji game to his home and opening it. in the meanwhile, we see Alan's parents deciding to send him to boarding school to which he objects and decides never to talk to them again. Then Alan and Sarah begin to play the game when Alan gets sucked into it and Sarah getting scared runs for her life. Then the film takes a 26 year leap, where we are introduced to 2 new characters Peter and Judy, who have been given a quite nice back story. They open up the game and while they playing Alan comes out of it. Then we are taken on a joyride where the try to finish the game with a now grown Sarah. Now the thing that felt awful in the film was the CGI. It felt like you were watching some big patches of imagery that were just pasted onto the screen. Then I guess the Van Pelt character. He was just too laughable for me. And was wasted a lot. And finally, the revised 1995 version wherein some things were not explained rightly, according to me.Performances: Robin Williams made me remember that why I will be remembering him as a great actor. His comic timing was spot on. RIP Sir Williams. Bonnie Hunt was also great as Sarah. Kirsten Dunst was a great child artist in the film. So as Bradley Pierce.Favirite Scene: The scene where Alan pops up to save Peter and Judy from a lion and his joy that he has returned home after 26 years of being trapped in the game. Robin Williams just acted so great in this scene.Verdict: Although with some misses, Jumanji is a very much watchable film. I enjoyed my time with this movie.I am going with a 7.5/10",Jumanji

As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is ""better"" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated.

146,smashattack,A little adventurous... and childish.,6,26 February 2002,"Jumanji is a great idea.  The movie has great potential and could have turned out excellent and a true action classic.However, some aspects of the movie prevent that.  For example, the monkeys in the kitchen and abroad hardly look like monkeys.  They look like warped, evil, demonic beings with fur and tails that were only made to cause mischief.  Well, sure, you might say that's what the game meant to do, but come on... I think they should have used real monkeys here.Certain parts of the dialogue are a little corny and make one feel as though we're watching ""Spy Kids"", which can sometimes really ruin the feel that they're in a life-or-death situation.The acting was great (some parts it was not), and as usual, Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst put on an above-average performance.The action and crashes and other sequences are a contradiction, in a way. Here we have fake-looking monkeys, but superbly crafted action.The music, composed by James Horner, is quite dull and does not help get you into the spirit of the movie.  A lower-than-average job on his part.Overall, this movie is really good.  I would suggest watching it if you can get past some annoying areas of the movie.",Jumanji
147,margulanabutrlov,Jumanji Review,10,23 March 2019,"Two kids (Dunst and Bradley), bored on a wet afternoon, discover an ancient board game and being to play. By magic, the game unleashes jugle beasts and flora into their New England home, along with a man who has been trapped inside the game for a quarter of a century (Williams).
Though entertaining, Jumanji - adapted from an idiosyncratic children's book by Chris Van Allsburg - feels more like a package than a movie: Jurassic Park-style CGI effects, Gremlins-style childhood traumas, Honey I Shrunk the Kids-style Joe Johnston direction and Robin Williams-style Robin Williams. On a scene by scene basis, it is mostly great fun but suffers from a contrived script which repetitively drags characters back to the eponymous magical board game for another effect-producing throw of the dice.
The story opens in 1869 with some kids burying the magical game Jumanji but without explaining who made it or what it's for, as if that stuff were being left for the sequel, then flashes to 1969 where the thing is rediscovered by mixed-up rich kid Alan (Adam Hann-Byrd) and a few turns unleash African bats into New Hampshire and send Alan off to jungle hell. A quarter of a century later, the film finally starts proper as orphans Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce restart the game and unleash the grown up Alan (Williams) along with a collection of flora and fauna that run riot through the town, causing chaos.
The CGI creeping vines, capering monkeys, attacking alligators, fluttering bats, hungry lions and stampeding hordes are genuinely amazing: as hyper-real and odd looking as Van Allsburg's original illustrations. For once, the strange look of CGI is turned to its advantage as the jungle animals are supposed to be fantastical. A major trick is missed, however, by having the sole human to emerge from Jumanji to be a regular actor rather than an effect. This undermines the weirdness and allows Jonathan Hyde - who does a Captain Hook-like double as Alan's tyrannical father and a gun-toting white hunter - to overact shamelessly through too many slapstick stunts.
There is quite a lot going on in the film, which disguises the thinness of the central idea (African chaos erupts from board game at every turn). Williams' Tarzan act is a reprise of his Peter Pan and the less-than-stellar supporting cast - with the exception of the excellent Hann-Byrd and an amusing Bonnie Hunt as Williams' neurotic old girlfriend - just gape in amazement or consternation as the effects boys run rampant.",Jumanji
148,krdement,Epitome of Moronic Hollywood Film-Making,2,2 May 2008,"A previous reviewer wrote:""A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie.""I agree in part and disagree in part with that comment. The problem is impossible to pinpoint, because there are PLENTY of ""big problems"" with this movie!""Random hazard generator"" is the PERFECT description of the ancient board game! Random hazard after random hazard until the game ends is what is supposed to pass for ""plot"" in this movie. Did anybody count how many times the game board fell out of and back into the players' hands? That, too is supposed to pass for tension.Ultimately, the film fails because there isn't any development of the back story. What was the origin of the game? Now, that would have been an interesting question to explore! And how does the game work? All we ever see is the game's projection of ""random hazards"" OUTWARD into the reality of the players, but somehow Alan (Robin Williams) apparently was sucked INTO the game. How did that happen, and why doesn't it happen to any of the current players of the game?Actually, the guy in the pith helmet is, more or less, the human villain in this movie, but he is never more than an inexplicable, evil cartoon. Was he, too sucked into the game like Alan, or is he the sole human ""random hazard"" generated by the game? Why is he so determined, not to hunt animals, but to MURDER Alan? The film just glosses over the fact that this sub-plot is actually one of premeditated murder! The hunter guns for Alan simply because the plot demands it. But the movie makes no attempt whatever to explain the character. Never once did I sense any genuine emotional chemistry among the characters. Just a bunch of actors acting - not INTERACTING. The love story sub-plot felt obligatory, never genuine. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt never generated enough chemistry to make me care whether Alan and Sarah got together in the predictable end.All in all, this film has the germ of an interesting idea that is really wasted by focusing on mindless, non-stop ""random hazards,"" poor CGI effects, ""lots of screaming and running around"" and insufficient character development. Except for the precise nature of each ""random hazard,"" the whole film was disappointingly predictable, including the cliché of the almost-kiss in the midst of peril routine. How many zillion times has that been used? The dialog is a similarly endless stream of clichés.The issue was never HOW the game would end - but WHEN. The more interesting issues were never even glanced at. This kind of movie can only appeal to people raised on video games. It was generated by that kind of adventure-for-the-sake-of-adventure mentality, and it has that same kind of feel.",Jumanji
149,matlefebvre20,When your life hangs on a simple roll of dice...,6,25 July 2006,"NOTE: this comment is provided by Christopher Dorian and Peter Rhydon.When young Alan Parish and his friend Sarah Wittle sat in Alan's living room and began playing to that strange game named ""Jumanji"", neither them, nor the audience, could have expected what was coming after.Because ""Jumanji"" is not your parents' ""Payday"". The game instructions are simple: roll the dice and the player who reaches the end first is the winner. It's just in-between that things go a little bit different...What was just a little game meeting transforms into a special effects extravaganza, filled with all sorts of creatures and eye-catching action scenes and stunts that seem to be borrowed from the best moments of the Indiana Jones adventures.The computerized special FX are the main aspects of the movie and they mostly succeed to their task. While they may look archaic today, remember that these visual tricks were created in 1995, and that computer-driven movies were a new sensation. Looking at the lion's faces isn't completely interesting, but it's worth the effort.Action scenes are well conceived, well acted, and well pictured. Particularly memorable is the crocodile fight in the flooded house, with the characters trying to defend themselves like the Orca crew in ""Jaws"".Those two points are tightly linked with one man: director Joe Johnston, who previously made ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" and ""The Pagemaster"". He clearly shows that his former employers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had a huge effect on him and that he gets inspiration from those two phenomenons. And when we see the final result, we could feel that Johnston could become a phenomenon too.But it isn't the case. And why? Because ""Jumanji"" relies on a quicksand storyline and poor lines, because characters are occasionally believable and because action scenes are not epic in the Star Wars or Indiana Jones style. The concept is excellent, but the developed elements are not on the same level. Characters are often performing in cliché and predictable scenes, instead of innovative situations.If we talk about the actors, one should prevail from the others: Robin Williams. Even if his grinning smile looks stuck on his face like The Joker, he is a convincing jungle raider and his performance is fantastic, whatever it is for dramatic, terrifying or comic moments.What is also good about the film is that it can be enjoyed by people from all ages. Children will be delighted and excited by the animals depicted here and adults will enjoy the magnitude of the special effects employed during the film. The dialog is generally well suited for a general audience and there is no real troubling or disturbing moment.It's good to see that the '90s still deals with that kind of stuff. Technological developments imply more and more sophisticated video games of all kinds, but it's heart-warming to see that classic board games can provide excitement like this. After seeing that movie, playing ""Monopoly"" would seem to be like a tea party or some other kind of silly joke.",Jumanji

Okay, the actual transformation did not work perfectly, but I insist that it was still a straight accomplishment that had 1. a nice cast, 2. sustainable visual effects and achievements, 3. a great story, 4. both funny and entertaining sequences, that even made you pause and think sometimes, which I regard as a major attainment of any movie.

Jumanji simply put is a bundle of fun, why analyse a film like this? Truth is you shouldn't, just sit back and let the wacky action take you away..., it has wild animals, a dangerous board game and a throwback from the 19th century, intent on murdering Alan (poor Robin Williams!) So as a child Alan discovers a board game called Jumanji, but this is no ordinary game, he enlists his good friend Sarah to play it with him, unfortunately for the poor lad, he rolls the wrong number and gets sucked into the game, for many years. Years later, two kids Judy and Peter rediscover the game that had been hidden and decide to play, quickly releasing Alan from his jungle prison, from here on in the action is frantic and joyous, with a race around town, an adult Sarah joining the game and many-many mishaps as the quartet anxiously try to complete the game and get to the end. Who on earth thought a film about a board game could be so good? Masterful, cute and camp comedy by the legend of the genre helps to lift the film up to lofty heights, a very young Kirsten Dunst and an always reliable Bonnie Hunt put in professional performances as well..., a proper Sunday afternoon film that's a surefire way to boost moral. For 1995 when Jumanji was released, the special effects and computer generated imagery were spectacular, to make the variety of animals appear so lifelike was amazing..., the carnage that spreads across town was well shot and the cinematographer and art department team had a real good eye for detail. There's a new Jumanji film soon to be released, kind of a sequel to this film starring The Rock, but the new film will have to go some way to living up to the original, I doubt it will be anywhere near the quality and enjoyment that this film possesses, The Rock instead of Robin Williams, and that's going to work how?

A family friendly fantasy action thriller.There is so much magic in the movie, it is so close and intense. It is full of great shots, great performances, where the actors, Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt in particular, but also all others including the child actors. Actually, Kirsten Dunst and Laura Bell Bundy are particularly impressive child actors with terrific presence.It does drag a bit sometimes, in sequences where you just wish the heroes would be more efficient, where you get a bit of a ""oh no, not again"" when the story gets delayed again by similar problems. This affects my rating a little bit, but most of the complications that delay the story are called for, so it isn't a great problem. The average action movie is a whole lot worse.Although the movie can be slightly scary for small children, it has no profanity whatsoever, some violence but no blood and gore. But it has a lot of humor, particularly visual humor, and much of it is actually funny. Very family friendly. I recommend it.",Jumanji

155,nmholland,"Not the Best, But A Very Fun Movie at the Very Least",7,30 March 2016,"Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and is the story of two children (Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce) that find a magical board game that unleashes animals and magic upon them, and they have to play until someone wins. Each time a player rolls the dice, a new curse is thrown at them. Soon after beginning the board game, a man named Alan Parrish, played by Robin Williams, pops out of the game, and was actually responsible for beginning their current game decades before with a girl named Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt). Alan and the kids must find Sarah and complete the game so that everything can go back to normal, and they can continue to live their lives.Jumanji is an amazing film, if you're a child. Growing up, I used to watch Jumanji all of the time, and I loved it. However, I recently gave it a rewatch, and it has its share of problems. However, this doesn't mean it's bad, because it has a lot of good qualities to it as well. I didn't dislike going back to watch it again, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, it's just not as good as I used to think it was.The biggest problem this film has is the CGI. There's no way around it; it looks terrible. All of the animals look practically animated they're so dated. Every time a lion, or a monkey, or even a giant mosquito would show up, I threw up in my mouth a bit, because it just looked so awful, and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray. I didn't watch it on television, or even on a DVD, I saw the ""remastered"" Blu-Ray, which still looked really bad.That being said, the practical effects the filmmakers did use look great. The makeup, particularly on one character, is really nice, and doesn't look bad, or sloppy at all. Any shots with practical effects look great, very much unlike the CGI.The best thing that this film has to offer is the emotional conflict with Robin Williams' character, specifically the connection between him and his father. He never got along with his dad, and when he was sucked into the board game, he never got the chance to make up for what he said or did to his father. This is a great aspect of the movie, and offers a relatable situation to the audience. The impact this relationship had on Alan was great, and it showed through Robin Williams amazing acting.That's another good quality about the film; the acting. Starting with Robin Williams, who always does good, the acting is great. Even Kirsten Dunst, who was around 12 when this film was made, gives a really nice performance. As far as Bradley Pierce, he does fine, but he was also probably 8 or 9, so you can't expect an Oscar worthy performance from him. Bonnie Hunt also does decent as Sarah, however boring her character may be.That's my other big issue with Jumanji: the characters. Although Robin Williams' character is well rounded, the children's' characters were kind of flat, and didn't stand out too much. There's a pretty useless subplot involving their parents, and it doesn't click with the movie that well. Plus, the audience is to think that they are the main characters (or, that's what I thought, at least), when the real protagonist is Alan Parrish, which we find out later in the film. There are also parts of Jumanji in which the kids are necessary, but there are point when they aren't. When they aren't required, then they seem to just bring the scene down, and almost annoy the audience. Sarah is a somewhat flat character, and has the same problem that the kids do: sometimes she's important, other times she's not.The last positive I'd like to point out is the direction of the movie. Joe Johnston does great as a director, most of the time (cough, Jurassic Park III), and this stays true for Jumanji. His work with the camera brightens this film up, and is nicely paced so that flat characters and horrible special effects don't jump out at the viewer as much as they normally would. His work with the direction truly brings a light to the film.Despite all of the problems with Jumanji, it still is a good film, I just pointed out more negatives than positives. In all reality, I'm glad I own Jumanji on Blu-Ray, because it may have problems, but in light of everything else, it's fun.",Jumanji

However absurd this idea may be, it works as far as the adventure goes. It has many flaws because eventually the absurdity becomes too much and, especially for adults, it will become annoying because of its repetition in the the attempt of filling the movie with 'funnys'.Robin Williams himself is a pleasant surprise as the action hero.

161,fatcat-73450,Few Could Have Done it as well as Williams,8,29 October 2021,"This movie is extremely memorable, probably helped along by Robin Williams' acting. He's at the top of his game here and this is perhaps his finest work.Usually Williams either played a loveable slacker/loser - Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) - or a boundlessly silly and and energetic personage - Aladdin (1992). In other words, he almost always has some jejune quality about him.Here his part of the script calls for just this type of man and the he plays his role to perfection. It's what his Peter Pan was supposed to be in Hook (1991), but perhaps because of maturity as an actor, the directing, or the script it came off better here.His character is essentially a young boy who is swallowed up by a sentient game that magically sends him to live alone in a dangerous jungle at an early age. He grows up physically (by appearances seems he's there about 30 years. I forget what the actual number is in the movie) in the jungle and is able to survive, but emerges a bit socially and psychologically stunted and embittered, feeling cheated of his life.Our hero knows how to deal with all the poisonous and bone-crushing nasties that lurk in the dark jungle from experience and survival instinct, but that doesn't mean he's not afraid or that he has all the answers. He is what you might call a ""manchild.""And indeed a hero he is. By the climax it's shown that he comes to remember those dim lessons of his youth and understands them. He comes to discover the meaning of bravery, fatherhood, responsibility, and how to distinguish the important from the insignificant.The acting from the other characters is strong as well, but there were otherwise way too many effects in this movie. Comparable to how Rocky IV (1985) became a movie dominated by montages, this one is dominated by 90's CG sequences which are mostly dumb. I feel like management ordered that the movie should be a spectacle and it's mostly inane ugly CGI scenes (I won't say it aged badly since I think today's CGI is no fresh daisy itself and still usually looks ugly and generic as sin).Indeed, I saw it in the theater when it came out and it's the dramatic moments that lingered with me.Honourable Mentions: The Kite Runner (2003) is the R-rated version of Jumanji. At its core, it's about a selfish and cowardly young boy who only matures during some climacteric stretch of his life relatively late in his physical adulthood. The stuff happening around him also endeavors to keep the audience entertained by being shocking and epic, although in the case of Kite Runner there's no fantasy.",Jumanji
162,jmhammerstein-980-842586,wonderful movie,10,24 September 2016,"Jumanji is a great movie from beginning to end. It's about a magic dice game that when played, summons exaggerated animals and other things from the African jungle and sucks people into the game jungle who must stay there until somebody rolls either of two numbers. This happens to Robin William's character in 1969 and he stays in the jungle for 26 years. He is brought out by kids discovering the game and playing it. The movie is scary. It has some great scenes, including with a lion, a giant carnivorous plant, and giant mosquitoes. It has good humor in it. It's a movie that's probably not too bad for anyone except very young children. It's probably too scary for them.",Jumanji

164,babyfir77,Board Games Can Be Deadly!,9,2 February 2012,"This is a roller-coaster of a film. So much action, danger and fun! I'm glad, however, that there was not a sequel. This is enough story for a single film. Robin Williams was terrific as the adult Alan Parrish, returning to the world after being whisked away many years ago as a child because his game piece landed on an unfortunate space.Bradley Pierce and cute Kirsten Dunst were also superb as the orphaned children. The situations they are involved in are wild and exciting. From lions to uncontrollable monkeys to a deranged hunger, they face them bravely. A lot of CG effect, but convincing.The film, directed by Joe Johnston, who also managed the equally thrilling Jurassic Park III, keeps the action moving along. Just like a roller-coaster, there are moments the viewers can catch their breaths.I also like the ending, which shows some heart in the way (BIG SPOILER) that is satisfactorily allows the kids to stop from becoming orphans. A fun film!",Jumanji

Board-game comes to life is such a fun concept and the movie plays with it pretty well.Seeing MJ (Kirsten Dunst) so young plus Robin Williams does what he is best at.Some sequence which I still remember will be the monkeys just hazardously destroying everything. The kid cheating and having a tail.

The premise of getting sucked into an unknown jungle inside a game for years was horrifying to me. Upon more recent rewatches, the balance between fear and fun is a lot more obvious, keeping you on your toes but not like the horror movie I thought it was as a child.

Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was.The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done.This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too.,Jumanji
169,fullonrobotchubby,Might actually have been better without words.,4,28 March 2007,"Jumanji is the movie Night at the Museum (which also stars Robin Williams) wishes it could be what with all the creatures magically coming to life and running amok. My question is... Why would any movie strive to be Jumanji?... Well, I suppose it is a successful and memorable family film, but honestly, how much better does that make it? Based on the wordless children's book, ""Jumanji"" is the name of a jungle-themed board game that two recently parentless children happen upon. When the kids roll the dice, their game-pieces magically (or magnetically) move, and if the game says something about monkeys or a ferocious lion, monkeys or a lion actually appear in their home. Robin Williams pops out of the game as a past Jumanji player who spent his childhood surviving animals and a hunter in the game's jungle world. Since his piece is still on the board along with another's piece, the girl who watched him get sucked into the game (played in all-grown-up form by Bonnie Hunt), they have to help the kids end the game/destruction of the town. My favorite scene is when the monkeys are terrorizing In Living Color alum David Alan Grier in his squad car... although I just can't stop wondering why the filmmakers didn't use real animals instead of the awful, blatant CGI. Ultimately, the film's marketing is what hurts it the most: funnyman Williams is over-dramatic, the movie's style is more freakish than fun, depth is attempted in double-casting Jonathan Hyde as William's hunter and father... Jumanji lies to its audience in every fathomable way, but at least it still has a sense of adventure, which I guess is good...",Jumanji
170,catfarmer1358,Robin Williams is great as always,9,23 September 2018,I really enjoy this film. The only reason that I gave it 9 stars instead of ten was because it slightly scared me and I'm not a huge fan of that. Regardless it's a great film with amazing actors and wonderful message. Makes me miss Robin a lot!,Jumanji
171,eternalsea,Below average action adventure,3,22 March 2006,"I knew Jumanji was never going to burst with intelligence or be driven by great performances, and yet despite this I was quite looking forward to it as a holiday blockbuster. Well to put it in simple terms that was a mistake. The films plot stands a chance of being the most convoluted of the year with so many back stories it only ever annoys. It starts of with a young boy called Alan Parish who gets sucked into a board game, at this point I should have left as it only gets more idiotic. After this incident we flash forward twenty years to find two new children have found the game. They unleash Alan who is now grown up and played by an irritating Robin Williams. Along with him an assortment of Jungle beasties are unleashed into their quiet neighbourhood. The kids and Alan must complete the game to restore everything but with every throw of the dice more horrors await. The film resembles an ameturish pantomine in every respect a part from the visual effects. Director Joe Johnston also responsible for the mediocre Honey I shrunk the Kids should have treated the audience like adults, then the film might have gone somewere. However as the movie doesn't treat us like adults and depends totally on its special effects I think its safe to say its a failure. The performances particularly from the children and Robin Williams are predictable and annoying. Jumanji might entertain under 7's or those with IQ's under 50 but for the rest of us it simply is a heavily flawed and rather rubbish piece of cinema",Jumanji
172,CinematicGarbage,A jaw-dropping adventure movie!,4,1 May 2019,"Jumanji (1995) is one of the adventure movies that people of all ages are interested in. It is about a board game and you have to play and take risks to win. This isn't just any board game, it can appear animals stampeding and villains like Van Pelt come to kill you. Sounds exciting and hazardous, isn't it??
The legendary Robin Williams was chosen to be Alan Parrish, the boy who sucked into the game in 1969 and returned to Earth in 1995, learning lots of jungle techniques, Bonnie Hunt was Sarah Whittle, Kirsten Dunst was Judy Shepherd and Bradley Pierce as Peter Shepherd. I don't mind the acting much but I would give it 7/10 because there was nothing too good in there, just normal.
The scenes were kinda unforgettable because of the awesome adventures and it made you experience the wonderful nature and dangerous risks of nature and I love it, but that doesn't mean the plot is excellent, I think there must be something else so the plot deserved a 7.7/10 from me. The characters are...okay but the villain made it better but not much: he only wanted to kill one person but not all so I will give them 7.4/10.
I really am impressed with the CGI effects. There were lots of animals but the really surprising thing was they didn't use any animals, the animals in the movie were all CGI and they looked like reality (except for the monkeys, they were really terrible). The CGI would get a 8.7/10. It was really awesome and sometimes jaw-dropping! But I think the movie should have its background better like the sequel and sometimes adding black bars to the movie would be great as well. Many 90s movies had done that such as Braveheart, Titanic, Independence Day and more.
They had some good humor and funny acts which I don't laugh much because they used the humor too rarely. The thing I loved about the movie is the fun and exciting adventures from the board game but the thing I don't like is the background. It's too old-school like the 80s and 70s because this is adventure and the background should be as good as the adventures and CGI.
Jumanji (1995) is not a bad movie at all. Why do critics find it unfavorable? And why did it get only 54% from Rotten Tomatoes and just 39 points from Metacritic. But I feel fair when it got a 7/10 from IMDb. I really like the movie. It's unforgettable with the adventures and risks, also the animals made from CGI stampeding and ruining things. The board game is really unique and maybe the most iconic board game in movies. I would give it 7.7/10",Jumanji
173,zach-69,I love this film!,10,30 May 2004,"I loved this movie! First of all, my #1 favorite actress is Kirsten Dunst, who plays Judy! I have seen Kirsten in countless other films including: Bring It On, Disney's Anastasia, Mona Lisa Smile, Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2 (June 30), and (Duh!) Jumanji of course. We have a lot in common. I am a HUGE fan of Robin Williams as well. He has played in films that I've seen such as: Mrs. Doubtfire, (also starring Pierce Brosnan who plays the worlds greatest Secret Agent: Bond, James, Bond. Robin has also been in: Disney's Aladdin (The Genie), Patch Adams, Flubber, Biscentanial Man, and Hook. I have seen Bonnie Hunt in her t.v. show, Life With Bonnie, and Cheaper By The Dozen starring the ever sooooo funny comedian Steve Martin and my sister's favorite actress Hilary Duff. I have a lot of favorite actor's but only one actress, and that's Kirsten! When I first saw her in Jumanji I fell in love with her. She is one beautiful young lady. I didn't know who she was though, LOL!!! I didn't recognize her in Spider-Man ""sigh"". As I looked at the credit's I saw a name: Kirsten Dunst. I remember seeing that name in the end credit's for Jumanji. I just about fainted, LOL!!!! I rented Jumanji again, and I looked at her and I realized: ""Wow, she hasn't changed a bit!"" ""She's still got those big Blue eye's that I just love,"" she hasn't lost her sense of humor,"" and I will always, always, ALWAY'S LOVE HER SMILE! Every movie I've seen her in, she's always been a really hot Redhead, Well, in Jumanji she wasn't a redhead, but, SHE WAS STILL HOT! LOL!!!! She's a legend, to me. I looked at her biography on IMDb.com and I saw that she was born on April 30,1982! I just about fell out of my chair. LOL!!! I was born April 10,1988!!!!!! She's six years older than me, but heck! I still love her. But, I'll always remember her as that little girl named Judy in Jumanji! My favorite line that she said was when the Cop commented on Robin's clothes for the first time: ""He's a Vegetarian! I was sucking in air, I was laughing so hard. Another scene was in the rain in Jumanji when Robin and Bonnie were about to kiss, and Kirsten is in the back rolling her eyes! LOL!!! That brought be back to the upside down kiss in the rain in Spider-Man! Jumanji is a fun movie! It can be a little intense sometimes, but it can also be funny. One last thing: KIRSTEN DUNST IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE MY FAVORITE ACTRESS! THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE!",Jumanji

175,sporeviews,Jumanji is a good movie!,7,24 December 2017,"I have to admit, I actually enjoyed this movie! I liked the concept, the characters were likable, and the performances were pretty good!Now I'll list three problems I have:1. The 3D animation. I understand that not all movie have the biggest budget in the world, but the CGI bits with the monkeys, the quicksand, and the crocodile, all felt REALLY dated.2. The board game rules. Throughout the movie, the board game rules were getting really inconsistent, e.g. In the first scene of the movie, bats fly into the room through the fireplace, and appear to be normal-sized. But in the second act of the film, mosquitoes fly into the room, but appear to be giant-sized. Plus, a crocodile appears in the swamp water, but the game didn't mention it would appear.3. I wish the movie was more memorable. Maybe if the movie had a stronger budget, e.g. having a longer run time to develop the characters, and the cinematography had a stronger sense of stake, e.g. showing the townsfolk running out of town in terror, and either dying or panicking, it would have made the movie more at stake. Or maybe make the characters more memorable e.g. Fleshing out the characters by learning more about them. Sure they were likable, but I kept forgetting their names throughout the movie. But Robin Williams really was the most memorable character, with the most memorable performance.Despite all that, what does make up for the flaws, is the ending. It was just so uplifting, satisfying, and genuinely heartwarming, it raised my rating of the movie, from ""average"" to ""good"".",Jumanji
176,golem3,Jumanji  a timeless adventure story,10,12 September 2005,"There are few children's movies that I particularly enjoyed  I can recount The Borrowers, Labyrinth and The Neverending Story. Jumanji, however takes a new place among children's films  in fact, it may seem that initially, Jumanji is about simplistic story about kids playing a board game. Based on a gorgeous picture book story of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg, this movie takes a beautiful magical adventure and makes it into a thrill ride that defies all natural laws. Time travel, physical transformations, perceptual distortions and multiple universes are just a few of the things that Jumanji toys with. The most evident phenomena is that the characters run in two different and parallel universes, one where Jumanji exists, and the other where it is just a dream. The life of Judy and Peter as orphans exists in a different world from the one where Jumanji doesn't exist  in other words, Jumanji is a catalyst of fate, an evil entity that does not bring about awe as it did in Allsberg's book, but fear. The world that Allen Parrish is doomed to be incarcerated in the jungles of Jumanji is another one, but that period of time is nonexistent in the world he will eventually live in. This is the beauty of the movie; that these characters can only allow their trauma and epiphanies to cross worlds. With each roll of the dice, the characters grow and change. The ending with 'Jumanji' is mark of the end of that universe  everything that the jungle world had yielded, from the colonist-hunter Van Pelt to the roaring stampede and the monkeys had to return, to be sealed into the game and the universe. The game controls life; but it is merciful when played to the end without cheating. The mental agony and pain must have been tremendous for the Parrishes. Presumably, Alan spent his twenty six years in the jungle, but returned to his old self only to again relive his life as if it never happened. The temporal distortion must have presumably had an effect on his parents, although only Sarah seems to notice. (She was playing the game  and only those playing are directly affected, but in the game universe of Judy and Peter we see a problem in the movie's understanding of temporal change) The power of fate in deciding the endgame was critical in the film. It seems that the game was in itself a game of a game; it was all planned out and ready to go. In fact, it also seems that no matter how crazy or perilous the situation is, the characters cannot be killed. Even Van Pelt says at the Sir Sav A Lot that ""I am hunting only Alan. I won't kill you, since you didn't roll"" He too is bound to the rules of the game, no matter how much of a colonialist he is. The game instills a high level of fear without death, in order for the game to continue, all the characters must be present. So in one way, no one need be scared of anything in the game. Instead, the game builds resilience in the characters. It was natural that in the end the end was initiated by the future; or more appropriately the past. At the end, both Sarah and Alan make up for the trouble they have caused and have a life bond from the experience. The jumping between 1994 and 1964 is a critical aspect where we see that the horrors of the game have allowed Judy and Peter's parents to not die in the ski accident. They are oddly willing to put an end to their vacation when they hardly know the Parrishes""In the jungle, you must wait, until you roll a five or eight""  Jumanji ""Roll a two, roll a four, but never ask for more""  GautamRATING: 10/10 (amazing)",Jumanji

The other actors do okay with the bare dialogue.

179,indialm,A great way to remember Robin Williams,10,6 April 2020,"I'm not sure if people understand the difference between a review and plain criticism. A review tells you about the film, it's story, the characters, etc. Criticism only complains about the film telling you nothing about it. Things like ""Why did Jonathan Hyde play two roles?"" Well it's because he represented fear to Allen Parrish (the protagonist) as both a father and the hunter in the jungle. Who better to play both characters?This film is the beginning in a series about a game that literally pulls its players into the game, another world, and they become the different characters they have chosen. There is only one demand; they must finish the game no matter what.
Allen Parrish is a young teenage boy in 1969 who is bullied and from a rich family. He begins playing Jumanji accidentally with a girl named Sara. During one turn Allen gets pulled into the jungle, through a roll of the die in the game, and there he stays for 26 years until a new family moves into his old house. Two new children find the game and, to noone's surprise, start playing.The special effects at the time were pretty well done even if seen as less than perfect by today's digital standard. Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt as the adult Allen and Sara are at their wonderful comedic best. Bonnie Hunt plays adult Sara as a neurotic, who now works as a medium, after she tells Allen that as a kid everyone thought she was crazy when she told people he was ""sucked into a game board.""
Allen, on the other hand, makes his reappearance as Robin Williams after someone rolls the correct dice number. That brings him back out of the game as an adult male dressed in leaves from the jungle where's he's been outrunning his arch nemesis (his father) but in the form of a big jungle hunter.
The remainder of the game is one adventure after another but now in 1995. David Alan Grier has some of the best comedic lines as the town cop who worked at Alan's parent's shoe business as a young man.
I've watched all three films and thought the second was a fine homage to this one. Unfortunately the most recent one (2019) didn't quite live up to the first two. Hopefully if they make another they can get some of that original writing back.",Jumanji

181,crazychap,"Has more depth than the book, but lacks much of its lustre",7,6 June 2005,"When I was in fifth Grade, I read a book called Jumanji. It was a 1982 book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera.A year later (February or March 1996), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In 1869, two young chaps bury in a chest ""Jumanji"", a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy. 100 years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in 1969, but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight""; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic 1995, where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost...Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm. The other three characters, but the movie is so focused on the four players that everyone else looks like a decoration set. The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining . But the screenplay touches on the drama scenes so lightly that they do not create much justice to the film. The anarchic present looks like a throwback of Back to the Future II's Alternate 1985. But all ends well at the conclusion, and people will find it likable, including those who read the book. By the way, this was the first time I heard about Kirsten Dunst...**1/2 out of ****",Jumanji

Robin williams does what he did best. Brings alive the man from the hidden depths of the game where he grew up after being captured in his young teen age. The latest gamers might scoff at the game, but it's the precursor for the modern layered complex games. The ferocious animals and creatures coming out of the game can fire up the imaginations of a child.
Kirsten dunst showed what she could do ay that very tender age too. Sweet but energetic and logical mind.

183,thedudeabides-2,"Stupid, but fun, family adventure",8,21 August 2014,"Board games aren't as popular as they used to be. Before the likes of Xbox and Facebook, we had classic board games such as Go For Broke and Game Of Life. Luckily, we didn't have anything like Jumanji; a mystical board game which magically comes to life as you're playing. It sounds incredibly fun, which is what young Alan Parrish thinks, minutes before he is sucked into the game and left to fend for himself for 30 years. Reawakened by a younger generation, old Alan, played by the late Robin Williams, must finish the game before it engulfs the entire town. If it sounds a little ridiculous, that's because it is. But it is a heck of a lot of fun as well. Robin Williams brings his usual maniacal charm and injects healthy doses of humour when the movie threatens to take itself too seriously and a young Kirsten Dunst offers ample support as one of the younger players. But the real star of the show is the effects; we are treated to scenes of an animal stampede through the streets, a monsoon inside a huge mansion and, in a wonderful subplot, one of the players is gradually transformed into a monkey because he tries to cheat the game. It is almost 20 years old now so, understandably, some of the effects don't quite hold up, with the monkeys being the prime example but the premise is so much fun that you won't really mind a few dodgy effects shots here or there. It also takes a little while to find its feet, with the beginning seeming to drag on for a little longer than necessary, and the ending may be a little to sickly sweet for some tastes. But once the main plot gets going it barely stops for breath as the players have to deal with any threat that the game delivers and a big part of the fun is waiting to see what the game will spit out next. A wonderfully fun family film with plenty of thrills and a great premise.",Jumanji

The animation and costumes/makeup details are well done and realistic although the technology differs from today. Robin Williams did an amazing performance as Alan Parrish. He is truly missed, and his films are a nice reminder of humanity and kindness. The original story of the infamous Jumanji game board is funny, action filled, and clever in all its wonder. It's a timeless classic and a beautifully made film. A definite must watch for all audiences. Anyone from the 90's era will instantly go back in time after seeing Jumanji.

It's a pretty clear morality tale, of course, with the main message (to me) being that Alan's father is right; you have to face up to what you're afraid of. But the subject of the message is hidden by the clever misdirection at the start of the film. There's a lot of time spent establishing that Alan is being bullied, and that he's being bullied because he's an only child of the posh family. So, is Jumanji a film about facing up to the bullies and how 26 years in the jungle makes you harder, smarter and faster and able to kick their tiny keesters when you get out? You know it isn't. Jumanji is a film about being afraid of your parents; of your parents being scared of you; and of the real fear behind that fear, which is the inevitable mutual loss. Clever, clever misdirection - but that's signalled in the first scenes of the film. Alan isn't paralysed by the ""bullies""; he can go and get whupped with indifference. And the film gives us no hint of any resolution of that scenario. He's terrified of his father, though. The deep part comes when you have to ask why; and the playing between ""young"" Alan and his father is to my mind some of the best observed of that sort of confrontation I have seen. Other deep parts of the film? The close similarities between child and adult ways of dealing with trauma; Kirsten Dunst and Bonnie Hunt both lie vigorously and repeatedly about what happened (though we have to give Bonnie credit for trying to tell the truth at first...). Bradley Pierce's look to camera by the woodshed. He knows we're watching; is his character giving us the sly nod to prove the actors know it's not real, and however bad it might look they weren't in danger? Why do I say ""accidental"", then? Because there is so much shallow stuff in there too. I don't just mean the general FX and demolition derby. They're fun, they're a good ride. All the wailing and screaming and plain silliness has me asking whether I'm reading too much into this piece. After all, Robin Williams was well known for his splendid ""man-child"" performances; Mork, Toys, Hook, GMV. In the end, I think I'm giving the film the right amount of credit, and all because of the scene at Bonnie's door. Was that the first hint of the very mad and dangerous characters he would flower into playing? If so, it was well done and well judged. 8/10 for this fun and dangerous film.",Jumanji
191,Jozinek,Fun family movie with an ingenious setting.,8,24 November 2019,"This film revolves around a young boy named Alan Parrish: a frail little shrimp of a boy who's brutally bullied and is the son of a wealthy shoe manufacturer. When him and his friend play a mysterious board game called ""Jumanji"", nothing but chaos ensues, and Alan disappears whereas his friend that he played the game with spends the following years of her life traumatised by the events that took place when playing Jumanji.Decades later, two other children come to the house with their guardian and land into similar turmoil when they get a hold of the game, except the fact that they unleash numerous terrors upon the town of New Hampshire including psychotic (and incredibly hilarious) monkeys, giant mosquitoes, you get the picture. In fact, I don't want to reveal much more since this film is SERIOUSLY so worth going into blind (as any good film is).So other than the insanity that occurs from the magic of Jumanji, we see an interesting use of timelines and how Alan's disappearance affects New Hampshire and what changes after the game is completed. The special effects are shaky but great for the time that this film was released in, so it's forgivable. Also I love all performances (especially the Hunter and Robin Williams as Alan).",Jumanji
192,assassington,"A classic, and the recent new movies cannot compare",10,16 July 2021,"A bit of horror, a bit of thrill, a bit of a bittersweet moment- that is what makes this movie truly the best. Okay, perhaps I'm just bias because of Robin Williams- but I stand with what I say! I like to rewatch the movie and notice many little details or realize actually how dark it was compared to how I viewed it as a kid.That's also why I love this version actually. I don't know if it is just me, but I feel like the new ones are missing the same edge vibe.",Jumanji
193,Newyorking,Perfect for the entire family,8,15 December 2019,"I decided to watch this movie with my 7 year old boys and absolutely loved it!! The movie is perfect for that age - suspense, thriller, kids, humor, and Robin Williams. I grew up watching him and miss him so much. He is amazing in the movie, and my boys really enjoyed watching it. I had purchased the game so surprised them with it after the movie and we had a fun game night. I highly recommend it for that age. The new Jumanji is geared more towards teenagers and adults with cheesy dialogues just to generate cheap laughs; this one is a classic. I wish they continued making these for kids, because the new ones are definitely not geared towards kids.",Jumanji

Thankfully, this is a movie in which that is easy to do. The premise, a game that produces real consequences (like a stampede of wild African animals, or a floor that turns into quicksand), is a fun way to introduce several exciting--sometimes hysterical, sometimes terrifying--circumstances for Robin Williams and the rest of the cast to have fun with, and fun it is, like a roller coaster at Six Flags.But in a way this film is also about growing up; about learning how to fit in, how to be responsible for yourself, and above all how perseverance can win the day. Yes, this is a fantasy-adventure movie. But there is a point to it all, and that point is that sticking to something in the face of terrible adversity has its own very special rewards.One last thing. This is supposed to be a Robin Williams movie. But good as he is, Jonathan Hyde as Hunter Van Pelt and David Alan Grier as Carl Bentley steal every scene they are in.",Jumanji

I mean, it has an entire back story, as we can see in the beginning, when those two kids are trying to get rid of the game. Then it goes to 1969, when Alan finds the game, he and Sarah start playing, and he gets sucked into Jumanji. Then, throughout the rest of the movie, Alan comes out of the jungle and he, Sarah, Judy, and Peter continue playing the game and unleashing all these dangerous animals (and Van Pelt) and the monsoon and killer plants into the city. And at the end, those kids in Japan find the game. Very well thought out. Certainly worth a look.",Jumanji

202,Gavin59,Jumanji is fun!,8,10 September 2009,"What a great movie and a clever concept! A board game that sucks you into it, and must be finished by the originals who played the game. I remember seeing Jumanji in the movie theatre when it first came out, and this past weekend had the opportunity to rewatch it (thank you resale DVDs!) Starring Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, the action is fast paced and easy to follow. No swearing in this movie makes it appropriate for all ages, though little ones might be frightened by the rampaging animals. There is nothing Disneylike in their qualities. Still, the story of sticking together and teamwork prevail throughout the entire film. Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Greier are great in their supporting roles. Bonnie Hunt gets some of the best lines in the film with regards to cheating and a downtown sale. An early Kirstin Dunst is also great. If you have never seen Jumanji, I encourage you check it out. It's fun and you always wonder what the game is going to come up with next.",Jumanji
203,rogerm_59,Fun little movie hidden in the back drawer,7,18 January 2005,"Movie plays. In comes zoo. Who's that laughing? Why it's you!Jumanji never made a big splash (though the PR engine tried its best) but it's a clever little fantasy about a magical board game that changes reality. The special effects are laughable and enjoyable at the same time, particularly the stampede, and altogether it's a fun jaunt. Surprisingly, considering that the rest of cast is mostly up-and-comers, Robin Williams doesn't dominate the film, but adds the right touch of insanity to the whole affair.But, like many Williams vehicles, there's a heavy ""let children be children"" component, as well as a domineering father figure who somehow just can't show his love for his child. Ignore all that, and just enjoy the game.7 of 10 from me.",Jumanji
204,Rurextrexx34,What happened to Robin?,4,23 May 2020,"The movie is structured as a series of special effects sequences involving whatever dangerous manifestation results from each person's turn rolling the dice. They all scramble frantically in the face of new dangers every ten or fifteen minutes or so, then the dangers disappear neatly for the next person to take their turn, and so on until the end of the movie. It's not exactly the most imaginative structuring going on here, but I will admit that the ending has a little twist that, while it includes one of the cheapest happy Hollywood copout moves in movies (they also pulled the same thing in Click), I would be lying if I said it wasn't at least a little heartwarming.Unfortunately, a lot of the movie is geared toward kids around 10 years old, the same age as the kids in the movie, but it also contains some imagery and some situations that kids that age would find much too frightening or intense. There is a scene involving giant spiders that admittedly look like nothing other than big plastic spider-puppets but that is still just as creepy as anything in Arachnophobia. So beware if you have a fear of creepy crawlies!I would be lying if I said the movie wasn't at all fun or entertaining. The story is told in an unconventional way, but it's also true that it's an unconventional story, which at least makes it a little more interesting. But in retrospect it's a little hard to get over how perfectly everything is arranged as a setup for the ending. The relationships between Alan and Sarah and between the two of them and the other two kids who, needless to say, are orphans, will seem a little too perfect for some people. The characters are not uninteresting and the performances are satisfactory, but unfortunately they all take second billing to an ambitious special effects team that doesn't seem to know when their half-baked digital creations are helping to drive the movie along and when they're just swallowing everything else up.",Jumanji

A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood.

206,TheEagle,The end is near!,4,9 December 1998,"'The end is near' was my best thought after an hour of Jumanji. The end of the movie that is.Despite a lot of good reviews of people I hardly know, this film is a first-class let-down. It is the somanieth movie in which Robin Williams comic qualities are abused.The story is about a game, Jumanji, that has come to life. After every move something terrible happens; a stampede or a giant spider attack. The game has to be finished to stop all terrible things happening.Of course Williams' comic talent and the special effects try to safe the movie but everything is overdone. By memory, I recall that the makers promised great special effects; they had used the same effects as Jurassic Park! Yes, they did, but they obviously only got the demo version of the package.Also, poor Kirsten Dunst, having the role of a nice young girl, is transformed is such a prig that all her good intentions fall into nothing.All in all, if you have to choose between watching this movie and cleaning up the house, please clean up your house starting with trashing the video of this movie.",Jumanji

Period.,9,1 October 2017,"I was about one years old when this came out, by three I was mesmerised by the analog and digital effects Jumanji contained. It stood aside the efforts of Jurassic Park, but more animal-based as Jurassic Park was dinosaurs.Robin Williams pulls off a strong performance as Alan Parrish. The film revolved his character playing the game and escaping the world the game brought to him. It had Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce aside Williams whom join this adventure. I believe the film took a creative angle, which more fluctuation that the book left for the imagination. Here it follows the book accurately, just with expansion amongst the book's basis. Hence allowed more adventure and opened more for the viewer digging themselves within this jungle adventure.I can go on about the film's details and how they amaze me.

It's nowhere near as funny as Welcome To The Jungle, but it's more magical and entertaining than The Next Level.The whole cast is great, including the child actors, which is very rare for a child actor to be decent in a family movie. The visual effects were pretty bad, but I didn't really mind since this was a 90s movie, not a Christopher Nolan movie. I actually laughed at some of the jokes, but most of them came from the legendary Robin Williams, he carried the movie from painfully cheesy to pure fun. Also, I didn't buy the chemistry between Bonnie Hunt and Robin Williams, it just felt a little forced and unnecessary.If you're a bored, unemployed teenager like me, I suggest you check this one out because I guarantee that the inner kid in you will be satisfied.6/10, a fair rating for a cheesy 90s movie.",Jumanji
213,gccuconati,Liked it very much,10,13 August 2021,"I've been re-watching this movie for years, and it is excellent.By today's standards, the CGI effects are certainly dated, but for their time, they were excellent. Based on Chris Van Allsburg's famed 1981 horror book, this film revolves around a mysterious board game, which is a very well-executed and interesting concept.The acting is excellent as well. Robin Williams, one of America's best comedians, who sadly committed suicide in 2014, was hilarious in the role of Alan Parrish, and this was the very first movie I ever saw him in. Bonnie Hunt is also very good as Sarah Whittle, with her freak-out upon seeing the game being especially funny. Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce are also excellent as Judy and Peter Shepherd. Jonathan Hyde is appropriately wicked as Van Pelt, the evil, rifle-wielding man-hunter released from the game, who wants Alan dead.The film's music score, composed by the late, great James Horner, is absolutely beautiful, as you would expect from him, and sounds epic and suspenseful in all the right scenes.And there are so many awesome moments (even if little kids can consider them scary), such as the scene at Sir Save-a-Lot, which is also very comedic (even though my older brother used to hate it, now he loves it).In short, this movie is very faithful to the source material, and an absolute masterpiece. I strongly recommend this over its new, heavily overrated sequels, which star Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, and completely betray the source material by turning this magnificent work of art into a complete joke.",Jumanji

But remember:  once you start this game, you can't stop.  If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must.""Jumanji"" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  The basic premise stays the same:  a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure.  When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things.  Only finishing the game will make it all go away.In the hands of Hollywood, more story is added.  Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself.  He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing.  The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams!  Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter.Robin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles.  He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt.  The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the ""This is MY baby"" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike.",Jumanji

The digital effects and animatronics are great; the screenplay doesn't work. A complicated narrative set-up (which keeps the star, Robin Williams, off screen for the first half-hour) is followed by an hour of screaming and running around which doesn't develop much of anything. The big problem isn't hard to pinpoint: The movie has no real antagonist _ no villain. The supernatural board game of the title not only doesn't have a personality (it is, after all, only a board game), it doesn't have an intelligible plan. We find out nothing about how or why it exists. It's just a sort of random hazard generator. The four main characters survive the hazards just long enough, the game ends _ end of movie. The pasted-on homilies the screenplay comes up with _ the need for courage, commitment, real parent-child communication _ are drowned out in the hubbub, and a good cast (not to mention a big budget) is wasted.

Well for a 7 year old anyway.Robin Williams plays the part really well but the real star of the film is the special effects. The stampede and various other disasters from the game were fantastic for their day. OK they look a bit dated now but in their time, they were some of the most advanced special effects ever used in movies.Bonnie Hunt steals the show with her humour and character. And the 2 children are fantastic as actors. The only thing that lets Jumanji down is the tag line. It gives away too much of the story of the film. But don't let that spoil things.

I have heard few people praise this film but I believe it to be a classic due to having an eerie dark sense all the way through until the credits roll, whilst still maintaining comedy and being for the whole family.

233,JBRoseOrg,Ignore the critics on this one--it's a great romp that gets better with time!,9,24 February 2003,"**Warning--Spoilers**We've owned Jumanji on video since it was released in 1996 and pull it out a couple of times each year for kicks.  It's as fun today as the first time we saw it with plenty of twists and plot turns to keep you hooked through the closing credits.  I've read the reviews by several of the critics on IMDB, and it is obvious they just don't get it.Criticism #1:  ""Jumanji is too scary for kids"":  Our children (ages 2 to 11) have all seen this at an early age and none was ever the slightest bit frightened.  Jumanji doesn't scare kids because 1) the dangers are never prolonged; 2) there is a ton of humor interwoven in the dialogue; and 3) everyone knows it's just a game.  After all, the pranks in Jumanji are no more harmful than what you see in Looney Tunes or Roadrunner & Coyote and kids instinctively get that.Criticism #2: ""Jumanji has no story"": wrong again.  Every time we watch it, something new comes out, particularly in the relationships between the main characters.  There are particularly poignant moments between the father and son characters allowing them to reconcile and overcome the aloofness that can keep men from coming to grips with their feelings toward each other. And, the Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt relationship has a great payoff with romance and their triumph over forces of nature (real and implied). There are also numerous humorous details and themes that run through the film from stampeding rhinos to run-a-muck monkeys that keeping you laughing throughout the entire film.Criticism #3: ""The special effects overwhelm the story"":  The film is based on an animated children's book and the special effects intentionally mirror the artwork from the book.  My kids oohed and ahhed at each and every FX enhanced adventure from the stampeding animals to the wood floor turning to quicksand and in each case the result was to stimulate a great deal of discussion about the ideas in the story.  The monkeys are particularly funny evoking squeals of laughter as they embark on their high jinx.So, don't let bad reviews deter you from seeing this flick.  You and your family will have a great time during the movie and your kids will want to talk about every aspect of Jumanji after it's over, even if it's just an excuse not to go to bed on time!",Jumanji
234,olle-utberg,Decent adventure,8,17 January 2009,"Well where do I begin.The Casting: I guess the casting was OK. Robin Williams does a decent job, same goes for Kirsten Dunst. I really love the Sara Whittle character, but I am unsure if its because of her written dialog, which I indeed love, or the acting of Bonnie Hunt. I don't know what role the policeman is supposed to play however. I mean he doesn't do anything really important and it seems like he is there just to tie up the loose ends. It is OK though, I would rather have this cop around than just having them loose the game some more, which I think would have been the other alternative. His supposed to be funny moments however is something the movie could've done without.The Story: I really enjoy the story! Its simple, not to serious and perfect for adventure. My problem with it is how the story about the characters end which is a bit counter dramatic. The moral of the story, whatever you perceive it to be, feels meaningless. Since everything just ends up a-okay for everyone.Some people have been complaining that you never get to know the origin of Jumanji or how it looks inside the game. I don't have that problem simply because it would take away all the mystery. The parts of the story I grow tired off is how they loose the game to often. I figure its to add suspense which works at times, but the movie overdoes it. Another thing that I don't really like is how Van Pelt, the hunter, has to buy a new modern rifle. I kind of liked the retro feeling to him, but that disappears when he has an enormous automatic black rifle with night-vision aim rather than his own old rifle. The effects: To be honest, what comes first in my book is acting and story. If you take the old batman movie the effects aren't at all impressive. But that don't stop them from being awesome. Same goes for this, sure the computer effects haven't aged well and the monkeys just look stupid. But it isn't that big a part of the movie. Maybe of the marketing but I've learned you have to take that part of the entertainment business with mountains of salt.I figure I got to much to say about the movie, there is a lot of stuff I haven't talked about, so I'll just stop here and sum my thoughts up.Its imaginative and adventurous with good acting and decent effects. The only part which stops me from giving it a 10 is the ""comic relief"" which is just stupid and unnecessary. A bit more adult sprinkled on this movie and it would be a lot better in my eyes. Still, a good movie!",Jumanji
235,Mr-Dale,My favorite movie as a child,10,24 March 2007,"I first saw this movie when I was 8 or something and I loved it immediately. The idea that you could actually play a game that could have the consequences Jumanji had was awe-inspiring for a kid like me. When I saw it again on TV 2 or 3 years later I taped it and watched it over and over again. At one moment I would lay in my bed and play the movie second by second and word by word in my head. That's how obsessed I was with this film. The action made me want to study biology and major in zoology actually.But I didn't study biology, I am a film student now. And from a film student point of view this movie is, of course, nothing special. The effects aren't perfect, it's no quality film and certainly not Oscar worthy or anything. But from a personal point of view, it still amazes me. When I watch it again it takes me back to my childhood and the amazing visions I had back then of it actually happening in my school and such. For that sense of nostalgia and the memories I have for this movie, I give this a straight 10 out of 10. After all, it was my favorite movie as a child.",Jumanji
236,Kendra64,I love this movie so much,10,10 December 2005,"If you do not love this movie you are crazy. Its filled with action and excitement. I love Sarah Whittle played by the famous Bonnie Hunt. I also like Carl Bentley, a clueless police officer played by the comedian David Alan Grier. This movie is so creative. My sister and I watch the movie every weekend, we do not get tired of it. This movie did not get the awesome rating it deserved. People sometimes do not understand a quality move when they see one. I would strongly, strongly, strongly recommend the movie. Trust me you will love it to death. If you do not... then you are odd. Please watch the movie, try it you'll love it...duh!!!",Jumanji

238,phoebe_monkey,One of my favourite films ever,10,1 January 2005,"This film is great, it is definitely a family film (little kids might get scared when there are *SPOILER* guns shooting or when the giant spiders have surrounded the actors,or when a crocodile attacks the man but apart from that it isn't too scary), but it is one of those films everyone has got to see. I first watched this film when it first came onto TV (they now repeat it every year), and I have been captivated by the imaginative story every single time I've seen it. The basic storyline is that two kids find an old board game, but when they start playing, the madness begins- stampeding animals and more! This is a story about friendship, love, sticking together and much, much more. If you haven't seen this film already WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!",Jumanji
239,djfuzy,"Story would be decent, but visual effect suck worse than an 80s video game...",5,26 February 2020,"When I was I kid, I did enjoy this flick.
I think the plot is quite interesting and would be worth to watch.
However, the visual effects are so bad, making it impossible to watch this movie in a resolution higher than 480p. In times of Full HD and 4k, that doesn't add points to the movie.
One can clearly see that literally every single animal (or whatsoever threat) is just (lousy) animated. I just can't enjoy a movie then. What might have still looked charming and enjoyable on a 10"" TV-set in 1999, doesn't do the job on a 70"" 4k OLED 20 years later...",Jumanji
240,nilpaddo,A walk in the memory lane,8,11 August 2017,"We (me and my brother) used to watch a cartoon named ""Jumanzi"" every Wednesday, back in 2000. Watching this movie talk me through a walk in my memory lane. The great Robin Williams also makes me nostalgic. 26 years, struggling and surviving, and than fighting back to get their life back. It is called human spirit. Though, every bit of it is fantasy, the plot become more human, when Robin remembered his saviors, who give him another chance in the game.",Jumanji
241,colinhart-09507,Plastic acting at its worst,3,4 February 2018,"Waste of time waste of money . Why did they even bother making this film ?. We're the actors trying to be funny because quite simply they weren't in fact they were quite the opposite .

242,mporhachev-88372,Cult film for all times,8,27 July 2019,"Once again, reviewed the film Jumanji. There are films that do not age, become classics, this is what this film is.
Unfortunately, such films with such a fascinating plot and such an acting game are not filmed now, there is a feeling that the current directors came out only yesterday from the jungle. Maybe not everyone will put Jumanji in the list of cult film, but personally my nostalgia and love for the character cannot bypass the film and don't write a little review about it.
Eh Robin, now your movies will look much sadder...",Jumanji
243,kvv,Not for 13+ age,3,15 February 2002,"Very weak film. FX is good.... for 1980 not for 1995. Plot is definitely childish. I was not interested in what will be in this movie. No original ideas. There's lot of goofs. It's seems that people had equipment but no talent - and we can see ""Jumanji"". Don't waste your time.",Jumanji
244,Rey-3,The jungle,10,2 December 1999,"This is an excellent movie for all ages. Congratulations to the cast, production, stunts and all the people. And now I want know what's happen in the jungle when Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) was there for 26 years. This should be a good adventure.",Jumanji

254,YenerYunusoglu,My Childhood,10,9 March 2014,"This movie made my childhood. I love Robin Williams movies, Jumanji introduced him to me. Jumanji is a movie that everyone should watch. Robin Williams will again make you appreciate living as he always does in his movies. The movie contains full of fantasy objects. The writer has a really great imagination. I will make my children to watch this movie after all years that pass. While watching this movie as a kid, I was scared, excited and happy. It makes you to feel every kind of feeling. This indicates that the movie has done a good job. I again recommend to everyone. Jumanji appeals for all ages. I am pretty sure I will watch the movie again when I get old with the same emotions when I watched it in the first time.",Jumanji

257,shobhan_pandit,Fun!,9,19 December 2011,"I give this movie a ten on ten. I may be biased as I watched this movie when I was ten and whenever I watch it, it brings back fond memories of lazing around and watching movies during my summer vacations. But I am surprised that the overall rating for this movie is 6.5 (when I write this review), I expected it to be at least 7. This really is a fun movie to watch with some hilarious scenes. The monkey bike riding scene stands out it particular. The special effects looked good when I was young but now the fake animals are not very impressive. Jurassic Park was made before this movie and had much better special effects. Robin Williams does seem too old to play a 35 year old Alan Parish but he is a brilliant actor and you do not mind accepting him as Alan. Bonnie Hunt does a good job too as the paranoid Sarah Whittle. The kids do a great job too, especially Bradley Pierce; look out for the scene where he is searching for an axe. And David Grier is brilliant as the bumbling sheriff Carl Bentley.I suggest you watch this movie with your family on a weekend. Its worth it!",Jumanji

259,sach_j,This movie warms my heart,10,26 December 2020,"I originally watched this as a kid when it first came out in 1995. Back then I imagined myself in the movie, the sense of adventure it brought, the special effects, the romance, it had it all. And of course the legendary Robin Williams - what an actor.
Fast forward 25 years later to 2020, and I'm writing this review after just having watched it again. It still brings out the same emotions and strong feelings of nostalgia.
I absolutely love this movie, it's not too long, doesn't drag on and even to this day, the special effects still hold up really well.
If you haven't already, give it a shot! Watch it with your family, it has something for everyone ... you won't regret it!",Jumanji
260,effijo,One of the best family movies,10,3 January 2019,"One of the best 90's child's movie. Includes adventure, humor and love.

Robin Williams is amazing as always and his role also symbolizes the struggling bond between father and son and overcoming fear.

Words are not enough to describe such a man... I've seen a lot of people in my life, all kind of people, but i never saw someone having so much warmth and kindness in just a small smile like Robin. That's something which makes you to love him unconditionally. The way he acted in the movies was so original that it can not be compared with anyone else in the history of cinema. He's smile made us all better people a little bit, which means he changed the world in he's own way. He will be always with us, and within us. Let's make him immortal !!!",Jumanji
262,crusher_297,Ja Rule Jumanji,10,21 August 2005,"'Jumanji' is a drama comedy about a boy who is always picked on by a bunch of bullies. He gets sucked into a disastrous game board called 'Jumanji'. He was taken to a jungle for 26 long years. He then comes back after the dice read 8 and with the 3 other players who unleash the unexpected dangers of the jungle onto the real world.Alan Parish is a troubled boy with kids picking on him 24/7. One day while walking through a construction site he finds a chest that holds 'Jumanji' - the board inside it. He starts playing this game with a young girl, Sarah, where he is sucked into the game. After 26 yrs he comes back as a man!! Sarah Whittle is one of the bully's girlfriends and she brought back Alan's bike when he invited her in to play the game. She was really scared when Alan was sucked into the game, after that she was chased by bats all the way down the street. It looks so real but when she falls over and a bat is on her shoulder, it looks Judy and Peter are the two other players who live with their generous aunt because their parents had died in a car crash. Judy lies because it makes her feel better and Peter doesn't talk to any one except Judy. Peter turns into a half monkey/human for cheating, which special effects make this look real.Together all four encounter many different but dangerous stuff from the jungle. Not only does it affect Alan, Sarah, Judy and Peter, it affects the whole town. All in all 'Jumanji' is a rollicking imaginative adventure that will carry you away literally!!",Jumanji

264,joshuaclark-15512,review for jumanji.,7,18 September 2017,"This 1995 film is a really good movie if you are sitting down with your family and just want to have a action and adventure movie night. If you have surround sound this movie would be epic. Joe Johnston has done the best job to turn a normal movie into the most amazing and moving movie ever. This movie will put you on the edge of your chair! This movie stars the amazing Robin Williams! To start this movie there is some kids that are burying a board game. They hope that it will never be found again. Years later the board game is found by a little boy named Alan. Little does he know how much trouble this little board will cause. Sucked into a jungle and chased by bats but they need to finish. More kids find the game 26 years later and have their turn. After that it does not work. That is because they need all four players. They are determined to finish.Alan is good at using his resources that he has. He is good at using them when he comes back to civilisation and there is, ""No more banana leaves.""Sarah does not like playing the game. She tries to run away and she the thinks and says, ""I don't like the sound of that!""There are lots of dangerous things in the board game. These things are not wanted to be harmed. They might be rare or not even possible in the real world. In this game good or bad things are all possible. This is shown when Alan says,""Run! It's a stampede!""This movie is great for viewers of many ages but i think you should only watch it if you are 8+ as there is some scenes that involve near death. There is no death in this movie though. If there is someone that is lower than 8 and you want to let them watch it than i would suggest parental guidance or even the parent watching jumanji first. If you're going to watch it then i hope you enjoy your adventures journey through the life of jumanji. Happy ViewingJoshua Clark",Jumanji
