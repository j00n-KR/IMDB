0,TheLittleSongbird,John Landis's best film along with The Blues Brothers,10,30 December 2010,"I like John Landis and his films, and An American Werewolf in London is up there with the best of them. For me, there is so much to love about this film. There is John Landis's perfect direction, he manages to revisit the horror genre and parody it at the same which is very difficult. There is the wonderful cinematography and beautiful scenery. There is Elmer Bernstein's superbly atmospheric score. There is the funny, scary and above all brilliantly written script. There is the great special effects and some of the scariest and most effective transformation sequences I have seen in any horror movie. There is the adeptly constructed story, with never a dull moment. And there is the acting, David Naughton carries the film well, Griffin Dunne is very good and Jenny Agutter is simply perfect. All in all, brilliant film and one of the best of the genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",An American Werewolf in London
1,Leofwine_draca,A classic of the comedy/horror genre,10,29 November 2013,"I remember An American Werewolf in London and The Howling being the big rival werewolf films of the early '80s. Both were big, scary movies with cutting-edge special effects and reputations as equally decent films, but I think London has the edge. It just feels that the narrative is cleaner and more focused, and the combination of comedy and horror works really well.The movie is also notable for its depiction of 1981-era England through the eyes of a couple of American students (and Yank director John Landis too, of course). It's tightly written, exploring the werewolf theme from a psychological perspective, which I liked, while also providing possibly the best rampage of all time come the ending. It definitely deserves its reputation as one of the big horror films of the 1980s.Rick Baker's special effects are the real star here and they deservedly won the Oscar; that transformation scene is still stunning, and unequalled even with the advent of CGI (Baker's own work in the disappointing Wolfman remake didn't come close). The blood flows freely and the deaths are vicious and unpleasant, as you'd hope for given the subject matter.The film's settings are also splendid, really bringing an age-old rural myth into the then-present day. The Piccadilly climax is brilliant stuff but the build up is equally watchable, particularly the excellent sub-plot involving John Woodvine's doctor investigating the case; Woodvine feels like a worthy successor to Cushing in this one. That's not to belittle David Naughton's fresh turn as the lead or the incredibly lovely Jenny Agutter as the object of his affection, of course.An American Werewolf in London is just one of those films where everything comes together and gels together perfectly. I particularly like the nightmarish dream sequences which allow the director and writers free reign; the bit with the demon Nazis with machine guns is a tremendously fun moment, for instance.",An American Werewolf in London
2,SnoopyStyle,Well made good looking simple horror,8,21 June 2014,David Kessler (David Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Griffin Dunne) are young men backpacking through the English moor region. They stop at a small pub in East Proctor where the locals are hiding a dark secret. They are attacked by a werewolf and Jack is killed. The locals rescue David after being mauled by the werewolf. The locals perpetuate a lie that a madman attacked the two guys. Nurse Alex Price (Jenny Agutter) treats David and they fall for each other.It's a very simple old style horror from writer/director John Landis. The makeup looks good. The dead Jack looks are especially nasty and bloody. Griffin Dunne has a fun time as the walking dead. The transformation is done really well. It's very simple like the chase in the subway where nothing is shown other than growling. It's the age before CGI. It has a bit of humor like the cheesy porno flick. There isn't much in terms of story. Basically he gets bitten and he turns. It doesn't have to get much fancier than that.,An American Werewolf in London
3,mark.waltz,"The Moors, London, comedy and of course a wolf man!",10,6 October 2021,"Delightfully entertaining, this amazing mix of dark comedy and horror is a perfect mix. The story starts with two Americans, David Naughton and Griffin Dunne, traveling around the Moors when they are attacked by a werewolf after being warned about the darkness while in a very superstitious Pub. Dunne is killed and Naughton injured, and after being taken in by friendly nurse Jenny Agutter, he begins to have transitions that really affect his bones and his facial structure, mainly with the addition of a lot of unwanted hair.Thanks to director John Landis, this film is incredibly funny as well as scary, the type of film that would make you toss your popcorn container in the air when something happened out of the blue. Dunne keeps appearing to him in various forms, trying to convince him to kill himself, but Naughton is intent to persevere, that is until a very serious transformation occurs which is one of the most frightening visions ever in the movies. The special effects and makeup design are outstanding, and well there are a few gross-out moment, this is the probably the most family-friendly modern werewolf movie ever made even if Agutter and Naughton do have a sexy love scene.Coming out at the same time as two other very good werewolf movies (""The Howling"" and ""Wolfen""), this ranks as the best because it is just so lighthearted and innocent and its own way even with the use of gory special effects and lots of bloody bodies. Veteran character actress Lila Kaye (a Marie Dressler look -alike) is quite amusing as the bar mistress on the Moors, and her customers are delightful eccentric as well. This is such a fun filled to watch that you will definitely try to keep a copy on hand to revisit every now again around Halloween time. Next to the 1940 classic Lon Chaney Jr. Film, this is the best of the werewolf movies.",An American Werewolf in London
4,kosmasp,Full Moon,9,13 October 2009,"A great horror movie that can be funny too? Here it is and it works! John Landis is absolutely against the term ""horror-comedy"" being labeled on this movie. Whatever you want to call it though, it is a great combination, of scary and funny moments he dishes out here. Not to mention one of the greatest transformation scenes, like ever! But to reduce the movie to that particular scene wouldn't be doing it justice at all! While Mr. Landis does everything that he shouldn't be doing (if you would follow a painting by the numbers kind of approach, to get your movie right), everything he does fits perfectly. You have people/characters in here, who are not really serving the story or have any particularly purpose to the story. In other words, the movie would have worked without them. But as in his other movies, he has this strange people in, who actually elevate the movie and make it different. It's great to hear people, who wouldn't even have a line in other movies, getting not only screen time, but also some weird/strange funny lines. This all works fantastic with the horror, that slowly builds up ... a classic, that is a must-see for anyone! And it hasn't dated!",An American Werewolf in London
5,gavin6942,Definitive 1980s Werewolf Film,8,21 October 2011,"Two American college students on a walking tour of Britain are attacked by a werewolf that none of the locals will admit exists. John Landis made a name for himself directing comedies like ""The Blues Brothers"" and ""Animal House"". Horror fans (rightly) try to claim him as their own, but he is a comedy guy just as much. And it shows. Although this is an incredibly scary film, it clearly has a sense of humor. That is a big reason it works so well.Who wants to see David Naughton run around naked? If you do, this is the film for you because he finds himself naked repeatedly (and in you squint, you can almost see his special appendage if you pay attention). But, if this is the only reason you watch the film, you are missing out on many other great things.The debate, going back more than thirty years now, is whether ""American Werewolf"" or ""The Howling"" is the better film. Some might add ""Wolfen"", but they would be wrong. Considering ""Howling"" has seven sequels and ""American Werewolf"" has only one, you might think ""Howling"". But you would be wrong. Joe Dante is a beloved director, and the talents of Rob Bottin may even surpass those of Rick Baker... but ""American Werewolf"" is the superior film, if for no other reason than its tone. It has a balance of humor and comedy that keeps it fun and the sort of film you can return to.Worth noting are the transformation effects; these are fairly impressive, especially considering the time the film was made. Everyone knows this was the first film to receive an Academy Award for Best Makeup. As of 2014, Baker has earned seven of these. How often has a horror film changed the course of the Academy? Not often, and perhaps never before or since. This is, in many ways, Baker's film.The film has received almost universal acclaim. Roger Ebert was an exception, noting the movie ""seems curiously unfinished, as if director John Landis spent all his energy on spectacular set pieces and then didn't want to bother with things like transitions, character development, or an ending."" As rarely as Ebert gets it wrong, he got it wrong here. Although he may have a point with character development, the lack of depth never seems to take away from the picture -- we are not to care about these people, just to gaze voyeuristically at their foibles.",An American Werewolf in London
6,lee_eisenberg,when I saw this on TV...,7,10 August 2005,"With ""werewolf"" in the title, we know that a man turns into one. In this case, American college students David Kessler (David Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Griffin Dunne) are attacked on the English moors by a strange creature which kills Jack and injures David. While in the hospital, David falls for nurse Alex Price (Jenny Agutter) and gets a visit from Jack's decaying ghost, who warns him of what will happen come the full moon. Anyway, David goes home with Alex, they have sex (interestingly, this wasn't cut on TV), and you know what happens the next night (don't worry: Alex wasn't home).The main thing was that ""An American Werewolf in London"" had the neatest scene in movie history of a man turning into a lycanthrope. Maybe the movie didn't have any kind of message or anything, but really folks, we don't want that in werewolf movies! Other cool aspects include the bar - it didn't have a very inviting name. And Jenny Agutter was pretty hot.Oh well. If ever you're in England, you'll just have to remember to steer clear of the moors. And the next time that there's a full moon, you know what that means.",An American Werewolf in London
7,jboothmillard,An American Werewolf in London,8,6 September 2005,"One late night two Americans (one being David Naughton) have come to England and are lost somewhere in the country. They find a pub and ask for help and they do not warn them about the known creature outside. It's not long before David and his friend are attacked by a werewolf. David's friend dies but he only got a scratch. Anyway, later in the film David seems fine, but his friend as a ghost keeps warning about turning into a werewolf himself, David obviously assumes he's dreaming. David's transformation scene is very scary and good effects, but its also amusing. Look out for Bottom's Rik Mayall and The Muppets' Frank Oz (not just on TV in the film). The film won Best Makeup at the Oscars. It was number 16 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!",An American Werewolf in London
8,ccthemovieman-1,Still Funny & Frightening After All These Years,9,9 November 2005,"Here's a film that never fails to entertain, year after year. It's almost a quarter of a century old but hasn't become dated and the special effects, which were astounding in its day, are still good. Director John Landis is so good at making entertaining movies. This is one of his best.The appeal to this film is the combination of horror, suspense, action and humor. The latter actually is the key ingredient because this can become a downright scary movie. The levity here and there is welcome relief. There is just the right amount of contrast between horror and comedy.For parents wanting to know, there also is a fair amount of rough language and there two sex scenes, one as part of the story and one ""on screen"" in a porn- movie theater where the two male leads meet late in the story.Jenny Agutter is the love interest in here, a very pretty woman whom Americans audiences aren't that familiar with. It isn't just her: neither of the two leading (American) male actors in this popular movie ever became stars, either.An entertaining but silly sequel came out almost two decades later, ""An American Werewolf in Paris."" I own both movies but much prefer this one.",An American Werewolf in London
9,rmax304823,Is That A Grin Or A Snarl?,6,25 February 2015,"I'll make this short and sweet, like the old lady's dance.The beginning is highly atmospheric. One night, two American college kids stop in a pub with the portentous name, ""The Slaughtered Lamb."" This is in Yorkshire and the pub is surrounded by flat, foggy moors. The pub itself is warm and inviting but the patrons are not, especially when one of the kids, David, asks about the shrine on the wall, the shrine with the pentagon on it.They are booted out into the night by the surly patrons, with a warning to stay on the road and avoid the moors, as Sir Henry Baskerville was once told. Well, Sir Henry survived. And that's the difference.The remainder of the film, as much of it as I saw, takes place in London, which, you'll remember, is a big city and not at all as frightening as those filmy and ominous moors. However, when David wakes up in hospital there, recovering from his bites, he's attended by the kind of nurse that hospitalized men dream about and that do not exist in real life.I'll tell you, Jenny Agutter, uniformed or undraped, lightens up the picture and the city.Outstanding special effects. If you enjoy the sight of ripped and sagging flesh, with bath tubs of blood, you'll be delighted. It's also supposed to be a comedy because it's approach to the material is light hearted. Yet, the truth is, all that blood, all that brutality and violence, aren't very funny, no matter how well they're nested in a plot full of wisecracks.And the central figure, David Naughton, isn't much of an actor. He gets the comic sense of the situation across but his features and demeanor don't know the meaning of anguish. Jenny Agutter can't really act either but I don't care. She's not the sleek, naked teen ager of ""Walkabout,"" but she has an offbeat beauty and the precise diction that you could listen to forever.",An American Werewolf in London
10,Tweekums,A classic comedy/horror,9,9 April 2017,"David and Jack are two young American enjoying a long holiday in Europe and naturally their first place to visit is a particularly bleak Yorkshire moor. Cold and wet they take shelter in The Slaughtered Lamb public house the welcome is such that they decide to leave fairly soon. As they leave the locals warn them to stick to the roads, stay off the moor and beware of the full moon. Soon they hear something and are then attacked by a wolf-like creature; Jack is killed and David wakes in a London hospital a few weeks later. Soon afterwards an undead Jack visits him and tells him they were attacked by a werewolf and if David doesn't kill himself before the next full moon he will turn into a werewolf and start killing people. As he recovers he gets close to Alex Price, his nurse, and when he is discharged she lets him stay at her flat and in her bed. Come the full moon he does indeed transform into a werewolf and goes out and kills six people; when he wakes up he has no memory of what happened and is naked in London zoo. After these events his doctor starts to wonder if he was involved and David tried unsuccessfully to get himself arrested before the next night.There are plenty of comedy horror films but most fail to be funny enough or fail to be scary enough or frequently both. This however succeeds on both counts. The film starts amusingly with David and Jack getting a lift on a lorry full of sheep before going to the perfect example of an unfriendly pub. When they are attacked it is obvious that the horror is going to be good too both scary and pretty gory. The special effects are still impressive over thirty five years after it was made the transformation of David into a werewolf, using great physical effects is a classic scene much better than the rapid CGI transformation of certain recent films that include werewolves. David Naughton does a fine job as David, nicely portraying his disbelief and later fear, about what is happening to him. Jenny Agutter also impresses as Alex, the nurse who falls in love with him. There is a fun selection of music to accompany the film; a succession of well-known songs, each of which refers to the moon. Overall I'd recommend this to horror fans although it certainly isn't suitable for younger viewers.",An American Werewolf in London
11,BA_Harrison,A howling success!,10,2 December 2006,"A quarter of a century has passed since its original release and An American Werewolf in London still stands (hairy) head and shoulders above any other lycanthrope movie. Its perfect direction from John Landis, superb black humour, groundbreaking make-up effects, and wonderful performances from leads David Naughton, Griffin Dunne and Jenny Agutter make the 1981 classic absolutely unmissable.Naughton plays David Kessler, an American back-packer travelling across Europe with his best pal Jack (Griffin Dunne). However, stopping off to visit the Yorkshire moors turns out to be a big mistake when the two lads are attacked by a werewolf. Jack is killed, but David survives.Whilst convalescing in hospital, David suffers from awful nightmares, and is visited by Jack's corpse, who warns him that in a few days time he will become a monster and kill. David confides in sexy nurse Alex Price (the delectable Jenny Agutter) who explains that he is suffering from shock and is imagining things. Falling for the young American, Alex invites David to stay with her in her London flat. But a couple of days later, David realises the awful truth when he turns into a furry fanged beast and leaves a trail of death in his wake.Landis's movie carefully mixes dark comedic moments with scenes of absolute horror to deliver that rare beasta comedy/horror that manages to be as frightening as it is amusing. The imaginative script blends traditional werewolf lore with its more contemporary elements perfectly, and much of the humour is derived from David's inability to accept what is happening to him.Furthermore, the horror isn't diluted by the comedy; in fact, the viewer is made to feel even more uneasy about the events unfolding by the awkward juxtaposition of the two genres. The film flips from lighthearted moments to extremely gory deaths in the blink of an eye and the results are definitely unsettling.Make-up maestro Rick Baker's yet-to-be-topped transformation effects still manage to take the breath away, proving that good old fashioned prosthetics beat the hell out of new-fangled CGI any day. His other work on the filmassorted bloody wounds and some nasty nazi-stormtrooper monstersare equally impressive and deservedly won him the 1982 Oscar for Best Makeup.Add to all that a killer soundtrack and a brilliantly downbeat ending and what you have is a winner from start to finish which deserves a place in any true horror fan's collection.",An American Werewolf in London
12,moonspinner55,"New-fangled horror movie homage...morbid humor and gore, yet nearly always with tongue-in-cheek",7,14 August 2011,"Writer-director John Landis' amusing comedy-thriller, a throwback to the monster movies of the 1940s, underlines its nostalgia for the past with black humor and outré shocks--but, surprisingly, the film isn't heavy and only occasionally seems mean-spirited. Two likable American tourists, back-packing through Northern England, run afoul of a werewolf; one of the men survives, much to his eventual regret. Landis has great affection for the werewolf entries which came before this; he alternates between a cheeky sensibility and full-throttle horror, and his handling is just nimble enough to distinguish the wit from the gore. Oscar-winner for Rick Baker's trenchant makeup effects. *** from ****",An American Werewolf in London
13,Quinoa1984,"both entertaining as a technical marvel, as comedy, and even as horror",10,25 September 2006,"John Landis has one of his most memorable films, as it challenges him as a director of comedy and horror, and he's rarely done better in the latter. While many of his best films are among the comedies that he directed for SNL alumni Belushi and Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy, An American Werewolf in London stands apart from those by casting David Naughton, Jenny Aguter, and Griffin Dunne in the parts- all practically unknowns then- and giving them some of the best kinds of genre roles imaginable. The two friends played by Naughton and Dunne are out on vacation, sort of, and they stumble upon a town loaded with superstition about wolves and other things. When Dunne gets killed and something, uh, peculiar happens to Naughton, it changes both of them- principally because Naughton keeps seeing Dunne, deteriorating throughout the rest of the film, even as he both turns into the werewolf (""Beware the moon, David, beware the moon"") and falls for a kind nurse played by Aguter. All three roles are realized well, though it might be prudent to put a lot of good will on the male leads, as they both go under Rick Baker's still show-stopping make-up jobs.This is the kind of production that could go in a few different directions, and for someone like Landis's skills it could've gone in those directions, either one, considering his background. It could have been a send-up much like his Kentucky Fried Movie. It could have been just dumb, pure camp like one of his lesser comedies of the 90s. But here he's really sticking to his guns to make it really believably scary, but also with a sly, coarse, and crude sense of humor about it. It's almost in tune to what would come a few years later with Ghostbusters, only without the mega-wit and overall mainstream appeal. It's a cult item that probably isn't seen by many as Landis's other films, yet I still remember things very well from the film years later, indelible things like the use of songs (obvious, sure, by 'moon' being all over the place, but everything from Van Morrison to CCR to the main Blue Moon theme used during the crossover are really dead-perfect for what's needed). Aside from the obvious make-up scenes, I remember being both freaked and delighted by the undead exchanges with David, especially when it finally reaches its purest absurdity in the movie theater scene.And even the ending, unlike other Landis films, is with a tinge of tragedy and sadness. This is not the ending a typical comedy director would bring, as by now we've really gotten on the side of David, the scorned protagonist turned bloody villain by way of a curse. Some of the scenes that end up cutting back to the old rural village, as I also remember it, were not my favorite scenes as they brought more of the superstitious stuff that is not necessarily needed. It's the bits with Naughton, with Dunne, and even with the lady of the film that make it worthwhile. It's fun but not too goofy or bad B-movie-like, and it's scary without being cheap. It's basically the finest synthesis yet from the filmmaker to combine his gory theatrics with his firm, cool sense of humor. It's also one of my favorite films of 1981.",An American Werewolf in London
14,tavm,John Landis' An American Werewolf in London is fine horror-comedy,8,17 April 2007,"After 26 years, I finally got a chance to see John Landis' An American Werewolf in London in its entirety. David Naughton, whom I first saw on Dr. Pepper commercials singing ""I'm a Pepper"", is fine as the guy who becomes the title character. Griffin Dunne, perhaps best known for Martin Scorsese's After Hours, is likewise as his doomed buddy who comes back as the decaying undead. Jenny Agutter has great chemistry with Naughton as the nurse who falls for him. And John Woodvine acquits himself nicely as the doctor trying to help David. Loved the reference to Lon Chaney's The Wolf Man when David and Jenny are in bed. Rick Baker wholly deserved the first Makeup Effects Oscar for the believable werewolf transformation. Nice quick shots of various wolf killings. Most hilarious scenes were when Naughton wakes up naked in the London zoo and gets, first, balloons and then a lady's coat to cover himself up! Also loved his insults to the police constable like, ""Prince Charles is a faggot!"" The ending seemed abrupt to me especially when it changed to The Marcels' doo-wop version of ""Blue Moon"" in the end credits but otherwise, this was a fine mix of comedy and horror. One of John Landis' best. P.S. Watch for two Landis trademarks: Fake movie See You Next Wednesday is the title of a porno flick-which we see some scenes of-playing at the cinema of Picadilly Circus where David meets Griffin and his victims and the ""When in Hollywood, Visit Universal Studios (Ask for Babs)"" slide which previously appeared at the end of Landis' last two features for the studio, Animal House and The Blues Brothers, also appears here (Babs being the AH character who was revealed to have become a US tour guide).",An American Werewolf in London
15,BandSAboutMovies,Perfection,10,10 October 2019,"There must have been something in the water in 1981, as The Howling, Wolfen and this film all came out in those same twelve months. While all three are interesting films for different reasons, An American Werewolf In London astounded audiences with its special effects.Rick Baker's vision was to have the main transformation -- set to Sam Cookie's ""Blue Moon"" -- happen in real time, with no cutaways or dissolves. Director John Landis compounded the difficulty of this sequence by insisting that it be shot in bright light. This all led to six ten-hour days of prosthetic make-up, but the results were an Oscar -- the first of its kind -- for special effects make-up and Baker became a household name. Well, in the house of kids who subscribed to Fangoria.While he was a production assistant in Yugoslavia on the film Kelly's Heroes, he witnessed an elaborate gypsy funeral where a criminal was wrapped in garlic and buried feet first in the middle of a crossroads so that he would never rise again. This moment of real life horror stayed with him for over a decade as he built his career in Hollywood.The money people thought that this movie was too funny to be scary and too frightening to be hilarious. Time has proven them wrong.David Kessler and Jack Goodman (David Naughton from March Madness and Griffin Dunne from After Hours) are backpacking through Europe. As they make their way across the moors, they stop at a local club called the Slaughtered Lamb. In the midst of all the fun they're having, they innocently inquire about the star on the wall and are asked to leave. Seriously -- the bar just shuts down and forces them into the night, knowing that they'll die out there.Look for Rik Mayall in this scene, playing chess with former pro wrestler Brian Glover. Adrian Edmonson had been invited to be at the shoot but blew it off.As they walk into the night, the pub owners can only say, ""Keep to the road, stay clear of the moors and beware of the full moon."" Of course, that means that our heroes wander off the path and are surrounded by a creature that howls at the full moon. Jack is milled and David barely survives when the pub's patrons come out to save him. As he passes out, he sees that it wasn't an animal that attacked, but a nude man.Three weeks later, David wakes up in a hospital where Inspector Villiers tells him that he and his friend were attacked by a lunatic, while our hero insists that it was a wolf. That's when things get even weirder -- Jack appears, even though he's dead, and demands that David kill himself before the next full moon. As long as the bloodline of the werewolf continues, Jack will be undead, forced to haunt the world.As David heals up, he moves in with Alex Price (Jenny Agutter, Logan's Run), a nurse who helped him get back on his feet. Instead of being able to celebrate young love, Jack's warnings -- and decay -- grow more insistent as we get closer to that epic transformation scene.The rest of the film is a rollercoaster of werewolf attacks and David trying to reason with Jack, who is joined by all of David's victims inside an adult movie theater. Finally, the police -- and Alex -- close in.Today, Landis regrets some of his choices as he made the film, such as cutting certain sequences to earn an R rating. For example, the sex scene when Alex and David finally consummate their relationship was a lot more explicit and there was an action sequence where David as a werewolf would wipe out the homeless along the Thames. The director also felt that he spent too much time on the transformation scene sequence because he was so fascinated by Baker's effects.That said, Landis and Baker were never on the same terms after this film. It took eight years to make the movie and Baker decided to use all of the work he'd created so far for The Howling. Right around the same time, Landis finally got the movie greenlit and called Baker, who had to tell him he was already lining up a werewolf project. After getting screamed at over the phone, Baker left the project in the hands of his assistant Rob Bottin and only consulted on that film.Special effects would never be the same after this film. Today, the entire transformation would be computer rendered, with those amazing monsters only truly existing on the screen. This film's effects were so upsetting to even the actors that it caused depression when they first saw how damaged their faces were.PS -- Please, by all means, avoid An American Werewolf In Paris, a movie made by none of these people that has extreme bungie jumping in it. That's probably the only reason to watch it, actually.",An American Werewolf in London
16,Coventry,Werewolves at their peak !,9,23 June 2003,"This was the golden age for horror. Just like the 40's were for monster movies, the early 80's were great for a couple outstanding werewolf-films. The first half of this decade has brought us the Howling, The company of wolves and Silver bullet and this one from John Landis...I recommend them all. This film sets one of the best atmospheres I've ever seen. The movie opens with great shots of the British countryside, while the song ""Blue Moon"" is playing (the calm version, the more ""Rock 'n Roll version appears in the end) I don't think a better opening scene is possible for a film like this. It's obvious right away : although John Landis made his name in comedy (Animal House) he knows what he's doing in the field of horror. Everything in this movie is in the right proportions. There's a good amount of creepy scenes, a great soundtrack (all the songs are about the moon...and songs like ""Bad moon Rising"" by CCR always work) a good acting by the main characters (Naughton convinces, Agutter is adorable and Dunne is GREAT !) There's also a lot of humor in the film, but the film never makes fun with the genre of horror or the myth of Werewolves. That's an achievement on itself, I believe. And last but not least the make up effect are sublime. The transformation from man to wolf is now, more than 20 years later, still one of the best scenes in horror ever !! The film got an Oscar for that and it surely deserved that.If your wanting to see a good old-fashioned Werewolf movie : Look no further, you found it. I assure you'll love it. More than 15 years later, they made a sort of sequel. Set in Paris this time. That one contains a few good scenes (and a lovely Julie Delphy) but it isn't half as good as ""Amercian Werewolf in London"" is.",An American Werewolf in London
17,Theo Robertson,The Greatest Werewolf Film Ever,9,14 June 2009,"In his original review the great Roger Ebert didn't think much of this film citing the numerous dream sequences as being unnecessary . This is unfair . The dream sequences are needed to hold the attention of the audience . There's a problem with all werewolf films in that they're self limiting with "" man getting bitten so audience have to wait and twiddle their thumbs till man turns in to werewolf "" so Landis brings in the dream sequences to keep the audience on tenterhooks . It may not add anything to the plot but the werewolf Nazis and the following sequence where the audience are wrong footed is a very witty piece of writing The film manages to merge gut wrenching black comedy with gruesome horror and not many films have been able to do this . It also manages to mix traditional horror clichés like outsiders walking in to an Inn ( We don't get many strangers 'ere sir ) with post modernism where characters discuss werewolf movies . These mixed concepts never jar and add a charm to the film . Even the Americancentric view of England being a place of lonely moors , red buses , punks and friendly London bobbies adds to the warmth What makes the film even more fondly remembered over time is the fact that before CGI was invented FX teams earned their money . The special effects people and make up artists make AWIL a tour de force for their profession . You might complain that the werewolf itself when fully shown looks too literally like a massive wolf but nowadays we'd be drowned in CGI effects credibility would quickly collapse . Indeed this was a major problem with the sequel set in Paris . That and the blatant fact that it was unrelated to this picture There are a couple of minor complaints . One is the very abrupt ending where the protagonist is killed when you're expecting the deed to be done by his lover , especially when David did mention werewolves being killed by loved ones in movies earlier . There's also a plot hole of David transforming in to a werewolf , leaving the house killing several people including one in the London underground but never once being spotted by a passer by . What compounds the lack of logic is the following memorable comic sequence where a naked David wonders how he's going to get home but I guess this is cinematic convention in general and horror convention in particular , you have to suspend disbelief in order for a film to work But these are minor complaints .

18,Scarecrow-88,An American Werewolf in London,8,15 October 2006,"""But look at me. Here I sit in a porno theater, in Piccadily Circus, talking to a corpse."" As you can tell from the dialogue above, Landis takes his werewolf film into a whole new arena letting it all hang out with wild ideas that somehow work despite how absurd they seem. David Kessler(David Naughton)watches as his best friend Jack Goodman(Griffin Dunne)is slaughtered by a werewolf and then gets a slash in his chest from the beast before townsfolk kill the lycanthrope.David might've survived, but he's a lot worse for ware, because he's now a lycanthrope who is warned by his friend's corpse(Dunne, who is shown with skin deterioration after each visit at first exposing a nasty neck ripped open until his visit to David in the porno theater where his entire face has rotted away), unfortunately stuck in limbo like any werewolf victim who isn't freed until the werewolf bloodline is severed. Goodman offers suicide to his pal telling him that he'll kill innocent people if he doesn't. David, though, doesn't know if his decomposing dead friend is merely a product of other bizarre nightmares so he, at first, doesn't take the visits seriously. He and the nurse attending to him, Alex(Jenny Agutter, quite yummy)fall in love and when David eventually does change into the wolf(this is the amazing transformation sequence CGI just can't top)..this complicates his life. How can he continue to live knowing that lives are in danger(in a hilarious ""day-after-the-transformation"" sequence, David finds himself naked in a cage with wolves and must walk through a zoo naked until he can find something to cover himself with)? His continual visits from Goodman end in a porno theater where he is presented the dead victims he attacked as a wolf which is a gruesomely macabre moment that is quite funny at the same time as they offer David ways to kill himself. Landis surprises the viewer with an abrupt, chaotic conclusion in Piccadily Circus where the David turns into the werewolf rampaging through the streets causing an array of devastating crashes with many people being smashed by(..and thrown out of)vehicles.",An American Werewolf in London
19,Hey_Sweden,"""I will not be threatened by a walking meat loaf!""",9,21 May 2014,"John Landis' delightful 1980s update of the werewolf theme is one of those horror films that succeeds quite well at delivering both the chills and the chuckles. It's often as funny as it is scary, has a script (by Landis) that is very quotable at times, features an excellent assemblage of actors, and is thickly atmospheric. For this viewer, at least, it has the edge over the *other* big werewolf movie of 1981, ""The Howling"", due to its ""stranger in a strange land"" premise. Landis gets great use out of various British locations. The makeup effects by Rick Baker are impressive and memorable, and deservedly won the Academy Award for that year. The soundtrack features both a wonderful Elmer Bernstein score and a selection of pop tunes each containing the word ""moon"" (including three versions of ""Blue Moon""). Everything adds up to create an experience that is lots of fun.American tourists David Kessler (David Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Griffin Dunne) are travelling the remote English countryside when, after a tense encounter at the out-of-the- way pub ""The Slaughtered Lamb"", they end up attacked by a four legged beast on the moors. Jack is killed, but David survives, and David soon ends up receiving regular visits from his mutilated pal, who warns David that he was in fact bitten by a werewolf and will become one on the next full moon. David doesn't want to believe it - and who would? - but sure enough, he transforms and starts savaging London citizens. Meanwhile, David has fallen in love with a nurse, Alex Price (Jenny Agutter), whose boss, Dr. Hirsch (John Woodvine), decides to do some sleuthing.Naughton is a very engaging lead, and Dunne is equally solid (and amusing) as his undead friend. The appealing Agutter is at her loveliest here. The excellent Woodvine leads a fine supporting cast also consisting of David Schofield, Brian Glover, Lila Kaye, Rik Mayall, Don McKillop, and Paul Kember; Frank Oz has a great cameo as the American Embassy man. Landis begins his film on an extremely ominous note; those opening minutes in the country are beautifully spooky. From then on he creates an effective balancing act of humour and horror. The gore and the principal transformation are amazing, although some fans do feel somewhat let down by the appearance of the monster itself. Many fine sequences, especially the chase through the subway system. The Nazi monster nightmare scene is also noteworthy. The climactic chaos in Piccadilly Square is exciting, and the ending is very much to the point.Looking at this now, it's hard to believe that Landis could have had such a hard time selling this script; he'd written it several years previous.Strongly recommended to all genre fans.Nine out of 10.",An American Werewolf in London
20,preppy-3,Great horror movie with a strong sense of humor,10,25 December 2004,"Two American boys David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dunne) are traveling through England. They get stuck on the moors one night and are attacked by a werewolf. Jack is killed but David is only wounded. He recovers in a hospital in London with his dead, decomposing friend Jack appearing to him and telling him he will become a werewolf unless he kills himself. David refuses to believe it and starts to become attracted to Nurse Alex Price (Jenny Agutter). Then he's released from the hospital, and there's a full moon that night...I caught this in a theatre back in 1981. For its time it was pretty extreme but also very funny. I loved it back then and it still holds up today. I was surprised to find myself laughing out loud many times during the movie. Many people think this is a comedy or a spoof but it isn't--the violence is extreme and very bloody and never played for laughs. But John Landis (writer and director) manages to balance the horror and the comedy perfectly--that's not easy but he manages it. Also the film is beautifully directed and he's got two attractive, appealing leads--Naughton and Agutter.Naughton isn't much of an actor but he IS good-looking, has a nice body and is nude frequently. Agutter is a little better. The best performance is from John Woodvine as Dr. Hirsch. But really--this isn't an acting film. The special effects are still impressive today. Jack's body is decomposing more and more each time he's sees David. It's gross but it works. And the transformation sequence is still very good (much better than the CGI crap we get today). And the all out destruction at Pickadilly Circus is just great! Only complaint: When the police shot and kill David at the end there is no way they could have shot him without killing Alex--but she's not hurt at all.This was ignored back in 1981 (audiences probably weren't ready for it) but it's now considered one of the best horror films of the 1980s and the best werewolf movie ever! I give it a 10.Best line: Dead Jack to David: ""Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring!""",An American Werewolf in London

The Transformation Scenes especially. The rest of the Gore drips from the Screen at regular Intervals and the Dark Humor, while at times are Poker-Faced and Strained, is enough to keep this one going as a Cult Favorite for Years to come.On the Down Side, David Naughton is an annoyingly Bad Actor and is saved by the rest of the Fine Cast. There may be one too many Moon Songs and the Obligatory Sex and Nude Scenes do seem Dated. But none of this is enough to take away the Sheer and Blatant Gall of it all.There are some Genuine Shocks and the Piccadilly Square Carnage is just this side of Over the Top in an already Over the Top Movie but it works for a Final Blast of Mayhem.

22,poolandrews,An excellent classic horror that holds up really well even now.,8,8 July 2009,"An American Werewolf in London starts on the gloomy English moors where two American backpackers David Kessler (David Naughton) & Jack Goldman (Griffin Dunne) are hiking, they become lost & are attacked by a Werewolf with Jack being killed & David injured. Three weeks later & David wakes up in a central London hospital to the news that his mate is dead, he quickly starts having horrific nightmares as he & nurse Alex Price (Jenny Agutter) begin to fall in love. When released from hospital David stays with Alex, on the night of the first full moon after the attack David turns into a Werewolf & kills six people & wakes up naked at a zoo. Unable to remember what he did the night before David becomes worried & after getting various visits from his dead friend Jack warning about what was going to happen he is convinced he killed those people. The only way to put an end to the bloodshed is for David to be killed but with the next full moon fast approaching who will do it...This British American co-production was written & directed by John Landis & is considered one of the true classics of the genre, usually I don't buy into what other people say & make my own mind up just the way it should be but on this occasion I can see why An American Werewolf in London is so highly regarded as it's an excellent horror film with lashings of black humour. The script modernises the traditional Werewolf story just like The Howling (1980) did around the same time although I think An American Werewolf in London is the far superior film. It has a great story that really engages with terrific character's whom you care for & make the downbeat ending rather sad, a nice pace, plenty of incident & some really cool scenes including the climax set in Piccadilly Circus which must have been a nightmare to organise. To offset the horror there's a nice vein of black humour running through the film with a funny & slightly surreal scene set inside a porno theatre where David gets to talk with his dead victims & the amusing aftermath of David's first transformation where he wakes up naked at a zoo & has to get home by stealing a woman's coat. The only problem I have with An American Werewolf in London are the abrupt nightmare sequences which don't make much sense in context & just seem to happen & I would have liked a little bit more involving the villagers who feel like they should be important but are never really used & are totally forgotten about. All in all though a classic of the genre that holds up really well even today, in fact An American Werewolf in London is head & shoulders above most new horror product.This is well made with the Oscar winning special make-up effects by Rick Baker being of particular note, the Werewolf transformation is excellent & still has yet to be bettered really. It's certainly a lot more impressive than any CGI computer Werewolf transformation I have seen. There's some good gore here too from ripped up Deer, slit throats, severed hands, rotting corpses, lots of blood, a bitten off head & some mangled bodies. The effects are good though the attack scenes are short & little is seen probably due to the limitations of the effects at the time. Several London landmarks are seen & feature in the film while the soundtrack is especially good here with all the songs featured having the word Moon in the title & the Werewolf howl very striking & one of the best I've heard.With a supposed budget of about $10,000,000 this had a pretty big budget & you can see it on screen with good use of locations, great effects work & high production values. The acting is very good too, there's a great supporting cast including Jenny Agutter, Brian Glover, Alan Ford, Frank Oz & Rik Mayall while porn star Linzi Drew appears as herself in the porn film playing at the theatre. Apparently the studio hoped Dan Aykroyd & John Belushi would be cast in the leading roles but thankfully that didn't happen.An American Werewolf in London is a classic horror film that is well regarded amongst genre fans for very good reason, it's one of the best horrors out there basically that can be enjoyed on many levels & probably is more accessible than a lot of horror. A really top film that was followed by a terrible sequel An American Werewolf in Paris (1997).",An American Werewolf in London

26,Boba_Fett1138,Original as well as surprisingly effective horror/comedy.,8,10 October 2008,"What this movie does very well, and what it is so well known for, is the fact that it perfect blends the comedy with its horror, without letting the one element weaken the other. Because for instance in lot of other horror/comedies, the comedy really weakens the horror. It makes them ineffective as scary and gory ones but this really isn't the case with ""An American Werewolf in London"".Perhaps this is because the comedy within this movie is more subtle and B-movie like. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously which allows the movie its comedy to work out so effective and subtle. John Landis obviously made the movie deliberately B-movie like in parts, especially by picking not the best actors and by not giving them the best dialog imaginable. It on top of that features some great typical B-movie like moments, which perhaps is only truly notable for the genre fans and most other people will probably write it off as lame and simplistic.Just because the movie features humor and has B-movie elements in it doesn't mean that this movie is ineffective as an horror movie. In that genre this movie also really stands out. It does this by featuring some great imaginative and gory looking sequences. but it also does this not in the least with its make-up effects. Especially the dream sequences within the movie are quite memorable. This movie was actually the first to receive and Oscar for its make-up. Before this, best make-up wasn't even a category at the Oscar's, believe it or not. But thanks to this movie the academy realized that this was a profession to take seriously and to include in the award ceremony. The award of course went to legendary make-up artist Rick Baker. It was the first out of 6 Oscar's he has so far received during his career.The movie is actually surprisingly gory. It's just not something you would expect from an horror/comedy but this movie is basically just as gory, if not gorier, than most other 'serious' genre movies. Director John Landis actually now days is surprised how gory this movie actually is when he looks back at it.Of course the movie doesn't feature a too complicated plot (luckily so) but it nevertheless know to pick an original approach with its story and all. It doesn't feature an usual werewolf plot in which the victim is battling his transformation during full moon and is plotting to kill the werewolf that bite him in order to lift the curse. I won't tell what the actual plot of the movie is, since it will probably spoil to much but fact is that it's original, which also means that the movie doesn't end in a typical 'Hollywood-way'.When watching this movie it actually becomes more painfully obvious how bad its sequel ""An American Werewolf in Paris"", which got made 16 years(!) after this movie, actually is. It tries to achieve the same thing as this movie, by picking the same type of approach but in moments like that it becomes obvious that directing is a real important job and that some directors are simply more talented than others. Anthony Waller just obviously ain't no John Landis! John Landis would also later impress with the legendary Michael Jackson video-clip for the hit song 'Thriller'. The special make-up effects again came from Rick Baker. The clip definitely shows similarities to this movie in especially its style.A great as well as enjoyable unique werewolf movie!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",An American Werewolf in London
27,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Stick to the roads, as well as classics like this",8,8 March 2010,"Two friends hiking out in the country in England find more than they bargained for. So begins one of the best of the numerous funny horror movies of the 80s, not to mention one that holds up remarkably well. To be perfectly honest, I didn't care for all of the jokes and gags; I found several to fall flat, and found this to have too much irritating comic relief. Dunno, maybe this is Animal House(I haven't watched that one and I honestly don't intend to) to a greater extent than it's The Blues Brothers(I'm referring to the sense of humor). With that said, it definitely did make me laugh. And it is rather terrifying, with a solid atmosphere that is built up quite well. I didn't think this had the impact that it should, but to be fair, my copy had sound issues, so I did not get the full experience. The characters aren't all that interesting, or maybe that's just me. It looks marvelous, the editing and cinematography are spot-on; Landis is a highly talented director and writer. This is tense and suspenseful whenever it goes for it. The scares work, hardly any are cheap or unsatisfying. This has amazing FX, and those transformations are excellent. While it is a simple story and execution, it is immensely effective. There is plenty of bloody, brutal, gory violence, a little moderate to strong language, and infrequent nudity(mostly male) and sexuality. I recommend this to any fan of this type of flick. This entertained me from start to finish, something the recent remake of The Wolfman completely failed to. 8/10",An American Werewolf in London

I mean a pure werewolf film, not a mixture with vampires or other monsters.

Two backpackers visiting England have their vacation shaken up when one of them is bitten by a werewolf. The movie goes on to chronicle his transformation and the victims left in his wake.In 1981 this movie was the bomb. The main character, played by David Naughton, was witty and likable. In fact, he reminded me very much of Robert Downey Jr. But I think what made it such a standout movie was David Kessler's (David Naughton) metamorphosis. Granted I was very young, but I hadn't seen anything like it before. Until this movie I don't think werewolf transfigurations had been attempted on film. It was awesome, even today. Consider that there was no CGI, just make-up artists and camera tricks. AWIL set the standard for werewolf movies and they're all still chasing it.",An American Werewolf in London

With An American Werewolf In London, writer/director John Landis shows us how to do it, because this movie makes us laugh and jump.The story is a familiar one - the admonition not to stray onto the moors on the night of the full moon proves one to take notice of, as failure to comply with it leads to one American tourist dying and the other being hospitalised. During his convalescence he falls for one of the nurses (and she for him) but, come the next full moon...David Naughton was a pleasingly vulnerable lead, but his career never really went in the direction one might have expected it to after this film.

But there's no denying that ""An American Werewolf in London"" does have some extremely memorable moments, like a ghoulishly creepy werewolf attack set in the English moors, and at least one scene, the first time we see the hero turn into a werewolf (which won the film the Academy Award for makeup in the first year that award was given) obviously influenced ""The Howling"" greatly.Grade: B",An American Werewolf in London

The opening here is among one of the most impressive parts to this one with the fun of their arrival in the country and their journey through the countryside, eventually winding up with the actual attack which is quite a dark and brutal effort which is far more inhuman and savage than expected before letting the big gun-down finish As well,that leads into the main section of the film here where it starts to get into the growing realization of what he's become as this is easily the best part of the film. The conversations with the gradually-decomposing friend showing up at the most inopportune times is a great building block while also managing some fine jokes at the comedic content of the situation, while far more engaging is the actual investigation done at the behest of the doctor into his condition after arriving at the hospital. That leads into some rather enjoyable times here where it really manages to continue on through a fine series of clues that gradually lead to the eventual discovery from the group which is how this one really gets a lot of good fun going along with the events leading up through the initial attack and overall build into how he got to become a werewolf. Once it gets past that into the action as well it's a lot of fun here with the series of attacks found in the suburbs of the city and in the subway station that gets some pretty enjoyable times here along with the finale in crowded London makes for a lot of good fun. The design is pretty creepy, and looks like what a man who turns into a werewolf looks like, in terms of the werewolf as it looks incredibly scary and creepy. It's wisely kept out of the shadows in the beginning so that suspense is drawn up about what it looks like, and all we get are brief glimpses of something, and when the big reveal comes, it works wonders as it doesn't look like what you expected. There are only a couple of minor quips about this film. The first one is the slow beginning, as it takes a while for the film to really get going with the cheap jumps get a little tiresome after a while. The big stuff doesn't happen until an hour into the movie, so it does finish on a flourish but the opening is a long dredge. The humor is another big distraction as if it doesn't know if it wants to be a horror film or a comedy since the comedy can be a distraction for those that are into the hardcore horror aspects in the film. The last flaw here is about the storyline as it's one of the few that doesn't try to change the werewolf mythology and instead relies on viewers knowledge of previous werewolf movies to know the background for this one. Some of it is given in the film, but not really enough for first time viewers to werewolf movie to truly understand. Otherwise, this one is a lot of fun.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Full Nudity, several mild sex scenes and scenes set in a porn theater.",An American Werewolf in London

It is also one of the first to incorporate comedy and horror together very successfully.  This movie has two guys walking the countryside.  They go into a pub at night, get thrown out for being too curious and later are attacked by a wolf.  One of them is killed and the other is sent to a hospital where he has a rather odd dream. He of course was bitten by a werewolf so he ends up becoming one.  Very well done as they have him haunted by those he kills, even his friend pays him a visit in different stages of decay.  The make-up and effects were excellent, this is much better than the cgi werewolf in Paris (I never watched that one, but I saw the previews), though this one probably has the more limited movement.  Some gore here and there, the worst is when the guy sees his dead friend at the hospital for the first time.  The guy ends up falling in love with a nurse as well.  This film is very good all the way around though those dream sequences are kind of bizarre.  Also, the whole ending was just a bit to depressing seeing how most of the movie had its lighter moments.

36,Wuchakk,The title of the movie tells you everything you need to know,7,13 April 2017,"Released in 1981 and written & directed by John Landis, ""An American Werewolf in London"" details events when two American male college students (David Naughton & Griffin Dunne) hike through the moors of northern England where they're attacked by a ferocious werewolf under the full moon. One wakes up in a hospital three weeks later wherein he starts a relationship with a nurse (Jenny Agutter). Will he become a werewolf? John Woodvine plays a doctor who takes interest in the case. There were three major-release werewolf films in 1981: ""The Howling"" was the first and arguably the best, debuting in April, while ""Wolfen"" came out on in July and wasn't really a werewolf film, but rather a thinking person's nature-runs-amok flick. ""An American Werewolf"" came last, released in August, and was easily the most successful at the box office, making three times its cost in the US alone and 6 times worldwide. Yet, ""The Howling"" was more successful if you go by profit in comparison to cost, as it was surprisingly low-budget for a major release. ""Wolfen"" was, by far, the most expensive; and flopped. ""American Werewolf"" quickly garnered a cult following and I can see why. I usually don't like horror mixed with comedy, but this movie does it expertly; it's consistently thrilling, gory, colorful, quirky and amusing. The transformation scenes hold up, as they depict the excruciating process. Moreover, it's interesting seeing life in London in 1980 (when it was shot). Unfortunately, while Agutter is comely, not enough is done with her; and there's a curious hollowness to the movie, not to mention it ends in an awkwardly abrupt manner. Nevertheless, it's well worth checking out if you're in the mode for a quick, entertaining horror/comedy fix. A stand-alone sequel came out in 1997, ""An American Werewolf in Paris."" A UK production, the picture runs 97 minutes and was shot in Powys, Wales (Hay Bluff, Crickadarn & Brecon Beacons) and England (London, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire & Middlesex). The special makeup effects were done by the renowned Rick Baker.GRADE: B",An American Werewolf in London

With realistic computer graphics, better models etc, and the pushing the envelope on FX, this move is the stone wheel compared to the all season tire.

39,christopher-underwood,"the first transformation, which incidentally I feel is the best in cinema",8,7 January 2020,"A very enjoyable and well put together film. Feeling a bit under the weather post Christmas, this seemed just the thing to watch. Not too demanding and always a pleasure and so it turned out. Perhaps there are too many hospital scenes but then we do get Jenny Agutter. I don't feel the creature at the end is anything like as impressive as the one glimpsed earlier after the first transformation, which incidentally I feel is the best in cinema. Returning to the lovely Agutter, I did feel this time that she didn't seem entirely confident as the lead and yet this sort of worked because she was in such a strange situation, being head of heels in love at first sight with a werewolf! The start with the arrival on the moors, the pub and the aftermath, is brilliantly done. The Piccadilly Circus incident is also wonderfully choreographed and if some of the middle is less consistent, there is still plenty of fun to be had. Kept me going anyway.",An American Werewolf in London
40,Smells_Like_Cheese,A great comedy/horror flick,10,8 December 2004,"There was a time when believe it or not, I wasn't into the movie. I thought the ending was a little weak. But after giving the movie another chance, I loved it. This is without a doubt one of my favorite horror films, because it has such a brilliant combination of horror and comedy that is priceless.John Landis, he was such a great director in the 80's and I learned that this was one of his first scripts. This movie was also a break through Oscar wise, this is the first film to win best make up effects. Which it totally deserved because we actually get to witness the transformation from man to werewolf on screen and it's unforgettable. For 1981, these effects were amazing!Taking place in London, as two Americans are back packing through Europe, we have David Naughten who plays David Kessler and Griffin Dunne who plays Jack Goodman. When they are warned to ""beware the moon and stick to the road... oops!"", they loose their way and are viciously attacked by a werewolf. Jack is unfortunately killed but David is bitten and the werewolf gets killed by the town's people. David wakes up in the hospital where he is being cared for by a beautiful nurse, Jenny Agutter who plays Alex Price and is David's love interest in the movie.When David has finally gathered himself and accepts what happened as just a ""freak"" accident, Jack, a terribly dismembered and gouged out dead Jack comes to visit David from beyond the grave. It starts off as just this hilarious conversation talking about Jack's funeral while David is debating if he's going crazy or not, my favorite line is in this scene: ""Susan(name???) cried a lot and snuck the comfort in Mark Levigne's bed"" David is shocked and says ""Mark Levigne?!"" Jack just playfully remarks ""An a*****e, life mocks me even in death"". LOL! Then Jack tells David that they were attacked by a werewolf and he must kill himself otherwise he'll kill others and make them like Jack whereas he cannot go to Heaven or Hell, he's on the line until the werewolf's blood is severed. ""Have you ever tried talking to a corpse!? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others"" is Jack's last lines before David just begs Nurse Alex to get him out of the hospital.Through a love or lust story between Alex and David, David is warned once again by Jack who is now becoming more decayed, he ignores the warnings thinking it's only his conscience but is terribly wrong when he kind of goes on a stroll during the full moon killing 6 people in London. He then is confronted by all of the corpses along with Jack and just have this great scene of how to kill himself. Guys, this is a terrific movie and is a must see for horror fans, comedy fans, any type of movie fan. It's just a lot of fun to watch and it's scary and exciting and you just can't miss it. Beware the moors and maybe get yourself a silver bullet if you go to London. :D10/10",An American Werewolf in London

Today, I feel like I'm 9 years old and in the theater again when I re-watch this movie.American Werewolf in London is one of the best comedy horror films ever made yet as some of the scariest moments ever filmed.This movie uses old school special effects which will give any of today's CGI effects a ""run for it's money""! I am mainly talking about the infamous werewolf transformation scene which is still viewed and re-viewed by many today - considered to be one of the greatest transformation scenes ever!

43,sddavis63,I'm Not Sure You Could Make A Better Werewolf Movie,9,2 July 2011,"Wow. With one word that pretty much sums up this absolutely stunning horror movie. Director John Landis managed one of those movies where everything just came together and almost everything is right with this. The premise of ""An American Werewolf In London"" is obvious from the title. And, yes, a lot of werewolf movies have been made - before and after this one. So, sure, you'd wonder how another one could be fresh or rise above the rest, but this one managed the trick. It is the perfect combination of a very frightening movie, a very graphic and bloody movie and a very funny movie. At times you'll be jumping and almost wanting to put your hands over your eyes, and then five minutes later you'll be chuckling at something. It's all there, and woven together just perfectly. And out of all the werewolf movies I've seen (and I love the genre, so I've seen a lot) I think this one has the absolute best transformation scene ever put together.The cast was superb. David Naughton as the unfortunate David Kessler, who gets bitten by a werewolf and is of course cursed to become a werewolf. The little known (at least to me) and very lovely British actress Jenny Agutter was perfect as Alex, David's nurse who lets him move in with her after he's released from the hospital. There's really no weaknesses in any of the supporting cast, either. The relationship between David and Alex was one minor issue. It happened too fast to be truly believable. The plot mechanism of having David's dead friend Jack who had been killed by the werewolf that bit David (played by Griffin Dunne) appear to him and warn him about what was going to happen worked for a while but became a bit tired by the end. This very fast paced movie also ended a bit too abruptly for my liking, although there was a pretty good romp of devastation by the werewolf through Piccadilly. Those are really quite minor weaknesses, though. Overall, this movie is a blast. (9/10)",An American Werewolf in London
44,llltdesq,"Funny and horrific, though wildly uneven film with incredible makeup and effects.",8,31 October 2001,"This film is actualy reasonably good, with good performaces from Naughton and Agutter and the best performance of Griffin Dunne's career (which isn't saying much), and good special effects and fantastic makeup that won Rick Baker the very first competitive Oscar given for makeup.  There are some amusing cameos, particularly in the pub toward the beginning.  Not Gone With the Wind, but then we already had one of those.  An entertaining, enjoyable film well worth watching.

I liked the humor, the one transformation scene and the full-frontal male nudity, but it's hardly a great werewolf movie. #1 he turns into a dog, so not a scary werewolf to me and even when he's a monster SOOO late into the movie, they barely ever show him except in close-ups that could've been filmed anywhere or even months following the film's wrap.

Indeed!But, hey! - What the heck! - When it comes around to this picture's spectacular ""panicking mob"" scene (impressively shot in London's ""Piccadilly Circus"" district) - I'm sure that all can be forgiven.Directed by John Landis - ""An American Werewolf In London"" is a fairly entertaining slice of Comedy/Horror where you actually may be pleasantly surprised when some of its howling humor suddenly turns around and bites you on the ass.This film contains both male and female nudity, as well as some intense sexual situations, too.",An American Werewolf in London
47,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Bad moon rising.,7,5 January 2021,"Landis' iconic werewolf movie isn't what you'd perhaps expect it to be. It's a tragedy about two young men who fall victim to a werewolf while they're backpacking in the Yorkshire Dales; one of them is killed instantly, the other is stricken with a curse that sees him slowly transition into a beast of the night. The majority of 'An American Werewolf In London (1981)' is dedicated to the latter's slow transition from man to monster, a transition marked with ghastly nightmares, visions of the dead and, eventually, body metamorphosis. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the protagonist's lycanthropic form eventually comes into play; the flick's infamous 'transition' sequence is engrained in pop-culture, regarded as one of horror's greatest moments. Rick Baker's special effects are a sight to behold, painfully conveying the plot's bone-breaking body horror and gut-wrenching gore with equal aptitude. The movie is impactful primarily because it creates likeable, down-to-earth characters and does a rock-solid job of getting you to care about them. Its hero seems like one of the nicest people in the world, which is why his turmoil hurts us as almost as much as it does him. Plus, pretty much every character acts in a naturalistic way, their attitudes towards the prospect of a werewolf in London never feeling out of place or obtuse. In general, the picture is very entertaining. It balances its horror with humour, almost straddling the comedy and horror genres. Though it isn't particularly scary and it isn't particularly funny, it ends up being much more distinct and memorable than it would have been if it had aimed solely for one genre. It's an unpredictable and energetic experience that keeps you engaged throughout. 7/10",An American Werewolf in London

The film goes for it all - horror, comedy, and romance - which may have been a little bit of a stretch as there are occasional moments that are less successful, but overall the combination makes it quite entertaining.

But if you have waded through the other reviews you already knew that. What is most interesting perhaps (aside from the fact that -- DUH -- the attempts at a sequel did not work) this 1981 film could be easily be the ""template"" for many of the hit movies and TV shows that came next.

This is essential a horror comedy without horror or humor getting in the way of a particular scene. It blends seamlessly, bringing us a film that is funny at times, and horrific at the same time, without being gory.The film's acting was also very good, notably John Woodvine as Dr Hirsch.

54,tomgillespie2002,Fabulous comedy/horror that features the most innovative effects in horror,9,17 March 2012,"Two American students, David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dunne), are on a backpacking trip in Northern England. Following an awkward experience in the local pub, The Slaughtered Lamb, the two set out again and stray from the road, going against the locals warnings. They are attacked by a vicious monster that kills Jack and wounds David, who wakes up days later in a London hospital. After being discharged, he moves in with nurse Alex (Jenny Agutter) but is plagued by nightmares and visits from his slowly rotting friend Jack, who claims he is stuck on Earth as an undead. He also warns David that the beast that attacked him was a werewolf, and come the next full moon, David will transform and kill.This film had somehow evaded me for too long, so I decided to finally sit down to see what all the fuss was about. I hadn't heard much about it apart from the fact that it included a legendary transformation sequence that changed the face of horror effects forever. After viewing the film, and that sequence, I can safely say that the hype is completely justified. David's transformation, which depicts his limbs elongating, his nails sharpening, and his face becoming that of a giant wolf, is truly exceptional, even by today's standards. In a world full of lazy CGI substituting for arguably more realistic prosthetics and make-up, it was delightful witnessing a work of true genius by the Oscar-winning Rick Baker. The make-up used on Jack on his frequent visits are also truly exceptional, as he turns from torn and bloody, to grey and rotting, and finally to nothing more than a moving skull with eyeballs.Director John Landis had made plenty of money with his comedies The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977), Animal House (1978) and The Blues Brothers (1980) before making a foray into horror, and it feels like a natural move, as the film works just as well as a horror film as it does a comedy. At time it feels like a heartfelt homage to the old Universal horrors of the 30's and 40's (the likes of The Wolf Man (1941) being an obvious inspiration) and the Hammer horrors of the 60's (the rural setting), but it rises above being a mere love-letter and is a great film in its own right. I'm aware of the sequel, An American Werewolf in Paris (1997), but the absence of Landis and the cast suggests its a mere cash-in that relies on the original's reputation, so I'll probably give that one a miss.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",An American Werewolf in London
55,didi-5,still funny after 27 years,7,1 July 2007,"Catching this film on a recent TV showing ages after first seeing it, I was struck by how funny the cinema scene still is. An inspired idea to have all the corpses from David's recent werewolf rampage suggest how he might end his life! David and Jack, American tourists in Yorkshire, find themselves in a pub where the locals are aggressive, and when they leave they are not told the town's big secret - that there's a big wolf out there. So Jack gets ripped to pieces (that's about as gory as the film gets as the other killings are largely out of sight of the camera) but, as a member of the 'undead', he keeps appearing to the traumatised David, reminding him that he really should end his life to ensure safe passage of those he's murdered into the next world.Of course, David finds love with Jenny Agutter's nurse ...Rick Baker's special effects help this film a lot, although the werewolf looks less scary than it used to.

56,poe426,Naughty Naughton...,7,7 October 2014,"As mentioned in my comments regarding THE HOWLING, the early 1980s were a great time for Fright Film fans. There were hits and misses, as in any decade, to be sure, but there seemed to be a general AWARENESS of Fright Films at that time. Maybe that's because directors like John Landis and Joe Dante, who'd grown up reading FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND, were more in TUNE with the genre than a lot of other directors. (A lot of ""name"" directors dabbled briefly- and very often very badly- in the genre before moving on.) That said, I was disappointed- and still am, to this day- with AN American WEREWOLF IN London because it just doesn't deliver the Goods the way it should have. Growing up on Shock Theater and the like, I was used to seeing classic Fright Films on television late Friday or Saturday nights- but I was rarely SATISFIED with the overall experience for one simple reason: the Monster was usually kept off screen until the final few minutes, when s/he/it would pop out and scare the daylights out of you just before the closing credits. That was a ploy that I always resented: I wanted to SEE the Monster, to marvel at his/her/its Monstrousness throughout the entire movie, not just there at the end. Landis did the exact same thing with HIS Monster. He should've known better. I like the movie- it brings back some fond movie-going memories-, but I wish there'd been MORE. (Anyone interested in Landis's take on the genre should check out his book MONSTERS IN THE MOVIES, an excellent tome that should be available at your local library; it's the closest thing I can think of to actually going back and reading an issue of FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND.)",An American Werewolf in London

The only thing gripping about this was the porn film that was shown near the end...I wanted to know what happened next!! Anyway, this 'classic' is about two American guys travelling around the North of England where they get attacked by a creature. One of them then slowly becomes an American werewolf...in London. I wasn't engaged at all. Sorry, but there was nothing compelling here. We went from a horror flick, to an investigative crime story, to a dark comedy and then back round again. None of it mixed well in my opinion, they all contrasted each other too much for me to be invested in the story. Any scares that were built up were diminished by our main character running around naked asking a boy to approach a bush...it was a different time back then ladies and gentlemen. Then these humorous scenes were instantly forgotten as soon as the narrative started to become frightening again. Maybe I just didn't get it, or just call me old fashioned. What I can appreciate though are the technical aspects. The make-up and prosthetic work was outstanding, particularly the famous transformation scene which blew my mind (and this is a first time watch). Ground-breaking back in 1981. I liked John Landis' camera techniques, particularly the werewolf point of view chase scenes. It felt fresh and genuinely created some tension. David Naughton gave an incredibly charismatic performance, although the romance between him and Jenny Agutter was horrendously forced.

63,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Comedy by daylight, horror by moonlight, ""American Werewolf"" is memorable but bogged down by a bad story",4,25 January 2017,"John Landis is a name associated with comedy. He wrote or directed some of the greatest comedies ever made, two of them (""Animal House"" and ""The Blues Brothers"") in the two years preceding ""An American Werewolf in London."" So it's no surprise that ""American Werewolf"" threw his fans for a loop with its intense moments of horror and gore, but also no surprise that it's ridiculously silly.The horror-comedy hybrid is more commonplace today, 35 years after the release of ""An American Werewolf in London"" (not to mention a little horror film called ""The Evil Dead""). Back then, horror comedies were just horror movies that were so bad they were funny, so to have a movie with such strikingly horrific images interlaced with raunchy comedy was a shock to the system. Today, that juxtaposition is what little value exists in watching ""American Werewolf.""Nothing can take away makeup effects artist Rick Baker's groundbreaking work on this film transforming the main character, David, into a werewolf, and its much-deserved first-ever Best Makeup Oscar, but the technology is all in service of an aimless story.Two young men, David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dunne) are backpacking in northern England when they are attacked by a werewolf. David wakes up in a hospital in London, where he starts to have violent hallucinatory dreams and is warned that during the next full moon, he'll turn into a werewolf, wreaking havoc on innocent souls. Much of the story is us waiting for David to turn into a werewolf, and the rest is waiting for the inevitably conclusion to his predicament. In the meantime, his nurse (Jenny Agutter) falls for him and his doctor goes off in search of the truth.The makeup, the horror sequences, the discomfort of Naughton running around naked and a werewolf attack in a porno theater – they're all either impressive or quirky bright spots for fans of genre films, but Landis strings them together using the bare minimum of what constitutes a story. He knows what scenes and moments he wants to punctuate ""American Werewolf,"" but the plot moves between them without any discernible reason.There's good stuff in the movie, but the moments can't carry the dead weight. Landis has good horror instincts as best demonstrated by the subway chase and a wry sense of humor when it comes to ironic moon-themed songs and violence as seen in the climax in Piccadilly Circus, but the gaps in the story are filled with comedy, which confines the horror to just a handful of spots in the film. There's no suspense or sense of dread. This isn't to suggest Landis magically be Hitchcock, but too much of the film languishes or feels relevant to neither the comedy nor the horror.""An American Werewolf in London"" will always have a spot in the pantheon of horror movie history for its innovations and for spurring a genre renaissance in the '80s, but of Landis' catalogue, it makes the list of notable films, not timeless ones.~Steven CThanks for reading!Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",An American Werewolf in London

65,jzappa,"It's About the Naked American Man in Us All, and Our Existential Quest for More Balloons",10,25 October 2011,"Horror-comedy seems to have gone stale, with thinning excitement or originality given to it, yet this just makes Landis's accomplishment more striking. Not simply gruesome but truly eerie, not simply funny but witty, this unapologetically uneven film has what seem to be faults, but these are offset by the film's various potent fortes: The purposefully self-conscious and playful use of music is brilliantly ironic and shamelessly unsubtle, the characterization is excellent and the one-liners are incessantly unforgettable. From time to time, directors attempt to take advantage of the subtle line between horror and humor and play with our defense mechanism of laughing at uncomfortable things. And sure enough, some clever filmmakers, like Landis, tread the tightrope with ease.In regards to narrative or structure, this bafflingly moody cult hit follows the traditional lore of the werewolf curse to a tee. What makes it distinctive, if not exclusive, is its haywire matrimony between bleak, fatalistic horror and broad, absurdist comedy. Both former and latter are in equal parts effective. At the core of this schizophrenic effect is our empathy for the protagonist, whom we hope will discover some remedy for an insufferable dilemma. And Landis is not easy on his audience or his main character.The movie begins in the moors of the Yorkshire Dales, where two Americans, David Kessler and Jack Goodman, are on a backpacking trip. By the time they happen upon a hamlet close to nightfall, they're chilly and famished, so they opt to peek in on the local pub, The Slaughtered Lamb. Their welcome there is emphatically glacial, with incredulous stares from the regulars. Before leaving, they're grimly cautioned to stay on the road and not ramble onto the moors, a caution they disregard, much to their remorse.When it comes, the violence is sudden and ruthless. The next thing David knows, he's recuperating in a London hospital under the caring aid of an insatiably sexy nurse named Alex and the no-nonsense Dr. Hirsch. Notwithstanding a Bunuel-inspired cycle of tormenting nightmares, David appears to be making headway until he gets a troubling visit from the inexplicably living-dead Jack, who tells him that on the night of the next full moon, he'll be transformed into a werewolf.Apart from both being released in 1981, there are many parallels between this and Joe Dante's The Howling, which should come as no bombshell, as both were overseen by exceptional make-up guy Rick Baker, who was also accountable for transforming Jack Nicholson in Wolf. Baker, working with ""old-fashioned"" apparatus like prosthetics and makeup, crafts a progression of impressive imagery. Baker won an Oscar for his work in An American Werewolf in London, in which he elaborated upon some effects in Dante's own witty film.Needless to say, Landis integrates a diversity of elements into the film. Near the beginning, we have the unpretentious buddy tete-a-tete with Jack and David. The attraction between David and Alex is sugary without being nauseating, and part of why we care so much about David. Then, as is always true of Landis' work, there's the plethora of cryptic allusions and crafty references. Frank Oz has a triple cameo, as himself, Kermit and Miss Piggy. Landis makes his customary See You Next Wednesday reference as the title of a hilarious faux porn film. And there's an absurd car pile-up that echoes the vehicular pandemonium in The Blues Brothers but with much more succinctness and unexpectedness.Most of the cast is peopled by British character actors, including the excellent John Woodvine as Dr. Hirsch and Brian Glover as the most quarrelsome Slaughtered Lamb regular. Jenny Agutter, at the summit of her career, is delightful as Alex. The two Americans are played by David Naughton and Griffin Dunne. Dunne has most of the best one-liners, and, in the face of his increasingly gruesome appearance for most of his screen time, is close at hand for comic relief, a neat analogy for the whole of the film.",An American Werewolf in London
66,Vartiainen,Mastercraft of its genre,8,26 September 2019,"An American Werewolf in London is one of those films with the perfect title, first of all. It's descriptive and memorable. It tells you straight out what to expect from the film, down to mood and style. And it stands out.Luckily, the rest of the film can keep up. Two young men from America are on a holiday in Britain. They're hitchhiking they way south, aiming for London, and eventually the rest of Europe. But they get lost one night on the moors, and something comes after them. One of them wakes some weeks later in a London hospital, with grievous scars on his person.Sound a bit basic? It can be, if examined in a vacuum. Out of context. But keep in mind that this was one of the very first successful films that could lay claim on the genre of horror comedy. It is a scary film. The make-up and culture defining practical effects are unbelievable gruesome and creepy, even by today's standards. The film nails the creeping atmosphere of inevitability and doom. But it also goes just a bit over the top at just the right moments. Like any good parody, it's a loving example of the genre it's parodying.That being said, even though I can see how this is counted as a comedy, it is much more of a horror film. Sure, it has fun with itself, but when it tries to scare you, you will be scared. The first transformation scene alone will give you nightmares. Personally I was too impressed by the special effects to pay attention to how horrifying it looked, but that's the film buff in me.An American Werewolf in London is still counted among the best of its genre. It has withstood the test of time beautifully, and even though it's very much an exploitation film at heart, it is worth a watch for all audiences looking to sample all that cinema has to offer.",An American Werewolf in London
67,gwnightscream,"""One Of The Best Werewolf Films!""",7,30 October 2012,"David Naughton, Griffin Dunne and Jenny Agutter star in John Landis' 1981 horror film. This begins with 2 American college pals, David Kessler (Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Dunne) arriving in a small village outside England. Soon, they're attacked by a werewolf with David getting injured and Jack getting torn apart. David is taken to a hospital where he meets nurse, Alex Price (Agutter) who starts to care for him. David starts seeing Jack appear to him as an undead corpse warning him that's he's cursed with the mark of the beast and will become a monster. David doubts at first, but soon realizes it's true. This is definitely one of the best werewolf films, Naughton and Agutter have great chemistry and who can forget Rick Baker's excellent make-up effects. I recommend this classic.",An American Werewolf in London
68,GOWBTW,Very scary to say the least!,10,15 January 2013,"This horror gem is to be true to its word. You have the ""The Wolfman"" back in the 1950's. But John Landis brings out the best of the supernatural in ""An American Werewolf in London"". Here you have two American college students who are hiking out in the Moors where see an pub and stop for a drink. The locals there were very unfriendly when the duo asked about the pentagram on the wall. So when they left the pub, it's a full moon. Out in the Moors, howling occurs and a vicious creature attacks the duo. Killing one and wounding the other after the locals offed it. Thinking it was a wild dog was it, is not. It was a wolf, but none like this one. It was a WEREWOLF!! The attack left him with nightmares, and he can't see to contemplate on what has happened. He sees his dead friend every time he falls asleep. When stays with the nurse, he feels happy. But one night, when the moon is full, he undergoes a very big change: lyncathropy. Going from man to wolf: Werewolf! He makes a killing at night. When he woke up, he was in a zoo with the wolves. While naked, he steals a kid's balloons, and a long coat to get back to the nurse's flat. Madness seeps in as the hours goes by. When the beast dominates his life, there's no turning back. A great movie, great effects, Landis outdid himself well in that film. David Naughton was excellent playing the victim of a werewolf attack. A true gem this movie is. 5 stars.",An American Werewolf in London
69,thinker1691,The Werewolf and the Lady,8,6 January 2007,"Almost never did ""werewolf"" pictures interest me. From the time I was a youngster and saw Lon Chaney Jr. and his werewolf persona, I always expected something more frightening from the monster. Unsettling for it's time perhaps, to me, all werewolf creatures were pretty much laughable. However, we fast forward to "" American Werewolf in London "" and while I the the adult viewer sat there mesmerized by the Man-Animal change while writhing in agonizing pain, I dared not move. Terrified as we all were at the full-moon transformation, this film's special effects forever change my perception of a realistic horror film. Traveling through the English countryside, two American youths, David Naughton as David Kessler and Griffin Dunne as Jack Goodman, are savagely attacked by a marauding Werewolf. While Jack is ferociously ripped to shreds, David escapes, then returns quickly to try and save his friend. Later David is visited by his dead friend and falls in love with his nurse in this black drama. Due to it's graphic and certainly authentic scenes, many TV stations will not show the uncut version without warning the audience of it's fantastic, but blood curling scenes. Still, with the additional but superior talents of Jenny Agutter as Nurse Price and John Woodvine as Dr. J. S. Hirsch, the film makes the grade as a classic in it's own right. A good scary film, so have someone with you when you see it. ****",An American Werewolf in London
70,Polaris_DiB,Good effects with quirky dialog and interesting soundtrack,9,23 January 2008,"If ""The Evil Dead"" could be described as slapstick horror, ""An American Werewolf in London"" is screwball horror. Two Americans hiking around England, bickering about their choice of vacation and generally teasing each other with every step, end up getting kicked out of a creepy inn in a creepy town, only to get attacked by a werewolf. One of them dies, but returns from the dead to tell the other one that he must kill himself before he get turned, whereas the other one is more interested in getting into a cute nurse's (played by the lovely and charming Jenny Agutter) pants. Hilarity and horror ensues.In terms of straight-up entertainment value, there is little equal. The dialog is at times funny, at times sassy, and in some compelling ways realistic (especially the opening dialog and the moment in the porno theatre). There are enough thrills here and there, plus some gore for fans, though if you're looking for something scary, there's more chilling out there. On the other hand, the special effects are second-to-none and, these days, a real treat away from the CGI diet. This movie is probably retroactively better than it used to be, simply because it's so simply produced and well thought out.Another point of interest is it's classic rock score. There are some unusual music tastes in this film away from the typical tension-building score, and it helps add an idiosyncrasy and humor to the film beyond what's happening on the screen.--PolarisDiB",An American Werewolf in London
71,Stevieboy666,My favourite werewolf movie,10,24 September 2018,"Lost count of the number of times that I have watched this classic. There are just so many things that I love about it, beginning with the opening scenes that were shot in the Black Mountains, not far from my home & a place that I know well. Then to the Slaughtered Lamb, joining the likes of Brian Glover & a very young Rik Mayall. And finally on to London. It is a fantastic combination of horror, comedy and even romance, brilliantly paced and of course showcasing Rick Baker's amazing special effects. And last but certainly not least it stars the very beautiful Jenny Agutter.

One night they are attacked by an animal of sorts and they wake up with their lives changed forever. This movie is directed by John Landis (Coming to America) and stars David Naughton (Body Bags), Jenny Agutter (Logan's Run) and Griffin Dunne (After Hours). The storyline for this is presented in a relatable way via realistic circumstance that feels like ""this could happen to you."" The dialgue and circumstances feel very natural and there is a good blend of humor and horror. The transformation scenes are legendary and I loved the makeup use on the friend. My only complaint is the werewolf is so good in this I wish we didn't have to wait so long to see it. Overall this is a masterpiece that I would strongly recommend. I'd score this a 9/10.",An American Werewolf in London
75,MBunge,More noteworthy than entertaining,5,27 April 2013,"Time is a cruel judge and there are few better examples of that than An American Werewolf in London. This is a well made and very clever film which, in its day, was more remarkable and historically significant. The passing of the years, the coarsening and acceleration of our culture and the movie's own impact on popular imagination have unfortunately robbed it of most of its appeal. Now, the most noticeable things about it are its weaknesses and not its strengths. As cliché as it sounds, sometimes you really did have to be there to appreciate what all the fuss was about. That's the case here, so I'd first and foremost encourage anyone who watches this flick to keep that in mind.David and Jack (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are a couple of puffy coat-wearing Yanks who are backpacking their way across England when, on a night when the moon in full, they're attacked by a savage beast on the moors. Jack is slaughtered, the beast slain by villages and the badly wounded David only sees the animal transformed back into a man before he wakes up weeks later in a London hospital. There he flirts with a beautiful nurse (Jenny Agutter) and chats with Jack's undead spirit. The beast, you see, was a werewolf and Jack is condemned to spend eternity in limbo until the monster's bloodline is ended. David survived being bitten, which means he's going to become a werewolf. So, the only way for his friend to rest in peace is for David to kill himself. And he's better hurry up about it because the next full moon is only a few days away.There's a lot to admire in An American Werewolf in London but I'm going to start with its flaws, since those are what most modern viewers will primarily see in it. The plot is painfully sparse and nothing more than the bare bones of the werewolf story everyone learns growing up, with no attempt to expand, extend or amplify the tale. Writer/director John Landis uses some startling dream sequences to fill time, but there's no disguising that little happens for the first hour of this year. The special effects, while cutting edge for their day, have been far surpassed. Anyone who's grown up with horror-comedy as a fully formed sub-genre will also detected the abrupt and severed nature of how the two are blended here. The ironic, self-referential distancing that has come to traditionally lubricate the mixture is almost entirely absent. Even when the occur virtually side-by-side, the laughs and screams the film means to provoke are separate impulses. The movie has funny bits and scary bits and there's not a lot of connection between the two.Those are the things that will cause a lot of viewers to react negatively to An American Werewolf in London and that's a shame. There are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments here. Landis demonstrates his skill by succeeding where so many lesser filmmakers fail by making his characters talk and act like believable human being who are just living their lives, rather than designated victims waiting to be killed. The horror genre has also developed a look, sound and feel where if you see any random 15 seconds of film, you instantly know it came from a horror flick. That's not the case here. This looks, sounds and feels like a regular movie that just happens to deal with supernaturally violent subject matter in comedic fashion.And while it may not have been the first to do so, An American Werewolf in London might have been the most important factor in changing lycanthropy in Hollywood. The image of the werewolf in entertainment used to be someone in regular human clothing who was really hair and had an animalistic face. Landis rejects that concept in favor of a four-legged creature with a snout and mostly non-human aspects. In the wake of this film, werewolves stopped being guys in costumes and became puppets or CGI creations and that visual interpretation helped establish the parameters for everything else about the notion. The pop culture evolution of the werewolf could have gone in a completely different direction. Instead, John Landis became the midwife, if not the father, of all the howling beasties we see in the Underworld and Twilight franchises and most every other werewolf story told since this one.I liked An American Werewolf in London, but more as a museum piece than as entertainment. It has its charms. It's also going to seem dated to those to young to remember what werewolf movies were like before it. As long as you understand that going in, you'll probably enjoy it.",An American Werewolf in London
76,Fluke_Skywalker,Howlingly good,7,29 June 2017,"Plot; Two young Americans backpacking across Europe are attacked by a creature, leaving one of them dead and the other irrevocably changed.Despite its lofty status (and the fact it ran on a loop on TV in the 80s), I'd somehow managed to never watch An American Werewolf in London. For sure horror isn't my favorite genre, but I knew of its comedic counterweight and that's a combination that would seemingly appeal to me. 36 years later, on a recommendation from the great 80s All Over podcast, I finally gave it a go. I'm glad I did.Deftly balancing the horror with the comedy, Landis uses one to enhance the other. It's a very fine line, and he and his cast walk it expertly. The script is snappy and there's no wasted motion in its tight hour and a half runtime. The cast all acquit themselves well, with David Naughton making for a likable and sympathetic lead, the impossibly beautiful Jenny Agutter breathing life into what could've been a thankless role, and Griffin Dunne stealing every scene he's in as Naughton's undead best friend.The end feels a bit too sudden, but I was both surprised and impressed by the direction Landis went and it gives the film a weight and poignancy.I love it when I'm rewarded for going back and watching an older film that I'd previously ignored or otherwise missed. This may have been the first time, but it won't be the last, that I watch An American Werewolf in London.",An American Werewolf in London
77,jimbo-53-186511,"It has a lot of the usual John Landis touches about it, but unusually I felt that these touches may have worked slightly against this film",6,8 September 2017,"Two American college students are on a walking tour of Britain where they stumble upon a local pub known as the Slaughtered Lamb. They converse with the locals, but feel out of place and decide to leave early despite being warned about venturing outside on a full moon. Shortly after they leave the pub, the two students are attacked by what appears to be a werewolf and one of the students gets killed where the other one lives. The surviving college students attempts to tell his story, but it seems that no-one wants to believe him...Landis sets this whole scenario up in wonderful fashion and considering that he is an American film director he does seem to have an excellent grasp of some of the customs that we have in the UK. The whole xenophobia angle to the narrative is presented wonderfully; the Americans are received with a predictability frosty reception (and believe me this is typical of a lot of pubs in England whom are very unreceptive to strangers). However, the Americans soon feel rather uncomfortable in this close-knit public house and decide to venture out on their own despite some of the publicans advising against this...**************SPOILERS FOLLOW FROM THIS POINT ONWARDS****************However, the moment that both of the American students get killed the film ultimately becomes weaker and perhaps that is partly down to Landis as a director. Landis is used to directing a lot of comedy films and that shows here as he does give this film a kind of goofball charm to it, but part of the problem here is that this seems to be a comedy-horror which I didn't find particularly funny and was also a film that I didn't find particularly scary. The fact that it is so daft means that it works slightly better as a comedy than a horror, but I'm not entirely sure if that was Landis' intention. I'll give him some credit though as he does add some weight to the narrative by playing this out as some kind of fantasy or dream on the part of David Kessler - this is the only rational way that I could accept what was happening... Rolling with it on this basis I did enjoy it, but I have to admit that all of the scenes towards the end showing all of Kessler's dead or undead victims and Jack Goodman talking in the cinema may have come across as being profound, interesting or funny at the time now look silly, cheap and rather unnecessary and serve as more of a distraction now than anything else. Although I must admit that the moral debate that occurred in these scenes did provide a rather interesting social commentary.Whilst I found An American Werewolf in London to be reasonably enjoyable I didn't think it was brilliant as for me it didn't entirely work as either a comedy or a horror. In fact, the most interesting thing about it was trying to determine what was really happening and what was going on in our protagonists head... There is definitely a meld between fantasy and reality. This is worth a look if you're a fan of comedy horror type films (if nothing else Landis does keep things moving well and the film doesn't really hit any dull spots). However, if I'm totally honest I didn't find the story that involving and felt that Landis had made the film a little too silly at times.",An American Werewolf in London

For my part, I expected it to be way more serious and scary that it was. That's unfortunate.I think that the very good transformation special make-up effects are not enough to make this movie a great one, for it lacks in seriousness, realistic gore and blood (not the syrup that is shown) and around 20+ minutes more runtime.The black comedy and humorous moments destroyed the momentum and credibility of the movie IMO.The acting was good but nothing special due the heavy humorous load or lack of seriousness, whatever you prefer.It's not a parody, but it's not a solid werewolf movie either.Finished too abruptly and in a sort of weak way.",An American Werewolf in London
79,kirbylee70-599-526179,HAIR RAISING TALE,9,5 November 2019,"When released in 1981 AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON created quite a stir among horror fans. Not only was it an amazing horror film it was one of two notable werewolf films released that year, the other being THE HOWLING. Fans continue to argue to this day about which film had the most unique transformation sequence but Oscar voters decided and awarded the best special effects makeup that year to Rick Baker for his work on this film. But the movie was more than just special effects.The story opens with two American backpackers on holiday in England. David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dunne) are walking along the road in the dark when they come upon a small village and a local pub, The Slaughtered Lamb, still open. They step in to find an unwelcoming group of townsfolk whose hospitality is sorely lacking. Knowing they're not welcome they decide to leave but not before they're warned to stay out of the moors and on the road. Once gone the group begins to talk about how they should have taken them in.Of course while walking they lose their way, end up in the aforementioned moors and are attacked by what appears to be a giant wolf. Jack is killed and the folks from the pub arrive in time to save David who's been bitten by the wolf. David wakes in a hospital where he's being watched over by Nurse Alex Price (Jenny Agutter). The police question him but he has few answers.While in the hospital David is visited by Jack, or at least his ghost. Still carrying the mangled face he ended up with as a result of the attack he tells David that he was killed by a werewolf. He also lets David know that with the next full moon he too will transform into a wolf and that the only way for him to rest in peace is for David to kill himself. Of course David thinks he's hallucinating.While in the hospital and with no one else to turn to, David begins a romance with his nurse. When released Alex takes him back to her apartment to stay until he mends. While she's at work Jack reappears once more, this time a bit more decomposed, and warns David again. Still thinking he's a hallucination he ignores the warning. Until that night when he changes into a wolf, goes out, kills several people and wakes the next morning to find himself naked in the wolf area of the zoo.David tries to get himself arrested in Trafalgar Square with no luck. When Alex shows to help him all he wants to do is put distance between them so he doesn't do her harm. Popping into a porn theater David once more sees Jack, not more rotted flesh than human as well as the other victims of his rampage. They all attempt to talk him into killing himself but will he be able to do so and will he do it in time?While watching the film this time, the first in several years, I was surprised at how straightforward the story was and how time passed quickly while watching it. I'd always felt it was longer than the 97 minutes it clocks in at and this time they went by sooner than I expected. I'd remembered the film as entertaining but was again surprised at not just how solid a story it was but how it was put together with perfection.Director John Landis at this point in his career was known mostly for comedies having directed THE KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE, ANIMAL HOUSE and THE BLUES BROTHERS. His move to horror suited him and he combined bits of humor in the mix but not enough to take away from the real genre the film belongs in. Landis would return to horror in several other films later in his career and this one didn't pigeonhole him as a genre director but it is an amazing first attempt.To discuss Rick Baker's makeup effects here would be to be only a chapter in the career he has established for himself. Baker has done so many amazing effects before and after this film that there is little doubt he will find himself in the hall of fame for those who create these images if one ever exists. Not only are we able to watch the transformation on screen but we can feel the pain involved as one would change from man to wolf here. To this day people still discuss this transformation.The acting on hand is also above par. Naughton, probably known more for his work in a Dr. Pepper commercial than anything, showed that he had a certain naïve charm to him in the role of David. Dunne has never been better and has the funniest lines in the whole movie as the decomposing Jack. Agutter looks lovely but has little to do other than be sympathetic. But all of these combine to make an effective movie.The film has been released before on blu-ray but that doesn't compare to the new edition being released by Arrow Video. The company once more shows why they are the premiere company when it comes to releases like this. To start with this release is a new 2019 restoration from the original camera negative supervised by John Landis, giving a clarity unseen before with the picture.

80,dwpollar,Effective horror-comedy with an abrupt ending...,6,11 January 2015,"1st watched 1/4/2015 -- 6 out of 10(Dir-John Landis): Effective horror-comedy with an abrupt ending that leaves the viewer wondering why the Director, John Landis, closed out the story the way he did. The movie is about a couple of American friends vacationing in England who are attacked by an animal, killing one and wounding the other. The locals know something strange is going on in their area, but don't do what's necessary to keep them out of trouble. They do however get there soon enough to save David, played by David Naughton. If this was a werewolf that attacked them -- the legend is that if you survive you will turn into one at the next full moon, and this is David's fear. The doctor and nurse that initially take care of him get involved in a couple of different ways. The nurse, played by Jenny Agutter, takes him in and starts a romance. The doctor eventually tries to find out what actually happened as the authorities say they were attacked by a human lunatic not an animal. The movie is scary and funny(with most of the humor coming from Griffin Dunne, who plays David's dead friend who keeps showing up in a degrading state trying to get him to kill himself before he kills others and to send him to his final resting place). Rick Baker's makeup takes center stage especially during the initial transformation scene where David turns into a werewolf. The gruesomeness is a little overused and is a slight negative to the movie, in my opinion, but the movie keeps your interest until the final 15 minutes where it finishes way too quickly. The movie is unique in it's ability to fuse many genre's into one movie somewhat successfully. Landis appeared to either run out of money, or just didn't have a more dramatic ending prepared(to it's fault) but still the movie was worthwhile.",An American Werewolf in London
81,NateWatchesCoolMovies,the original werewolf transformation,8,4 December 2016,"John Landis's An American Werewolf In London has what is the most impressive human to wolf transformation sequence I've ever seen. You can dump your wallets out and buy all the CGI effects at hand, and none of them will ever match the tactile weight that practical effects have, the combination of hair, putty and latex that assures you there is *something real* on screen, and not the hollow timbre of computer driven wizardry. Everything in the film builds up to this shock and awe moment, and up until then it's a fairly low key, atmospheric affair in which you never quite see the beast that kicks off the inciting incident. Griffin Dunne and David Naughton play the two American backpackers who find themselves wandering the moors of northern England, positive there is some kind of creature hunting them. The crusty locals avidly deny any such presence, but aren't convincing and furtively shift their gaze, clearly not being honest. Sure enough, Naughton is attacked and bit one night, and he begins to exhibit those good old symptoms. The change happens all at once and is quite startling; this isn't a sleek, aesthetic werewolf either, it's a lumbering behemoth, all fur fangs and fury, storming about the cobbled streets of London like a coked out grizzly bear out running zookeepers. We only get to see him in London for a brief and chaotic end scene, but it's worth it, taking the slow, misty nocturnal buildup and switching to broad daylight, revealing what was unseen before and bringing it jarringly down to earth. I can't speak for the sequel, as I've never seen it, but this one remains one of the most well crafted, fun werewolf films you can find, and my personal favorite.",An American Werewolf in London
82,drownnnsoda,Unusual But Appropriate Combination of Horror and Comedy.,9,10 March 2007,"""An American Werewolf In London"" is a comic yet spooky movie that caught me off guard. The film opens with two travelers, David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dunne), who are walking on foot in the middle of nowhere. After stopping into an English tavern, they depart again, but Jack is savagely killed by a beast, and David suffers a bite wound. The beast is killed, but soon after the horrifying incident, David begins to have some very strange things happen to him. He begins seeing his mutilated, dead friend, Jack, talking to him as if he were still alive. Turns out that David is now a werewolf himself, and when the sun goes down and the full moon lights up the night sky, he transforms into a beast himself, and begins unintentionally killing people in the London area.This film is probably the strangest mixture of comedy and horror that I've seen - but there is no problem here, because it works. Blending these two genres is tough, because both are very extreme and opposite of each other. One would think that a werewolf film mixing these genres could easily be a mess, but this film works quite well. The storyline is based around a werewolf, which while it isn't a completely original idea, still remains unique because of the remaining elements in the plot. It's far from your typical werewolf film, and I liked that about it a lot. It's clever, spooky, and really all well-written, and this is proved with it's versatility. It can be very scary and times, but remains darkly hilarious throughout. This is not a surprise though, with the film being from the guy who directed the college-campus comedy classic, ""Animal House"" a few years before working on this project.This film isn't all laughs though, there is plenty of horrific moments to be had here. The first attack (in which Jack is ultimately killed by the werewolf) is scary as hell and completely unexpected. The scary moments in the film are mainly (and expectedly) during the werewolf scenes, and there is quite a bit of gore to be seen too for any of those gore fans out there. There is also some very stunning makeup effects, primarily being the werewolf transformations. Computer generation didn't exist in 1981, but the makeup and special effects (all handcrafted) are truly amazing, even more so considering the time they were created. The cast is led by David Naughton, who isn't the best actor ever, but it doesn't really matter. He plays the character believably enough and is very funny. Jenny Agutter is the female interest, and is also very good in her role, and Griffin Dunne plays David's dead best friend, providing quite a few hilarious one-liners, despite his grisly post-mortem makeup.While it isn't for all tastes, ""An American Werewolf In London"" is arguably one of the best werewolf movies ever made, or at least one of the best in a very long time. This film blends two genres together just right, invoking both scares and cringes, and some good laughs as well. While it may be a bit of a strange combination, it works. Recommended for those who don't mind their horror served with a side of comedy. 9/10.",An American Werewolf in London

John Landis is phenomenal!!,9,5 October 2020,"This is more than a cult classic , it created the genre comedy horror, the transformation scene is a historical one. Everyone loves it, Michael Jackson loved it so much he had John Landis direct thriller( greatest video of all time) and turn him into a werewolf. If you haven't seen this masterpiece you must see it right this minute!! The special effects were done without computers and CGI and to me it still stands up. Just watched it again for the 100th time in the year 2020 and with how our country is right now I NEEDED a laugh and some fun!!!!!! Thank you John Landis!!!",An American Werewolf in London
84,JoeKarlosi,An American Werewolf in London (1981) **1/2,6,17 October 2009,"I felt it was time to re-watch this movie and give it another chance. I saw it at the theater in 1981 when I was 19 and I immediately disliked it due to what I felt was its over-reliance on comedy and not taking itself seriously enough as a horror movie. Well, today I finally decided that after almost 30 years it was time for a new viewing with a more open mind.Overall, after this re-watch I have to say I am now far less harsh on American WEREWOLF than I was in 1981. I think that what seemed so ridiculous and silly to me in 1981 doesn't play nearly as foolishly in 2009, and especially not after another 20 years of seeing so many far worse and TRULY stupid modernized horror films. In fact, during the first 60 minutes of American WEREWOLF I'd say there wasn't really any ""misplaced intrusive comedy"" that hurt the experience for me at all. As a matter of fact, I was surprised during this re-evaluation at how serious much of the film actually played to me. 28 more years and so many inferior goofy modern horror misfires really polished it up in my eyes. It wasn't comedy that got in the way during the first hour; if anything, it was the lack of anything really happening until that first powerful transformation sequence.I was really enjoying the film, and was almost prepared to give it a 3 out of 4 star rating myself; except that the foolishness eventually reared its silly head during the scene where David wakes up in a zoo and runs around nude asking a little boy for his balloons to cover himself up, rather jolly and apparently not even the least bit properly shaken up that he's just woken up naked in a zoo in a cage with real wolves and doesn't know why! Okay, so that was only a little bit of passable nonsense ... but then when David wears a woman's coat, and starts screaming loudly in public for a London booby to arrest him, shouting: ""Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Sh-t!! Cu-t!!!""... well, that started sounding more like the old AWIL I remembered and despised from my youth. And the entire sequence in the porn movie theater with not only a revisit from his old friend Jack the Corpse, but now all his other victims' corpses joking around as well.... that was too much, and I found myself going down to a rating of ""Above Average"" instead of ""Good"".A word about Jack and his constant appearances as a deteriorating corpse ... I took them all to be David's own hallucinations because he's been driven near the point of madness, so these were not a hindrance. But with the last visit in the movie theater, I wondered how David could be imagining all those other victim's faces he killed, considering he never met them? Maybe he remembered what they looked like and all their names form when he was a wolf? ANYTHING but figuring that these dead people were real and actually sitting in that theater (which they couldn't have been, as the theater was empty afterward).In the end, I liked the movie better. It's not going to be a personal favorite I'd choose to see anymore, but I guess I'd now consider it a pretty good werewolf film, and one of the more respectable of the ""modern versions"". There was certainly enough gore and violent scenes staged to offset the light parts. I would say that if Landis cut out the whole sequence of David conversing that last time with the dead people in the movie theater, and all that junk of him trotting around town with the balloons and wearing a woman's coat, as well as that desperate yelling at the policeman to get arrested and saying really stupid things, this would have been a MUCH more effective horror film.BUT I do have to stand as correct in one thing I have maintained form the very start back in 1981 as to why I was not a big fan of the movie. After the show I played an interview on the DVD with John Landis, and the very FIRST words out of his mouth regarding the movie were: ""Everyone keeps saying this is a COMEDY! But it's not a Comedy -- it's a HORROR FILM!!!"" So, after all these years of people insisting it's a ""comedy"" or at least a ""horror/comedy"", here was Landis himself stating he meant it to be a ""horror movie"", but it turned out to have unnecessary silliness in it that I think hurts it. **1/2 out of ****",An American Werewolf in London
85,gcd70,"Astute, unnerving and timely",7,27 March 2008,"A timely satire of horror and particularly werewolf movies, John Landis here shows his astute talent for comedy as well as his ability to truly unnerve his audience.Writer/director Landis' funny, frightening story tells of two young American lads who are back-packing across Europe when they run into trouble on the moors in the north of England. The boys are attacked by a strange, ferocious animal which kills one of them and badly maims another. The survivor of the pair (David Naughton) begins to experience horrible nightmares, and starts to suspect the experience may have turned him into a monster.Landis' script is clever, in both its conception and its original premise, while his dialogue is particularly sharp and bitingly funny. Many times Landis superbly captures the essence of British humour (something rarely done by an American writer), especially during one scene inside a Piccadilly porn theatre. He compliments his incisive screenplay with controlled yet free flowing direction, knowing exactly how he wanted to present this theme to his audience.David Naughton is the perfect all American boy, and plays well his role as the scared and confused tourist who is terrified of what he has become. The British support cast are spot on, being wonderfully English with their stiff upper lip, while the Northern England players are suitably nutty and superstitious. Frank Oz drops in as a representative from the American consulate.Malcolm Campbell's editing allows the movie to build nicely to its crescendo, Robert Paynter provides some telling cinematography (especially on the moors), while the technical team's crowning glory is the superb make-up effects from Rick Baker, which breathe gruesome life into David's change and undead Jack.Undoubtedly though this is John Landis' picture form beginning to end, with his refined script and timely direction making ""American Werewolf"" what it is, thoroughly enjoyable cinema.Sunday, August 11, 1996 - Video",An American Werewolf in London
86,dworldeater,Masterpiece,10,21 October 2018,"An American Werewolf In London is untouchable and by far the best werewolf movie of all time. This comes from the creative mind of John Landis, who is responsible for and best known for making some of the most successful comedies. Among them are personal favorites Trading Places and The Blues Brothers to name a few. It is hard to believe he also made this, which is also a personal favorite and a brilliant movie. An American Werewolf In London looks great with excellent camera work and has groundbreaking state of the art special f/x. The tone of the film is pretty dark, but still is funny at times. This is the perfect balance of horror and comedy and John Landis is on the top of his game behind the camera as director of this fine film. David Naughton, who before this was best known as ""The Dr. Pepper Guy"" gives a broad and exceptional performance in this. Griffin Dunne was also great as his buddy Jack and the two of them had a very natural chemistry in the film. The film delivers on gore and macabre imagery and is in a lot of ways very unique. An American Werewolf is in my mind perfect, terrifying, dark, but still funny. This movie holds up really well and is a very important and influential horror movie.",An American Werewolf in London

Soon David is visited by Jack's ghost who is slowly decaying like his body and Jack tells David that he's a werewolf and he must kill himself.Review: I really love this film, all except that the leading man did only a mediocre job, even though the role didn't need much acting abilities. I thought Griffin Dunne was really quite funny. Director and Muppeteer Frank Oz makes a cameo appearance as Mr. Collins from the American Embassy. The direction is excellent and the dialogue is good. The gore effects are top notch and everything looks great. I was a bit annoyed by the abrupt ending, but it really didn't bother me that much. I highly recommend this horror comedy!

One of the best, An American Werewolf in London is a comical title that lives up to being a comedy and a horror movie. The special effects by Rick Baker alone, make this movie a hit. The off edge comedy and the almost slap stick style acting welcomes the horror. Many surprises throughout the movie, An American Werewolf in London has a little bit of everything. There are moments of laughter, hate, love, drama, and horror, the movie pushes the envelope in being an original work, even though it is a remake! Keep your ear open for the movie's soundtrack.

89,aidanratesmovies,Take us back to the time before our eyes were flooded with CGI,9,2 March 2021,"Although for a horror film it's certainly a different change of pace, An American Werewolf in London is able to be both amusing and timelessly scary throughout its reimagining of an otherwise classic tale. Unlike many CGI filed films today, An American Werewolf in London relies deeply on practical effects. It also decides to limit its creature parts of the film, something of which I both admire and resent the film for. I appreciate putting the story first in terms of the film, but something just feels a bit underwhelming concerning the wait beforehand of the werewolf itself. It can be a rather entertaining film, but I just feel like a larger portion of the beginning could have been used as something greater for the subject at hand, rather than just waiting for the werewolf action to commence towards the end. The practical effects in this movie are genius, ahead of its time really, and I loved seeing them play out on screen. I also love the look of the werewolf itself, even with its little screen time, its presence doesn't really leave you and all scenes with it are done incredibly well. The acting is decent, nothing special, nor anything drab. The screenplay can feel like filler at times, but during its stronger moments, it's an incredibly well written film- balancing its elements of comedy and horror quite beautifully. In the end, An American Werewolf in London is yet another hit for infamous 80's director John Landis- and although its not perfect, it is quite enjoyable.
My Rating: 8.5/10",An American Werewolf in London
90,I_Ailurophile,"A masterpiece in all ways, from the least likely genre",10,15 October 2021,"Here we are again: a film I've been quite overdue to watch, being well aware of its reputation. Now that I have, I can only add my voice to the chorus: from the very beginning it's a simple delight. 'An American werewolf in London' grabs our attention right from the start and is solid through and through, an outstanding film that defies the limits of its genre.In mere minutes we're introduced to the chief characters and informed of the setting. Within twenty minutes we get solid atmosphere, and a sense of the lightly comedic tone the feature strikes - situational comedy and dialogue that is at turns clever, dry, and sardonic. The exposition is quick and the movie wastes no time whatsoever: 'An American werewolf in London' never lags, yet even as it keeps a brisk, busy pace, it never feels rushed or overfull.The writing is wonderfully adept, shifting through a number of moods throughout, and including a fantastic, wide array of varied ideas but weaving them all into the narrative organically. Story, scenes, characters, dialogue - there's nothing about the screenplay that isn't altogether solid. For that matter, the execution of every single moment readily impresses as no less than flawless. No few excellent films with swell writing have been undone by a shoddy execution, yet every passing scene feels natural, whole, essential, and exquisitely integrated. Above all, the protagonist's first transformation is without equal among werewolf films, or arguably horror generally. All due credit to director John Landis for such fine consideration with typewriter and camera alike - this is utterly phenomenal.The deservedly award-winning makeup is unrivaled - the detail is magnificent and jarringly realistic. The blood and gore is marvelous, the special effects that realize the werewolf transformation are superb, and the very appearance of the lycanthrope is, again, possibly the best that the genre has to offer. Filming locations, set design and decoration, costume design, hair, lighting, sound, music - there is nothing about this that isn't absolute top-notch.That goes for the cast as well. Star David Naughton is first-rate as the protagonist ""David,"" perfectly embodying a very ordinary American man who suddenly finds himself thrust into terrible, frightening, bewildering circumstances. The role requires distinct range, dynamics, and personality, and Naughton is clearly highly capable. Jenny Agutter, as Alex, similarly demonstrates charm and emotional poise that provide a human face and anchor for the film. And one can hardly go without also mentioning Griffin Dunne as Jack, providing a purely comedic foil to the most horrific aspects of the feature, even he himself spends most of the runtime in brilliant, garish, monstrous makeup.I'm truly astounded. I knew how well the movie was regarded, and I had high expectations, and still it far exceeded the best I could have anticipated. Horror, comedy, a touch of emotional weight - unparalleled writing, direction, makeup, and effects - an entrancing soundtrack and deeply skilled cast... I could go on and on, but I'd just be running in circles. However highly I've regarded other werewolf movies, this almost certainly is the true sovereign of the genre, and even among horror flicks broadly, I don't think many can compare. 'An American werewolf in London' is a peerless slice of cinema that everyone needs to watch at least once, and that's all there is to it.",An American Werewolf in London

Meanwhile nurse Alex ala Jenny Agutter provides not only the gorgeous ingenue-girlfriend but is as strong-willed as vulnerable; and the wise doctor, played by slowburn exposition-spouting John Woodvine, brings an intelligent Hammer Films style investigatory aspect - a sophisticated ringer of sorts...But it's makeup shaman Rick Baker who steals the show: His Oscar-winning man-to-wolf transformation has never been equaled since, leading to the inevitable body count massacres (like Michael Carter stalked in an ominous tube station) as each sequence feels like its very own ghostly, gothic, offbeat campfire tale.",An American Werewolf in London
93,Samiam3,Howling good fun,7,19 July 2009,"If there was a Chinese calender for horror films than 1981 would be the year of the wolf. Two fan-praised flicks, this one and The Howling have put hair and claws back on celluloid for the first time since the Wolf Man forty years earlier. John Landis's film is definitely the better of the two with good quality black humor, sensational fun/disgusting make-up and a cast of quirky characters, This is one not to miss.It starts in northern England. David and Jack, two young American tourists are attacked by a werewolf one night. Jack is killed but David survives. He is taken to a hospital in London, where no one believes him when he tells them that the attacker was not a 'who' but a 'what'. He gets out a few days later, and his pretty young nurse (who he quickly falls in love with) offers him a chance to stay at her place. After having a few dreams about his dead pal who tells him that he will become werewolf in a couple of days, David thinks he is losing his mind. He soon realizes the scary truth, as will the rest of London on the night of the next full moon.The primary reason that this movie tops The Howling in my opinion is because of its fresh approach. The film is not satisfied with being plain camp, so it goes creative. A little romance and a lot of humor is all it takes. Unlike The Howling, Landis' script does a better job of making use of all the supporting characters. It is not just the principal characters who get good lines, everyone gets the chance to be funny or quirky, even the six or seven werewolf victims have roles more complex than being lunch in one scene each.

Griffin Dunne (where is he these days?) plays his buddy who becomes the werewolf's victim. John Landis made this comedy-horror flick on a shoestring budget.

95,RainDogJr,"I see the bad moon arising, I see a great John Landis film",9,18 October 2009,"Last night I saw for the very first time John Landis' An American Werewolf in London (released back in 1981). It was just, not counting one of the two Landis' ""mini movies"" for the Masters of Horror series (Deer Woman), my very first encounter with the not completely comedy Landis (heard pretty good things about Trading Places but sadly as for this day the only ones of his comedies that I have seen are The Blues Brothers and Blues Brothers 2000). Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Bad Moon Rising"" can be heard in this film. Of course it is a great classic song and in a way it will help me to let you know a bit more about An American Werewolf in London (of course only if you have still to see the film): for just a moment forget to pay attention to the lyrics of ""Bad Moon Rising"", it's like a feel good song with a really nice and gentle rhythm, its like a really nice little song. An American Werewolf in London is a very nice and extremely entertaining film with characters that will make you laugh each time they're on the screen (there's a very clumsy and very funny London Sergeant), with jokes, cool references to other movies (not only to other werewolf movies), a film with really fun stuff. But now, remember the lyrics of that Creedence song from the brilliant ""Green River"" album, we have lines like ""I see trouble on the way"", ""I see bad times today"", ""hope you are quite prepared to die"". And the chorus says to us: ""Don't go around tonight, there's a bad moon on the rise""... of course in this film the ""end is coming soon"" for many people. And we all know that since the very beginning: the film introduces two American friends (David, played by David Naughton, and Jack, played by Griffin Dunne) that are in Europe, in England to be more specific... but not in London yet. We see soon trouble on the way since our American characters arrive to the ""Slaughtered Lamb"" and aside of the creepy name of the place and the usual tension with the ""people are strange when you're a stranger"" thing there's something else in that place, something of which ""Lon Chaney Jr. in Universal Studios said that's the mark of the wolf man"". Certainly the film let its audience know since always that the werewolf thing is real and gives to its main character (David will be the main character since he, unlike his friend Jack, survived the brutal attack of a, according to the official police report, maniac person and was taken to a London hospital) his memory (he is sure that they weren't attack by a normal man) and some real nightmares and the chance to keep talking with his dead friend Jack (cool as hell is that scene at the porn theater). The film is typical then we have main characters like the ones that Jenny Agutter and John Woodvine play. The female character is of course the love interest of David and the male character is of course the one that will be aware of the werewolf problem after seeing the enough. The film works perfectly when is time for the horrific things that are not quite part of very bizarre nightmares or stuff like that. It works since there are really great sequences (the stuff with the victim at the subway station is one of my favourite scenes of the film, it's really great with the danger present all the time but visibly present only for few seconds) that deals with people getting killed but still there's time to laugh (I just love the ""hangover"" part with our main character awaking not really remembering a thing about the previous night and delivering truly hilarious stuff... ""a naked American man stole my balloons""). Of course An American Werewolf in London is perfect for these October's nights. 9.5 out of 10",An American Werewolf in London

It mixes humor and horror in a way that, while tonally inconsistent, it provides so many scares and laughs that I didn't care what its flaws were. The film's sense of humor is definitely because the film's director and writer, John Landis, has directed so many great comedies. If you gave the same premise to a much more serious filmmaker, they probably would have made a straight horror film, subtracting all of the brilliant laughs that Landis gives us. Of course, part of what makes ""An American Werewolf in London"" so special and so entertaining is how hilarious it is. It's almost unbelievable that a movie with so many horrific and gory moments can also be laugh out loud funny throughout.Another important part of ""An American Werewolf in London"" is the use of the acclaimed, award winning special effects, that earned Rick Baker a well deserved Oscar win.

97,PredragReviews,Being a Werewolf is Actually Pretty Terrible...,8,12 November 2016,"""An American Werewolf in London"" is without a doubt in my opinion, the unique comedy/horror movie ever made. It has terrifying moments of dread & suspense, it has great jump out of your seat scenes, & it has comedic scenes that match the terror & horror of this film, a relief from the tension it builds. It is filled with pathos, comedy & creepiness all at the same time in scenes with David & Jack. Jack was killed by a Werewolf in the first part of the movie (that in it's self is one of the greatest scenes in horror) & rises back from the dead to tell David who was also attacked, but survived, that he will become a Werewolf in two days, the start of the full moon. David does not know whether he is hallucinating or dreaming Jack at first, & questions his own sanity. These scenes are some of the best in the movie, they truly make you jump when you first see Jack appear. They make you laugh with their delicious black comedy. They make you shudder with their eeriness as Jack talks straight to David about becoming a Werewolf, killing people, making others, & that he is the last in line of the Werewolves & should take his own life, so all the victims from previous Werewolf attacks can move on from being bound to walking the earth. There is such pathos in these scenes, that it causes sadness, as the two actors are truly superb in their performances, there is great chemistry here. I really can't understand why David Naughton, who plays David, fell into obscurity after this film, his sad, funny, & terrifying performance as the man doomed to be a werewolf is one of the greatest performances in horror. You really feel empathy for this person. You care what happens to him. You feel his pain. Also a special mention for David's dream's sequences, truly disturbing dreams.The story is good, but clearly not without some forgivable issues. What made this movie truly great was Landis' ability to be brilliantly funny at times, while keeping a straight, serious, even brutal tone during the violent, rending scenes, the wincing transformation and the final scene with nurse Alex and David such that I wouldn't dare call this a straight up horror-comedy or a satire; simply a great, very serious werewolf movie that also happens to be often funny when things aren't dire. The cast play their scenes well and are obviously having the time of their lives doing it. This may be as close to a perfect werewolf movie as we ever get. As it stands, it is at least a great guide to making a horror movie infused with a lot of fun.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",An American Werewolf in London

Landis has made some snappy dialog tying in British and American culture with werewolf lore as well as sexuality. David Naughton plays naive well, while Griffin Dunne is in for some added sarcasm. Jenny Agutter meanwhile heats up the screen in a wholly clichéd ""nurse"" role, but her appeal is magnetic in the movie. For not having computers much to rely on the filmmakers do an solid job considering with creature effects. At 97 min the movie seems a little cut-off, yet plausible and acceptable. 7/10 for this early 80s rock. Recommended",An American Werewolf in London
99,screenman,Quirky Horror,7,10 November 2009,"'American Werewolf' was one of those ground-breaking movies of its time, like 'Alien' and 'The Thing'. And like them it predates the tedious age of CGI. What you see is what there is. And what you see is a mesmerising piece of metamorphosis from man into beast. It's quite incredible to watch and - frankly - rather disturbing, like Rob Bottin's gargoyle masterclass in Carpenter's 'The Thing'.Strangely, these astounding effects are employed in what is supposed to be a comedy horror. For me, this idea doesn't quite work. The horror is a little too good and a little to graphic. It deserves to be taken more seriously. To be honest, I find they jar with the odd mixture of comedic moments: being naked in the park, queueing in a woman's coat, and the ghostly interviews in - of all things - a porn-movie cinema. The oftener I have watched it, the more bizarre the whole thing seems, and the less the ideas seem to mesh.There's a romantic interest with nubile Jenny Agutter, who makes a plausible Miss Innnocence as usual. Reliable John Woodbine - a TV B-list staple for years - plays the doctor. Brian Glover makes a suitably eponymous Yorkshire presence. The two young American leads are pretty forgettable, and - I've forgotten'em.There's a tremendous American-style car pile-up in 'Picky' Circus which would simply never happen, it's even less likely than a werewolf, and as to a doctor being so diligent as to drive the 500 mile round trip from London to North Yorkshire - well; anybody know one? Take it as you find it. It's seriously strange, like 'Society'. And like the latter; you won't forget it in a hurry.",An American Werewolf in London
100,mhorg2018,Overrated,4,26 August 2018,"I'm not a big fan of comedy-horror. While this is an ok movie, some of the comedy elements fail, and, as much as I love Rick Baker, this is one of my least favorite werewolf designs. It looks more like a bear than a wolf. Also David Naughton isn't that good of an actor. They could have used a better, more believable lead than the Doctor Pepper guy. Jenny Agutter is the best thing about this movie.",An American Werewolf in London

102,m-47826,Most overrated werewolf movie.,3,24 September 2021,"The only good thing about it, is the living room transformation. And the soundtrack. The rest is painfully trying to be off beat, and looking silly. Even the finale stage of the werewolf design looks ridiculous. And that trumpeting sound they chose for the grunt, was laughable. All the praise and hype it's getting, is clearly snobbism, because movie critics turned coat, and started calling it « a classic ». After ripping it to shreds, on its release. Sometimes the first impression is the best, and this applies to this movie in particular. Maybe it's the nostalgia, for that monty python-esque humor, and universe. But there's got to be some reason behind this sudden shift of opinion. To me, it's the special effects, in one scene in particular. But that don't constitute in being a great motion picture, either. So see for yourself, and be impressed or not, like I was.",An American Werewolf in London
103,mjw2305,A great Werewolf Flick,8,15 January 2005,"A terrific blend of Comedy and Horror.Some scenes really are quite horrific, and utilise some great visual effects for the time. Yet others scenes are hilariously funny.The Cinema Scene where David is confronted by his victims casually telling hims that he needs to commit suicide to be free from the curse of the werewolf, is probably the finest scene in the movie, it still makes me laugh years later.Definitely worth looking at8/10If you enjoyed this movie check out 'DOG SOLDIERS'",An American Werewolf in London
104,sme_no_densetsu,A successful blend of horror & comedy from John Landis,8,17 July 2016,"In 1981, a horror movie might have seemed like an odd choice for John Landis, known at the time for his madcap comedies ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"", ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" & ""The Blues Brothers"". Nevertheless, ""An American Werewolf in London"" would prove to have certain affinities with the director's previous work despite venturing into the territory most associated with Universal's 1940's 'Wolf Man' pictures.In the movie, a couple of American college students backpacking through England get attacked by a large wolf. The survivor of this encounter ends up in hospital and is soon visited by his dead friend with an ominous message: he will transform into a werewolf at the next full moon.The basic story undeniably (and purposely) draws from past werewolf movies but the approach is what separates the movie from its brethren. Liberal doses of comedy are applied but these do not dilute the more horrific elements of the story. Landis expertly manages the movie's tonal shifts, often juxtaposing horrific & comedic elements within the same scene.That being said, perhaps the most memorable parts of the movie are those that showcase the special effects masterminded by Rick Baker. The werewolf transformation scene in particular is the film's undisputed centerpiece. That scene and others like it landed Baker the first Academy Award for best makeup (his first of nine to date).Another aspect of the movie that warrants high praise is the soundtrack of moon-themed popular music, including three versions of ""Blue Moon"". While using three versions of the same song may sound monotonous, each version has its own flavour and is cleverly incorporated into the movie. Also used memorably are CCR's ""Bad Moon Rising"" & Van Morrison's ""Moondance"". In addition to these somewhat tongue-in-cheek selections, Elmer Bernstein contributed a traditional score that helped to establish mood in most of the more horror-oriented scenes.All things considered, ""An American Werewolf in London"" is a horror comedy classic that has stood the test of time. Although the special effects may not be uniformly convincing by today's standards, the movie's energy and imagination make up for any shortcomings. No discerning fan of horror movies should miss this one.",An American Werewolf in London
105,Howlin Wolf,Howlingly good! (SPOILERS),10,30 March 2001,"No, I didn't name myself in honour of the film (I have a tattoo of a wolf baying at the moon on my arm) and yes, I know the above summary is pathetic; but despite the seeming indications to the contrary, I love this film to bits.   It's so atmospheric.  The opening scenes are really spooky and the combination of a 'classic' soundtrack set to moments of genuine terror reminds me of a (slightly less good) horror flick, ""Christine"".  This is a film that's not afraid to go for the jugular when it scares, despite the fact that it could also be classed as a comedy.  So many films that try to mix genres like that end up feeling unbalanced - this is how it should be done.  The werewolf attack at the beginning is terrifying...   The characters and the cast that play them are all uniformly likeable. ""David"" is the epitome of a man far from home confronted by something he doesn't understand.  Dunne would have stolen the thunder of a lesser production with his role as ""Jack"".  Agutter is fine (and disturbingly sexy for a young boy like me, watching the film for the first time)  Even the doctor who examines David is an accomplished actor who I've seen in lots of things before (I think...)  Oh, and as other people have commented, the love scene is very sexy indeed!  If you're a Brit, watch out for the past alumni of our television screens turning up in ""The Slaughtered Lamb""  (Great name, but you'd think twice about going in there, wouldn't you?)  Altogether now: ""You made me miss. I NEVER miss...""   There are too many classic scenes to list fully here without descending into tedium.  The trip to the zoo is a surreal and hysterical highlight, as is the 'meeting' in the porno theatre.  And the effects?  Let's just say it's still one of the most impressive things I've seen, even in these days of fancy CGI.  Also, I struggle to think of a single more disturbing sequence than the 'attack of the Nazi werewolves'.   Let's not forget the comedy though, which, when it's funny, is hilarious. Evidence for the defense?  ""I will not be threatened by a walking meatloaf!"" - David to his hideously scarred and dead best friend Jack - I rest my case.  For all the comedy and memorable moments, the ending is extremely potent and shocking.  Credit must go to Landis for his adroit switches between drama and comedy.  Yes, he has also made awful films (Beverly Hills Cop III, anyone?)  but we must never forget that he gave us this classic and also the surprisingly funny Murphy vehicle ""Coming to America"".   ""AAWIL"" is a true original that stands out in a sea of unimaginative horror schlock.  We may never see its like again; after all, we haven't since.  Be grateful.",An American Werewolf in London
106,Analog_Devotee,Considered a classic of the genre for good reason!,8,13 October 2021,"It's pretty funny how this one initially feels by-the-numbers before quickly establishing itself as a true uniquity in its genre. Just the right amounts of terror and comedic relief, with enjoyable performances and characters, and beautiful cinematography. I see why so many folks consider this an all-time favorite.",An American Werewolf in London
107,KUAlum26,Probably pretty unique for the times it was released,8,14 February 2006,"Nowadays,it seems that tongue-in-cheek movies based on a genre,particularly horror,are pretty common. Heck,parodies and riffs of film styles seem to reproduce like rabbits. But nearly twenty-five years ago,I doubt you could've said there were that many films out there that were like ""An American Werewolf in London"".Director John Landis,fresh off ""The Blues Brothers"" and ""Animal House"" decided to go in this direction,helming a movie that could be ostensibly thought of as a horror flick. But instead,we have a dark comedy of supernatural proportions. College buddies David and Jack(David Naughton,forever the ""Dr.Pepper""singing shill and Griffin Dunne,well before becoming an auteur)are backpacking through scenic and lonely rural northern England when they fail to find sufficient shelter during a full moon. When they are attacked by what appears to be a wolf,JAck is killed and David is wounded badly.When David awakes in a London hospital,he is only scarcely aware of what happened to him and his friend and it isn't until some horrifying dreams,unexplained maulings occur in London and the reappearance of his buddy Jack(mauled and gnarly) does it become plainly clear to the YAnk abroad what is going on.The film benefits greatly from a modest attempt at scares,relying instead on painfully ordinary occurrences,peppered by the horrific and laced with the right amounts of humor and sex. The acting is fine,with only Jenny Agutter as the nurse who falls for David standing out as noteworthy. As I recall,this film was quite the hit in 1981,but quietly went the way of cult horror movies. This could be considered a good ""middle ground"" film:a horror film for people who are not really into horror,or a comedy for those whose humor is more fond of the macabre or dark.",An American Werewolf in London
108,oneguyrambling,Ladies and Gents - the REAL Wolfman film.,8,27 December 2010,"The film opens with two American backpackers as they trudge through Europe on what must be ""we've graduated, let's kill some time and let our hair down before college and maybe nail some foreigners along the way"" adventure.David and Jack share an easy chemistry and their dialogue is quite believable and realistic, in the early scenes you can totally ""get"" that it is just two friends wandering around sharing a laugh Until that is they stop in at the ""Slaughtered Lamb"" for a pint (Publican: Why don't we get more customers! I came up with the name myself.""). As they arrive it is near dark, the customers look at them like they have 3 heads. After a few minutes one of the boys asks the ""wrong"" question, the customers look at them like they just punched Betty White in the face.A little frazzled, nervous and I guess still thirsty the boys decide to leave and head off, apparently not together enough to wonder why a local pleads with them to stick to the road they head off cross country into the darkThe title tells you what happens next, they are set upon by *Something* (wink).David wakes up weeks later in a London hospital - the living Jack plays no further part in our story. After being questioned by police David swears it was a wolf, the police similarly swear it wasn't, having already gotten the facts from the locals, they write David's story off as ramblings of a traumatised boy.Now David seems to be recovering from his horrendous wounds quite quickly, faster than the human body should allow. He also starts having some (uber) weird dreams (think nazi-monsters gunning down his family) and experiences flashes of disturbing clarity. His main nurse is a young 20 something woman named Alex, she seems to empathise with David and provides him with some personalised care (not yet dirty minds!).Then one day Jack shows up unannounced, you'll note I said previously the living Jack was gone, meet the zombie undead Jack. He informs David that he is now a werewolf and that Jack himself is floating in between the living world and the next, the only way he can permanently transition is if the chain is severed – in English this means David must die before Jack can move on. Jack matter-of-factly tells David to top himself before the full moon, or you'll transform and kill people. Good news to get as you are starting to feel a little better.Given his amazing recuperative powers David is allowed to be released from hospital, and after a ""You can crash at my place"" from Alex he does just that – NOW you can let your filthy minds run free. The next couple days are spent relaxing – Cue the Bow-Chicka-Wows maestro.Days pass, then Jack shows again, a little more decomposed, a little more desperate: ""The full moon is tomorrow. Top yourself or I will remain in limbo"".We know if David does in fact kill himself then he won't become anything more than mulch, so it is safe to say he does not, the rest of the film pans out like you might think it would, but it is a hell of a ride getting there.The makeup effects for the ever-deteriorating Jack are amazing considering that there is zero CGI used, and the transformation sequence is quite rightly seen as a masterpiece to this day. Should it depress those that made The Wolfman that a 30 odd year old movie with no computer assistance absolutely PWNS their comparatively sh*tty big-budget CGI everything effort? I vote yes. David gets to transform a couple times, each time he manages to have a little wolfie-fun at the expense of the innocent citizens of London, each time he wakes up naked in public with no recollection of the night before (insert Colin Farrell joke here). The attacks and killings themselves are not shown clearly on screen but the aftermath often is, and as you would expect it is always bloody.Of course the local police and media are a tad concerned given the 6 murders in the area, and Alex and her Doctor similarly share some information and theories between themselves.The ending is a little abrupt in that 80s way which is simultaneously strange but refreshing, the story is essentially told so it ends. In fact the entire movie is really quite straightforward:1. Guys on holiday attacked. One dead.2. Second guy a werewolf but doesn't (yet) know it.3. Guy falls for a cute nurse.4. Now he knows it! Transform – Attack – Recover – Rinse – Repeat.5. Finale.There are no unnecessary subplots, no bits that go nowhere and every character is there to be eaten or to wonder why people are being eaten around them and who is doing it.All in all An American Werewolf in London probably can't be considered an All-Time classic even though the transformation sequence is, it is a little too simple and the middle third of the film lags a little too long. But it does tell its simple story very well and entertains along the way in the first and last thirds of the film.Put another way: If you thought The Wolfman was OK An American Werewolf in London will blow your tiny little mind!Final Rating – 8 / 10. There aren't too many films of this era that hold up well against the more BOOM CRASH POW stuff of recent years. This however is most definitely one of the exceptions. Fun, scary and with a couple of very memorable scenes.",An American Werewolf in London
109,Maciste_Brother,Typically overdone John Landis flick,3,1 March 2008,"I saw ""An American Werewolf In London"" when werewolf movies and transformation scenes in horror films were all the rage back in the early '80s. I love horror films and went to see as many as I could back then. Gore or violence never bothered me even though I prefer horror movies which are on the subtle side. Well, I didn't like this movie at all and subtle it ain't. I actually walked out of it halfway through because my friend wanted to leave. She hated it while I wasn't too impressed by it, so we agreed that we had better things to do than watch this thing.With time, I eventually saw the whole movie and I still didn't like it. I recently caught it again on cable and AWIL is clearly a disappointment. There were so many things going for it. Some scenes were effective, certainly at the beginning but the movie devolves quickly after his dead best friend starts visiting David, the werewolf-to-be, and when a nurse (Jenny Agutter) brings David to her house (totally improbable) and those annoying, unnecessary dream sequences. Those dream sequences have almost nothing to do with the werewolf angle. Certainly the bizarre ""Nazi mutants who kill David's entire family"" dream sequence. IMO, those scenes took away from the main story and basically told me that Landis was bored with the werewolf storyline and felt the movie needed to be punctured with gratuitously violent dreams.Then there's the whole moment when the werewolf is trapped in the movie theater by the police and eventually escapes and causes chaos in London is yet another typically gratuitous John Landis scene. Preceding the history making car crash scene in THE BLUES BROTHERS, the escaping werewolf (which, btw, looks totally unconvincing or looks like a bear more than a wolf) causes a massive car pill-up where we see people being run over, being hit by cars and going through store windows or crushed between vehicles. This moment is unnecessary to the storyline and yet Landis felt the need to show us in gory details bystanders being killed senselessly.Because of these numerous unnecessary scenes peppered throughout the movie's length the story barely hangs together in a cohesive manner. And the much vaunted emotional ending is basically a replay of the one in KING KONG. The mix of (slapstick) comedy, violence, horror and romance doesn't work at all here. Only Jenny Agutter comes out looking good in this feeble special effects project. David Naughton is also amiable enough but his character is just a cypher to the scene stealing fx. Watch the beginning, up to when the two guys are attacked by the werewolf and then turn off the TV. Aside from Jenny, there's nothing worth watching after that.",An American Werewolf in London
110,BrandtSponseller,One of my favorite films,10,29 January 2005,"While backpacking through Europe, two friends, David Kessler (David Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Griffin Dunne), find themselves out on England's moors, despite advice to avoid them. When a wild animal attacks them, one of them dies, and the other just might be turning into a monster.Director John Landis' ""pet project""--he had to sit on the script for 10 years before he had enough clout from other films for this one to be greenlighted--is an excellent, seamless melding of comedy and horror, with a surprising amount of brutality and one of the most wonderfully dark, abrupt conclusions ever made.John Irving once said that he loves to put comedy and tragedy in close conjunction because each can make the other more effective. That's just the effect that the combination has in An American Werewolf In London. Both the comedy and the horror in the film are fully committed to, unlike many attempts to merge the two. If ""the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"" is ever true, this is an example. The comic bits wouldn't be nearly as delightful if they didn't supervene on the disturbing, and the horror wouldn't have near the impact if they didn't arrive in the context where you half-expect the next moment to be just as lighthearted and amusing. Both the initial ""animal attack"" and the apocalyptic ending are perfect examples of this.Aside from that exquisite unusualness, An American Werewolf In London has many other superb characteristics. The cast is perfect. Naughton, who also starred in the seriously underrated Desire, The Vampire (aka I, Desire) (1982), carries the film with ease. The cinematography is excellent. The shots of the countryside (actually filmed in Wales) are actually both beautiful and very eerie at the same time. The make-up effects are awesome, and the transformation effects are unsurpassed. The music, which is primarily a number of different ""moon"" related pop songs, is also perfect, partially because of the bizarre contrasts in mood that the music creates, which echoes the comedy/tragedy juxtaposition. Unlike many other films, every scene in this one is a something I'd like to spend years exploring. The settings, the characters, the scenarios are all so fascinating.This film is a 10 out of 10 even with one hand tied behind its back. If you enjoy it, and you're open minded about newer horror film styles, the ""sequel"", An American Werewolf in Paris, is also worth a watch.",An American Werewolf in London
111,inspectors71,Meatloaf in a Box,7,5 March 2014,"This is a technician's movie, not an actor's. I say this about John Landis' An American Werewolf in London because many of the performances and much of the humor are forced. Don't get me wrong--I have a great deal of affection for Landis' work in general and for his brave but failed attempt to mix his sharp and snarky humor with the natural tragedy that is the story of werewolves. AAWIL simply tries too hard to be an everyman, a modern retelling of the classic tale of the innocent who is attacked by a lycanthrope and must decide if he will end the bloodline of the monster by his own hand.Landis' has crafted a grim, gory, occasionally funny, and usually gasp-worthy film narrative of a college graduate on a walking tour through England who survives a werewolf's attack only to fall victim to its curse. The ""technician"" remark at the start of this review pertains to how hard Landis works to force us to care about the characters with slick plot tricks, startling violence, sex (the romp in the shower between David Naughton and Jenny Agutter, with Van Morrison's Moondance in the background, works better than the de-icer you sprinkled on your walk last winter), and his trademark mixing of modern humor and old-school jokes. You feel creepy laughing at the supernatural interplay between Naughton and his college buddy, long after said buddy's face has begun to shred and slough off from decomposition. But, you laugh anyway.That's why I said the movie feels forced. It works--and it sometimes works very well--as a horror movie, a comedy, and a snapshot of London in 1980, but the viewer feels manipulated during and after the film. It's as if Landis said to himself, ""Today, I will be fresh and spontaneous, as I was in Animal House, or I will die trying!""Instead of fresh, there are fresh kills littering the streets and alleys of London. Instead of spontaneity, there's one set-piece of film construction after another. It's like watching a box store being built, and you only occasionally wonder what's going to sold in the store. If Landis had been able to maintain that wonder throughout the 97 minutes, he would have delivered a masterpiece instead of a blueprint.",An American Werewolf in London
112,Spuzzlightyear,"""I'm sorry I called you a meatloaf Jack""",10,5 July 2005,"An American Werewolf in London is a movie I can never get tired of watching. All about a young man's rather unfortunate series of events that happen to him while he and his friends go backpacking in England, he gets a rude visit from one of the locals there (who happens to be a werewolf). He winds up in a hospital, and that's where the real fun begins. David Mcnaughton is just so good in this movie, I can never imagine who else John Landis could have put in this movie. He plays the role of 'David' with much humor and pathos that I was rooting for the guy in the end, even though I shouldn't have been. Jenny Agutter plays the nurse he meets while he's cooped up in the hospital, and they have definite chemistry between them. I don't want to ruin the story for people, as it's filled with surprises, scares and high weirdness (the dream sequences still get to me).

Career performances by Naughton, a stunning Agutter, Dunne and Woodvine in story of two young Americans savaged by a werewolf in rural England. Dunne becomes the (undead) dead but Naughton survives a changed man. Other than the overdone dream sequences most of the movie works very well, particularly the later stalking scenes and Dunne's increasingly unwelcome visits.

The surviving American David woke up in a hospital in London and started to live together with Alex the nurse who's the loveliest character in the film. His undead friend visited him several times saying he had to kill himself so that they can become free of the limbo. It was pretty fun when he woke up in the zoo naked after a night of killings. It was bizarre when he and his victims got together at a porno cinema and he changed again and cornered by people and the police. Even Alex couldn't help him and he got shot before he couldn't attack her and was lying dead on the ground naked as Alex. We could only see glimpses of the killings and the werewolf until the very end when he changed at the cinema and it was all chaos. The transformation at the flat of the nurse was pretty good tho.,An American Werewolf in London
116,gizmomogwai,Awooo! A fun feel and sex make this one worth seeing,7,3 October 2009,"My mission to watch and review horror and Halloween-themed movies and TV throughout this October led me to the video store where I found a shortage of horror classics. However, I did find An American Werewolf in London, and while I can't argue this was particularly scary, or particularly funny (although there were a few laughs), or that there's a twist ending involving the girl, I do think this one's worth seeing.The movie tells the story of two Americans, Jack and David, who are attacked by a werewolf in England. Jack dies, and David goes to a hospital where he falls in love with a nurse named Alex. But David has become a werewolf and poses a threat to the community.There's not a lot here to make the movie special until the odd nightmare scenes- is David in a hospital or running through a forest? Both? Nightmare becomes further confused with reality when David is visited by an undead Jack. Then we have David and Alex's affair- the shower and sex scenes are hot, and Alex looks good both in her nurse uniform and sans clothes. It made me wish I were a werewolf.But then come the werewolf scenes. Except for a convincing transformation scene we don't see much of the werewolf, and don't feel much horror. But I will give the movie credit for two things: the doctor is worried what David will do, but doesn't think David is a werewolf in a supernatural sense, just a psychological one. This feels like a more plausible concern. And David meeting his undead victims in a porno theatre is an odd twist.Happy Halloween.",An American Werewolf in London
117,MrGKB,A classic 80s horror comedy...,9,30 July 2012,"...that holds up extremely well after three decades, writer/director Jon ""Animal House"" Landis' dark homage to and update of Universal's 1941 ""The Wolf Man"" will remain a benchmark of lycanthropic fiction for long as such stories are told. The main twist from a straightforward doomed romance tale centers on continual warnings from the lead's dead friend that he must kill himself or wind up as a murderous monster. As in the original, things end unhappily ever after.Its box office perhaps ran afoul of the prior releases of Joe Dante's ""The Howling"" and Michael Wadleigh's ""Wolfen,"" but that didn't keep Rick Baker's magnificent makeup effects from winning that first categorical Oscar (against contender, Stan Winston, for ""Heartbeeps""), nor has that kept it from being the most highly regarded of the three. Truthfully, I enjoy all three, but this is the one I revisit the most often.Ignore the curmudgeons; the acting is fine. David ""I'm a Pepper!"" Naughton provides his doomed hero a winning innocence, and Griffin ""After Hours"" Dunne is perfect as the undead friend, while Jenny ""Logan's Run"" Agutter charmingly embodies the tragic love interest. The rest of the cast is of a piece, including John ""Fatherland"" Woodvine as the inquisitive doctor, Brian ""Alien3"" Glover and David ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" Schofield as secretive townsfolk, and even Frank ""The Dark Crystal"" Oz in a somewhat rare human appearance. The only ""bad"" actors are the ones in ""See You Next Wednesday,"" the smutty film-within-the-film, and they're meant to be that way. And it still amuses me that Landis has gotten away with that ribald trademark for so long, and that so few people know what it really means.Never mind that; so many talented people helped make this film a genre milestone. Elmer ""too many to pick just one"" Bernstein's moody snippets of underscoring, the aforementioned Rick ""you have to ask?"" Baker's groundbreaking fx, favored Landis collaborator, Robert ""Thriller"" Paynter's aces camera-work, superb production and art design, and (of course) Landis' brilliant selection of pop songs to accentuate mood (forget that he didn't get everything he wanted; what he got worked beautifully, from the melancholy intro of Bobby Vinton's ""Blue Moon"" to the edgy jangle of CCR's ""Bad Moon Rising"" to the ironically conclusive Marcels doo-wop ""Blue Moon"" bouncing a stunned audience through the credits before it can recover from a quick and utterly---though totally foreseeable---tragic ending). Sweet! There's almost nothing I don't love about ""American Werewolf in London."" I can't imagine that the impending remake can possibly improve on it, although I'll no doubt give it a fair chance to try. The original will always be with us regardless. If you haven't seen it yet (though truthfully, I can't imagine that, either, if you're bothering to read this blurb), do.

118,ASouthernHorrorFan,"My Review Of ""An American Werewolf In London""",8,24 July 2013,"Some movies just raise feelings of excitement and pleasure inside no matter how many times you watch the film. ""An American Werewolf In London"" is one of those films that no matter how many times I watch I get giddy inside as I watch that opening scene of David and Jack walking down that county road near Yorkshire Moors. Directed by John Landis this film was released as a horror/comedy in 1981. The story follows two American backpackers in England. One is devoured by a wolf and the other is only bit before villagers shoot the beast. Madness and chaos transform the survivors life as he deals with the tragedy in London Hospital. A great set up for ""fish out of water"" story with a macabre point of view. The film has some very stereotypical aspects to it, the almost arrogant and foolish way that British intelligence is shown almost seems derogatory, as David must submit to foreign policies and beaurocracy. However the images of Londoners is mildly balanced and justified by the asinine shenanigans of David Kessler. The story is a funny and the negatives are minor unless you've seen the film like a thousand times and those idiosyncrasies are all that remain to pick at. The story stays with in a classic premise that does not rely on props or gimmicks of the time to find it's humor which make it an easy film to watch no matter how many decades pass.The special effects in this film are kick ass and organic. It is some of the best special effects make up work of the era. The film did not rely on cartoonish transpositions or tacky CGI which was all that was available in the 1980's. It kept with the basic concepts and abilities of creature effects , something that I am glad to see come back into fashion in horror. There are a few scenes in this film that really stand out as far as the FX is concerned. The scene with the Nazi Werewolves slaughtering David's family in his dream sequence is awesome and gives way to a story in the werewolf genre that I personally love. Then there is the scene when David is in the theater with all the dead whom he is responsible for. The rotting visuals are kick ass. Gross and gory and good. Plus I think this is the first time that we saw werewolves as massive beasts instead of the upright biped creature known in earlier stuff like ""The Wolfman"". No need for a real wolf, the kind popular in todays shows and movies, nor is there any aspects of the standing monstrosity that is so terrifying such as in ""The Howling"". This was a truly original design for the era. It made not only werewolves scary as hell beasts with almost no resemblance to man but it also made real wolves a bit more scary as well (for me anyway). Now as far as the over all effect of this film. I still find it as watchable today as I did the first time I saw it on HBO.As I said many a time in the past- my mom refused me theatrical horror films and regulated the television stuff until I was at least 11 years old. So I had to sneak or beg a sitter to let me watch something on HBO. ""An American Werewolf In London"" was something I plotted to see. I knew when it aired on a Saturday, and I knew which babysitter to favor that weekend so that I would be able to watch. It worked and I was both fascinated and scared from the first wolf attack until the final scene of David being shot in the alley. The humor, effects (especially the transformation scene) and the setting of this movie make it a true classic, American or otherwise.",An American Werewolf in London
119,aciessi,A Wild Time,10,19 May 2017,"For it's time, its truly something nobody had ever seen. A throwback to the golden age of Universal Horror films, with more blood and guts than any mainstream film of the early 80's, and enough strange humor to suggest that John Landis was making a comedy, which he vehemently claims he wasn't. This is a peak 80's movie. I loved every minute of it. Look, even I agree, it's a choppy mess of a film. The editing is off the wall. That nightmare scene with the masked invaders is something I will never understand in a million years. The film ends on the most bizarre note in history. But it just doesn't matter. I had a thrilling time. Everyone involved looked like they had a ball. The genius special effects by Rick Baker still holds up. David Naughton is such a terrific lead, it's a wonder how his career didn't take off after this. Best of all, this film inspired Michael Jackson to make Thriller. Just remember that, folks. Whether you love this film or not, we wouldn't have gotten Thriller without it.",An American Werewolf in London
120,Mister-6,"""American"" proud....",10,15 September 1999,"You have to love a horror movie that features a clip from ""The Muppet Show"".And if you love werewolves, all the better.""An American Werewolf in London"" works on so many levels, that it's small wonder so many regard it as a latter-day classic of the genre.  So many chills, so many laughs, all in one neat little package.As the ""Werewolf"" of the title, Naughton does very well, especially in scenes where his costume consists mostly of excess hair.  And as his buddy, Dunne easily steals the film with his observations and his worsening situation (I'll say no more but you'll know what I mean when you see this.).And the special effects!  Rick Baker once again makes his name supreme as makeup wizard unparalleled with so many different effects for werewolf transformations, attacks, zombified victims, etc.  But there's another side to this film you may not see coming.  This film has one of the best senses of humor in this genre since ""The Bride of Frankenstein"".  You'll forever try to mimic the mother's response when her son tells her, ""A naked American man stole my balloons!"" (trust me).I would never dream of telling you how it ends; but consider that this was directed by John Landis, think about the other films he's directed then see if what you expected comes out in the end.  It did for me.One final note: I haven't seen ""An American Werewolf in Paris"", but I have no desire to see any film trying to ape on the greatness achieved here.  Let well enough alone, will you, Hollywood??!Ten stars.  And I had no idea William Shakespeare was French.",An American Werewolf in London
121,KnightsofNi11,Genius level horror/comedy,9,5 September 2012,"From the director of Animal House... a different kind of animal. I really love that tagline and I really love this movie. An American Werewolf in London is John Landis' first foray into horror and, might I say, it's where he belonged this entire time. The film begins with two friends who are backpacking through Britain. One night they are attacked by a werewolf, leaving one friend dead and the other a werewolf himself. Unfortunately, no one will believe him until it is far too late. This is one of the greatest blends of comedy and horror I have ever seen, and should be taken as the perfect formula for how to blend these two genres.An American Werewolf in London is simply awesome. It is legitimately scary, and truly funny. The two genres blend together beautifully. The horror genre definitely helms most of the film, but darkly and ironically funny moments pop in and out of the film seamlessly. It is the make up for exactly how this kind of film should work.And speaking of make up, one of the coolest things about this film is legendary Rick Baker's make up design. It is horrendously spectacular. So spectacular, in fact, that it made the Academy Awards create the make-up category just for Rick Baker. If this guy wasn't awesome enough already, he practically single handedly created a whole new category for the Oscars. And it's very well deserved too, as the werewolf make-up is astonishingly brilliant, as well as the undead makeup as the dead backpacker repeatedly comes back to visit his still living friend in an amusingly intelligent sub-plot.An American Werewolf in London never falters and never loses its touch, always delivering on the scares and the intense suspense, and always dishing out great laughs throughout an incredibly entertaining and unique story. This is such a great film and John Landis has excelled at making a horror/comedy that works and keeping the werewolf mythology fresh and alive through a contemporary comedy. An American Werewolf in London works on a profound level of high quality filmmaking within this genre. There were so many things that could have gone wrong because of the subject matter, but Landis and the rest of the cast and the crew instead do everything right.",An American Werewolf in London
122,jluis1984,Simply brilliant horror...,10,10 February 2007,"1981 was a great year for Horror, as three excellent movies about werewolves were released that same year in a ""once in a blue moon"" event: ""Wolfen"", ""The Howling"", and ""An American Werewolf in London"". Of the three, John Landis' ""An American Werewolf in London"" is probably the most famous, but not without a reason, as it's more than a brilliant horror movie, it's simply one of the best movies ever made. Being only 31 years old and right after the hit comedies ""Animal House"" and ""The Blues Brothers"", Landis found himself able to finally make his dream project, a story he had conceived when he was just 19: the story of a young American who finds himself transformed into a werewolf while on a trip through England. Like the classics ""The Curse of the Werewolf"" and ""The Wolf Man"" did before, ""An American Werewolf in London"" would redefine the werewolf myth and bring it to a whole new audience.David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dunne) are two American tourists backpacking through the United Kingdom. One night while traveling across the Yorkshire moors, they are attacked by a strange beast that savagely kills Jack but is killed by the townspeople before it kills David. Weeks later, David wakes up in a London hospital, where he receives the tragic news of his best friend's death; however, this is not the worse that will happen to him, as Jack appears to him as ghost and tells him that what killed him was a werewolf and he can't rest in peace. But the worse part is that now David is a werewolf too, and cursed to become a savage beast under the full moon. Thinking it's all a hallucination caused by the shock, David refuses to believe this, but he begins to have weird visions as the full moon gets closer.Written by Landis himself, the movie is a delightful mixture of black comedy with classic horror that works perfectly together in the film. While the comedy is certainly one of the film's strongest points, Landis follows the pattern set by Universal's ""The Wolf Man"", and keeps the tragedy of the werewolf's curse as the main theme. As in Curt Siodmak's classic story, romance plays a big part of the story in the shape of Alex Price (Jenny Agutter), a nurse who becomes David's lover, and the one in charge of stopping the beast. The story unfolds nicely, and focuses on the suspense of the events before the unavoidable transformation, giving the movie a sense of impeding doom that fits nicely with the cynicism and tragedy of Landis' version of the werewolf myth. Robert Paynter's cinematography was the perfect complement to the story by capturing all the British landscapes (both urban and countryside) with a surreal beauty.The direction of the film is simply flawless, with Landis skill as storyteller shining as he makes his story come alive. As written above, most of the movie focuses on the fear and paranoia that David feels before his transformation, showing him in the state of disbelief when confronted by the ghost of his friend; however, this is not to say that the actual action of the movie is downplayed, as when the climatic scene of the metamorphosis arrives, it doesn't disappoint. Landis proves with this movie that he can direct scenes with heavy use of special effects with the same care as the normal character driven scenes. The film moves at a nice pace, never becoming boring or tiresome, and the use of classic songs with ""moon"" in the title is just another of the small details that makes Landis' masterpiece an unforgettable film.John Landis direction and Rick Baker's awesome make-up effects tend to downplay the work by the cast in the film, but this doesn't mean there are bad performances. David Naughton tends to be the focus of the criticism, and it is easy to see why, as not only he certainly is the weakest link in the cast, his character is not really a likable one at first. As a tourist, he starts as an arrogant brat, and his disdain for Jack's petition makes him less sympathetic; but this just increases the power of the climatic transformation. Jerry Agutter is very effective as Alex, and makes an excellent counterpart to Naughton. However, the supporting roles are the ones who shine the most, as Griffin Dunne and John Woodvine steal every scene they are, the first one as David's friend Jack, and the second one as Dr. Hirsch, the only man who tries to help David.Unlike most movies from the same era, it doesn't feel dated and still looks very fresh today. The mix of black humor and tragic horror works nicely against all odds and is the trademark of the movie. Baker's remarkable work in the make-up department is now a classic work in the history of the genre, and helped him to take his career to new heights after the slight downfall he had after ""King Kong"". The transformation scene is definitely now an iconic scene in the genre, pretty much in the same way as Jack Pierce's make-up for ""The Wolf Man"". Still, this film is much more than impressive effects, it's a tale of fantasy and horror told in a very classy and entertaining way. With all respect to Waggner and Fisher's movies, Landis' spin on the werewolf's myth is personally, the best rendition of a werewolves' story ever put on film.Definitely 1981 was the year of the wolf in cinema, as together with ""Wolfen"" and ""The Howling"", this movie gave new life to the legendary beasts that roam by night. It's really a shame that Landis's career became so troubled by the late 80s, as he has an enormous talent for directing. True, ever since the beginning of cinema many movies have portrayed werewolves in many different stories, but in my humble opinion, this brilliant film tops them all. 10/10.",An American Werewolf in London
123,ivo-cobra8,My favorite best werewolf film of all time a true horror icon classic!,10,15 October 2016,"An American Werewolf in London (1981) is a cult classic horror werewolf slasher flick. It is my third favorite werewolf film of all time! An American Werewolf in London is not only the best werewolf movie ever made it is also one of the best genre films of all time. I grew up watching this film and it is a childhood favorite of mine. I first saw this movie when I was 13 years young of age, it is a childhood movie for me and it is the first werewolf film I ever saw. I love this film to death and I think it is a great horror film of all time! It is one of my personal favorite horror werewolf movies of all time.It is very scary, especially the ending you can see a human's head falling down the street. I don't know much about the cast I don't know almost anyone except actress Jenny Agutter I know her from Logan's Run (1976) and The Eagle Has Landed (1976). This film is directed by John Landis who directed a lot of comedy films. The movie was entirely shot in London, Surrey, and Wales, which you can see a beautiful country side in the UK. This film: The Howling (1981) and Dog Soldiers (2002) are my top 3 favorite werewolf films this will be my number 2 favorite film.Plot: Two American college students are on a walking tour of Britain and are attacked by a werewolf. One is killed, the other is mauled. The werewolf is killed but reverts to its human form, and the local townspeople are unwilling to acknowledge its existence. The surviving student begins to have nightmares of hunting on four feet at first but then finds that his friend and other recent victims appear to him, demanding that he commit suicide to release them from their curse, being trapped between worlds because of their unnatural deaths.This is a classic horror film about two young American men, David Kessler (played by Naughton) and Jack Goodman (played by Dunne), attacked by a werewolf on a backpacking holiday in England. With Jack killed, David is taken to a London hospital, where his disturbing apparitions of his deceased friend informs him that he is a werewolf and will transform at the next full moon. What I love about this film is: I love the story, the special effects and the humor in here. In the opening scene you have a really beautiful view on an England country side when you see David Kessler and Jack Goodman walking down the road. This movie is really beautiful shot I love that two young men best friends are traveling together and seeing England in a country side. I love the werewolf story and everything in it.I love the characters in this movie, the story is a full long horror film with awesome black comedy in it, practical effects by Rick Baker that still rival some god awful cartoon ps1 CGI now a days!!! I have seen this film more then any other movie and it still feels fresh. And while filmed in the early eighties, it feels timeless. The blend of horror and humor are perfect. The horror comes at you brutal and/or fast and the humor is never forced but comes naturally out of the absurdity of the events (waking up naked in the zoo, having your dead friend tell you that you are a werewolf.) Oh man, this is such a fun movie. It's a great werewolf story with enough gore for the splatter junkies, and enough story to make it better than just some run-of-the-mill horror flick. This was created in a time when horror was HORROR, as opposed to these kiddie flicks with predictable jump scares we get today.The special effects, done by the great Rick Baker, are absolutely astounding, even more believable than a lot of what we get today. The first transformation scene is one of the best to ever be featured in a werewolf film, especially with the convincing screams of pain from David Naughton. The actual look of the werewolf is also just as great, giving one of the most menacing and evil appearance I've ever seen on a wolf. The howl sounds like a mixture between a man's scream and an actual beast giving a call, a sound that sends a chill down your spine every time you hear it. These sort of details remind you that even though there's comedy in it, Landis did put great focus on the horror aspect of the film.An American Werewolf in London is a 1981 British-American horror comedy film written and directed by John Landis, and starring David Naughton, Jenny Agutter, and Griffin Dunne.Overall: An American Werewolf in London is a timeless excellent cult classic movie my favorite number 2 werewolf film of all time! Score: 10/10 I love this film, the acting is really solid the characters in this film a well written. The special effects in this movie are well made. This movie on it self's stays a true classic in a horror genre and it is way better movie, than these days horror movies that are in PG-13 ratings awful!",An American Werewolf in London

The first time you 	  see the dream sequence it is really scary. I've also got to say that even nowadays, whenever I'm in the London Underground 	  the scene from Tottenham Court Road goes through my mind. I suppose the film is best known for the transformation sequence, 	  but there's all manner of lines that are quotable such as ""Remember the Alamo"", ""You made me miss"" and ""stick to the path"".

126,tonypeacock-1,A comedy horror that reinvigorates werewolf horror genre,7,27 October 2019,"Revisited this 1981 film in a newly remastered print today.The film tells the story of a couple of U.S. tourists, David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dinne) savaged by a werewolf like creature on the moors of Northern England.It has good elements of horror and black comedy. The film effortlessly goes from one comedic scene to a blood splattered scene of horror.Made in an era before CGI dominated special effects. Make up artist Rick Baker demonstrates his skills especially in the scene where David undergoes a full-moon transformation from human to werewolf.The film is British which adds a degree of added interest. The London scenes on the Underground reminded me of films like Death Line and Creep.Features some well known British actors like Brian Glover and Rik Mayall in the Slaughtered Lamb pub (great name!) an interesting experience.The music score is also quite good for Mancunians of a certain persuasion, Blue Moon featuring prominently.",An American Werewolf in London
127,Prichards12345,One of the best comedy horrors out there.,9,13 November 2016,"John Landis captures some wonderfully silly English humour in American Werewolf In London, while at the same time delivering a film that actually manages to frighten occasionally. It's extremely rare that a film does both so well, and as well as the engaging story we also have the ground-breaking transformation scene of man into wolf...The story concerns two American students backpacking through rural England. And for a change, they are hugely likable from the get go. Deciding to stop for a meal in the gloriously named Slaughtered Lamb pub, we get Brian Glover telling a great pub joke and Rick Mayall in attendance as an extra! It isn't long before our students put their foot in it.Leaving the pub they inadvertently stray onto the moors, and having previously been warned against crossing them, pay a severe price...David Naughton is really good in the title role, as is Griffin Dunne - quickly murdered by a marauding werewolf, he pops up as a ghost to advise his friend to kill himself. For poor David Kessler, you see, has been bitten...This is a film full of memorable moments that gel superbly; the dream sequence is fantastic, the subway murder suspenseful and engrossing and the transformation astonishing for its time (it still holds up today.) But the film is always laced with humour. And even the final tragedy of David's fate does not over shadow things too much.The 1980's did not produce many good horror films, but this is certainly one of them. Superb.",An American Werewolf in London
128,MattyGibbs,One of the all time great horror films,10,20 July 2014,"Mixing horror with elements of comedy is a dangerous trick but this is the finest example of a film that succeeds at the task. Although not really a comedy it has plenty of classic dark comedy which lighten the mood in between the undeniable horror that takes place. Much has been made of the special effects and even today 33 years later the transformation of David into the werewolf is impressive stuff. There is a brilliant tone of foreboding throughout amid some great scenes of werewolf mayhem. The acting is great with plenty of top notch UK character actors making appearances. David Naughton is very likable as the main character and this is important as it makes you sympathise with the position he finds himself in. Throw in the luscious Jenny Agutter as the love interest and you can't really go wrong. Although very much an 80's film it still manages even today to be a scary, witty and wonderfully atmospheric film which you can enjoy time and time again. The tension rises throughout and the ending unlike so many horror films is brilliant.Modern horror should take a look at this film to see how it should be done. A classic which every horror fan should own.",An American Werewolf in London
129,innocuous,Time has shown how good this was (and still is).,9,30 April 2008,"I can't give this a full 10 stars, but I can get pretty close to it. I first saw AAWIL just a week after it opened in theaters. I went with a co-worker of mine, since my wife did not care for the genre. About 2/3 of the way through the movie, my friend had to get up and leave the theater for almost 10 minutes. He told me later that he just ""couldn't handle"" the roller coaster ride from comedy to horror and then back to comedy.I'll second what most of the other reviewers have said about this film. Considering that it was done with practical effects, it is one of the most impressive FX films you can see. (The other film I immediately think of in comparison to AAWIL is John Carpenter's ""The Thing,"" which also relied entirely on practicals.) In my opinion, you could not remake this film using CGI or digital effects and get anywhere near the impact. Landis is truly a genius.Final comment...watch this on a big screen and turned up loud! Landis intended it to be viewed this way and you really owe it to yourself.ADDED 10/2/2009: You've GOT TO get the Full Moon Edition BD version of this film! Spectacular transfer, improved sound, and a bunch of nice extras, including two that were not on the HD-DVD version. ""Beware the Moon"" is a fine feature-length documentary about the making of the film and you should see it even if you have to rent it as a separate DVD from N**f***.Now...one more thing. I'm going to have to start an argument with some reviewers (including Mr. Ebert) who seem to feel that the ending of the movie is lame. In fact, I think it's one of the stronger points of the movie.****SPOILER ALERT!******First, the ending comes fast. It's abrupt and basically unexpected. Most viewers are at the height of tension and then it's suddenly deflated. In fact, the end credits roll and the typical viewer hasn't even absorbed the fact that the film's over. This is precisely the type of roller coaster ride that Landis has been working for throughout the film. He's knocking your legs out from under you. It's timed perfectly.Second, unlike many supernatural horror films, there's no ""hocus-pocus, how do we lift the curse/spell?"" mumbo-jumbo subplot at the end. We already know that a werewolf can be killed with a simple bullet (we've been shown once and told twice), so it should come as no surprise that the werewolf is NOT unstoppable. His death is quick, violent, and, best of all, simple.Third, some of reviewers don't seem to understand that David, in his transformed state at the end of the movie, is apparently able to remember/comprehend for the briefest moment some of his feelings for Alex. The tragedy is that, unlike in a Disney movie, his bestial nature can't allow him to do anything other than attack her. True love does NOT conquer all. David doesn't throw himself off a cliff to save her, or rush against the mob to die on their pitchforks. He tries to go for her jugular.*****END SPOILERS******The ending is one of the aspects of the film that so successfully make it a true tragedy. I'm teary-eyed every time they crank up the final rendition of ""Blue Moon"" because it's truly sad...not scary, not funny, not ironic, and not FX-laden.Get this film. You won't regret it.",An American Werewolf in London

This movie was either made out of extreme passion or Landis got lost while making it. People have commented that it has the best transformation scene in cinema history, although The Howling transformation was pretty well done.

Two genres that are not easy to combine in a good way, but here it's done creating both thrills and laughs. The second thing is the visual effects. Both special effects and make-up are very well done, especially considering this movie was made in 1981.As werewolf-movies go this is one of the best i've seen. I definitely prefer these kind of special effects and make-up to computer effects. And it really looks great here. Recommended!",An American Werewolf in London
134,oOoBarracuda,An American Werewolf in London,9,19 August 2016,"A true cinematic achievement was made by John Landis with his 1981 feature An American Werewolf in London. The black comedy/horror movie is the best of its kind. Starring David Naughton and Griffin Dunne as two college students walking through England when attacked by a werewolf, An American Werewolf in London is the comedic horror movie you never knew you needed in your life. Truly a film that changes the way you look at horror movies, a viewing of An American Werewolf in London works just as well for someone who is a horror fan, a comedy fan, or a soon-to-be converted fan of neither, a true treat and best of its kind, Landis outdid himself in 1981.On a cold autumn night, college students and friends, David Kessler (David Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Griffin Dunne) are begrudging their decision to take a walking tour through Europe when they are hurried away from a creepy cafe they happen upon along their journey with mysterious writings on the wall. Trying to put it out of their mind as they walk, it begins to rain and the two hurry along to try to find a cottage to seek refuge. Not paying much attention to where they are going, Jack and David are attacked by a creature that emerges from the woods. Jack doesn't survive the attack, but David does and he knows what he saw. He is convinced he and his friend were the victims of a werewolf attack, but the town refuses to believe it and hesitantly denies the existence of werewolves. Trying to heal and move about life getting over his trauma, David is haunted by dreams of eating flesh. Soon after the dreams start, David is also visited by his slain friend, Jack, and the other victims claimed by the werewolf in London. As David starts to turn into the werewolf every full moon, Jack tries to convince him that the only way he can bridge the gap between the two worlds is by committing suicide and releasing himself from the curse. David is stricken by the damage he has done in the state of being a werewolf and is desperate to rid himself of this curse, in any way possible.This film may truly have the best score I have ever heard, at least in its own genres. The music perfectly captures what's happening on screen and does a great service to filling every space in the audience mind's as they are watching. The film opens with Blue Moon for instance, which could not be any better at foreshadowing the events to come. The nightmare scenes and each reappearance of Jack were also best in their class. Each time we see Jack he has decayed more than the previous time we saw him, which was not only a brilliant directorial decision but also a great subconscious illustration of the decay of David as well. The first time we see David transition to a werewolf was painful and thorough, and the best transition scene I have ever seen. The fear we see on David's face is pure torture and chilling in its realism. The shots in the subway scene also go a long way to prove Landis' skill with a camera. The long shots and winding tracking shots are beautiful and expose the vulnerability of David to his own self. The camera work, music, and makeup and effects make An American Werewolf in London a standout, a true leader in the genre, and one to be seen by all.",An American Werewolf in London
135,Nightman85,The greatest modern werewolf movie!,10,27 January 2006,"Outstanding horror film from director John Landis is a wild modern classic and simply one of the best werewolf films of all time!Young man is bitten by a monstrous wolf in the England countryside, with some horrific results.An American Werewolf in London is often pegged as a comedy, and while granted Landis does give this film lots of sharp humor it's really more of a stunning horror film. Landis's story is one that quickly becomes engulfing as we are given a likable hero, humorous dialog, and some well-done scenes of shock and suspense. The nightmare sequences, as well as the wolf attacks, are truly scary. The movie carries an eerie atmosphere of the unknown. Rick Baker adds some wildly impressive makeup FX to this film, frankly they stand among his best works. This film boasts perhaps the most convincing werewolf transformation ever! Kudos go to a terrific soundtrack as well, notice all the songs have the word 'moon' in them.The cast is yet another high point in the film. Star David Naughton is a sympathetic and attractive hero, it's very easy to love the poor guy. Jenny Agutter does a wonderful turn as a nurse who falls in love with Naughton. Griffin Dunne is great as Naughton's ill-fated buddy, who just won't stop coming back! A terrific and simply unforgettable film all the way, An American Werewolf in London remains one of Landis's best works.**** out of ****",An American Werewolf in London
136,jhaggardjr,Funniest horror film ever made,10,20 September 2001,"""An American Werewolf in London"" is one of my all-time favorite horror films. It's also the funniest horror film that I've ever seen. This surprised me when I first saw it years ago, and after seeing it again recently in honor of its 20th anniversary, I'm still laughing over it. Be warned however, this is not a spoof. It's an intense horror film with a great sense of humor. One of the reasons why this movie has so many laughs is that it was written and directed by John Landis, who usually specializes in comedies. Landis has directed such hit comedies as ""National Lampoon's Animal House"", ""The Blues Brothers"", ""Trading Places"", ""Spies Like Us"", and ""Coming to America"". That's an excellent track record. ""An American Werewolf in London"" is one of Landis' best. It's about two American students who on one dark night with a full moon are walking on the Welsh moors and are attacked by a werewolf. One of the students dies while the other ends up in the hospital. However the attacks that the surviving man suffers causes him to transfer into a werewolf himself. Even though ""An American Werewolf in London"" is very funny at times, it's also very gruesome. Overall, a superior horror/comedy.**** (out of four)",An American Werewolf in London
137,hellholehorror,Ahead of its time,9,18 October 2017,"I would love to have grown up in America just so that I could watch this film from a true American perspective and truly appreciated it. I thought that it was a very good film but you could tell that it was an American writing because of the slightly alternate perspective on the English culture. This is a horror film with light comic undertones which I think were actually ahead of its time. The style is distinctly seventies even though it was made in the eighties. The story plays really well with solid progression and interesting sub-plots never taking attention away from the screen. Ignore the unbelievable elements and this is an amazing werewolf film. Probably the best werewolf film sandwiched between Ginger Snaps (2000) and The Howling (1981). I think that the light humour and interesting storytelling and some pertinent moments really make this a leader in the genre. I loved the detail of London conversely I hated the stuffy British people. The final scene was a climatic masterpiece probably never seen before or since to the same quality. It is not especially scary but I would still highly recommend this. Horrifically eerie, made me think that it could happen to me.",An American Werewolf in London
138,paulwattriley,Frightened love,8,8 February 2021,I loved this movie and it frightened the pants off of me. Its not a comedy people tagging it as a comedy annoy me. Apart from his dead friend appearing there is very little comedy factor to the movie.,An American Werewolf in London
139,gsygsy,unusual and entertaining,8,10 September 2007,"Mostly entertaining movie that manages to have its cake and eat it - it's both a genre piece and a satire of the genre at the same time.In true horror genre mode, there are one or two genuinely scary moments. I've seen the film several times and they still work, because they are so well-conceived and well executed.Griffin Dunne's character is the main location of John Landis' gentle satire, but there are en route amusing details - for example, the pub into which our two American innocents stumble is called The Slaughtered Lamb. And of course the soundtrack of ""moon songs"" is a glory of good humour. One element that doesn't quite work is the portrayal of the bungling detectives: I can't work out whether the fault lies in the performances or the writing or maybe a mixture of the two.In spite of a fair amount of blood and guts, the film has a great deal of tenderness in its central relationships, and against all the odds Jenny Agutter is genuinely moving in the finale.David Naughton is warm-hearted and charming, though maybe a little bland, as the film's hero. John Woodvine gives authoritative support as the doctor who suspects there's more to the American's wounds than meets the eye. There's a splendid bunch of Brits in other smaller roles, led by Brian Glover, Lila Kaye and David Schofield.The great transformation scene remains unique in its mixture of technical achievement and compassion at the victim's agony.It's an unusual movie, worthy of its cult reputation.",An American Werewolf in London
140,Gafke,Bad Moon Rising,10,30 October 2005,"This is one of my very favorite werewolf films of all time.Jack and David are two American students backpacking their way through the rural English countryside. Warned by the locals to ""stay off the moors"" the two nevertheless strike off across the aforementioned moors by the light of the full moon after a pub full of nervous and suspicious townsfolk give them a less than warm welcome. The two are attacked by a huge animal which kills Jack and seriously injures David, who awakens in a London hospital 3 weeks later. David seems physically fine, and pretty nurse Alex agrees. She even invites him to stay with her at her flat once he is released from the hospital. But David is not fine at all. He's suffering from some very realistic nightmares. Worse still, Jack insists upon visiting David from beyond the grave. Jack, it seems, was killed by a werewolf and is now cursed to roam the earth until the werewolf's bloodline is severed. David, Jack says, will turn into a werewolf in just a few days, and he must commit suicide to end the curse. David refuses to believe this, and even questions his own sanity. But when the next full moon rises and six people are found horribly mutilated the next morning, David must accept the truth: he IS a werewolf, and he must be stopped.Griffin Dunne nearly steals this entire film with his portrayal of the dead Jack, who casually shows up periodically throughout the film in advancing stages of decomposition. Though dead, his sense of humor is still very much alive and he mixes his dire werewolf warnings with bitter observations about girls he never had sex with and how boring dead people can be. Only the special effects by Rick Baker upstage Jack as, in a painful two minute long sequence, David transforms before our very eyes into a vicious beast. Very VERY impressive! John Landis has given us a brilliant black comedy with this film. The script is witty and clever, the performances are all nearly flawless and the story, though simple, is thoroughly believable simply because it never takes itself too seriously. The effects are awesome and the gore,when it comes, is quite shocking. A dream sequence featuring military werewolves wielding machine guns is enjoyably surreal, while another dream sequence featuring David with a demonic face still manages to scare the crap out of me every time. Watch for the ""climax"" in a porn theater - hilarious! The soundtrack, consisting of songs which mention the moon in their lyrics, is so weird and, at times, so out of place that it works perfectly.Don't miss this one. There's something for everyone in this film, whether it's gore, scares, comedy or love. An American Werewolf in London is a true classic.",An American Werewolf in London
141,skybrick736,American Werewolf in London (7/10),7,11 December 2016,"American Werewolf in London, undeniably the most highly praised werewolf film but is it really all that the film is cracked up to be? The film starts off really rough with atrocious dialogue between the two lead actors. It's a painful beginning ten minutes as the writing eventually gets better as more characters are introduced. David Naughton overacts a bit too much but otherwise he did a solid job in his lead role and has a good look for it. Jenny Agutter was the real star of the film, having great screen presence and bringing an authenticity to her role. Other attributes that the film did rather well was great dream sequences that were actually frightening. There are a lot of horror films that try to pull of scary dream sequences but American Werewolf definitely did it right. Also, of course, the transformation scene is top notch with perfect background music and interesting filming techniques on Naughton's arms, legs and exterminates. The werewolf's completed state is pretty believable too. There is a great ending too, albeit a tad ridiculous but there is no shown remorse to the Londoners and the city landscape was shot really well. John Landis's American Werewolf in London starts off really poor but quickly redeems itself into being a great horror film.",An American Werewolf in London
142,malkane316,QUICK REVIEWS!,9,26 May 2004,"SPOILERS!!!Time for another anti- CGI remark? Seriously, I am far from anti-CGI, I think it is completely over used though. When recreating a metallic image, or one with dark colours, or a night time setting, it is fine, as in T2. But when it is used for bright colours, as a substitute for living things, it for the most part looks fake. Watch Jason and the Argonauts, and ask what stop motion would be like with today's technology. Or even better, watch this. The transformation scene is vastly superior to any recent CGI and more importantly, it looks real. But enough of that, lets talk about the movie. Apart from having the gorgeous Jenny Agutter, we have here a mix of comedy and horror rarely seen more successfully. The opening scenes in the moors are full of tension, while the frequent appearances of the recently slaughtered Jack in increasing stages of decay are hilarious. My only problem is with the ending, but that is one of taste. Yes it's a good ending; I only wish there could have been another way <wipes tear from eye>. Each performance is effective, especially Naughton's, and while the directing may not be consistent, it is suitably chaotic enough for the movie's content. 8 OUT OF 10",An American Werewolf in London
143,charchuk,A landmark of British horror,10,8 May 2007,"When I first saw this, oh, about two and a half years ago, I really didn't like it. I hadn't seen Shaun of the Dead or other such horror-comedies, and the melding of the two genres was lost on me. I found it quite awkward: it was too funny to be scary and too scary to be funny. I appreciated the werewolf effects, but I thought the story was lame and the style didn't appeal to me at all. Oh, how maturity changes things.Suffice to say, I just watched the film again and I loved it. I laughed heartily at the dark British humour, I was in awe of the brilliant transformation scene, and I really felt for the characters. The script really is quite excellent; a perfect blend of comedy, horror, and romance - just like Shaun - that doesn't feel the need to sacrifice interesting characters for frightening scenes. It's got both of them. It does feel a little short, but that just means the pace is rapid and the film is never boring. Despite being relative unknowns, all three leads give solid performances, with Griffin Dunne especially standing out in a darkly comedic turn as a gradually decaying corpse.Speaking of the decaying corpse, the makeup effects are really the highlight of the film. Without them, there wouldn't be the exceptional transformation scene, and there wouldn't be the Best Makeup Oscar (created because of this film). Not only are the werewolf effects fantastic (even though there is a notable difference between the man turning into the werewolf and the werewolf itself) but the corpse is really quite stunning to look at. It's rather grotesque, but one has to admire the talent on display. It's especially noticeable in the scene in the porn theatre (porn theatre! how twisted is that?) with the myriad of corpses who return to haunt David. Add in the dark British humour, and the scene is perversely hilarious.It really is among the best in its genre - whether that be horror-comedies or werewolf flicks - and I'm glad that I can recognize its brilliance now. It's really quite surprising that an American director known for Animal House and The Blues Brothers could create something so innovative, so scary, and so... British. The film stands as a landmark of British horror, influencing later films like Dog Soldiers, 28 Days Later, The Descent, and, of course, Shaun of the Dead.",An American Werewolf in London
144,mwilson1976,"In which John Landis teaches us that turning into a werewolf is a very painful process, and the dead are boring to talk to!",8,25 November 2019,"John Landis directs this British-American horror comedy film that actually remembers to be funny, and packs a punch with Oscar winning special effects by Rick Baker, which includes a dazzling transformation scene that has never been bettered. David Naughton and Griffin Dunne are the two American tourists who are attacked by a werewolf after visiting a local pub called The Slaughtered Lamb in the moors of Northern England. They forget to heed the advice of the locals who include Brian Glover and Rick Mayall, who tell them to stick to the roads and stay off the moor. Jenny Agutter is Nurse Alex, the love interest, and the movie includes a lot of dream sequences that are creative and grizly. The werewolf runs amok through London's Piccadilly Circus in the films exciting climax after transforming in a porno cinema. Real life English blue movie star Linzi Drew appears in the movie playing there called See You Next Wednesday, just one of many in jokes which take place in the background to look out for. Frank Oz has a small but memorable role as an American Diplomat, and Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy even appear as themselves and are credited. The film's ironically upbeat soundtrack consists of songs which refer to the moon, and makes awesome use of Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Bad Moon Rising"" prior to the transformation scene. The rest of the score was composed and conducted by Elmer Bernstein and recorded at Olympic Studios in London. The film was followed by an inferior sequel 16 years later, An American Werewolf in Paris (1997), which featured a completely different cast and crew, and was distributed by Disney's Hollywood Pictures.",An American Werewolf in London
145,theshadow908,Classic horror/comedy,8,19 January 2006,"American Werewolf in London was one of the first horror films I ever saw, and it's really grown on me. It tells the story of two American college students backpacking through the British moores and they are attacked by a werewolf. One is killed, one survives a bite. The ghost of the dead one comes back to warn the survivor that he will become a werewolf. He doesn't believe it, but sure enough...This is a really great horror movie, and probably the best werewolf movie I've ever seen. It has the creepiest feel to it. The scene in which they are alone in the foggy moores while being stalked by an unseen monster...Classic. The really great thing about it is the mix of comedy. When the werewolf's friend returns from the dead to warn him, it's absolutely hilarious. He criticizes him and picks on him as if he were still alive. The werewolf scenes are awesome, even though you don't see much until the end. At least one more werewolf scene would have made it a bit better, because there's only two, but they're so amazingly timed, you don't notice it's only twice.The thing that really needs to be praised in this movie is the special effects. This is quite possibly the only movie I've seen before Jurassic Park that has special effects that still hold up today. The werewolf transformation scenes will blow your mind. No computers involved. All makeup, and yet they have his hands turn into paws, his face stretch out into a snout, fur grow from his skin, all right before your eyes. It's really amazing. This is truly a great horror film.

This modern day werewolf movie offers comic relief as the mauled Jack re- appears in different states of decay and a Florence Nightingale angle with sweet and beautiful girl next door Nurse Alex Price (Jenny Agutter). The dream sequences are interesting, but it all simply leads up to the special effects, the star of the show! The transformation sequence was amazing, while the shorter attacking clips less satisfying. The climax to the full moon with David waiting and pacing was brilliant of John Landis as I, too, was waiting for them to get it on! What keeps it together after all these years is the comedy between the two college kids. The dialog feels so Eurotrip real and yet it's a werewolf movie with the standard lycanthrope mythology explained as if every other werewolf movie is the training manual, and this is for real.",An American Werewolf in London
147,jonathan-577,I like it,7,27 December 2006,"Landis is no artist, and no moral philosopher. He has no sense of rhythm, no sense of structure, no grasp of character, and he imposes his car wreck fetish on every story he touches. And judging from the shower sequence I don't think this man has ever had sex. But I loved this movie when I was ten and I like it now. The horror element, the British setting, and Jenny Agutter playing it straight provide tension against his oddball juvenilia. The makeup is indeed great, though they sure are reluctant to show the damn wolf (which, as anyone who has seen Ginger Snaps can appreciate, was actually probably a very good idea). The porn movie-interruptus is hilarious, and it's fun watching Griffin Dunne rot. Lots of scenes, lines, images, are still with me from my way-distant previous view, so he's obviously doing something right. Not scary though.",An American Werewolf in London
148,buckikris,Beware Of The Moon,9,31 January 2012,"This movie is still great after 31 years, I remember seeing this the first time at the theater with my dad; and it was kinda scary for a 9 year old, LOL :D. I have the collector's edition DVD and it has a lot of extras, the making of it, an interview with make-up artist Rick Baker, outtakes, and of course interview with John Landis, plus a commentary with David Naughton and Griffin Dunne.The movie is about two friend that are backpacking in Northern England unaware of the horror that is kept a secret by the locals.The beginning of the movie; David, David Naughton and Jack, Griffin Dunne, get a ride with a sheep farmer. They are dropped off in a secluded area in England. They come across a pub called The Slaughered Lamb, and go inside. The place is strange as well as the people and unaware to them, the locals are hiding a deep secret that they want hidden. When Jack asks what the 5 star on the wall is for they flip out and give them some BS story and the two decide it's time to leave. The folks tell them to stay on the roads and keep of the moors; and most important beware of the moonlight.Well it's obvious what happens, they get attacked by a werewolf Jack gets killed and David will eventually turn into one. The story then takes place in London, England where David wakes up in the hospital. Everyone believes the two boys were attacked by a maniac, but David doesn't. He tries to explain but nobody will listen. He starts to get visits from is dead friend Jack who explains what happened to them that night and tells David the wolfs bloodline must be severed to stop the killing. He pleads for David to kill himself before he goes on the prowl and kills innocent people. David thinks he's losing his mind and tells his new found friend Nurse Price what's happening to him.The movie continues with Jack turning into a werewolf, and eventually killing without his knowledge of what he did until after he finds out by learning what happened through the newspapers, television, or word of mouth. He tries to stop his carnivorous way but fails. In the end the beast his finally killed and the bloodline is severed.The movie is great, I would recommend this film to anyone. It's not just a horror film, it's a horror film mixed with a little comedy. The only part of the film that sucks is the ending, it's tragic; but you kinda figured David's character would eventually wind up doomed one way or another.Kris L.

I was at my aunts Cottage in the middle of nowhere. It was late on a summer's evening. The cottage was a Servants Cottage, as she was Maid to a very well heeled family. After watching I had to go home, the walk home was only a few miles, no problem back then to hitch a lift. The walk from the cottage to the main road was one mile. One mile of country lane. With no streetlights, and plenty of empty fields and trees along the narrow winding ""single traffic width"" lane.Now, you are walking down a dark, quiet and a ""little too peaceful lane"", late at night, after watching An American Werewolf in London.

Working as Make up and Special Effect's Artist on movies such as Star Wars (1977), Flesh Gordon, The Ring, Batman Forever, Videodrome and the 1976 King Kong movie to name but a few. The category for Best Make-Up had only just been introduced to the Oscars, in 1981, because of An American Werewolf in London. Rick Baker was the very first to win an Oscar for this category. To date he has won six Oscars, for his work on Best Make-up and Effects. Winning, also, the 1982 Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films Saturn Award for Best Make-up for Werewolf in London, (and Star Wars (1977) in 1978 and Interview with the Vampire in 1995, to mention a couple here). The Director of Animal House, 1978, and The Blues Brothers from 1980, John Landis, has come a long way since becoming a stunt performer in Sergio Leone's 1968 masterpiece Once Upon A Time in the West, and as assistant Director on the 1970's Kelly's Hero's movie. Though not his first Horror movie to be Directed and written by Mr Landis, this being the 1973 Schlock comedy/horror movie. He took up the role as Writer for Werewolf in London as early as 1969, when he was nineteen years of age, some twelve years before the film was filmed and released. The impact of this movie at the time of its release was phenomenal. Nothing had ever been seen like this before. Being the story of two American friends, David and Jack, back packing across Europe. It is when they reach the English Moors in Yorkshire on a cold and wet afternoon, on a night of the full moon, that they find that their troubles will begin. After upsetting the locals in the Slaughtered Lamb pub, they are shown the door. ""Beware the Moon"", they are forewarned, this was to become one of the most iconic phrases in modern horror movies of all time. But it is too little too late, whilst getting lost on the Moors they are attacked by a lukanthropia. Jack dies and David wakes up in a London Hospital days later. The love interest here is done through the connection between the young and beautiful nurse Alex Price, played here by the ever quintessential English Rose Jenny Agutter. The next full moon rises, and David has other plans for the night. The Beast has awoken. What has made this movie transform itself from the mainstream werewolf movie to the Movie of Werewolf's is the fantastically frightening and completely original manner that David transmogrifies between Man and Beast. While other Werewolf movies rely on out of shot changes for example, here you are with him in the same room, to terrified to move. You are here as character witness, the fear locking your senses to the sheer terror that is unfolding before your very eyes and seeing every minuet detail, from Man to Beast. Every stage a transgression of a dangerous and terrifying ordeal. There is nowhere for you to run. Your next. As typical Landis style, humour, be it slapstick or dark is never far away. Even for Werewolf in London. David, in his Lycanthropic state devours several victims. The most famous being the businessman alone on the London Underground System. Classic horror. The point being that Jack and his poor victims come back from the dead to ask David to kill himself. Jack and his new found undead friends are now cursed to walk the Earth in limbo until he himself is dead. To break the curse. These undead are talking, walking and extremely decomposing carcases. The make up, at the time, was second to none. The attention to detail is truly (Oscar) inspiring.What is odd about this movie is that every musical soundtrack is a song that contains the word ""Moon"" in the title, for example: Blue Moon by Sam Cooke and Bad Moon Rising by The Creedence Clearwater Revival. This works very well, and brings home the ever foreboding fear and trepidation that Werewolf in London is. Here we see the late Brian Glover and a non-speaking cameo role by the then young and unknown English comic Rik Mayell, as the second chess player. Frank Oz, the Muppet master plays a tiny role here too. This werewolf movie has surpassed them all, due to the combinations of Rick Baker, John Landis and a great team of movie people working hard behind the scenes. An American Werewolf in London is an epic special effects masterpiece. If the Academy Awards have to make an entirely new Category because of Werewolf in London's merits, then that is telling us something, that perhaps Hollywood have become Animal lovers? No, they recognise talent and hard work when they see it.",An American Werewolf in London
150,jayjaycee,Be careful who you call meat loaf...,9,9 October 2019,"""An American Werewolf In London"" is a 1981 horror comedy directed by John Landis starring David Naughton and Jenny Agutter. When I was a young boy I had an irrational fear of wolves, especially werewolves. I couldn't take a look at one single picture or listen to one second of howling. Those creatures were simply terrifying to me and gave me several sleepless nights. I never thought I would be able to ever watch this film. But then, a few years ago, my father helped me to overcome my fear by slowly approaching the genre, starting with the old Universal classics, to Hammer Films and last but not least the modern horror films. Now I can watch any horror film without having severe nightmares. And this movie is one of the few films I feared the most but ended up loving. Right in the beginning the viewer can already feel in what direction this film will go, as it puts the protagonists in moody locations, thus giving us the opportunity to absorb the chilling atmosphere. From foggy moors at midnight to a completly filled Piccadilly Circus, the view is always impressive. While the plot and premise are quite simple and depict the old story of the lycanthrope curse, the execution is even more well done. It's the modern flair that makes this film so unique and enjoyable. Next to sympathic characters and an convincing on-screen chemistry between Naughton and Agutter, the film knows how to create a perfect balance between humorous dialogue and absolutely horrifying scenes of terror. It indeed manages to scare you and make you chuckle within a few minutes. Probably thanks to the interesting plot and outstanding practical effects. Admittedly, the film might have a few scenes that look like total nonsense, but now that I've already watched it multiple times, I finally understood the splendor behind it. The dream sequence for example is one of many symbolic metaphors that, if you get them, give the whole movie a whole new feeling, as it sublimely underlines the animalic undertone of the story. It's mostly conveyed by the fitting soundtracks as well. The acting is solid and fits with the characters, but most importantly, besides all jokes, the film doesn't forget the dramatic aspect of the whole curse: After all it's still about a likeable young man who's burdened with something he can't kill off, who wants to live a healthy romance with someone he deeply loves, but halfway through the movie you know that the only way for his redemption is his dead. This watch was actually the first time I felt how tragic and sad his killing in the end actually is. All in all, this horror gem delivers a packing genre mix that ranges from comedy to drama, with outstanding effects by the legend Rick Baker, virtuos camera work and a genius screenplay that offers more than you can get in a first time watch. An 80s classic that never will fail to entertain me and definitely is one of my favourites!",An American Werewolf in London
151,culwin,Oog,9,20 November 1998,"Another Landis masterpiece.  This director is most noted for his comedy films, and Comedy Central plays the heck out of this movie, but there's not much comedy involved.  Really, to get the full effect of this movie, you need to watch the un-edited version, in the dark, preferably on a full moon! Along with such movies as the Shining and Psycho, this movie is among the few elite in the horror-movie genre.One of the best aspects of this movie is the realistic cinematography and dialogue.  You feel as if the characters are real, and really in England, not some cheesy movie lot.  The only bad thing about the movie is the sometimes cheesy effects - Unlike others I do not think the transformation scenes are at all realistic.  But then, it was 1981.Future movies (including those by Lycanthrope Films) should look to this film as the model to try to live up to.",An American Werewolf in London

Well I apparently didn't like the movie then and I decidedly still don't like it now.The achievement of Werewolf, it seems, from reading various comments on IMDb, is in its makeup, and yes, after so many years, the scenes in which man becomes werewolf are still remarkable for their smooth and realistic transformations and into a werewolf that looks... well, like a ""real"" werewolf. But, as with Citizen Kane, movies known for their landmark technical achievements or how they brought what to movies yet to come, doesn't exactly move this layman moviegoer.Still, all that would be irrelevant if Werewolf were a good movie. But it's not. It borders on both camp and humor but doesn't quite reach either, and as a horror, I certainly wasn't horrified at any point, though, admittedly, I might've zoned out later in the movie.

153,mnpollio,Uneasy mixture of comedy and horror still has its moments,7,30 January 2012,"Americans David Naughton and Griffin Dunne are backpacking across England. While resting at a pub, the bizarre locals caution them about looking at the full moon and getting lost in the woods. Naturally, that is just what happens when a beast attacks, leaving Dunne dead and Naughton barely surviving. While Naughton recuperates and starts a relationship with his kindly nurse Jenny Agutter, he is plagued by vivid nightmares and ultimately comes to the realization that he has been turned into a werewolf.After a drought, 1981 brought us the one-two werewolf punch of first The Howling and then later An American Werewolf in London. The ""in"" thing is to dismiss the success of the former, while overstating the success of the latter. For my money, I prefer The Howling, which had some fun and inventive ideas on moving a werewolf film into modern times. By contrast, AWIL for all of its flourishes, comes across as a fairly generic werewolf film. We have the tormented, likable hero hurtling headlong towards his doom in England. The gory hallucination sequences often seem shoe-horned into the mix for shock value and the comedy itself is rather hit or miss. Having Naughton's undead friend and subsequent victims hound him into committing suicide is novel, but the fact that director John Landis feels compelled to have this happen at a porn theater and have the on screen sex interspersed with the dialog seems more than a tad silly and obnoxious.Additionally, the relationship between Naughton and Agutter seems predictable and ill-developed. She never has much of a role in the action and seems more of a plot contrivance. She is included merely because there has to be ""the girl"" who may potentially be terrorized by the werewolf and also because Naughton needs to have a reason to hang around London rather than returning home.The film does have things to recommend it. Although The Howling broke the ground first with amazing werewolf transformation scenes, Rick Baker's transformation effects here are equally impressive. Some of the attack scenes are well-choreographed.Casting-wise, the denizens of the pub seem to have been imported from Central Casting for oddballs. Agutter acquits herself nicely in an under-developed role. Dunne is amusing as the undead friend, who pops up throughout the film. Interestingly, Naughton is very winning and sexy in the central role and seems a good sport in regard to some of the more arduous tasks thrown his way. We sympathize with his predicament and want him to come out on top, even after seeing the devastation his transformations leave in their wake. Naughton is adept at navigating the serious moments as well as the more comical passages. The extended sequence after his first transformation where he awakens stark naked at the zoo and must find his way home is memorable not only for its off-beat humor, but for Naughton's willingness to play it for laughs and provide some welcome full frontal male nudity that is quite stimulating. I hear they may remake this film and one can be certain that whoever gets cast in the male lead now will not be remotely this forthcoming with the nudity.Landis seems to have some problems marrying the comedy with the horror, and his uneven direction is particularly notable in the abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion. It almost feels as though the plug came out of the projector rather than a real ending. In the end, while I feel The Howling is an all-around better film, this werewolf certainly has enough going for it to merit attention.",An American Werewolf in London
154,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Best werewolf horror Moves ever!,7,17 June 2008,"Remember back in the early 1980s when special-effects makeup artists were tripping over themselves to create the next big effect? The Howling boasted a fantastic werewolf transformation scene courtesy of makeup wizard Rob Bottin. Then along came Bottin's mentor, Rick Baker, with his own spectacular effects in this popular horror comedy directed by John Landis. An American Werewolf in London is more of a makeup showcase than a truly satisfying movie, but the film is effectively moody when David Naughton discovers that a wolf attack has turned him into a bloodthirsty lycanthrope. Jenny Agutter plays his love interest (watch out, he bites!), and who can forget Griffin Dunne as Naughton's best friend, an undead corpse who progressively rots away as the plot unfolds? All things considered, it's easy to see why An American Werewolf in London became a modern horror favorite.",An American Werewolf in London
155,rollernerd,Blue Moon,8,2 October 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Greetings from the dark...since it's the month of Hallows' Eve, might aswell watch a few spooky flicks. Tonight's movie review is An American Werewolf in London (1981) where two American friends, David and Jack, are backpacking across Europe starting with the North of England. They find themselves reach a pub located near the English Moors in Yorkshire on a cold, wet afternoon, where on this particular night there is ae full moon. The pub they find is called Slaughtered Lamb and when they upset the locals about a particular sign, they leave and start singing Santa Lucia...this is where their troubles will begin. Both are attached werewolf, one is killed, the other is mauled. The werewolf is killed but reverts to its human form and the locals are unwilling to acknowledge its existence. The surviving mate begins to have nightmares of hunting on four feet at first and nightmares of Werewolf Stormtroopers.The creature effects are pretty special where we see the Lycanthropic transformation scene - Man to Bear and each transformation itself just shows how great practical effects are along with smart directing in particular where we see the limbs grow and extend just looks incredibly realistic in comparison to the shiny-looking CGI we are used to these days. Big praises to be given to special effects maestro Rick Baker.The movie mixes humour and horror in a real cool way which may seem odd but you just follow it through with some light-hearted scenes in particular where old dead mate Jack returns where his is the undead, a dead fella in limbo due to being a victim of an unnatural death and we visually see the slow progression of his body; from a freshly-killed victim to decayed and decomposing mess. The humour is from the dialogue between the surviving mate and the undead mate - hilarious and the British Inspector who is has similar traits to Inspector Clouseau. A good example is when his dead friend brings David into an adult film cinema and brings along other recent victims where they all demand that he commit suicide to release them from their curse of limbo.The story is great and while we only see glimpses of the werewolf until the finale, we only see the full transformation twice. The acting is great and the banter the two mates is cool along with the subplot love interest between nurse Alex Price and David. There is a great reference to the classic Wolf Man flick starring Lon Chaney Junior and Bela Lugosi. Last but not least there is also an awesome moon-related soundtrack from the likes of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Van Morrison and multiple artists with their renditions of Blue Moon. For you movie goers - definitely worth the watch 8/10.",An American Werewolf in London
156,Thrashman88,The best modern Werewolf Movie ever!,10,22 April 2006,"AN American WEREWOLF IN London is probably the finest modern werewolf movie. It has humor, drama, horror, gore, sex, etc. It tells the tale of 2 American students on a backpacking trip through Europe. Apparently, their first stop is the UK midlands and it's here where the trouble for them begins. The movie is superbly directed by John Landis, who up until this movie, was known for his savage comedies like ANIMAL HOUSE and THE BLUES BROTHERS. It's by lumping Landis as a ""comedy"" director that many critics and IMDb users think American WEREWOLF is a combination of comedy and horror. Sure, this movie has some very funny moments, but in the way the scenes are played by the leading actors David Naughton and Griffin Dunne. They talk and act like any average twenty-something would: cursing, making fun of themselves in not so funny situations, etc. Thus someone might mistake this for a ""horror/comedy"", but in my eyes, it is not. It's got some very dark humor but mostly this is a very (as Landis would put it in a FANGORIA interview way back) ""Hard Rated R"" movie. There's plenty of violence and gore even in this day and age the movie still has some very shocking moments. The transformation scene earned this movie an Oscar and there are some people who might argue that THE HOWLING (which was released 4 months before)is slightly better. I beg to differ. THE HOWLING is also great fun but, to my eyes, it hasn't aged that well. American WEREWOLF on the other hand holds up pretty well. The DVD is truly a gem with its DTS sound mix which makes it a must for fans of this movie. Make no mistake: AN American WEREWOLF IN London is a movie for die-hard gore hounds but commercial enough to attract casual viewers. Beware of the moon!!!",An American Werewolf in London
157,Jacques98,Sadly typical.,7,17 December 2008,"Horror fans always rave about An American Werewolf In London as if it were the only film of its godly kind, alike, and, likewise, matched by nothing other movie. But don't they pretty much say that about every other movie that's even slightly better than average? It would take five pages to sit here and list every movie horror fans say is a ""masterpiece"", then I watch only to find it's downright average at best. That's the same sad story with An American Werewolf In London.After you've seen a certain about of moviesgenre makes no differenceit's impossible to look over they fact that they're all the same, with maybe a handful that really stand apart. I've personally seen hundreds, if not thousands, of films, and by this point most of them blur together because they're all, basically, the same. Characters all blur together because most of them lack any distinguishing personality whatsoever. That's why I give most of the movies I see low scores. It takes a lot for movies to stand out of the blur, and An American Werewolf In London certainly isn't one of them.From open to close, An American Werewolf In London follows the same predictable plot as every other monster film. ""I'm a werewolf, oh no! I have to kill myself, oh no! An angry mob is after me, oh no!"" Though it's arguable that this movie did have a very large impact on the werewolf films to come, and it certainly did, I just don't care. I don't write reviews on cinematic importance; that's for the pretentious clones who wouldn't have their own opinion of a movie if they were forced to. It was typical at best. Ginger Snaps, Dog Solders, and even Underworld all put this to shame and I didn't even really like any of them.Also, the effects are absolutely horrible, even for the 80s. The werewolves all look like they're made out of plastic with fur taped to their backs. I've literally seen cheap Halloween masks that are more effective and realistic than those worn by the dead in this movie. Whenever I started to get into a cool scene, these effects really killed it.With that said, I didn't give An American Werewolf In London an even lower score because it tried. Some of the moments were actually funny. The directing/writing was slightly better than average. A few of the plot points were reviled in a way that was slightly original for the genre.But none of that can save it from being just a typical monster movie and nothing more. It's forgettable. Is it worth a watch? Eh. It doesn't matter either way. Just don't believe the hype this is perfection in the horror-comedy genre, because there are much better horror-comedies out there.3/10",An American Werewolf in London

159,SamJamie,Terrifying & Funny.,8,18 August 2020,"An American Werewolf in London is a 1981 horror comedy film written and directed by John Landis. An international co-production of the United Kingdom and the United States, the film stars David Naughton, Jenny Agutter, and Griffin Dunne. The film's plot follows two American backpackers, David and Jack, who are attacked by a creature while traveling in England, causing David to question whether he will become a werewolf under the next full moon.After watching an American Werewolf in London for the first time I found the film to be a clever mixture of comedy and horror which succeeds in being both funny and scary, The film possesses an overriding eagerness to please that prevents it from becoming off-putting. It delivers a good share of scares and dark laughs. Some of the special effects are a little creaky now, but the snap of Landis's editing and the razor's-edge balance of horror and comedy are still fresh. The metamorphoses into the werewolf scenes are spectacular and the beast's rampage through Piccadilly Circus is marvellous. Splendid gory fun.

An American Werewolf in London involves a simply loveable cast of David Naughton and Jenny Agutter, alongside John Landis behind the camera. Overall, it's just a load of splendid, gory fun that manages to combine perfectly with super-clever ideas.The plot definitely lives up to being one of history's greatest werewolf features, but is a must-watch for comedy-horror audiences. John Landis can stunningly portray the painful procedure of the side-effects after being attacked by a wolf in a fantastical tale. The slow process is unquestionably quite unhurried, but is worth a good laugh and classic werewolf material.Towards the finishing, it really shifts and turns and becomes more gripping. This is mainly due to the decent amount of humour, but An American Werewolf in London will never fail to terrify.

161,happyendingrocks,"""Howling"" with laughter?",7,8 October 2009,"John Landis' werewolf odyssey certainly deserves its recognition as one of the most unique lycanthropy tales of all time, and I won't argue that its popularity is unmerited. But the film doesn't ever seem to decide what it wants to be. Is this supposed to be a horror film with comedic elements? Is this supposed to be a comedy with horror elements? Or is this actually a spoof of horror films? Whatever category American Werewolf falls into, it's certainly an enjoyable movie, but this indecisiveness makes the film frustrating at times, and edges it out of the ""classic"" category.Landis never quite figures out what the tone of his full moon follies should be, and Werewolf errs at both extremes of the line it straddles. Although there are some great humorous bits, the film isn't really funny enough to be considered a straight comedy, and the graphic violence pushes it out of the realm of light-hearted escapism. Conversely, the film isn't altogether scary either, and though there are some thrilling moments, many of the scare opportunities are played for laughs instead. As a result, the film ends up being a bit disjointed, never fully realizing the strong potential it demonstrates during its finer moments.The real star of the show here, and perhaps the reason this film has endured as it has, is Rick Baker's stunning special makeup effects. It's hard to gauge how impressed today's audiences will be by the still-inspiring full transformation scene, since modern film-makers can use CGI to create any illusion with very little effort. But Baker's work here is true magic, and those who appreciate the intricate artistry of the golden age of special effects will marvel at each step of the process. It's telling that a special make-up FX Oscar was created to honor Baker's work in this film, and he certainly deserves it for that indelible scene alone. I won't say definitively that he trumps Rob Bottin's work in the much scarier and much better The Howling, but in terms of climactic morphing scenes, the two are at least in a dead heat.However, even with these superlative effects at his disposal, Landis still can't keep this ride on an even track. Yes, Baker's werewolf make-up is spectacular, but when we see the finished product, it bears almost no resemblance to the physiology shown in the transformation scene. While we witness hands and feet stretching and distending, becoming longer and leaner, the final stage of the werewolf's gruesome metamorphosis is more akin to a common bear. The beast moves on all fours with short, stubby legs and has a squat compact body that belies any possibility of it standing upright. So, do those massive hands and feet shrink again during a part of the process we didn't see? Both the form implied during the transformation and the complete creature are impressive on their own, but they simply don't match up with each other.Another sequence seems tacked on just because Landis found some cool masks in Baker's studio. I'm still not sure why getting bit by a werewolf would cause a man to have a dream about demonoid World War II infantrymen storming his house and massacring his entire family, but this American Werewolf apparently fears this scenario so much that he has a dream WITHIN a dream about it. Yes, they are cool masks, but their usage doesn't ultimately have a real purpose in the scheme of the film.Also confusing is the notion that victims who are killed by a werewolf must remain in limbo until the werewolf itself is dead. It's commendable that Landis wanted to implement his own twists into the mythology of lycanthropy, but this idea really doesn't make a lot of sense. Getting torn to pieces by a werewolf pretty much makes you dead, not undead.I know it sounds like I'm pulling a werewolf on this film, but that's assuredly not my intention, since American Werewolf definitely has a lot of fantastic elements that elevate it above the genre's implied guidelines. Some clever usage of beloved music adds immeasurably to the amusement value of the comedic undertones, and tense scenes like the stalking of a commuter inside a subway tunnel show that Landis can definitely direct a scary scene when he sets his mind to it. The authenticity and classic horror sensibility of the Slaughtered Lamb pub, and the secrets its denizens hold, are the basis of a truly compelling mythos. Plus, the climactic crash sequence in Picadilly Circus is a decidedly gory and delicious bit of inspired mayhem.But, in the end, none of this is enough to make Werewolf a truly frightening film. And on the comedic front, it's certainly important to note that the funniest scenes in the film come courtesy of See You Next Wednesday, a movie within the movie.This is a very good little diversion, indeed. But for as much promise as it has on the surface, it doesn't ultimately deliver as much as it should. This Wolf's teeth just aren't sharp enough, and neither is the satire.",An American Werewolf in London

Some great effects done by Rick Baker involving a werewolf transformation scene that at its time of release was highly acclaimed...and deserved it. Landis also adds a wonderful score of very popular songs that all do have a connection and without giving it away see if you can figure out what that is.

167,son_of_cheese_messiah,Way too much padding,5,10 July 2014,"AAWIL is a modern day setting of a hoary old horror cliché. Man gets bitten by werewolf, becomes a werewolf himself and then goes on the rampage etc. All this is familiar stuff, done to death many times, but here we have the addition of a strain of darkly morbid comedy, represented by the regular appearances of Jack in increasing degrees of decay throughout the film. This raises the film above the average, but it does not save it from the boring musical montages (there are 3 of them!) or the frequent gimmicky nightmare sequences (too many to mention) which pad out the middle portion of the film.The film starts well on the Yorkshire Moors, with the local inhabitants of a village pub (the wonderfully named ""Slaughtered Lamb"") playing the part of ignorant and fearful villagers in films we have seen made many times. Then David is bitten and Jack is killed by the werewolf and then David wakes inexplicably in London (why? Are there no hospitals in Yorkshire?) Nurse Alex takes a liking to Jack and gives him a treatment beyond that usually available on the NHS. (It is not standard practise for English nurses to watch over patients at night or read them to sleep with stories but Americans seem to romanticise much about the NHS). There is some laboured comedy involving 2 detectives investigating the case. Then the padding nightmare scenes start. First David running naked and killing animals, then one involving his family being killed by masked Nazis(huh? what relevance does this have?) from which he awakens to see Alex being killed by another masked Nazi -but this turns out to be just another dream. This is such a cheat that I almost feel like giving it a 1 rating just for that.Things perk up with the re-appearance of Jack. Then Alex whisks David to her flat. This brings about the first montage, a love making scene to ""Moondance"". Soon we will get ""bad moon rising"" in a rather pointless montage quickly followed by ""Blue Moon"" during the actual transformation scene. This transformation is very impressive.Eventually David goes to a porno cinema to meet Jack again, who is now very decomposed. This scene, we the appearance of a host of people who David has killed, demanding he kill himself is the comedy highlight of the film.The final climax is overblown but the effect is rather ordinary.",An American Werewolf in London
168,RockPortReview,The best werewolf movie ever made!,10,8 January 2010,"An American Werewolf in London 1/6/2010Arguably the best werewolf movie ever made! In the early 1980's director John Landis was most known for his comedies like ""Animal House"" and ""The Blues Brothers"" when he decided to make a horror movie, or is it? One of the major criticisms about the movie is that it doesn't know whether it wants to be a comedy or a horror movie. While it deals with werewolves and is quite gory, there are also many scenes of pure comedy. This movie has inspired several young filmmakers since its release. Many horror comedies like 2004's ""Shaun of the Dead"" have homage's within them.This is the story of two American college students backpacking through Europe. Jack played by Griffin Dunne and David played by David Naughton. While walking through the English countryside they seek refuge from the rain at a pub called ""The Slaughtered Lamb"" The locals go silent upon their arrival, and the two are looked upon as if from another planet. This seems so typical of Americans who travel abroad, we do tend to stick out. Jack and David are a great match and totally believable as best friends in their dialogue and actions, another credit to John Landis who also wrote the script. Upon leaving the pub they are warned to stay on the road and ""beware the moon"". In the full moon lit night sky, they start to hear noises, as if being stalked by a wild animal. They've wandered off the road. Jack is then attacked and mauled to death by a werewolf, while David is merely wounded. The towns people come too their rescue and shoot the wolf, who then turns back into a human. David wakes up in a hospital to see Dr. Hirsch and Nurse Price. They tell him that the police report says they were attacked by an escaped lunatic, while David tries to convince them otherwise. David also keeps having nightmares, one in which he hunts and kills a deer with his bare hands. Believe me this scene is incredibly funny. He also dreams of a group of Nazi like creatures with Uzi's invading his house and killing his family. It gets weirder; while fully awake he is visited by the mauled body of Jack. He asks him if he can have his toast. Jack has appeared to warn him that on the next full moon he will turn into a werewolf. The only way to sever the bloodline is for David to commit suicide. Jack utters the best line in the movie when he says to David ""Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring"" It's all about how he delivers the line that makes it so funny. The film is packed with one-liners like these. Each time Jack appears, he is in a further state of decomposition. Jack visits him in the bathroom and once again urges David to kill himself. David replies ""I will not be threatened by a walking meatloaf"". Even though Jack is dead they still argue and carry on as they always have. The most famous and memorable scene is David's transformation into the werewolf. Rick Baker's effects have yet to be topped, even in the age of CGI. Baker won the Academy Award for Best Make-Up effects. The scene still holds up as one of the best ever filmed. After David's transformation we seem him go on a killing spree that he has no recollection of when he wakes up the next morning in the zoo. Since being released from the hospital he has been staying with Nurse Price. They have started quite the relationship; little does she know the dark secret that he holds.After a final conversation with Jack and his victims from the night before in a darkened porno theater, David can't be convinced to end his life and eventually turns back into the wolf. In the final scenes the wolf causes all kinds of mischief and mayhem in London's Piccadilly Circus. Several corpses and wrecked cars later, he is cornered. Faced with guns and Nurse Price professing her love for him, he is gunned down by the cops. He then transforms back into his human self. The werewolf genre is something that Hollywood has very rarely gotten right. Littered with such bombs as Cursed, Wolf, and Skin Walkers just to name a few. The British flick ""Dog Soldiers"" by director Neil Marshall is one the better films to come out in the last ten years. American Werewolf in London did spawn a crappy sequel in 1997 called ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" Often imitated and never topped ""London"" is hands down the best werewolf movie ever made!",An American Werewolf in London
169,freaky_dave,One of the best in the Werewolf Genre,8,24 February 2010,"An American Werewolf in London is a very good monster movie with special effects that were transcending at the time. The creature itself, unlike the ones in The Howling, another of the best, is a four legged monstrosity which is seen only in small parts, but those parts are shocking and outstanding. John Landis, the director of this movie, does what most good directors of horror films do, show you just enough to get your heart pumping, but never go too far. The old adage is still true, showing less is always more when dealing with horror films.The plot is simple. Two young hikers are back-packing along the moors of England where they are attacked by a beast. One is killed and the other survives, but we all know what that means. The dead friend returns in visions looking like a walking meat-loaf as the surviving friend calls him, and warns that the survivor will turn into a werewolf at the first full moon and kill people. He also tells him that he must killed himself so that this doesn't happen. Of course David (David Naughton in the one role he is best known for) the survivor of the attack, does not believe what he is hearing even though he's been having disturbing dreams. To complicate matters, he has also fallen for the nurse (Jenny Agutter) that has been taking care of him while recovering in a London hospital, which makes it even harder for him to take his own life. Sure enough he changes at the first full moon and goes about his slaughter as a monstrous beast.Like the Howling, this movie is known for being one of the best transformations from man to werewolf, and like its counterpart, I have yet to see a werewolf change that matches either, and that includes the newest Wolfman with all it's CGI. Also like the Howling, An American Werewolf has humor to go with the horror. Whereas The Howling has a few lines of comic humor, An American Werewolf has way too much, which detracts from the scariness of the movie. THis is why I have selected THe Howling as the better movie, even though both get high marks from me.The acting is good enough in American Werewolf, and the scenes on the moors of London, which include the tavern called The Slaughtered Lamb, (nice touch), and London itself, look great. Its too bad that since the early 80s, no other werewolf movie has matched these two, and that is twenty nine years. Truly a sad thing.",An American Werewolf in London

The special effects in this film are far more interesting and creative than anything in The Tomorrow War and scads of films similar to it. We've grown so accustomed to computer perfection in anything action or sci-fi related, that nothing really is ever surprising anymore. This was a fun, jaw-dropping and scary werewolf movie in 1981. Well, it's no longer jaw-dropping due to what I mentioned in the above and it's really not very scary anymore either, though it surely might be to new viewers, especially younger ones, and even I've got to say the subway scene is still tense.

If you're looking for a happy ending to this doomed little love story then keep looking because you're not gonna find it. The transformation scene is a hallmark of horror and quite a big deal. The special effects are darn good my only comment on them is that the creature looks different the second time as opposed to the first. The first time it looks like an aristocratic dog the second time it looks like a bobcat. Which is cool I guess if you like variety or inconsistency to use a better word. Another point of note is that EVERY SONG played on the soundtrack has to do with the moon. A unique twist on the werewolf genre to be sure.",An American Werewolf in London

After the incident, one of the men starts changing into An American Werewolf in London.David and Jack are two young Americans backpacking through Northern England as the first stop of their 3-month European trip. Late at night while walking off of the roads, they are attacked by what we see as a large beast which resembles a werewolf killing Jack in the process. The locals and police are convinced it was simply a madman and leave it at that. David becomes close to his nurse Alex and she invites him to stay with her at her flat while he recovers.David begins seeing his dead friend Jack who says he walks the earth because of his unnatural death caused by a werewolf. He also warns him that when the moon is full he will become a werewolf and that the only way to stop all of this is to die. The full moon does peak out and David does in fact turn into the beast, killing a few people in downtown London in very gruesome ways and in creative locations like a subway station and movie theatre. Can the beast inside of David be stopped?An American Werewolf in London delivers on all levels on entertainment. It is a very gory and scary werewolf film first and foremost, but it also provides hilarity and British humour along the way to keep it light. The human-to-beast transformation in this one remains the most realistic and well done I have seen to this day. I enjoyed the shots of downtown London, great location to have a wild animal roam the streets looking to kill. The film also made me feel for the characters involved, the ending was tough.David Naughton is a solid male lead playing the loveable David and killer werewolf. He has great on-screen chemistry with Jenny Agutter who plays Nurse Alex Price. Great performance by Griffin Dunne who plays the hilarious walking dead character Jack. The rest of the cast are fairly unknown British actors who do their parts well.A highly recommended watch. Probably my favourite werewolf movie of all time.8/10",An American Werewolf in London
175,LuboLarsson,Fantastic,9,5 September 2004,"John Landis made some fantastic movies in the late 70's and early 80's, Animal House, The Blues Brothers, Trading Places etc. He also directed Michael Jacksons classic Thriller video, but you already know that and like me I bet you wish he could make films like those now. One of his best films is An American Werewolf in London a cracking comedy horror. I love that its set in England and John Landis doesn't hollywoodise England for an American audience, it feels like an English director made this film. Great performances all round from the cast, having Jenny Agutter in the film is a huge bonus! Fantastic music and awesome special effects, some of which have yet to be bettered....yes I'm talking about that werewolve transformation scene! A classic.

177,hoernkeem,"An American Werewolf in London (1981, John Landis) Iconic yet dated horror flick from Landis. The true treat are the special effects.",5,11 February 2021,"An American Werewolf in London (1981, John Landis)
Landis is very well known for his iconic comedy films such as 'National Lampoon's Animal House', 'Trading Places' and 'Spies Like Us' that ran through the 70's & 80's. In 1981 he produced the oddball horror comedy hybrid 'An American Werewolf in London'. This film has achieved something of a cult status. This is probably the first time that I have seen it start to finish since I have been old enough to really understand anything. I have to admit that this film is, for the most part, lost on me. If it is a horror film I didn't really find it that scary. If it is a comedy film I really didn't find much of it funny.
The premise is simple; two American guys, Jack and David, are backpacking across the moors of Yorkshire, England. On a particularly cold and nasty day the stumble across a pub known as The Slaughtered Lamb. I do love that name and their sign! They are shunned and shooed out by nervous villagers who tell them to stick to the road. They quickly find themselves off the path for unknown reasons and are accosted by a wolf. It kills Jack, but David is only wounded as a villager shows up to kill it, but as it dies we see it is the corpse of a man. David is carted off to a hospital where he is subsequently visited by a very mangled, very dead Jack. The interactions between David and Jack are about the only thing really comedic in the whole movie. He tells David he is now a werewolf and will kill people and David must kill himself to avoid that eventuality. David and his nurse fall for each other. The full moon comes and David turns into the wolf. He kills some people before being shot and killed by the police, and cut to credits like really abruptly.
Despite the fact that David actually turns into the wolf I just never felt like the movie treated it with that much menace. The real triumph of the film is the makeup and effects, done by Rick Baker, and showing the transformation of David into the wolf as well as the deterioration of Jack for every time Jack visits David he decays more and more. I do seem to remember images of a decaying Jack staying with me as a kid. The whole film seems like an excuse to be able to demonstrate these effects which are quite stunning to watch.
The romance between David and the nurse is sweet, but obviously doomed. I do think they shoved just about every song they could find with moon in it into the soundtrack, hence we get three different versions of 'Blue Moon' as well as a sex scene set to 'Moondance'. I give Landis credit for that scene. It was a surprisingly well shot love scene. Not tame yet not explicit. It walked a very deft line.
At the end there is no time to think as the climactic end occurs and like a second later the credits smack you right in the face. It was just so jarringly abrupt that it left me laughing. I am sure there are some out there who love this movie and at the time I think it had elements, mainly in special effects, that were pretty revolutionary and creative at the time, but the rest of the film just doesn't hold together due to the extremely flimsy premise. There is just no meat on this story's bones. I don't think it was really bad, I just don't really know what this was trying to be so it just comes out kind of okay.

178,Condemned-Soul,"""Stay on the road. Keep clear of the moors...""",9,23 June 2020,"Scary. Funny. Gory. Brilliant. John Landis' 'An American Werewolf in London' is the quintessential werewolf film that's as much a tragedy as it is a horror.David Kessler and Jack Goodman are two American backpackers in northern England. Met with cold stares and grave warnings from locals, they are later attacked on the Yorkshire moors by a beast which kills Jack and injures David. Weeks later, David is visited by Jack's ghost, who warns him that he is now a werewolf and must kill himself before the next full moon. But this is complicated by David's romance with the nurse that cared for him...Memorable for its special make-up effects during arguably the most iconic werewolf transformation in history, this film still holds the power to terrify decades after its release. Whether it's the blood-curdling howls that announce the beast's nearby presence or the savage attacks that leave mutilated remains, this is chilling stuff.It's also enlivened by a surprising amount of humour, courtesy of lead star David Naughton's great line delivery, aswell as supporting star Griffin Dunne as David's unlucky friend now trapped in limbo and visibly deteriorating by the second. Plus, you can feel the attraction between David and Alex (Jenny Agutter) which makes the ending even more effective.Overall, 'An American Werewolf in London' is a classic of the genre that is difficult to match, and rarely beaten.9/10",An American Werewolf in London
179,tom_koopa,Beware the moon...,7,9 June 2009,"This may sound strange, but this is the first werewolf film I've seen. And I am 25 years old. Yeah I know, I'm behind on my werewolf quota.I watched an American werewolf in London last night and was highly entertained. It made a good impression on me.Two American student (I think?) friends are on vacation in England. They pass through a village where the villagers don't seem to take kindly to strangers. After a strange conversation, they head out again. Mind you, it is full moon and they pass through a foggy grassland.Not. Good.As expected, sooner or later the werewolf shows up and horribly kills one boy and mauls the second. By a miracle, the 2nd boy survives. But the horror is only beginning...The story moves at a steady pace and delivers almost everything, ranging from humor and drama to gore and partial nudity. Of course, the movie has a lot of suspense and scary scenes. In particular, the almost obligatory transformation scene caught my attention.This movie received several awards for the make-up and boy does it show! I haven't seen much films with such gorgeous make-up effects. May sound strange saying that since the make-up mainly applies on the (un)dead bodies...Sadly, the movie isn't that long, so it was over before I knew it. Still, an American werewolf in London is certainly a good werewolf film. If you haven't seen it yet, and are fan a of the hairy beast, check it out! 7 out of 10 stars.Oh yeah one last thing: what an unusual music score they picked for this movie...",An American Werewolf in London
180,C22Man,The perfect balance of horror and comedy,6,29 October 2013,"An American Werewolf in London comes from the mind of famed comedy director John Landis and is one of the finest blends of horror and comedy ever put on screen. It can be both eerily scary and gruesome as well as laugh out loud funny and nicely quirky. The special effects are now iconic, whilst the acting is subtle and the directing is excellent which help it achieve its renowned status.The story sees two American students David and Jack on a walking tour in Northern England. After leaving a strange pub the two are attacked by a werewolf who kills Jack and injures David, while the locals deny the creatures existence. David ends up in hospital and is plagued by surreal nightmares, as his nurse begins to fall for him. However the deceased Jack starts appearing to him and telling him to commit suicide to release him from the wolfs curse which David now has. The story is told in an unconventional manner that makes it standout the blend of the weird dreams and creepy images with the mystery of the story makes the film very interesting. The plot flows really well and the story itself is always twisting meaning it's difficult to know where it will end.The cast all do solid jobs. David Naughton is extremely convincing as David, playing him in an authentic way as just your everyday person who doesn't know how to react to these bizarre events. He does a great job in adding layers of vulnerability and a witty edge to the character that makes you care about him. Jenny Agutter is very good as Nurse Alex who effectively looks after David for most of the movie. She also puts in a very naturalistic turn as her stunning looks and intelligent demeanour enhance the role. Griffin Dunne is fantastic as Jack, who even in limbo comes off as rather happy-go-lucky. His comic timing is brilliant and always spot-on as he steals the scenes he is in. John Woodvine puts in a very good turn as the intelligent and determined doctor who decides to help David out. Talented character actors Brian Glover and David Schofield are great fun as two of the weary locals.The film flourishes in its smart use of both horror and comedy, as the scary moments are quite terrifying and the comedic pieces are absurdly funny. The dream sequences, which involve Nazi Werewolf's, and the actual wolf attacks themselves are really creepy. The scenes on the moors with the howl as the only sound are very eerie too and create an effective atmosphere. The comic pieces are really funny including Jack's remarks about the dead being boring and David having to escape a zoo without any clothes on. The balance between the two gives the film some great levity to go with the gruesomeness. The effects by Rick Baker are superb and still look great to this day. The transformation sequence remains iconic and the different stages of Jack's decomposing body are delightfully grisly. The songs used, which all have moon in the title, fit in perfectly and the score by Elmer Bernstein is nicely eerie. The ending can be seen as a problem, it is just so abrupt that you don't know how to feel about it. Overall Werewolf is very enjoyable with the perfect balance of horror and humour with wonderful effects.",An American Werewolf in London
181,danielharden,Does what it says on the tin,7,1 June 2016,"An American Werewolf in London is about... an American werewolf... in London. The title is a perfect reflection of what this film eventually becomes although it does take its sweet time to get there.The films story is more or less as the title describes. The first act focuses on the werewolf attack that would pass on the bloodline to David, the second act follows Davids recovery, realisation and random nightmares about World War 2 soldiers with wolf masks gunning down his entire family (error 404 relevance not found). Finally the third act shows the painful transformation, murders and the films inevitable conclusion. The film spends the majority of its run time building up to what the title promises, but once it reaches that point the film seems to take the obvious route to its final destination. Once David has transformed into the werewolf the film doesn't seem to progress much further.This is a comedy horror film and has a handful of moments that will make you smile or laugh. The porno film ""see you next Wednesday"" played in the films final act is by far the funniest moment in the film but that's just me.The films ending is abrupt. SPOILER ALERT the film literally ends when David is shot dead by police. Roll credits. This film falls under the comedy horror genre and so it was really surprising to have such a depressing ending. To be fair the ending is actually really good at drawing emotion from its audience as it takes you from sadness to ""is that it? no that can't be it."" The film has no epilogue simply finishing where the story ends, and the story ends with David.Overall an American Werewolf in London is a decent comedy horror film with a slow but interesting progression to sheer rampage and a depressing ending. The film has some light hearted moments, dark moments and wolf prosthetic's and make up that would win an Oscar. Another classic of-its-time horror film of the 1980's that is still enjoyable to watch today.",An American Werewolf in London
182,TheMovieDoctorful,A Theatrical Masterpiece,10,8 May 2020,"It's a miracle a film like this got as well respected and beloved over time, given how weird and unconventional it is. If you go back and read the original reviews, critics weren't kind to it, treating it as little more than a sloppy gimmick. If Nostalgia Critic or YMS or any of their ilk were doing their thing around the late 80s or early 90s on HBO or something, they'd likely slam the film for its bizarre nature. Nevertheless, the film has become one of the most celebrated cult Horror films of all time and for good reason. There's a sincerity and a genuineness to its eccentricities; the awkwardly honest and wooden dialogue, the uncomfortably raw performances, the intentionally and unsettlingly anachronistic musical cues, the vulgar, carnal nature of the film's sexuality and violence. An American Werewolf in London is a weird film, making up for its lack of Gothic sensibilities with an abstract nightmare tone and a big heart.The most frequent point of praise directed towards the film is in regards to its special effects and it's not hard to see why. Rick Baker practically created the market for Special FX Makeup artists with his groundbreaking work on this film. David's transformation from man-to-wolf feels outright demonic and otherworldly, his crunching and reforming skeletal structure something that his frail, lanky human body barely knows how to react too. The work on David's face as it screams and cries its way into a lupine snout is simultaneously moving and horrifying, both unprecedented in the history of werewolf films and unbeaten by the transformations of any successor. It's perhaps my personal favorite special effect on film history, boosted by some truly sickening and grotesque sound design. The gore effects aren't quite as cited, but they're equally disturbing and effective.Perhaps just as impressive, but rarely as mentioned, is the film's editing. This is easily one of the best edited films I've ever watched, within or outside the Horror genre. From the cross dissolves of David and Jack's seemingly innocent sunset stroll on the moors to the frantic, rapid choppy cutting of Jack's brutal death to the slow and nightmarish way David's werewolf attacks move, cutting off right before the animal can strike (Jack's scream of ""Its killing me!"" haunted my nightmares for a while, along with that hideous howl of the titular lycanthrope). An American Werewolf in London is a true testament to the power and terror that great post production can bring to a an already exquisitely made Horror film.The performances and dialogue are wonderfully hyperbolic and theatrical. They're full of character and subtleties that are hidden underneath the over-the-top script and direction. There is a method to John Landis' madness; the world of An American Werewolf in London is raw and awkward in a way that I think all of the best werewolf films are. There's a pathos to the werewolf story that will always demand some soaring melodrama. ""I'm torn between feeling very sorry for you and finding you very attractive"" says Nurse Alex (played by the phenomenal Jenny Agutter in one of my favorite performances in Horror history) is blunt and raw in a way that isn't common in much 80s Horror. Perhaps my favorite moment like this This is isn't just one of the best films ever made, it one of the most complete visions of an auteur ever presented.The performances feel passionate and rough in a way that so rarely gets truly appreciated. David Naughton plays his David Kessler growing more shocked and slowly consumed by the wonky and absurd nightmare that he's found himself in. His eyes are so expressive and soulful, it's a crime he hasn't done much other Horror. This is very much Jenny Agutter's show, however, and she's absolutely electrifying in the role of Nurse Alex Price. Her voice carries such a confident and strong wisdom, bringing to life a character both awkward and seductive. The revelation of her love for David in his final moments is such an authentic and heart wrenching moment from the nuanced and commanding actress.Speaking of, can we get into how interesting Nurse Price is as a character? Her sarcastically comedic side makes for an interesting substitute for the similar character of Jack Goodman after his death and I think that their similar wisecracking nature is what really attracts David to Alex to begin with.I'm almost curious if there was any subtext of jealousy Jack held to Price. Frankly, Price is certainly the more reasonable and compassionate of the two. If Jack really is real and not just a delusion, it begs so many questions that I would never be interested to ask with so many others.An American Werewolf in London is yet another testament to the unrivaled theatricality of the werewolf in monster Horror. It's an emotionally powerful and genuinely scary tribute to the absurdities of young adulthood told through the lens of your strangest nightmares.Beware the moon and stick to the moors.",An American Werewolf in London
183,joshi_3592,A fun horror movie to watch.,8,28 December 2009,"A American werewolf in London is a cult classic. It's not spectacular but it's damn good horror movie, which also offer a bunch of laughs.The name most people connect with this film is Rick Baker, the genius behind the make up effects for this film. Not only the werewolf look great, but so does the Zombie-ish ghosts, as well as the demons in the main characters dreams. It's movie with really grotesque monster, but when I say grotesque I mean it in the good way.As said earlier it's brilliant mix of humour and horror. David Naughton as David Kessler and Griffin Dunne as Jack Goodman as just great together even though it doesn't last long. Jenny Agutter as Nurse Alex Price also does a great performance. The friendship between David Kessler and Jack Goodman are believable and funny. As well is the relationship between David and Nurse Alex. SLIGHT SPOILER And the little conversations between David and ghost-Jack are just great. Rick Bakers make up on the slowly decomposing Jack is just terrific, and makes the conversations even more awkward and funny SPOILER ENDS.This is definitely horror director John Landis best or at lest most known film. much credit must go to him as well.And as every horror film I review, this is an R rated movie. The violence isn't to bad. But there's some nudity in this movie. I don't really care but I know there are many who does. So if you don't like the prospect of seeing David Naughtons crotch or having to see brief clips from a soft-porn movie that the ghost are watching in a theater, you might want to skip this film. For a very enjoyable horror film, with a bit of humour, I give this film an 8/10.",An American Werewolf in London
184,xbrad68,What if DAVID KESSLER said don't shoot me I am CIA?,10,18 June 2004,"AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON is a semenal Film with cutting edge special effects. Director JOHN LANDIS has done a fine job weaving songs like Blue Moon, Bad Moon Rising and Moondance into the film. The influence of the moon on an American Werewolfs life is given almost a spiritual aspect. Griffin Dunne as Jack Goodman does a fine job of acting. His character represents PRESIDENT JACK KENNEDY who seemed like he was out on moors without enough protection unfortunately. President Kennedys brain was preserved in alcohol so it would not have deteriorated like Griffin Dunne did as the Zombie. David Naughtons character David Kessler represents President Johnson who used so many of President Kennedys people it was almost like he was still talking to Jack Kennedy. President Johnsons downfall comes when he is blamed for too many battlefield deaths in Vietnam and he is forced not to seek another term as president. Perhaps the character of David Kessler is not really dead but has resigned from a further role in the movie. What if David Kessler had said don't shoot me I am CIA? I have great respect for both President KENNEDY and President JOHNSON.        Jenny Agutter as Nurse Alex Price does a solid job of acting and the viewer really identifies with her character. I gave AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON a 10 out of 10 for the great acting. I believe in non-violent behavior but you could still joke you were an American Werewolf in LONDON if you were overly fond of McDonalds hamburgers while in London. An Ameican Werewolf in Paris is OK.

185,piratecannon,Howl at the Moon,7,26 December 2012,"I love monster movies. I guess there's just something about the visceral thrills associated with waiting for some sort of uber-gross supernatural being to spring out of the shadows and make a bloody mess of things. When the monster/horror genre is mixed with comedy, the result—as we've seen in recent years—is often gold. Whether it's Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, or any variety of B-movie schlock, a good time is (generally) had by all.And that's the case with John Landis' 1981 film An American Werewolf in London. It's silly and punctuated by instances of extremely dark humor, and it rarely makes any attempt to work true ""emotion"" into the narrative. This, of course, is a good thing.After a somewhat slow opening, we witness two friends—who are backpacking across Europe—stumble upon a shady pub called ""The Slaughtered Lamb."" When they walk through the door, the effect is pretty much the cliché turntable-coming-to-a-screeching-halt scenario that you've seen a million times before. A room full of hard-nosed Brits eyes them suspiciously, and the boys' seemingly innocent inquiries about a pentagram that's painted on a wall doesn't help add levity to the situation. After some awkward moments, the pair is once again traversing the English countryside. It's then that a monstrous wolf-creature attacks them out of nowhere, killing one and injuring the other.The survivor is taken to a hospital in London, where he soon realizes that, when the moon is full, he'll transform into an unstoppable killing machine complete with fangs, claws, and brambles of tangled hair.Said protagonist falls for his nurse, and they embark on a brief love affair that involves little more than intimate encounters in a shower and playful banter regarding the possibility of humans becoming creatures of the night.As you'd expect, the humor is what elevates Werewolf above any offerings of similar quality. Landis strategically places appropriate moments of dry actions/line-delivery throughout the movie, and the contrast between the horrible gore inflicted by the monster and the overly ""proper"" behavior of some of London's finest citizens makes for a chuckle-worthy fish-out-of-water scenario.The problem, though, is that are far too many moments where the story— quite simply—lags. Throw the funny but much too abrupt finale into the mix, and it seems as if Landis and company have somehow avoided taking full advantage of a great premise.If you've never seen An American Werewolf in London, it is worth checking out. It has one or two moments that will likely cause you to double-over in raucous laughter, but, when compared to more recent comedy/horror fare, it seems like little more than a fleeting slice of mildly amusing nostalgia.",An American Werewolf in London

Directed by John Landis, it actually happens to be quite humorous as well as terrifying. The scene in which David first changes into the werewolf is ahead of it's time and can be understood why it was so horrifying.

A good version of the werewolf legend in which two guys backpacking in England are attacked by a werewolf. David Naughton, the actor from the 80s Dr. Pepper Commercials, plays a guy who becomes a werewolf, having to deal with the changes his body goes through. While watching the movie, I kept trying to place the nurse who befriended him. I looked it up and the actress is Jenny Agutter, who starred in the Australian film, Walkabout (1971). The movie does interject nice bits of dark humor like having his dead friend come to visit him throughout the movie. But don't be lulled into thinking it's not a classic werewolf film, as there are several gruesome scenes of werewolves attacking innocent people.

Solid movie gave a solid start.The special effects surprised me. I expected cringe and awkward design, but got none of that. The camera work was excellent, there were no cheap jump-scares and most importantly, none of the tension and atmosphere was created with cheap, typical horror music. The audiovisual execution as well as costume and set design were impressive. The story itself was believable and didn't suffer from any annoying or notable flaws. The movie was honest to its own story. The route this movie took was not by any means typical, but rather original. I loved how our main character changed from a camper to a victim and then to the actual horror itself. It all being captured from his character driven point of view.

192,thelastblogontheleft,Amazing Comedy/Horror Blend,9,9 December 2016,"I first saw this movie as, well, probably TOO young of a child. What can I say? My parents didn't baby me as far as film went. I've since re-watched it maybe three times now and it just gets better every viewing. This movie is a goddamn CLASSIC and if you haven't seen it yet, go do so RIGHT NOW (it's on Amazon Prime!). It turned 35 this year so consider it a birthday present.As soon as it started up and ""Blue Moon"" came belting out (the first of a ridiculous number of moon-centric pop songs), I felt all nostalgic and seeing David (played by David Naughton) and Jack (played by Griffin Dunne) in their matching puffy coats just drove it home.Ultimately it's just impressive how well this movie balances comedy and horror. The scary scenes can be downright terrifying — the sounds of the werewolf howling in the distance are some of the most chilling I've heard in ANY movie — and the comedy is clever and sharp. From the very first few scenes, we go from hilarious banter between the two to a truly haunting trek through the foggy British moors. It's a damn shame when Jack gets mauled by an unidentified wild beast, but thankfully we still see him later on, as witty as ever even with flaps of skin dangling from his torn open neck.You never know what emotion you're going to feel next, whether it's sharing in David's frustration over the law enforcement not believing his story or being surprised by how sexy it is to see his nurse, Alex (played by Jenny Agutter), feeding him while he gazes at her with those big brown doe eyes.The standout scene of the movie though is, by far, his transformation scene, thanks to Rick Baker. Set in a fully lit livingroom, you sit through almost 3 painfully uncomfortable minutes of his bones breaking and snapping into place, his hands and feet extending to a freakish length, and lots of sweating and body hair. Definitely one of my most vivid memories of watching the movie as a child (I'm surprised it didn't give me more nightmares), and just another example of how brilliantly the horrifying and hilarious are merged — he even manages to sneak in a joke in between pained screams, ""I didn't mean to call you meatloaf, Jack!"".Even the ending manages to be perfect. I won't spoil it for you, but it's great. Just a joy from top to bottom! Supposedly the director, John Landis's, son, Max, is slated to do a remake. That is a high bar, though, even for a blood relative of the director!",An American Werewolf in London
193,walsh-22,I've never jumped so much in a movie before,10,24 July 2007,"David and Jack are Americans who have decided to travel around the English moors. While out walking, they are attacked by a werewolf. Jack dies instantly and David is taken to a hospital in London where he recovers and meets and falls in love with Nurse Alex Price. But his dead friend begins to haunt him, telling him he has to kill himself as he is a werewolf and will kill lots of people and that Jack will walk the earth as a living corpse until David is dead. David doesn't believe his friend till he turns into a werewolf and kills. He then has to decide what he is going to do: live or die.Congratulations to John Landis for making such a scary film. It really scared the bejesus out of me and I haven't been scared for such a while.It is true what people say, the old ones are always the best and this film is no exception. I have grown tired with Hollywood churning out crappy remakes of classic horror films that were a success the first time round. I feel with the current outflow of horror films, they just follow the same predictable path and no-one gets scared because they know what to expect. I suppose it also has to do with the CGI, some of the films use it and the effects come across too slick and I don't think it is as convincing as the older films that didn't have this technology when they were making the films. Special mention should go to the special affects and makeup which were just incredible, particularly the scene when David Naughton (David Kessler) turns into a werewolf. It works so well and it is something I don't think we ever saw before in films. In past films, It would happen very quickly and the audience wouldn't see the transformation of the character into a wolf, this film showed more than hair appearing on the body and face, it showed his body changing: fingers expanding, feet getting bigger and body getting longer. It is just amazing they were able to do that scene so well, considering they had to come up with ways to manipulate the camera so the transformation would work on the screen and didn't have CGI to fall back on. The scene that is very creepy is Griffin Dunne (Jack Goodman) popping up throughout the film, each time looking more and more like he is becoming the living dead, a corpse, no longer human in appearance.I Was very annoyed when David and Alex (Jenny Agutter) started a relationship and fell in love because I was hoping there would be a get out clause where David would turn back into a human and they would be together and the film would have a happy ending. I was really rooting for this but when David was killed by the police, I cursed John Landis for introducing this relationship and then having David die. Then I realised it was a horror film and there is never a happy ending in those.Nearly missed Rik Mayall in a small part as a chess player in The Slaughtered Lamb. Surprised to see him in the role as I am used to him in TV programmes where he is larger than life and not as understated as he is in the film.On the whole, a film that had me jumping out of my skin a lot and a story that was unpredictable which made me enjoy it more than the remakes that just make me feel bored.",An American Werewolf in London

195,Snake-666,Horror-comedy perfection!,8,1 September 2003,"John Landis directs this exceptional addition to the werewolf sub-genre featuring a beautiful soundtrack, some of the best comedy in any movie and a solid story. David Kessler (David Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Griffin Dunne) are American college students on vacation and wandering the English moors. On their travels they happen upon a quaint English pub with some rather unusual patrons. Unfortunately the pair seems to offend the pub regulars by enquiring about a pentagram painted onto the walls and decide that it is best to leave. Before their departure they are warned about walking on the moors at night and are told to stick to the roads. Irreverent of such advice the pair soon find themselves walking on the moors and suffer a horrendous attack in which Jack loses his life. David wakes up a few weeks later in a London hospital and is disturbed when he starts to see his dead friend who informs him that unless David commits suicide he will become a werewolf on the next full moon.From the enchanting opening scenes of the English moors accompanied beautifully by the elegant song Blue Moon' to the tragic final moments An American Werewolf in London' is one of the finest examples of horror comedy in the last thirty years. The special effects genius of Rick Baker, who created one of the most convincing werewolf transformations in film history, justifiably is what this movie is mainly remembered for but it unfortunately leaves the other equally impressive aspects of this amazing movie neglected. The sharp and strong screenplay also written by director John Landis is full of witty jokes and clever dialogue. Landis also directs this movie competently and creates an undeniably comic atmosphere yet intermingled with some shocking horror sequences. In fact the nightmare sequences that feature early on in the movie are possibly the most effectively dark and disturbing horror scenes of the 1980's!On top of the impressive screenplay and direction we are treated to some of the better acting that any horror has to offer. David Naughton plays his role so well that it is impossible not to feel sympathy for him throughout the movie and especially towards the end. Jenny Agutter in the role of Nurse Alex Price also offers an inspired performance and one feels for her during the dying moments of the movie. No comments about An American Werewolf in London' would be complete without commenting on the hilarious performance by Griffin Dunne whose occasional appearances as a zombie in various states of decomposition offer some of the most amusing scenes in any horror movie including a truly side-splitting sequence in a theatre where Griffin's character, along with other zombies, discuss the best ways to commit suicide  it has to be seen to be believed! Full marks must once again go to Rick Baker for his talented make-up work which created some grotesquely brilliant decomposing zombies.Like with most movies there are some flaws such as David being sent to hospital in London after his accident took place in Yorkshire and occasionally the film drags a little (and I do mean a little) but overall these can be ignored as An American Werewolf in London' is a highly entertaining addition to the horror genre and a must-see for all horror fans. Although the exceptional make-up effects and the marvellously created werewolf transformation undeniably stand out this movie has far more to offer. Packed full of witty one liners and gory horror scenes An American Werewolf in London' stands out as one of the greatest horror movies of the 1980's and maybe even one of the finest horror/comedy films in history! My rating for An American Werewolf In London'  8.5/10",An American Werewolf in London
196,tmpj,"Bela, Claude, and Lon did it better...an un-necessary revisitation",5,3 April 2010,"This is a pointless remake of a classic film...made not to shock or scare...because it really does not do either ( if it does..it does so minimally), but for pure entertainment value. It was one of those films made when Hollywood was suffering from its malaise, not to be revived until Spielberg came through with ""Raiders"" and ""E.T"", etc. This film, in retrospect, was part of that malaise. I recall having seen it during its original theatrical release...I did not particularly care for it then, nor do I care much for it now, having seen it again recently. It simply has too many flaws, and was made in what I can only mercifully call the 'Hollywood assembly-line' fashion. It is not especially well worked out or thought out, though the make up and technology have improved tremendously since the days of Boris and Bela and Lon, Jr. In the older films, the high dramatic quality and atmospheric terror compensated for the tech short-comings. In modern times, it seems to be the other way around. We have technology up the rear-end, and we fall miserably short on the quality of the scripts and the acting and, sometimes, with the directing. This film failed to find the middle-ground, if such terror-terra exists. Filthy language, nudity, and straight-up indecency also rob the audience of any claim of morality or moral tone to the movie ( and I am NOT one of these fundamentalist Bible-thumpers...but let's face it...there was a moral under-pinning to films of the 30s, 40s,and 50s, and I think it was a good thing...it made us think and feel...and we were not de-sensitized by any of those films as we are by to-day's gory celluloid !)or of our humane bent. There...I have had my say. The film has acquired 'cult-status',and so be it. But the subject matter had been better stated some 40 years earlier, and John Landis and crew had little if anything to add to it that was of substance. In some instances it is better to ""leave well enough alone""...that is, unless you have the skills and the craftsmanship to improve upon it, which clearly was not the case in this instance.",An American Werewolf in London
197,RomanJamesHoffman,A horror tour-de-force that captures the poignant heart of the Wolf Man,8,26 July 2014,"In cinematic terms, The Wolf Man has always found himself playing second fiddle to the Vampire. This is strange considering that they are both essentially carnivorous nocturnal shape-shifters (resulting in them being considered as identical in some cultures) that share a certain perennial fascination in folklore from all over the world. Perhaps this is because, despite their dead-ness, we (sub)consciously idolise vampires for their immortality and suave aristocratic eroticism. In contrast, the curse of the werewolf, even though still technically living seems far worse as he is caught between life and death and also lacks any kind of control, or even awareness, of the savage acts he is impelled to commit. It is this underlying sense of tragedy, over and above the horror and the superb black-comedy, which makes 'An American Werewolf in London' such a great film.The film begins with two young American backpackers, David Kessler (David Naughton) and his good friend Jack (Griffin Dunne), on a tour of the North of England amid the rainy and desolate Northern moors. Not one for subtle foreshadowing, director John Landis has the fate of the two men broadcast from the outset as they arrive hitching a lift in the back of a van carrying sheep and, in search of food, they stumble into a pub named ""The Slaughtered Lamb"". The locals are inhospitable Hammer horror clichés and soon our unfortunate friends are wandering the moors when they are attacked by a monster which kills Jack and imparts a far more terrible fate to David.From there, the plot is quite straight-forward: David is transferred to a London hospital (presumably there are no hospitals anywhere else) where he meets, and falls for, the charming nurse Alex (Jenny Agutter) who, inexplicably, takes in the injured young American. From there he learns of his curse from an old friend through some exchanges of dialogue which are funny one minute and deathly serious the next before the (justly) famous transformation scene which trod new ground for movie make-up and special effects in being so protracted and gruelling. Finally, David ends up wreaking havoc in Central London. Told like that, the plot is actually very thin, but the film is far more than the sum of its parts as everything (horror and humour) serves to humanise David as he struggles to understand what has befallen him adding a heart-breaking poignancy to the sudden conclusion.However, herein lies the only possible criticism I could make of the film; that is, that most opinions I've heard or read focus on the transformation scene or the comedy and overlook the real heart of what makes the film great. Maybe this is something to do with the temperament of Landis who (like Joe Dante, who would release 'The Howling' the same year) brings a certain post-modern tinge to proceedings. The positives of this are the films ability to straddle genres, its use of music, its self-consciously applied horror / comedy tropes (horror: the Moors, the pub full of locals; comedy: the police duo) and the references to horror classics (Hammer Horror's 'Curse of the Wolf Man' (1961) and the 1941 Universal classic 'The Wolf Man' are referenced in the film while the title harks back to the first cinematic foray of the Wolf Man with Universal's 'The Werewolf of London' (1935)). However, the downside is that it creates a distance from the character and the tragedy which really does carry a punch.However, I would be lying to say if the movie revealed all of its layers to me on first viewingand here is the key, it is a film which rewards repeat viewing and still feels as fresh today as it must have felt back in the day.",An American Werewolf in London
198,levybob,No no no no no .....,2,18 June 2020,"Oh this is so very bad.It might have been OK in 1981 (though in fact it wasn't good then, and I ought to know as in 1981 I was already a 38 year old movie-goer), but it's a stinkeroo today.A lot of people believe the film is both horror and comedy. I, for one, believe the comedy to be ... unintentional.The early scenes on the British moors lead the viewer to believe it's a typical horror film. But once the moors are left, so is the film's direction. It weaves this way then that, the viewer never sure what's going on, who's really dead, who to root for, and on and on.Griffin Dunn (the wolf's first victim) is, as always, fine I(the first 'star' is for him). David Naughton as the eventual werewolf; not fine at all. Jenny Augutter as Nurse Price; lovely to look at (the second star because of her).The rest of the film, none.

199,terrible2,1981: The year of the werewolf,10,7 December 2005,"I love werewolf movies, even the stupid one's with the exception of any ""Howling"" sequels. 1981 was the turning point for our hairy hero's, gone were the Elvis chop wearing dudes with terrible under-bites, and in were the really scary ""werewolves"" that walked on all fours and ripped their pray to pieces. An American Werewolf In London is one of two films released that year, that showed us what a little latex and a lot of imagination (and bladders) can do. John Landis, fresh off the heals of ""The Blues Brothers"" gives us a masterpiece of modern horror, and leaves us thinking ""Are there two John Landis'?"" The movie is brilliantly shot in terrifying fashion, yet Landis manages to throw us some off beat humor, so we don't soil ourselves to bad. Set in England (obviously), we follow two buddies as they hitchhike across Europe. David Kessler (David Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Griffin Dunne) have not a care in the world until they end up on ""The Moors""... At night... With a full moon... Okay this is getting redundant, but I bet you get where I'm going (if not: refer to title). If you ever do find yourself in merry Ole' England, at night etc, etc, etc. Stay clear of a place called ""The Slaughtered Lamb"", in fact, just stay on sheep truck until sunlight comes around. Besides (the first) Howling, American Werewolf is the best werewolf flick out there, and holds up nicely to today's cheesy horror flops. Take warning though, if you are going to rent this film, make sure cover says: ""London"", not ""Paris"", which is a little more like... Benji in Paris.",An American Werewolf in London

201,Wilbur-10,Groundbreaking transformation effects put all previous movie werewolves firmly in the dog house.,7,14 August 2000,"This is a rather offbeat horror/comedy which is mainly remembered for the painfully realistic transformation scenes ( feel those bones distort ), and the resulting werewolf which really looks like its ready to dish out some serious damage - the scene in Piccadilly Circus when the beast goes on a slaughter rampage is great stuff. The problem is that I'm not sure if the humour and the love interest with Jenny Agutter add anything, or if it would have worked better as a straight horror. The film is undeniably fun and the pace never slackens throughout, but the fact that it is still the effects which everyone remembers suggests that without them the film would have quickly been forgotten. Enjoyable but maybe too lightweight - the slightly gimmicky ending does work though and overall the film is well above average.Look for British TV comedy star Rik Mayall as one of the customers in 'The Slaughtered Lamb'.",An American Werewolf in London
202,Teknofobe70,The best werewolf movie ever made.,9,6 April 2005,"It's always tricky trying to write a review of a great movie that you've loved for years. Attempting to finally put down in words exactly what makes it so great seems almost impossible ... but I'll give it a shot anyway. Ladies and Gentlemen, I give to you, An American Werewolf in London -- Two American's arrive by truck in the Yorkshire moors, as part of a three-month tour of Europe. As they walk along the country roads, they engage in realistic back-and-forth banter and we learn that Jack is unhappy with the situation and would much rather be in some continental city, whereas his friend David is glad to explore the English countryside. As the sun goes down, they take refuge inside a pub called ""the Slaughtered Lamb"", to escape the cold. The locals are unfriendly, especially when they ask about a pentagram painted on the wall ... the two of them eventually take the hint, and leave to continue walking through the moors.Wandering off the road into the dark grassy land, they begin to hear strange and frightening howling noises, and see something big stalking them in the shadows ... suddenly Jack is attacked, and David flees the scene before turning back to help his friend, but he too is set upon by some kind of wolf-beast until the locals show up armed with shotguns. He wakes up in a hospital, and learns that his friend Jack is dead. While there, he falls in love with a beautiful young nurse. As he recovers from his trauma, he has peculiar dreams about monsters, misty woods, and killing. Then he starts having gruesome visions of his dead friend, who warns him that he is becoming a werewolf ...There are so many memorable sequences in this movie it's unbelievable. My favourite has always been the initial werewolf attack on the moors -- I first saw the movie when I was very young and that was the one that scared me most of all. I also remembered the dream sequences particularly well, and that poor man who is stalked by the werewolf in the London underground. It's an incredibly surreal movie, especially during the excellent hospital sequences, because, well, becoming a werewolf would be a pretty surreal thing to go through! All of this is helped by the high quality of directing from John Landis, and Rick Baker's infamously brilliant make-up inventions.The soundtrack is also excellent -- Landis' idea was that he would only use songs with the word 'moon' in the title. Since then the songs ""Bad Moon Rising"" and ""Blue Moon"" are automatically linked with this movie by anyone who's seen it. The cast is also very notable, and both David Naughton and Griffin Dunne give funny, competent performances as the two Americans, while the all-star British cast is headed by the brilliant Brian Glover, Jenny Agutter and John Woodvine.Some of the comedy may be a little cheesy, but most of it is still worth a few laughs. You should bear in mind that this was the first real horror comedy ever made, and these days they're a dime-a-dozen. If it hadn't been for American Werewolf, the genre would certainly not have been the same. This is an indisputable classic of the horror genre, and an incredible important movie. Two decades on, it's easily still deserving of it's title as the greatest Werewolf movie of all time.",An American Werewolf in London

205,Mister-Creeper,Still One Of The Greatest Werewolf Films Out There,9,20 August 2007,"An American Werewolf In London is still one of the greatest films about a lycanthrope ever made. It never fails to entertain us with its black humor as well as scare us when needed. It spawned a semi-remake in 1997 titled 'An American Werewolf In Paris,' which was/is a great effort, but still falls short of the film at hand.One of my favorite scenes near the beginning of the film, is when the two backpacking Americans, David and Jack, enter a little pub called ""The Slaughtered Lamb."" That name alone screams, ""STAY AWAY!"" ...but as we know, they enter regardless and the locals inside don't seem much like the friendly type. Anyways, after short conversation, they are warned not to stray from the beaten path (which, for those of us who have seen this film, we know what comes next).Packed with the dark humor and scares, the special effects for this film are also top-notch for back in the day. The werewolf transformation is right up there with 'The Howling.' If you've only seen the ""Remake In Paris,"" and enjoyed it, then you have to seek this film out and watch it. Even if you haven't seen the ""Remake In Paris,"" you still need to watch this film. EVEN if you HAVE seen this film, go back and watch it again for old times sake! Highly entertaining. Highly recommended. ...and highly worth your time, if not for anything other than the dark humor! 9 out of 10! A classic horror film for the werewolf in us all!",An American Werewolf in London

207,sampleman411-1,One Way Ticket to Nowhere,9,30 April 2002,"This horror tale plays like the supernatural version of ""Breaking Away"" and ""American Graffiti"" in which the young male character goes through painful Rites of Passage.  Except in AW the man changes into an actual man-eating beast... and there is no bicycle (or vintage car) race. 
Is this movie horror, a comedy... or a little of both?  Director Landis says it is definitely ""horror.""  So let's press on...  AW is also about culture shock, post-pubescence, raging male-hormones, nihilism, & traditional and historical apathy (two vacationing American student friends are only discovering 'new ways' and new young women to lay in Europe).David (David Naughton) is the visiting Yank who, when bitten one evening by a large and savage beast on the English moors, is doomed to become one himself every full turn of the moon.The cathartic (i.e. orgasmic) last scenes in this movie (The Piccadilly Circus and The Alley sequence) are excellently played out, but the viewer might get the impression that everything here was a rush job, with no serious consideration for responsibly explaining anything previously seen or set up, plot-wise.Regarding nostalgia for the '50s and '60s, directors George Lucas and Steven Spielberg never dared to go this far, gore-wise, and for this, Landis is to be commended.  Add to this the fact that the AW soundtrack is predominantly different versions of 'Blue Moon.'  Rick Baker won the first Academy Award here for special-effects makeup (You won't dare use the The Tube when touring London).

They are dropped off in a remote village in Yorkshire and enter a public house called the Slaughtered Lamb, with a picture of a huge, blood-drooling wolf on the board. You know from that exact moment things aren't going to be pleasant. After entering they a received with contempt by the group of exclusive villagers. Outsiders being considered rather unwelcome, and for good reason, after a small sit down inside they leave, with strict warning from the villagers: ""Stay clear of the moors. And beware the moon."" They leave. It is pitch black, and the moon is full. Unaware of where they are going, they trek out, rather stupidly onto open fields. Soon enough they're on the moors, and all around a perilous howl is heard, echoing from all directions. It is even heard back at the public house, the villagers terrified and guilty. Knowing they just sent the young men to their doom. Next comes the carnage as after a tense session of stalking the wolf finally strikes. Killing one of the lads (Jack, played by Griffin Dunne) and almost killing David (David Naughton) if not for the villagers turning up to blast the beast away with a heavy gun. --- Injured, David awakes in hospital. In London. The story given by villagers being that an escaped mental patient tried to kill them. David knows better. --- He recuperates some. He's visited by Jack's decaying corpse who is stuck in limbo. The werewolf's curse must be broken, the remaining part of it's bloodline must die.

214,eytand94,The Best Horror Comedy Ever!,10,13 September 2009,"After such infamous comedies as ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" and ""The Kentucky-Fried Movie,"" who would have thought that John Landis would do a movie like ""An American Werewolf In London?"" I would never have known about John Landis's love for horror movies. This movie came as a gigantic surprise. This is what a horror-comedy should be.Two backpackers, David and his roommate Jack, are walking along the moors of London when Jack is slaughtered by some kind of rabid animal. While Jack is dead, David gets off easy, only horribly bitten by the animal. Waking up in a hospital, David tries desperately to explain what attacked him. It could've been a giant dog. But then, David gets visits from Jack, his body disintegrating into a skeleton. Jack tells David repeatedly that he was bitten by a werewolf, and before a full moon approaches, he'd better kill himself. David doesn't believe Jack, until he really does turn into a werewolf, stalking the town.The origin for ""American Werewolf"" is very interesting. Like David and Jack, John Landis was on the moors of London, when he saw a few gypsies burying a body feet first. The reason they buried the body feet first was so he couldn't get up and cause trouble. ""Well, what if he did get up?"" Landis said.Landis does an awesome job of blending horror with gut-busting comedy, especially with scenes such as the porno theater and the nude transformation scene. He also offers some horror movie references, such as the original werewolf movie, ""The Wolf Man."" But the real star of the movie is Rick Baker's amazing makeup effects. They are very believable and they look so real. They didn't give Baker an Oscar for nothing.The cast is very good, including David Noughton as David, Girffin Dunne as Jack and Jenny Agutter as Alex, David's love interest.John Landis really is a master of horror. ""An American Werewolf In London"" shows how a horror-comedy should be done: with a black sense of humor, fantastic effects, plenty of nudity and very fun horror.",An American Werewolf in London
215,alanrayford,Everything a horror movie should be,9,10 January 2010,"""An American Werewolf in London"" is probably the scariest damn movie I've ever seenperiod. When I saw it on the big screen, I was only five. This film terrified the crap out of me then and still holds up. Without a doubt, it is my favorite horror filmEVER. It works on the visceral, cringe inducing level (the death of Jack Goodman is harrowing). It delivers on the disturbing, psychological level (Kessler's dreams are truly unnerving). A man survives a werewolf attack, becomes a werewolf himself, innocents are shredded, and a new cinematic benchmark was reached. As such, there really isn't much I can say about this horror masterpiece. But here goes.The acting, writing, and FX are superlative. Made in an era when horror flicks still got respect, everything was top notch. John Landis' script moved along briskly, knowing how to balance bloodcurdling violence with truly disturbing imagery and some minor comedy. David Naughton, Griffin Dunne, and Jenny Agutter put their backs into their performances, like good actors are supposed to. The romance between David Kessler and Nurse Price; the friendship between David and Jack Goodman; and Kessler's deteriorating sanity in the face of his dread predicament all felt eerily legitimate. As for the FX, the transformation scene is brutal. And, the werewolf ripped into people with more bloodlust and ferocity than any ordinary, big honking wolf could ever muster.Now there is a remake in the works. Despite how much, as a fan, I may not want to see the original's memory soiled, this remake is probably still going to happen. So I'm not going to review ""AWIL"" so much as air what I think can make the inevitable re-envisioning worthy of the original. First, I'll address the lone error of this outstanding film.Nurse Price's flat should've been destroyed. A man goes through a tortuous, bone crunching transformation into a huge, quadruped in her living room. But when Alexandra Price returns home, she finds her flat to be relatively undisturbed. This is the only flaw in ""AWIL: that I can think of. And, it's one which has led to the argument that the film's events were all in David's head. In the remake, when Price gets home, her place should look like ground zero. There should be claw and tooth-marks on the floors, the walls, and probably the ceiling too. Her furniture should also be ripped apart, as it held her scent. It's hard to believe the creature wrought the damage it did throughout the city, yet took great care to not damage a flat's upholstery. Now, on to the new additions I'd like to see.I'd like to see more of Jack the friendly ghost. Have it where Goodman's damned, and Kessler's death has no bearing on that. No, for his soul to rest, he has to wait until his body, as it lies in the grave, basically disintegrates and frees his spirit—a process which can take months. So at first he's telling Dave to go back to the Slaughtered Lamb, where they can contain him. Of course, David doesn't listen on the first or second visit. So, for the first new appearance, Jack could appear about an hour before the change. On that occasion he's all business and switches gears, yelling at Kessler to commit suicide since there isn't enough time to get clear of London. The second new appearance by Jack could be the morning after David's first transformation. Goodman could be the reason those wolves didn't tear into Dave once he returned to human form and was vulnerable.It would also be pretty cool to see more of the werewolf in all of its brutal glory, not just the front half of its body. It should be shown how agile, fast, and powerful the beast is. After all, it did get from one end of London to the other, entirely on foot and in a matter of hours without ever being seen. I just want to see this thing moving in a way that demonstrates how, without a heavy gun on hand, there is no fighting or escape.Instead of just two nights, the beast's rampage could take place over three. That middle night could feature a bone chilling home invasion, on the outskirts of London. This would show that merely being inside does not guarantee any protection from monster and serve to boost the body-count past a paltry six. The cherry on the top could be a blood-splattered Kessler waking up to see this carnage firsthand and nearly loosing his mind over it, after throwing up a few telltale bits of gore.Another thing that would be really cool would be to see a few more subtle hints things were not well with David. Before his first transformation, we should see his ears twitching at every sound the closer night gets—just like a wolf's. His sense of smell should also be off the charts, really throwing him off. Also, because his other half eats so much, his body could be seen evacuating itself in preparation. I mean, if he hasn't had anything to eat, but is excreting solid waste three to four times an hour, something is clearly wrong.Lastly, I'd like to see more on the background of Lower East Proctor. With whom did the curse originate? Why didn't the villager's eradicate that bloodline? Was the Slaughtered Lamb really safe from the werewolf? How long had they hosted this creature? Was there anything else out there? And was it just that town, or were all the neighboring villages preyed upon? If there's to be a remake, these are the changes I'd like to see in it. And the truth is, if we fans don't state what we'd like to see, we'll likely be stuck with a waste of celluloid to make ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" feel like ""The Godfather"" in comparison. And who the hell wants that?",An American Werewolf in London

It's about these two guys who are vacationing in England and come across a werewolf and one is killed by it and the other is injured by it. The result is based on the mythology. The one killed becomes undead and the one injured becomes a werewolf. The movie is very scary and funny. It's a comedy and a horror. The special effects, especially the first transformation, are very good. It's not okay for children with the violence, terror, nudity, and sex. The ending is sad but very good. This may be one of the two best horror movies of the early 80s with The Shining. It's a very entertaining movie.",An American Werewolf in London
218,ConsistentlyFalconer,See You Next Wednesday,10,9 March 2016,"Comedy Horror films are tricky. For years, John Landis had his script for this film rejected on the grounds that it was either too scary to be funny, or too funny to be scary.They were wrong: this film really works. The scary bits are scary. The funny bits are hilarious.David Naughton's a bit wooden, but everyone else - I mean everyone - is absolutely perfect. Look out for an odd cameo by Rik Mayall, too.Rick Baker's effects were so groundbreaking at the time they created a new category at the Oscars so they could acknowledge them.It may be the perfect werewolf movie. It unashamedly deals with the pain of the transformation; the fear-stricken paralysis of the villagers; Naughton being both victim and killer at the same time; Jenny Agutter trying desperately to help her seemingly mentally-ill boyfriend There are so many great moments of both comedy and horror, miraculously contained in one film, and that's a rare thing.Verdict: See You Next Wednesday",An American Werewolf in London

As he recovers in hospital in London David Kessler is visited by his dead friend who warns him that at the next full moon he will turn into a werewolf.I did not expect much from this so I was very surprised that it was so good. It had a great mix of gore and humor that complimented each other very well. The make up and special effects were something special for the time this was made especially the impressive transformation of David into a werewolf.The penultimate scene where David is roaming Piccadilly circus is pretty amusing especially when he bites off the police commisioners head just as he has got out of his car. Glad there was no happy ending here, ie a cure was found for David and he was able to live happily ever after with the nurse (Jenny Agutter). This film is great fun, a fine accomplished piece of film making.",An American Werewolf in London
220,The_Depressed_Star_Wars_fan,The best werewolf movie of all time.,10,9 July 2010,"This is one hell of a great horror film. The effects in this movie are freaking fantastic. The best display of these special effects is in the The werewolf transformation, which is probably the best ever. The werewolf itself is pretty cool looking. I actually like how he's four legged, and boy does the face of this werewolf look angry! It's no wonder that the guy behind the special effects won an Oscar for them. Now lets talk about the acting. Needless to say it's pretty good, nothing special, but still good. The music to this movie is actually kinda interesting. All of the songs were chosen because of the fact that the word moon was in them. Like Blue moon, moon dance, and my favorite, Bad moon rising. The plot to this movie is actually pretty good. David Kessler and his friend Jack are traveling Europe when all of the sudden, they are attacked by a werewolf. Jack is killed, but David survives and is taken to a hospital in London. Later on, the Ghost of Jack visits David and tells him that he must kill himself or he will become a werewolf.

221,azcowboysingr,Very disappointing film!,3,11 December 2005,"I went to see this one with high hopes but left the theatre wishing I could get my money back. The plot was good, as was the initial transformation scene but Rick Baker should've quit halfway through that. The finished werewolf looked more like a scruffy Chow dog than a ravening werewolf, certainly NOT as good as the werewolves in The Howling, Bad Moon, or Dog Soldiers! Anyway, every Horror movie buff knows you need silver bullets to kill a werewolf. The movie had a few scary moments but they were cheapened by the director's attempts to slip in some bathroom humor and low comedy for the teenagers in the audience. the nude sex scene was pretty good although Jenny Agutter really needed to be fed some cheeseburgers...she was so skinny she looked like a Twiggy wannabe. The man who played the Dr. in London and the guys in the pub were the best actors in the whole film. Actually, the old 1950's film, The Werewolf, was much better even though it was made on a shoestring budget.",An American Werewolf in London

Everyone has a button that when pressed scares them and sticks with them but i just feel that its not been done much theses days, but this one remains a fav of mine, yes it shows its age in places but the change into werewolf is still one of the best bits of horror film ever full stop.

224,Paul-250,A Different Kind of Horror Movie,7,15 May 1999,"I generally avoid horror movies, but I found American Werewolf in London strangely compelling, partly no doubt because of the effort to give the film as much verisimilitude as possible. The result was one of the most accurate evocations of London in cinema, making the real horror of the film (seeing someone you love transformed horribly in a way you can do nothing about) almost believable. As in Claude Chabrol's thriller Le Boucher, the real horror comes from a gradual realisation of the truth and of its implications, and, somehow, the transformation scene contributes to that. Definitely a worthwhile film.",An American Werewolf in London
225,Mr Pants,Unsentimentality makes it the perfect werewolf film,10,9 January 2001,"The problem with many horror movies is they feel the need to invest a lot of time telling the audience how we're supposed to feel about the characters the killer, the location. As movies like ""Scream"" further drove home a point the rest of us already knew, we don't need the help!What makes AAWIL so perfect is its absolute refusal to go smarmy, even for laughs. It takes an unsentimental, almost clinical view of the proceedings and the audience is left to fend for itself. It reminds me a lot of a film like Kubrick ""The Shining,"" although that film was dealing with less tangible material than the age-old myth of the lycanthrope.Case in point, the first transformation scene, in which David has been sitting around all night, wondering why he isn't hungry. Then, in a split second, he's suddenly in agony, tearing at his clothes and helplessly screaming. Sure the effects are good, but i find this tonal attitude more integral to why this film works. The effects just help seal the deal.Another commentator described this movie as ""efficient"" and I wholeheartedly agree. There is not a second wasted on languid exposition or unnecessary sympathy. We just watch what happens and the result is a film both wildly funny and genuinely creepy, something that not even Kubrick was able to achieve so effortlessly.",An American Werewolf in London

227,pitsburghfuzz,"Much too scary to be funny, much too funny to be scary.",10,26 February 2010,"An American Werewolf in London is undoubtedly one of the greatest cult classics ever. It is considered by many to be a mini classic. The story begins with two Americans(well, really Canadian but whatever) name David Kessler(David Naughton) and Jack Goodman(Griffin Dunne) who are taking a trip through Europe and end up in England. They are then attacked by a werewolf, Jack is killed, but David lives through the attack. He wakes up in a hospital in London were we meet Dr. Hirsch(John Woodvine) and Nurse Alex Price(played by Jenny Agutter, our love interest. David then experiences weird nightmares that seem very realistic. We meet Jack again(in fact we meet him three times in the film) and he explains that David id a werewolf and unless the bloodline of the werewolf is severed, then all of his victims will continue to walk in eternal limbo. Without the make-up effects by Rick Baker, this movie would not have been half as effective. The werewolf transformation is the greatest in cinema history(the transformation is probably more famous the final form itself!) It won Rick Baker the well deserved first Academy Award for Best Achievement for Make-up.

It is a simple film to pass the time that has good special effects and shows the transformation of a man into a beast and a woman who seeks a man below his hair.

An American Werewolf in London is without a doubt the best Werewolf and Horror/Comedy ever made. The special effects are unsurpassed. If Werewolves were real this is exactly how they would look, instead of a human shape with a wolves head, it looks more like a massive very scary looking dog/wolf. You catch a glimpse of it on the Underground scene and then again at the very end. They couldn't have made it look more real if they tried. It has an absolute perfect balance of comedy and horror. The horror of the movie is very scary and the comedy is often hilarious without adding the mistake of slapstick (An American Werewolf in Paris). There is also a bit of a love story thrown in. I think this is and always will be my favorite horror of all time and was probably the first real horror that I saw as a child (Shown to me by my very irresponsible babysitter when I was just 7). I hear it's due for a remake, it would have to be a pretty amazing movie to surpass this one.",An American Werewolf in London
233,RElKO,"Good, but could have been GREAT!",8,25 July 2000,"There was a time when science fiction and horror movies were made with craftsmanship. In other words, people didn't program the non-existing elements in movies with computers. They made creatures, monsters and non-existing animals with their bare hands, and if they were made expertly, they were made like real living beings. Of course, there are exceptions when creatures can only be made really alive with computer animations when make-up effects and animatronics are too expensive. Jurassic Park is a great example of that. But this movie is an example of why most creatures and transformation (into creatures) are best when done with manual labor. Would Mogwai from ""Gremlins"" have been cuter and better when made with a computer? Would the very appearance of The Fly have made you want to throw up if done with computer techniques instead of with the expertise of Chris Walas? Would the transformation of the the main character in ""an American werewolf in London"" into a werewolf have been as incredible had it not been masterfully created by Rick Baker. The fact that he received an Academy Award for his skills says enough.Now about the movie: When two campers go hiking in the English countryside they are viciously attacked by a wolf-like animal. One of the campers, Jack, is torn apart as David, the other camper, runs for his life. When he decides he can't just leave his friend and returns, the damage is done and Jack is dead. Out of the dark comes the animal and bites and claws David, before being shot by locals. When David, heavily wounded, looks to the side he sees that the ""animal"" that was shot is just a man.David wakes up in the hospital, gets acquainted with a nurse, falls in love with her and is taken into her home by her. When she is on nightshift and David is at her home alone, he discovers that full moon will have a new meaning to him from that moment on.Although the humor in the film was not unpleasant at times, i can't help but feel how GREAT this film could have been had it been serious. At one point, during a transformation, David even looks into the camera. Which kind of almost spoils the whole scene for me. But the horror, the incredible make up effects (there were no special effects, everything you see on the screen really happened thanks to Rick Baker's great work), and the serious parts in the movie made this one of the greatest horrormovies of the eighties for me.",An American Werewolf in London

And the doctor that takes care of Naughton in the hospital happens to be Jewish. And the nightmare scene when the Nazi monsters with machine guns invade his parents house has symbols of Judaism. Coincidence? I think not...Although this is not the first movie (nor will it be the last) to deal with the duality thingy of human nature, I believe that Landis takes this to another level by using the Jewish guys/werewolf to explore it. For me, what Landis does here is illustrate Sartre's famous definition of the Jew: ""A Jew is like anyone else, only more so."" I believe Landis is saying here (using the Jew to represent everyman as Joyce does with Bloom) that you must redeem yourself from within. How? Because even the smart Jewish doc and the gorgeous shiksa nurse (Jenny Agutter) cannot save him. Brilliant movie.",An American Werewolf in London

But it was surely not anything like that. It was so accurate to real English life. The film also has great thrills and very funny moments. The end in Piccadilly circus is very exciting and in my view one of the greatest moments in cinema history or at least horror moments the film dose not use all the original myths -SPOILER-silver bullets wont kill it-SPOILER But keeps some of the original stuff -SPOILER-He will become a werewolf in a full moon-SPOILERThe film is smartly done rarely any mistakes very smart story and an edge of your seat thriller.

236,saeedahmedsasoli,The best werewolf movie ever.,10,25 November 2020,"The film's sense of humor is definitely because the film's director and writer, John Landis, has directed so many great comedies. If you gave the same premise to a much more serious filmmaker, they probably would have made a straight horror film, subtracting all of the brilliant laughs that Landis gives us. Of course, part of what makes ""An American Werewolf in London"" so special and so entertaining is how hilarious it is. It's almost unbelievable that a movie with so many horrific and gory moments can also be laugh out loud funny throughout.As a director, Landis approaches Hitchcock in terms of scene economy and symbolism. For example, the opening sequence set on the moors of northern England features the tragic hero David and his friend Jack climbing out of the bed of a truck laden with sheep - benign animals destined for slaughter. Biped ""sheep"" David and Jack meander to ""The Slaughtered Lamb"", a pub sheltering cowering, xenophobic locals from the monster afoot on the moors during full moon. Soon the inhospitality of the town folk compels the two lambs to leave - virtually sending them to their slaughter.This was ignored back in 1981 (audiences probably weren't ready for it) but it's now considered one of the best horror films of the 1980s and the best werewolf movie ever!

Pardon the howling.  Wow, this is one of the best werewolf movies to EVER hit the screens.  Howling was good too, but this outdoes that.  The special effects were excellent for its time peroid and is not totally bad for this time peroid also.  But thanks to monster creaters like Stan Winston they are no where near as respected as they were in those days.  The plot to this movie isn't all that original, the budget was a little below sufficient, and the acting was just good (nothing spectacular), and the suspense is just average.  So what makes this movie the best?  It's witty sense of humor for one thing.  The jokes are hilarious, whoever made the script was certainly not a corny individual, I mean if we can appreciate a joke told 20 years ago in a low budget movie that means it was a very good joke, and there is not a single joke that you don't laugh at here!  The atmosphere was stunning in the movie.  Very few movies can be as funny as this and yet be as dark at times as this.  Another strong factor was the ending, you genuinely feel sorry for the poor kid.  And instead of pressing on after the last scene it just ends in a snap.  Which leaves you stunned. There is just something about this movie all in all that is beyond the screen...  Why does a movie like this work?  I wish I could answer that, but I can only to some extent.

242,slothropgr,A compendium of missed opportunities and miscalculations,3,21 January 2006,"It's difficult to imagine that Landis actually put as much thought into this thing as he's said. Money yes, especially in make-up. But nowhere else. First the good: Jenny Agutter is gorgeous and the only believable character in the flick. The werewolf is amazing though not much of a wolf, more a cross between a lion and a piranha. The transformation is still mind-boggling, Rick Baker used every trick in the Dick Smith book as it was then written, and added a bunch of chapters of his own. The acting is good enough--Naughton is a very likable protagonist and works well with Dunne. The music is nice (can listen to Sam Cook any time) but distracting--after awhile you wonder whose version of ""Blue Moon"" will pop up next. I dreaded the arrival of ""Moon River."" Then we come to the script. Alas. Nothing in this area makes much sense. After a very suspenseful opening it all falls down, logic was not part of Landis's thought processes. The running gag with Dunne returning from the dead again and again looking more decayed each time is good, but it LACKS A PAYOFF!! He just disappears. What the film needed after the werewolf is killed (badly, see below) is Naughton and Dunne walking spectrally off into the night and a line like ""Well, this looks like the end of a beautiful friendship."" And the doctor's entire trip to the village where it all started is useless, he learns nothing we don't already know and it adds nothing to the story except length. After all the blood and murder and horror (even the contrived stuff like the whole sequence in the Tube) and an interminable and gratuitous series of car crashes (what is it with Landis and cars?), the poor ol' wolf is shot down in an alleyway like a rabid dog--and by regular bullets. Very disappointing. And then we don't even get to see him change back into Our Hero! Thereby removing any connection between Our Hero and the monster, and with it most of the scene's pathos. Hadn't Landis seen any of the other werewolf pix? ""Fright Night"" did something like it quite nicely with a very realistic wolf. And where the hell is Our Hero's family?? Frank Oz shows up as a rep of the American Embassy, but that's it. Obviously Landis wasn't interested in even that much reality. One overly pathetic phone call does it for Our Hero's entire previous life. Puh-leeze. The business with him being haunted by the ghosts of his victims is a nice touch, but again where's the logic of having his good buddy there? He was killed by the last werewolf. Oh well.

This comedy/horror hybrid is fast paced, brief and to the point, frightening, sexy (the use of Van Morrison during a most erotic sex scene is sheer genius), subversive (the Jewish in-jokes are really a Jungian buffet of imagery), and funny. Much has been written about the Rick Baker special effects and they are truly stunning and there isn't a hint of CGI to be found. The famous transformation scene is the best of the werewolf sub-genre as it is well-lit and performed with Sam Cooke's golden throat silking ""Blue Moon"" on the soundtrack.Landis also manages to celebrate the classic horror film while also gently spoofing it. A contemporary classic not to be missed. A 8 out of 10.",An American Werewolf in London
244,jamesnicholls-58600,A film full of cheese,8,16 April 2020,"This movie is a very low 8, pretty much borderline 7.9/10-8/10. I found this movie moderately entertaining but quite strange, the movie doesn't seem to know what it is, whether it's a horror movie or comedy. The first 60% of the movie it's a genuine horror film, but the last 40% it has a lot of comedy in it which is very different to other horror comedy's I've watched which tend to be comedic throughout the entire film and not have as much horror in it as this film. The effects were brilliant for it's day, the ghost scenes were good gore and still stack up well to this day. Scare wise, it's probably one of the least scariest horror films made in the last 60 years, but it has it's moments. Jenny Agutter was amazing in this movie and kept tempting me and my mates to squish her fat cheeks throughout the entire movie.The setting in Britain was very nice and accents were pleasing to the ear with great beautiful scenery of Britain's fun fertile lands in the Northern English countryside. Several scenes made me laugh and this film gives you the impression the British characters think the Americans are very strange to say the least.The characters were full of character, there wasn't a dull soulless character in the movie, the dart player wasn't a bad man but had a temper and a lot of honesty, the chess player was quite mean dishonest character with an even worse temper than the dart player, Alex was a very adventurous motherly nurse, Jack was a entertaining character who made a lot of good jokes and the main character was just hilarious and a bit cowardly to a certain extent. For a film that's not even 2 hours long it had a rich complex set of characters. I thought the ending was a bit disappointing though, the main villain at the end was killed far too easily and seemed to be under powered when it came to it versus firearms.Plot Complexity:11/20 -Slightly above average complexity
Characters: 7.5/10
Emotion (not including laughs): 6.5/10
Consistency: 10/10 - Can't think of a boring scene

246,imad_jafar,The greatest werewolf film ever!,8,17 February 2010,"For this masterpiece, director John Landis updates every werewolf cliché in the book and makes the film wholly original by adding Rick Baker's masterful special effects and his own superb sense of humour to the mix. The result is the greatest wolfman movie of all time. David Naughton and Griffin Dunne are two American college students backpacking on the English moors. They are attacked by a ferocious werewolf (which we, cleverly, only get glimpses of) and Dunne is slashed to death. Naughton survives, wakes up in a London hospital three weeks later and discovers he was bitten by the werewolf that night. Then, in a sudden shift from dark horror to gruesome comedy, Naughton is repeatedly visited by Dunne's rotting corpse, who tells him to commit suicide to stop himself from becoming a wolf on the next full moon. While the film remains wholly enjoyable throughout, the undeniable highlight remains the breathtaking transformation sequence. On the night of the full moon, Naughton becomes a flesh-eating werewolf before our very eyes. Overall, I feel that this delightful combination of horror and comedy is a frighteningly funny spectacular that is sure to remain in the horror-loving heart of any fright-flick fan.",An American Werewolf in London

AAWIL tells the tale of 2 American youths whose European adventure turns to terror after they are attacked by a werewolf. One of them is killed, but the other's fate is worth than death because whenever their is a full moon, he turns into a werewolf and terrorizes the people of London.Audio/Video: Since this review is based on the 1981 Vestron Video, I expected a lot worse than what I got. Sound is pretty good, but some scenes are really dark to see.Extras: None.

It sounds like standard monster movie fare, but John Landis manages to turn it on its head and creates a wonderful, darkly comedic flick. It's only major flaw is the lack of a memorable musical score, but this is made up for by it's excellent use of moon-themed songs (Blue Moon, Bad Moon Rising, etc.)All in all, a fantastic genre piece that has stood the test of time and has cemented itself as my all-time favourite werewolf flick.",An American Werewolf in London

An American Werewolf in London has great realistic special effects which I think even now are better then computer generated ones.Everything about this movie is excellent: John Landis's expert direction, fusing together a monstrous hybrid which veers crazily between pure comedy and absolute terror, plus, Rick Baker's Oscar winning special effects which outclass any digital trickery by today's Hollywood. By the way, Baker is the guy who is also responsible from special effects / makeups of Planet of the Apes, X-Men and Hellboy.An American Werewolf in London isn't just scary, but at times can be brutal.

254,benjaminryder-45940,Funny With Great Effects,8,27 October 2020,"John Landis crafts a memorably fun and sometimes frightening werewolf tale with An American Werewolf in London both embracing and lampooning several werewolf cliches. Imagine yourself hearing that a wild animal bite has turned you into a werewolf. How would you react?Well, you might react a lot like David (David Naughton) when his dead friend (Griffin Dunne) shows up to give him a warning that, during the next full moon, he'll turn into a werewolf and have an insatiable blood lust. Not even the love of a good nurse (Jenny Agutter) can save David and he'll have to kill himself to break the curse and save any number of people he might murder in werewolf form.This doesn't sound like much of a comedy and it's not in the traditional sense, but the horror is balanced by a welcome amount of humor that keeps things light and also has the advantage of making the horror scenes ever more horrific.

As a child, the Star Wars trilogy got me interested in film, as a teenager it was American Werewolf that cemented that interest and turned it into a passion.And there is so much here to enjoy. Landis very, very carefully tells an affecting, amusing and at times terrifying story of an American abroad, backpacking across Europe with his best friend, who gets bitten by an English werewolf. In the aftermath of this, he finds tragedy, love, and then sprouts hair and fangs and eats people. It's beautifully written, expertly performed, and features some of the best effects-work ever put on film.
Nothing about American Werewolf is wrong, or misjudged. The story unravels at exactly the right pace, and along the way it becomes the most quotable horror movie ever made. It's also one of the best, and certainly my favourite.As an adult, I have yet to see another film that gives me as much pleasure- continually- as this.

258,midnightrane,Best Morph Ever...,9,7 January 2002,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*** A fantastic horror film: part dark comedy, part suspense, part outright gore, ""An American Werewolf In London"" is a classic of the genre. Featuring what is still the best werewolf 'morph' ever captured on film (including all the newer but inferior CGIs) it succeeds in avoiding the trappings of other werewolf films: campy, cheesy or just plain bad. The score is perfect, incorporating nearly every great song about the moon. Also impressive are ferocious growls and haunting howls, along with blood-curdling sound effects during the 'morph' (how 'bout those cracking bones!). It is the story of two American boys on a Senior trip to England. The on-site scenery is perfectly eerie as they lose themselves on the country-side moors. After an attack from a 'lunatic' which kills one and leaves the other 'ill', the story begins a steady climb to climax. Although it fails as a mystery it succeeds as a tense thriller, in spite of all the catharsis. John Woodvine stands out as the skeptical yet deductive physician but Griffin Dunne steals the show as a progressively decaying, angry corpse in limbo trying desperately to convince his friend that he is a werewolf and must be destroyed in order to end his torment. Amid several excellent scenes including ""Queen Elizabeth is a man!"", awakening nude in a zoo and a tragically sad/funny/pseudo-erotic exchange in a Piccadilly Circus porno theatre, the 'waking from a dream into a dream' is classic. Sometimes surreal and often hilarious, ""Werewolf In London"" is a must-see for any horror, thriller or werewolf fan.

The thing that's even more amazing is that the film was made in 1981. 1981. Not that big of special effects. Not like the ones today. But, Rich Baker does an unbelieable job at the werewolf makeup. The scene starts out with David, reading a book, the full moon out. Then..BAM! He starts to scream bloody-murder,""It's so hot! GOd..umh..!"". He then tears up his clothes..and the magic begins. The first real part is the hand. David looks at his right hand and sees it move upward, as if it's growing taller. Then, from there, the rest is history. His feet bulk up.

Although not as shocking for its violent dream sequences as when it first attacked our screens, the film still hits home today. The key to its success being its dark humour. Sometimes this seems very out of place. For instance, a grinning ghoul remains light-hearted even when his face is rotting off, producing a genuinely creepy effect. And that's the thing. The humour used in this film is much more sophisticated than in films such as ""Fright Night"", where comedy is merely used for relief. Here, humour is used to increase our sense of discomfort. It jars so much with the violence and gore, it unsettles us, as we think ""What is this Director trying to do to us?"". It's elements like this that elevate a very scary movie to greatness. Worth watching for the transformation sequence alone, the special effects do not disappoint either. But it's the strange alternations between comedy and terror that keep you on the edge of your seat.

For a 10 year old, what's not to like?I rented this recently and realized that it hasn't aged well. Dunne's performance is still funny -- but the material isn't as funny as I remembered. Or as scary. A lot of the story is disjointed. It sets up many paths and then, boom, it's over; characters and motivations don't resolve. I do feel this film had a big impact on horror storytelling -- for instance, Buffy the Vampire Slayer seems influenced by its ironic comedy and horror mix.

273,Bailiff,A melange of genres that doesn't always mix well,7,8 November 2003,"""American Werewolf"" is a great concept: two unequivocally 80s American college kids trekking through the bowels of England's moors stumble upon a cursed lycanthrope who turns both their lives upside down.  It has a sizable spattering of dark humor, sex, outstanding transformation scenes courtesy of Rick Baker, creative death chases (watch out London commuters!) and a terrific soundtrack, especially CCR's Bad Moon Rising. There are also some weird extraneous elements that are completely unexpected (including a very memorable dream sequence); all of this helps ""AWIL"" stand out well above most other werewolf epics. Unfortunately, towards the climax it's a little hard to figure out what John Landis was really going for, because the movie ends perfunctorily and leaves the viewer unsatisfied overall; there are too many loose ends that aren't closed, and the jarring transitions between humor and gore don't always work so well.  Still, it's a worthy venture in this subgenre, easily better than passable fare like Silver Bullet but still lacking when compared to The Howling.

The effects were cutting edge at the time and I believe that only served to enhance the appeal.  David Naughten was exquisite in the lead and another thing I liked about it is that it wasn't filled with big names.  Which tends to make horror films more real in my opinion.  I mean it is easier to relate to unknowns in a fantastic setting such as this than say folkes like Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. You're not preoccupied with comparing their acting or how ridiculous they look in the part.  Less distractions more entrancement.This film is about two American friends who are attacked by a werewolf in the British countryside.  One of which is infected with lycanthropy and continues on to London where he must confront his first victim's gory ghost, deal with his transformations and all the antics it causes with virtually no idea as to what is happening while in hot pursuit of his new love interest.

At the exact same moment this movie can make you wet your pants in horror and humour. And the eerie score, as well as the great moon soundtrack that doesn't fit at all. However, that is precisely why it works so well, like at the end, when the credits roll- happy music plays right after a chilling, disturbing, powerful, and frightening scene.Overall, this is one of the best films ever made, and the best horror film made (I don't count Jaws as horror, but if I did, Jaws would be best).

So the start doesn't offer anything new; only after the attack and the subsequent trip to the hospital does the picture take a dramatic turn. 
Here is where John Landis, director of Animal House and Kentucky Fried Movie, works in the comic elements.  Landis has experience in comedy, although his record is spotty at best, he does know how to set up a joke. The hospital starts the encounters with his dead friend Jack who informs him that he is in fact a Werewolf.  This is only the first of three encounters and is the start of the running gag where you can watch his deterioration as a member of the ""undead"".  The movie goes between a good gothic horror with all the elements of any good wolfman flick and a well worked comedy using the plight of a person turning into a wolf as the core of the comic elements.  The horror scenes are done well; the transition where he turns into a wolfman the first time is really good, perhaps the best in movies.  There are plenty of jumps when he is attacking the locals and the werewolf itself is a good piece of special effects.  In summary the acting is better than average, the girl is cute and the horror scenes are good and horrible.  This is a real sit at home with your date kind of movie.  Good fun, some scary scenes and an easy story to follow so you can fool around while you watch and not miss too much.",An American Werewolf in London
281,user-11512,creative effects and ideas with a semi-serious dialouge combines great to form a modern werewolf classic,8,17 November 2006,"An American Werewolf in London takes dazzling special effects of the time being 1981 and used a semi-serious half comedic script to make this movie both charming and chilling. Fans of the werewolf horror movie genre mark a bulls eye with this motion picture. The effects all from talking deceased past victims to the incredible werewolf morphing effects during the full moon phase have and will continue to awe audiences. This film gave the perspective of the werewolf very well, weaving even better with the post perspective of its victims. The werewolf himself as a human enjoys a warm and endearing relationship with the British nurse who helped take care of his original medical problem. Overall this film packs a hint of comedy however not enough to drown out the scares and hunt scenes. Overall, there are now films that compare however if you want films that weren't atrocious of the genre (still none rise above this film)try watching: The Howling, The Wolf Man,Underworld, Cujo (I know its a dog but K-9/wolf close enough), and the sequel (although tremendously lower in quality) An American Werewolf in Paris. I rated this film and 8 because it delivered a full and complete compelling werewolf film with creative additives. If you want the suspense, comic relief, and terror of a werewolf film this is the best film to get i from and is in my opinion the current benchmark for werewolf horror films.",An American Werewolf in London

283,richard_wright,a Horror/Comedy Masterpiece,9,27 February 2003,"An American Werewolf in London is a perfect example of how to make a superb horror/comedy and for some fans 20 years later remains the definitive example of the genre (not for me though, my fave is Brain Dead.) It is a rare film that makes you laugh out loud one minute, before sending you cowering behind the settee the next, but this movie manages it with something in reserve.A couple of American Lads have a three month holiday backpacking round Europe lined up, so where do they start? You betcha, sunny olde England!! Between suffering the twin indignities of having to hitch a ride on a van full of sheep and being thrown out of a pub populated by English eccentrics, they now have to cope with the inconvenience of a werewolf attack on the Yorkshire Moors. This left one of them stuck in Limbo as a walking corpse in a slow state of deteriation and the other with the strange habit of sprouting hair and tearing people up every full moon. Can David find a solution to his affliction before it affects his relationship with sexy British nurse Alex? Can Jack have peace in death at last and stop being as David brands him ""A walking meat loaf""? And will David's family ever be able to finish off that episode of ""The Muppet Show"" without being viciously murdered by zombie Nazis? All will be revealed..The key to American Werewolf's success is twofold: Rick Baker's Oscar winning make-up and an excellent storyline.The transformation scenes are all the more amazing because they were done when computer animation was practically unheard of so everything you see is manual. They still look good now over 2 decades on, however some later shots of the animal in flight may seem slightly dated. Overall though a great job considering the era's limitations. Even more impressive though is the script that successfully juggles two different styles and turns them into a solid whole. As well as the jump-out-of-your-seat scenes and the hilarious lampooning of old horror films, it actually makes us care about the characters and hope against hope that they find someway out of their situation, also in large part due to good work by David Naughton playing the hugely sympathetic hero and Jenny Agutter as the NHS love interest. Griffin Dunn is mostly there as a comic foil, but even he has some human moments that emerge from his schick.The recent DVD release gives this classic the treatment it deserves: a much cleaner, digitally remastered picture and tons of extras, including a hilarious commentary with Naughton & Dunne, outtakes and a feature length interview with director John Landis himself. I recommend this for fans of the film, which will surely still be simultaniously making people giggle and scream in equal measure in another 20 years time.9/10",An American Werewolf in London
284,mikeisitt,Werefolf flick that continues to impress,9,27 January 2012,"In the bleak winter of Northern England, two American students travel Europe in search of fun, and women. But first take a pit stop at ""The Slaughtered Lamb"" a gritty pub with some shady characters and upcoming comedians. Upon noticing a mysterious five-point star on the wall, the pair ask about it, and are immediately forced to leave. But the community at the pub know full well that they are leading the two Americans to their dooms, for there's a full moon that night...Ignoring the warnings of the pub members, the pair stray far from the roads. In a scene with some great camera-work, the pair encounter a werewolf, one of them is mauled to death, the other is cursed to become a werewolf the very next full moon.The film makes some great use of the camera and some of the most unrelated music to entertain.I would say this is slightly more of a comedy, as the kill scenes are short and sharp, and the funny moments are quite memorable. The film also blends the two elements together for some great scenes like when David, the hapless survivor, is visited by his dead friend, with half of his face mauled off, yet he talks as if nothing has happened.The film also shows off it's technical know-how as it boasts the hands-down best transformation scene in a werewolf movie. There's no cheap stop-motion here as we see poor David shout in agony as his whole body slowly cracks and creaks into a new shape. This scene won the movie a Special Achievement Oscar in Advancement in Makeup. The makeup for David's slowly decomposing friend who persists in visiting him is also pretty good.In one of his first scripts, John Landis entertains the audience with gory horror, yet at the same time some ridiculously funny moments in a short, sharp screenplay. Strap yourself in for ninety minutes you'll almost certainly enjoy.",An American Werewolf in London
285,fairytree,The best werewolf film you will see!!!,10,3 April 2004,"First of all allow me to introduce two godfathers in film history: John Landis, writer and director and Rick Baker fx and make-up artist. With these two on board you can't go wrong. A brilliant film ,the make-up effects in the film received an award. A few years on from this film a film called Company Of Wolves was released and bragged about the fx being much better than American Werewolf in London, big mistake there was no comparison between the two. On the American Werewolf in London film crew you had Rick Baker who had also produced the make up for the Exorcist and other horror titles - enough said. My favourite scenes in the film is when they enter a small village pub in Wales some where, the werewolf transformation and the classic underground tube station scene, these always somehow pop into my head whenever i use the tube in London.",An American Werewolf in London
286,stevenlshoup,Some Nice Cuts of Meat but NOT USDA Prime,4,4 February 2006,"An American Werewolf in London starts out with real promise, but soon after the tragic attack on the moors, this picture dims out and only occasionally brightens.David Kessler and Jack Goodman are tagged as goners from the moment we first see them (lambs to the slaughter) and there are intermittent scenes that either start to ""rev up"" the suspense and mystery or outright take us for a thrill ride, but in the end John Landis wastes a lot of time on scenes that would have been better replaced with dawning discovery of what is going on and the need to stop it, or unraveling the sinister web of fear in East Proctor where the tragedy began. Instead, he fills the movie with tableau after tableau of David's escalating nightmares; gratuitous shower sex scenes; and far too much time in David's ""after feast"" scramble to get back home, when that screen time would have been better served on Dr. Hirsch's suspicions or breaking the silence at The Slaughtered Lamb.Griffin Dunn's scenes as the progressively ""ageing"" Jack are as hilarious as they are morbid, but when it comes to speaking simple dramatic truths for the plot ( ""You will change."" ""Kill yourself before you kill others."")Dunn loses his sense of drama and the lines are painful to hear.Jenny Agutter is wonderful, Frank Oz is wasted and his scene unneeded as are the scenes between Agutter and the convalescing child who can only say ""No!"" All of the scenes I've pointed out so far stop the story dead in it's tracks. Once again we are amateurishly introduced to Scotland Yards answer to Beavis and Butthead -- when are British bobbies going to start taking offense at this stuff? -- in scenes that need severe rewrites, They just don't work and the story slams into neutral.Yes, there are moments of of truly fine craft: pets instinctively snarling at the normal David (they know what he is); the corpse conference in the porno house; The overwhelming sense of melancholy captured within the film; David's touching long distance phone call; every scene in East Proctor; every single werewolf attack (high marks for us seeing ""them"" seeing ""it"" without us seeing ""it"" and when we do, ""it"" is just a scary flash-cut); Hirsh's growing sense of dread and urgency, and of course, Rick Baker's mesmerizing and flabbergasting full fledged werewolf transformation scene (it is because of this scene that AMPAS created the category of Outstanding Achievement in Special Effects Makeup). A comment about the makeup effects: SFX techies yearn to have their stuff fully lit with the camera lovingly dwelling on it so they can let people appreciate what they've accomplished. Wisely, this is seldom done, as the human mind can fill in the blanks with much more depth than seeing the real thing and every good director knows this. However, in this film, it would have been nice to open the barn doors on the lighting set ups just a tad so we could get a little better glimpse of what Baker created -- in short, it's too damned dark! The finale is dizzying mayhem and exciting gore. Sadly, the ending leaves us empty. Vacant. Unfulfilled. Unfinished. It's as if Landis suddenly realized he couldn't come up with something poignant or touching, or even teasing (Mr Landis, Kessler and Nurse Price made love together, couldn't you have teased us with Son of American Werewolf in London?) so instead of turning to others for an answer, he just slapped on the closing credits, flipped up the house lights and cried out, ""Go Home!"" It's a shame to see so much potential ignored.",An American Werewolf in London
287,dkbrown,Still a favourite,9,23 October 2003,"I first saw this film over 20 years ago, but it remains one of my favourites.Key ingredients are the black comedy and the 50s/60s/70s soundtrack - I can't hear ""Blue Moon"" or ""Bad Moon Rising"" any more without thinking of this film.  However, there are also some moments of genuine horror including one - the ""nightmare within a nightmare"" sequence in the first half of the film - that I think ranks up there with a couple of scenes in Psycho, in terms of its shock effect the first time you see it.The transformation scene is also well done.  It's the evident painfulness of the process that gives it an edge. The special effects used in the scene are also excellent, although I seem to remember that I slightly preferred those in ""Company of Wolves"" which was released about the same time (but which I've never seen since because, unlike AWIL, it's never shown on TV).So it's a hardy perennial.  If you've never seen it, watch it.  And if you've seen it before and liked it, I bet you'll enjoy it on repeat viewings.",An American Werewolf in London
288,jackman-74739,Cracking monster flick,7,27 April 2020,"The script was tight (if a little dated), the set pieces were good and the soundtrack was on point, using pop songs about the moon for, well I'm sure you can see why. The main draw to this film though is the special effects, being very heavy in some parts. There is the iconic transforms scenes which though I've seen before, remain really uncomfortable, as it combines the sudden shock of it and the jolly backing music, with the really graphic and clear effects that still hold up to this day. But the effects I liked best were the ones on jack, how he was decomposing throughout the film, shown in all its gooey detail. The acting, while a bit stilted, felt like it fit, as the film felt like a pastiche to these old monster flicks. Also it all felt like what an American would think England is like after spending a weekend in London and watching an episode of dads army, but again this kinda fits in with the story, so doesn't get grating.
However one complaint is that the film is a little too short, and I have no idea weather I love or hate the ending, closing abruptly with him dead on the ground, causing me to burst out laughing from the sudden black screen.
But this film wears its campiness on its sleeve and is very enjoyable, if a bit dodgy in places. Now I can add werewolves and fearsome dart players to my list of why I shouldn't visit the north.",An American Werewolf in London
289,fcurry,"Before 'Evil Dead', there was a Werewolf...in London",9,14 October 2001,"Simply put, I really, liked this movie. Pay no attention to the suffering fools who hate on it. AWiL is not meant to be a straight-out horror film but a black comedy. Granted the extreme amounts of gore draw the line between fun and spook but come on, this isn't Halloween. Some scenes like (SPOILERS!)when the rampage in Picadilly Circus and David's grisly meetings with Jack are outright hilarious in a sick manner. Sadly, I'm probably the only one to think David's dream where his family's attacked by the wicked trick-or-treaters was funny. I heavily recommend this film to anyone at this time of year. 3 out of 4. ""Stay off the 'sequel', stick to the original.""",An American Werewolf in London

Kinda true to the legends, An American Werewolf in London, That's right guys I'm Reviewing another Universal movie that was released back in 1981 (The beginning of the 80's) Directed by a man named John Landis the guy who did a movie I never seen before Animal House, But this is a different kind of Animal, The Monster effects in this to be truthful is very good, so good this movie won an Academy Award and Oscar for Best Make Up, Well this was done by one man named Rick Baker, Looking up this guy on Wikipedia shows that he has done quite a lot, Some notable work such as the Alien Designs in the Men in Black Movies, the 2001 version of Planet of the Apes, Schlock (Something from the Beginning of his Movie Make Up Job life) Star Wars (The First one) Hellboy and he also did the Make Up effects on the 2010 remake of The Wolfman, So yeah he is a Monster Make Up Artist (Almost forgot, He also did Make Up effects on The Grinch) I own this movie on Blu-Ray and... I don't know what to say about this Werewolf movie, Don't get me wrong It's an alright film, The Werewolf Transformation is Amazing and somewhere creepy, But Rick Baker did a Fantastic job on it, To my opinion it's just on of them Comedy Horror films that resembles a B-Movie, Ofcause what was done here was amazing, Some of the story elements in this are similar to the Original Wolfman movie that was released in 1941 (the one staring Lon Chaney, Jr) The 1941 Wolfman is what a lot Lycan movie nerds claim that American Werewolf took ideas from it, It was rumored that American Werewolf was at one point an Wolfman Remake, but since, Universal wanted this to be a B-Movie tip and The Original Wolfman is a Classic, They left in a bunch of the Ideas, There is a Sequel to this movie called An American Werewolf in Paris released in 1997 (Some year as Batman & Robin), But since it wasn't a very interesting movie due to it receiving Negative Reviews I'm skipping it for the time being, All n All, This was a alright film.",An American Werewolf in London
291,filmdescriptions,Whatever Happened to Jack?,7,16 December 2016,"A lovely start to a film. Taking us along down the river of no return with David and Jack. Expect a lot of jump cuts in this film. The dialogue is okay, but the message is unclear. Still, the film could be used as a metaphor for old yuppies giving bad advice like ""go for a walk"" when you express discontent. And for people that struggle with opening and closing doors and entering rooms, this could be a good entrances into a room practice. John Landis subscribes to a good deal of attention to detail in these opening scenes. It's like we are running with the bulls in Plamplona Spain. Would've liked it better if Landis gave us a more realistic howling sound then what we got; and, it would've been cool if he aimed the camera at the creature as it was howling, dripping saliva. The howl sounded too faint in a crucial role, introducing us to the monster. Lots of anxiety and stress put into the making of this film. But it pays off! Landis does an excellent job at keeping us on the edge of our seat. This is done in one way, by dissolves, especially, the one used for the nightmare scene. I will say that his talking friend, the dear dead friend whom gives insight on the supernatural. It's a rare beauty, gift, and blessing when you see the special effects crew decide to give a close up of their work like this. In this case, Tom Hester and the makeup effects crew, did a wonderful job. The visual hallucinations in this film are right on, too. This is confirmed mostly from his friend Jack, of course, whom David keeps seeing. How Jack was able to get all the other members of his ""undead"" club membership together for a meeting seems unrealistic. Skipping ahead though, redemption granted. This film could be a lesson in camera work. Mainly POV. The wide array of neat angle shots help, such as the ones in the rain whilst you hear loud thunder claps. These sound effects get you involved. Nice if you like surround sound. However, nothing is consistent, and there are cold spots where the film loses its energy drive and dies out. Fortunately, the film has a killer soundtrack. Yes! Wait for it... we get a killer song by Creedance Clearwater Revival, the song Bad Moon Rising. Get ready because the famous transformation scene is right around the bend. Be careful, you've been warned! This scene has awesome attention to detail as well,  which is not easily viewed. The dude in the subway is so screwed! not to mention he looks like Michael Cera. Mayhem at its best during the action sequence of the snapping Werewolf scene while the orgy film is rolling. Some strike outs in this rocking film, sad to say. The overuse of London sirens, and some screen shots. This is a sad film, funny, and funny acting all rolled into one. Check this one out, this film Rocks!! Props!!",An American Werewolf in London

As a horror movie it does everything it's supposed to do...it shocks, scares, and repulses. But for every horror element it gets right, it gets two more of another element right. It weaves horror, comedy, drama, and some very touching scenes of sorrow together the way no other horror movie has or done since.Landis takes the viewer on an emotional roller-coaster through the entire film. From what has to be the most vicious werewolf attack ever filmed, to the comedic back and forths between all of the characters, and eventually the main character calling home to tell his family goodbye..because he knows he has to kill himself, AAWIL does everything right. If you've never seen this movie, I recommend getting the DVD right now! This is what horror is supposed to be.

To this day, I can watch the movie start to finish and be thoroughly entertained the entire time.It is the story of David, a young American backpacking through Europe. Him and his friend Jack are attacked by a werewolf on the English Moors under suspicious circumstances. Jack is killed and David is brought to hospital in London. When the authorities and a local nurse who he falls in love with refuse to believe his story, David is doomed to sprout fangs and a thick coat of fur to terrorize the streets of London.This is almost more of a comedy in some ways than a horror film. The comedy is subtle yet hilarious and probably one of John Land is' best works to date. The soundtrack will likely have you tapping your foot and the special effects are absolutely out of this world for the time. To this day, I cannot think of a more effective, realistic transformation scene in any film.If you're a fan of werewolves, horror, dark comedies or just appreciate some great practical effects, An American Werewolf In London will certainly not disappoint!",An American Werewolf in London

It's freezing so they need a place to heat up and get some food in. When they come up to a pub in a small village, the horrid sign above the entrance showing the bloody, severed head of a wolf on a stake, draws their attention. Once inside the lively atmosphere immediately changes to an unpleasant stillness as all eyes shift in their direction. As young men are - full of life and constantly trying to one up each other - they don't make too much of it and decide to continue their journey with lack of a warm welcome. But it's a full moon, and there's something lurking in the foggy moors...This wanna be B-picture is an entertaining ride. For starters it's hilarious, in part because it wants to be. After four decades have past, certain scenes that were once scary or weren't as thick with cliché as they are now, have a different impact now to the original intention.The make up artist won an oscar for his work and deservedly so. To this day it makes for the main attraction of the film and can still be scary at times. And even when it isn't. It's just amazingly well done.There's a fair bit of old school misogyny in this one, but seen in context it shouldn't hinder you from enjoying the film. A positive note: there is a good balance when it comes to male and female nudity that is unusual for a film like this. I can imagine ladies won't be sad to see the lead actor in his Adam's costume.At a length of about 90 minutes, the film will never bore you. David Naughton's charisma along with the awesome special effects make this a pleasant experience thoughout.

I have seen this film a million times and it still freaks me out, because I know that if it was me and my mate crapping ourselves at the situation we'd gotten ourselves in to, then we would, in all likelihood, act exactly like they did. You know, like in most horror movies, you see the characters choose the incredibly scary looking path instead of the brightly lit yellow brick road and it just ain't right. These characters are believable, the wolf is just about the most scariest monster you ever could imagine, none of this running around on two legs malarky here! Nosiree, we have ourselves a genuine evil hound from the depths of hell. Just look at the scene on the underground and the size of the thing when it comes in to view.

304,kpbtm,"22 years on, more astounding than ever.",10,11 January 2003,"I freely admit that I am prone to superlatives when it comes to early John Landis films, but in the case of this particular gem that is because he went so utterly against the mainstream and still carved something accessible but with myriad layers of depth, which still gets the synapses firing a generation later. The joy of the script is perfectly complemented by the offbeat improv of the central characters. The naturalistic tongue-in cheek tone that the 2 American protagonists maintain throughout most of the movie has not dated but, if anything, become more enjoyable, as filmgoers today are much more receptive to genre-bending than they were when this first came out. Indeed, this was one of the first films to successfully combine horror and comedy, which has since become a staple sub-genre in itself (see the Scream saga, Dog Soldiers, etc.) Many dismiss the ending as too abrupt, or downbeat, or just out of keeping with the rest of the film. But the same people will also be unable to come up with a better alternative. Building through the the film is a dark undercurrent, and this sense of malaise comes to a head when David attempts to take his own life in the phone booth in piccadily. This comes directly after trying to contact his parents for the last time, only for his youngest sibling to pick up, alone in the house, and we are left with the distinct impression that the parents will never in fact get the message David asked Max to pass on. If the film had been edited around Jenny Agutter's Alex, we would have a great modern tragedy. Watching it through her eyes is heartbreaking. Istill remember the first time I watched this; it scared the pants off me. The second time I laughed my arse off. On every viewing since then I have come away with something different and new. This is a film that has already proven it can stand the test of time and gets better with repeated viewings and age. Give it a few years, I think it'll be in more than a few official top 10 lists.

And not even a fan of werewolves.,8,27 September 2019,"I'm not really a big fan of werewolf movies, but I've heard a lot about this movie (especially the transforming scene), saw it on a sale so decided and to grab it.Keeping in mind that this is the first time I've ever seen this all the scares and tropes used in this movie, I've seen a hundred times but I can imagine what it must had been like at 1981! Especially the moments when I first saw the transformation, it still holds up, granted the acting in that scene felt a bit comical. It's hard to act pain and make it believable. There aren't many actors in the world that can pull it off. It took a bit away from the otherwise great and memorable scene.The movie was an enjoyable mix of subtle humor and horror. Little funny moments here and there breaking the horror and relaxing the atmosphere. Moments like the main character seeing his friend on the bathroom mirror when closing the cabinet. That polite englishman who, even in death, stays calm and polite. The great car crash scene that caught me off guard with it's goofyness and choices in editing.I enjoyed this movie even if the subject didn't feel interesting to me, There's isn't much of the wolf itself and i'd think that was the fact that made this movie more enjoyable to me. It was there when it needed to be, but no unnecessary action or gore scenes. A great movie! One that i can proudly keep in my collection.",An American Werewolf in London
307,Moviejock,A great idea badly executed,5,31 May 2003,"AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON is arguably the most brilliantly creative vehicle from the 80s, but ideas alone don't make full-length feature films.
The film's script provides its audience with precious little story, and what there is of it is illogical and therefore unconvincing.  Instead of story, Landis fills the screen with gimmicky sequences that undermine the impact of the truly substantial ones that work.  Provided that the dialogue, which is really quite awful throughout the film, be reworked--the nightmarish home-invasion, the second visitation of the protagonist's savaged friend, the protagonist's transformation, the hilarious balloons-in-the-park and the haunted theater sequences are all keepers.  The rest of the script should be scrapped and replaced with a story that makes sense.Further, the film's lovers, David and Alex, are virtual strangers--not only to the audience, but to one another.  The audience needs to know who these people are and understand what motivates their love.  Given that Alex invests the most and is willing to put her life at risk, it is especially important that we be given some clue as to why she apparently comes to love David so much.  Reducing David's and Alex's relationship to what appears to be a casual affair while depicting acts of great devotion is confounding and seriously undermines the impact of the film's horror.  Also, the film's comedic element is introduced too early in Landis' version.  This should not occur until after the romantic element is well established.Landis' film is a B-movie, unconsciously presented as something more, but not in the tradition of the great, classic noirs of the 40s and 50s.  This film really is mediocre.Not withstanding, the film's makeup, for which it deservedly won its only Oscar, and some of its special effects are really quite excellent and continue to hold up against today's standards.  And though its effectiveness is somewhat undone by the film's shortcomings, the juxtaposition of real horror and comedy is stunningly imaginative.I give it a 5 out of 10 for creativeness and effort, and strongly recommend it to film lovers, as this is a potentially great film still waiting to happen and should not be allowed to languish as a cult classic, namely because it isn't, i.e., a classic.  I recommend Michael McDowell to write and Tim Burton to direct the remake.",An American Werewolf in London
308,jstock426,Our Dual Natures Served Up Hollywood Style,10,26 September 2005,"John Landis reveals a philosophical take on mankind in this film, namely, that we have two natures: one benign, one monstrous. The werewolf legend handily serves as that proposition's allegorical vehicle, and compared to the alluded-to Nazi atrocities in two scenes, the legend actually pales. Sadly, under the dark impetus of our arrogance and vanity, our metaphorical ""full moon"", man is perfectly capable of transforming into nightmarish beast.As a director, Landis approaches Hitchcock in terms of scene economy and symbolism. For example, the opening sequence set on the moors of northern England features the tragic hero David and his friend Jack climbing out of the bed of a truck laden with sheep - benign animals destined for slaughter. Biped ""sheep"" David and Jack meander to ""The Slaughtered Lamb"", a pub sheltering cowering, xenophobic locals from the monster afoot on the moors during full moon. Soon the inhospitality of the town folk compels the two lambs to leave - virtually sending them to their slaughter.And so it goes throughout this brilliant film. Without revealing the ending, it can be stated that Landis makes his case against the idea that love conquers all; instead, he suggests that love only gives the beast within us pause.Beware the moon.",An American Werewolf in London

310,aydinbekoglu,"Very good acting, fun film, not scary...",7,4 June 2021,"Let us begin with the definition of a werewolf film: It's a film a about werewolves or includes werewolves that rely on make-up effects or CGI to transfer such imagery to the viewers. I have watched most of werewolf films and they commonly are categorized as horror films.Well, this movie is not scary. Some old-school jump scares are there but the effects are not superb. Even orcs in the siege of Helm's Deep in Lord of the Rings were more scary.The acting is great, the actors are very, very good. The doctor, the beautiful nurse, the protagonist are truly wonderful. I felt love in nurse's speech. The locals of England are shown as somewhat cold and unfriendly, where this is not very true. I have studied there and in every pub, you can easily find friendly conversation if you mind your manners!The film's pace is good, but the ending is somehow abrupt, too easy. It feels like the filmmakers are bored or something, so they rushed it.Music is quite fitting and makes you feel the mood.So, as a Sunday fun film, this is a great production. But in terms of a horror film, it is far, far behind , say, the Conjuring.",An American Werewolf in London
311,factualnatural,A 'Bloody' good time,9,1 July 2006,"An American Werewolf in London is perhaps the best werewolf movie out there. I know you're thinking werewolves? give me a break ! but this movie portraits the subject in brutal realism - it will make you think what if.... At the same time, the director throws in mild comedy. When I say mild I mean it works quite well, and makes this movie a true classic horror flick for numerous scenes that you won't find anywhere else. Early on, you have a great scene were you hear the then unknown creature closing in on some hikers(the main characters) under a full moon(duh). It's a great what's that, oh no its getting closer moments. The attack on the boys on the London moores (swampy fields) is simply terrifying because the dialogue is well written and the attack is so vivid. The film keeps the rules when you're bitten you then become a werewolf, this happens to the surviving boy who gets away with a scratch. His friend however dies, but he isn't really dead... his body comes back to haunt his surviving friend. Telling him to ""beware the moon"". If this all sounds cheesy so far, the actual movie I assure you is not. After having horrible nightmares, the surviving victim sees his friend come back. In what is the best makeup effect you may see, his friend is missing half of his face. In an example of the well written self humor of the film, his first words are can I have that piece of toast? referring to the hospital food. He warns that at the next full moon his friend (David, the kid who got scratched) will turn into a werewolf. David ofcoarse doesn't believe what he's seen until it's too late. This movie was the first to show the full man to wolf transformation in full light, it is a classic monster moment and lends to the believability of the films otherwise out there subject (WEREWOLVES??) The scene is so good it won the make up artist the award for makeup effects. I think they had to put some of the hairs on individually. The wolf itself is pretty scary looking and utterly shred its victims to bits. If you listen you'll catch all the songs in the film have the word moon in them, including Creedence Clearwater Revival's Bad Moon Rising, and another song called ""Blue Moon"" that after watching the film I play whenever I go camping at night because the hiking scene and first attack gave you the sense of this might really happen in the woods, at night, under the full moon. The main characters are all believable and good acting throughout. Plenty of action and a moderate body count keep things rolling, the good acting, special effects, and classic moments make it a fun movie to watch :)",An American Werewolf in London
312,catchick,"Bad moon, great movie",8,31 October 2008,"Maybe it ended a little too quickly? Maybe Alex should have been in peril for a bit longer? I'd like to have seen David try to change himself for another month, then end the movie. Oh, well. It's still a great movie.My sister saw this movie, as her first hardcore horror flick, when she was 17, in 1981. Scared the ever-lovin' crap out of her. When I saw it in its entirety for the first time, I had years of CSI shows, ""ER"" and ""Law and Order SVU"" under my belt. Therefore, the gore was not nearly as shocking. Certainly not as disturbing as following a bullet down someone's gullet and watching their stomach explode. In other words, if you can stomach CSI, ""Werewolf"" won't bother you too much.Having said that, it was sufficiently creepy for good thrills, without the nonstop ""ick"" factor of some of its descendants. The fact that the makeup and transformation scenes were done without CGI assistance is still amazing, and the movie well deserved the Oscar nod for the efforts. The effects are still incredible and hold up just as well today.David Naughton has such a wonderful speaking voice; I could listen to him read the phone book. And those big, soulful brown eyes.... Sigh. It makes the transformation all the more jarring.Griffin Dunne is perfect as the undead Jack. He's funny and desperate, all at once.I'm not really a horror movie enthusiast.

315,thomas-101-213903,Terrifying 80's horror comedy a real achievement.,8,21 July 2011,"I watched this on DVD in the dark earlier this year. I was terrified. And with good reason. This is a brilliantly terrifying and hilarious 80's comedy-horror with a lot of heart and excellent special effects for the time.Two American tourists are in a quiet place in the countryside in England when all of a sudden they get mauled by a werewolf. One is killed and the other becomes a werewolf. This first attack has a very lengthy and thrilling buildup and when it comes, it's utterly terrifying and awesome.One of the film's real highlights is the Oscar-winning makeup by Rick Baker. It really stands out in the transformation scene, when the main character transforms into a werewolf right in front of our eyes. He also keeps having visions of his dead friend in a gradually decaying zombie form. What also really stood out is the final scene, which takes place in a porno cinema. The man sees decaying visions of everyone he's murdered, who warn him that he will die. The film is also ridiculously funny in some parts, such as when he wakes up naked in a zoo and does everything he can to hide his man parts.Overall, this is a crowning achievement for director John Landis. I give it 8/10.",An American Werewolf in London

317,dansessions1998,Great Movie!,10,26 January 2013,"American Werewolf In London is just a classic horror movie, even though its old, its effects, especially the transformation into the werewolf, still even now in 2013 are pretty decent. I've been wanting to see this for a good couple of years now, after my Dad told me about it back in about 2009, but being only 11yrs old at the time and this film being rated an 18 there was no chance my parents were going to let me watch it. But today when looking round CEX I stumbled upon it and my Mum to my surprise let me buy it. I got home and sat down with my Dad and popped it into the DVD player. With in minutes I was glued to screen, just with the intensity of them stumbling across the moors after being firmly told by the rather unfriendly locals in the pub they had just left 'The Slaughtered Lamb' to stay on the road and off the moors! Hearing noises which most would associate with a werewolf they were starting to get very on edge, turning round and starting to run back in the direction of 'The Slaughtered Lamb' the noises were getting louder and closer. After one of the two friends stumbled and fell to ground, the other friend was viciously savaged by the beast which had been creating the intimidating noises. The 'werewolf' then turned and went for the other friend who had fallen, but was shot down before he managed to savage him, only being able to take one bite of the mans flesh. I have said a lot more about what happens in the film than I normally do, just because it needed to be told, for me to then talk about the points that I want to talk about. Like I said earlier the effects aren't shocking but not great either. I have to admit I did chuckle at the attack on the moors, but not because I'm a sicko who likes seeing people getting ripped to pieces but just because of the sound effects and the werewolf itself. But that certainly doesn't make the movie a bad film because the storyline the acting and the settings around London make the film great! I loved watching this film and found it extremely enjoyable. Especially when Jack who was savaged at the beginning returns, multiple times throughout the film to haunt and warn David of events which are gonna unfold and hurt him and others around him. But in general this film is just a great watch, not scary though but extremely enjoyable and very proud to be able to put it on my DVD shelf along with my 85 other brilliant films!",An American Werewolf in London

327,the hedgehog from hell,"A template for modern ""horror"" films",8,30 September 2002,"John Landis is fond of insisting that American Werewolf... is a horror film, and not a comedy.  For the time, the sudden switches in tone between crude humour and gory horror were an unheard-of combination. To look at the two elements of comedy and horror in isolation, then: the comedy is primarily of the fish-out-of-water type, with two New Yorkers adrift in the British countryside - lost, not just in the landscape but also in the culture.  Abruptly, after a blackly comic scene in the Slaughtered Lamb, the horror kicks in with a vicious attack which kills one and leaves the other destined to transform into a werewolf the next time a full moon appears.  And so it proceeds throughout the film, sometimes broadly funny, sometimes sickeningly horrific, and sometimes both. Many people have a problem with the sudden changes in tone, and this perhaps depends what you expect from this film.  If you want an out-and-out horror film, go and watch Nightmare on Elm Street.  If you want a comedy, watch There's Something About Mary.  If you're prepared to watch with an open mind, however, the stark contrast between styles only makes the horrific scenes more disturbing, as you're lulled into a false sense of security before being bludgeoned over the head. Rick Baker's make-up effects stand up to scrutiny to this day.  The werewolf transformation scene especially has never been surpassed in films of this type, particularly the hand stretching into a paw.  The fact that this was all achieved before CGI makes it more impressive to watch. Nowadays it's possible to computer-generate anything that can be imagined and put it on the screen, but with this ability comes the temptation to show off.  The most astonishing special effects were in the days when this was not possible and you watched, not believing your eyes, wondering how the hell they did it. American Werewolf is an early film in the lineage of the Evil Dead films, and later the Scream films, culminating in every post-modern, self-referential, self-parodying excuse for a ""horror"" film that clogs up the video shelves at the beginning of the new millennium.  The difference is that John Landis' film manages to be both scary and funny, while almost all of it's modern descendents fail miserably to be either.",An American Werewolf in London
328,dead_by_dawn-1,One of the greats...,10,24 November 2006,"'An American Werewolf in London' is one of the great horror films. Most people remember it for the iconic transformation scene. Traditionally, most special effects in movies tend to not date very well. But like Karloff's Frankenstein, or John Carpenter's re-imagining of The Thing, the transformation scene in American Werewolf continues to get better with age. The feats accomplished in this scene (when you look at it from the eyes of the post-CGI world) have never been topped. Even today, you feel David's pain as his body stretches and snaps and morphs into something else.And the film itself is just as iconic. It's such a simple story when you stop to think about it. There's no final twist. No underlined message put in by a director who thinks he's smarter than you. No room for a sequel (although the hacks in Woodtown saw fit to make one anyway in the mid-1990's). The movie hangs on a very basic plot-thread, and for a movie known for it's jaw dropping effects, it's primarily character driven.John Landis wrote the movie when he was 19, and that may have something to do with it. There's a strong sense of empathy that runs through the narrative. Just as the transformation scene makes you feel what David's feeling on a spectacular and dramatic level, the rest of the movie makes you feel David's pain, grief, happiness etc. just as affectively. You really get a sense of what this nineteen year old Yankee's backpacking in Europe is all about. Hell, he could even be you.The film does not get bogged down in trying to explain the supernatural events it chronicles. Sure, you're given basic explanation and a sense that there's something bigger going on, but for the most part the movie says that werewolves exist because werewolves exist. David is a werewolf because he was attacked by one and survived. There is no cure. He needs to kill himself. Nuff said thank you very much. Landis does a great job of planting these events into a real world surrounding. It's like he's saying, here's reality as far as this movie is concerned, and just like in our reality, life sucks. Get over it.I read somewhere that the Suits wanted Landis to change the bleak ending. They were saying ((SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT))""Come on John, we've gotten to like this kid, why does he have to die?"" and Landis just laughed and said ""Because that's how it ends."" You've got to respect a guy who sticks by his vision like that.There's a lot to be said about this movie. I could go on and on about the soundtrack. I could mention the hot sex scene. I could write a term paper on the significance of David's dead best friend Jack, who haunts our hero throughout the course of this movie like Hamlet's wacky neighbor. But I will leave this as my final thought in this review - An American Werewolf in London is a timeless masterpiece made by a man who was at the top of his game. Pure. Simple. To the point.",An American Werewolf in London

It is filled with very scary moments, (I still run if i'm on the underground) to this day. The 'changing' scene still sends shivers up your spine although it is dated now, but it still looks really good.Other good scenes include the classic porno cinema scene. You will not keep a straight face at this scene i guarentee you.

331,Haiku888,A modern fairy tale,8,11 July 2021,"This movie views best as a parable or fairy tale rather than straight - two nice boys head abroad with their minds on sex, in a fairly innocent way - the one most open about his desires is soon slaughtered by the wolf and comes back as a caution, the other finds romance & sex only to realize that he's marked with an wild, animal nature outside of his control which is deadly, to others and to woman he's drawn to. In that sense it feels like a product of its times, I'm not sure viewers today will get it in the same way of the tension between protecting others and fulfilling our animal natures (which seems now to be retro - ). But, it's an enjoyable film even if watched just for the story. The special effects are superb, the humor keeps it light. This movie may be triggering to people with depression or suicidal ideation, and is also very graphic in showing violence/corpses - I wouldn't advise it at all for kids or those who are sensitive to violence and violent images.",An American Werewolf in London

I first saw it when I was eleven and, as you can imagine, it certainly left an impression.There are many men currently in there late thirties who will always have a soft spot for Jenny Agutter shall we say.There are 3 standout moments.1.The dream sequences that David undergoes whilst in hospital. In particular The Nazi grotesques are very powerful and Landis does a marvellous thing where David see's his family butchered and his own throat cut whilst the Muppets are on TV. A weird contrast and unsettling as, as a child, for me the Muppets were very popular and a safe image. Couple that with Agutter being repeatedly stabbed by one leaping from David's hospital room window is visually shocking and totally unexpected.2.The werewolf transformation is excellent and a credit to the special effects all done without the benefit of CGI. This brings a marvellous ""organic"" feel.3. Finally the interchanges between David, Jack and the other victims is sublime. We are given some pretty gory moments throughout and this seems to maintain our sanity but lifts the film well above the simple horror format.One last point Landis deserves some real credit for bring the bleakness and Britishness of the piece to the screen that many foreign directors struggle with.",An American Werewolf in London

Films such as American Werewolf in London must endlessly frustrate those bearing this responsibility. American Werewolf, like other great films, transcends genre, foiling the attempts of people who try to fit movies into neat little categories.  Though ostensibly a horror film, American Werewolf also entertains with its comedy and saddens with its tragic romance.  American Werewolf is an amalgamation, a perfect mixture of disparate elements, each element complementing the other. Though the movie contains romance and comedy, neither of these elements distracts from the film's main thrust: terror.  On the contrary, the comedy and romance enhance the film's effectiveness, accentuating its horror.

With newer movie's there's always a Hollywood ending slapped on, no matter how unlikely the it was that the ending would turn out good. So for that i praise this film. Also the creepy atmosphere of the town where David and Jack get attacked was great. With the rolling fog and the luminous full moon, great stuff.

335,DocGrizzly,The Benchmark Of Werewolf Movies And The Original Self-Aware Horror-Comedy,10,21 July 2011,"John Landis is a self-confessed horror fan. The director with an already established strong cult following from a string of adolescent comedies in the 70s and proved box office gold.He gained enough pull that he took a gamble and proposed a horror film to his producer John Folsey Jr from a script he had originally penned at the age of 18 in 1969. Polygram Pictures green-lit the film and Landis had a $10 million dollar budget to get the picture made. An American Werewolf In London had sat on the back-burner for 11 years waiting for this watershed moment. Landis immediately called upon his pal, ingenious make-up artist Rick Baker. But Rick Baker had other current obligations to another werewolf production called The Howling. An animate and insistent Landis finally convinced Baker to turn over the reigns of The Howling to his protégé Rob Bottin while still acting consultant to that film. Rick Baker jumped aboard An American Werewolf In London. And due to proper financial backing Landis turned Baker loose on the world and both made cinema history together.John Landis hired two newcomers for the leads, David Naughton and Griffin Dunne. David Naughton previous work includes being the representative Dr Pepper singer/dancer and the star of a short lived television sitcom. Griffin Dunne is the son of producer and writer Dominick Dunne. He also landed a gifted young beautiful English actress named Jenny Agutter, a veteran (Logan's Run) of the big screen to play the strong female lead. The performances are superb. The cast and crew experienced excellent rapport throughout the shoot inspiring improvisation that naturally transitioned into the story. The story is simple enough, on the twilight of a full moon, a pair of backpacking American tourists, David (Naughton) and Jack (Dunne), literally stumble upon a village in Northern England hiding a terrifying curse. They enter a pub with an appropriate name of The Slaughtered Lamb seeking warmth from the evening chill but once our two intrepid travelers are introduced to the inhospitable locals they wisely choose to make a very quick exit. But it is not before being issued a series of bizarre warnings to stay on the roads and avoid the moors and beware of the moon. But their departure proves to be late and the warnings are naturally taken lightly. The Americans do realize the error of their ways when they consequently are stalked and terrorized by an unknown beast. One is killed, the other lies convalescing in a London hospital bed to fully recover. Under the light of the full moon, a legendary monster will run amok upon the unsuspecting city of London.John Landis singlehandedly breathes new life into a classic film monster while simultaneously producing the first genuine modern horror-comedy masterpiece. An American Werewolf In London is stocked full of references to its early B&W predecessors. A rich horror pedigree. Landis, like pioneer Siodmak, laid down new ground into werewolf cinema lore. Which includes the internalized werewolf, in that David Kessler experiences lucid dreams of hunting in woods like a wolf chasing down prey and consuming it raw. And the curse of lycanthropy burning into his splintered subconscious with vivid nightmares working like a slow acting inexorable poison, the beast breaking down the resilience of his humanity until all is lost upon the ineluctable full moon. Murdered victims of a werewolf are equally bad off, in that, they are eternally cursed restless souls doomed to walk the Earth as decomposing zombies until the werewolf bloodline is completely severed. This leads to a grisly juxtaposition of horror and black comedy as his dead friend Jack visits him, always returning more worse for wear than the last time to warn David of his carnivorous lunar activities encouraging suicide that Jack his friend can finally be put to rest and to spare more innocent lives. Unfortunately, David is slow to be convinced by these waking visions are genuinely real and slower to act upon them before the next full moon, further complicated by a new mutual love interest in his own nurse, sympathetic Alex (Agutter) who takes him in into her home. News of grisly murders splash all of London's papers. To David's horror the zombie apparitions are multiplying ... fast. Griffin Dunne plays the talking corpse with an infectious relish. Finally, one of the most monumental landmarks ever found in horror. The Werewolf Transformation. The juxtaposition of David Naughton's convincing emotionally pitched agony combined with creature effects is simply jaw-gaping wizardry to witness, flowing seamlessly from start to finish. One will be hard pressed to rank any other special effects and make-up in horror above this one. Never before and never since, have movie audiences bore witness to such an explicit and astonishing on screen metamorphosis.This film is not only groundbreaking but also set a new trend. Nothing previous attempted to simultaneously scare the pants off audiences with straight-faced terror and make them laugh with witty one-liners and self-aware comic undertones. In that An American Werewolf is a triumph right through from the first reel to the final reel.Also featured are rocking tracks provided by from Bobby Vinton, Sam Cooke, Van Morrison, Creedance Clearwater Revival, and The Marcels. And original music by Elmer Bernstein. John Landis and Rick Baker are the dynamic duo. Baker, recipient of the first ever Academy Award for Best Make-Up.(One important final word, Naughton and Agutter have a terribly *good* tender chemistry in this film. Beautifully orchestrated and captured by Landis. But the one detail that really slammed home for me are the final words between the two during their final two meetings. First. David at Trafalgar Square, ""I love you ... I love you ... I love you, Alex."" Final kisses and flees without any returns.Second. Alex in the alley, with David's death imminent, ""I love you, David."" The perfect ending.)10/10",An American Werewolf in London
336,reko-latvanen,A crackpot horror/comedy (not really in that order),6,3 March 2020,"Two Americans travelling in The UK are attacked by a werewolf. One dies and the other survives, only to turn into a creature of the night himself. This 1981 John Landis cult classic starts off on a relatively moody and loose note, but the mood quickly evaporates when the setting changes from the moors to contemporary London and the focus shifts from honoring horror traditions to an unconvincing love story. The loose quality of the film is here to stay, though, and your enjoyment of the experience depends largely on whether you can accept characters acting wacky for the hell of it. For me, the fact that the second act is mostly just this instead of actually advancing the story kinda tanks the whole film.The film does have its pleasures. The iconic special effects and makeup work are fantastic, working for both gruesome and amusing affect. All the actors seem to be on the right frequency when it comes to balancing conflicting styles and tones. Griffin Dunne really elevates his few scenes with deadpan delivery, even as his undead character's appearance keep getting closer to a meatloaf.While by no means terrible, I was underwhelmed by this supposed gem.

The music, the dark humor, the violence and gore and special effects--there are few movies that scare you and make you laugh at the same time. The only problem I have ever had with this film is the subway scene; it has the best shot and the worst shot in the entire film. The worst is the continuity of not seeing the wolf during a far-away-shot when you know it has to be nipping at the guy's heels. but to make up for it, with no sarcastic music, we get a long shot of the wolf ambling up to the escalator...

339,QualityApeMan,My Favourite Werewolf Movie,9,3 June 2018,"An American Werewolf in London is a lighthearted werewolf horror film from director John Landis.It might not be the best horror film ever made, but it's definitely among the best werewolf ones and is just such great fun.Even today the creature effects are pretty special. Landis plays it intelligently by only showing glimpses of the werewolf until the finale - the protagonist himself doesn't even transform until about two thirds though the film! The transformation scene itself is one of the highly-praised examples of practical effects in horror history. The way the limbs grow and extend just looks incredibly realistic and is much better than the shiny-looking CGI we see these days (cough, cough I'm looking at you Wolfman 2010). The make-up on David's friend Jack is great too, slowly progressing from freshly-killed to decomposing, skeletal mess.There are some very odd surreal moments thrown in including one with Nazi Werewolf Stormtroopers and two creepy little girls with a dog, some hilarious moments like the film-within-the-film See You Next Wednesday, and even some sweet, touching moments.Last but not least there is also an awesome moon-related soundtrack from the likes of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Van Morrison and multiple artists with their renditions of Blue Moon.An American Werewolf in London is probably my favourite werewolf movie, and is among my favourite horrors in general. Definitely recommended!",An American Werewolf in London

342,Chasing_fear,The best werewolf flick ever!,9,15 June 2007,"Directed by john Landis and with special effects provided by rick baker this is the best werewolf film and one of my favourite films of all time. Things kick of with 2 American back packers just wandering about near the moors. They come across a pub called the slaughtered lamb and are warned by the locals after they offend them with some of there questions. Before they go they are told to beware of the moors and stick to the roads, which of course they do not. They are are attacked by a werewolf and David is bitten or scratched and his friend is killed. The werewolf is then killed before it can finish David off. We then switch locations to a London hospital where David begins having bad nightmares and is warned by his dead friend that he will become a werewolf on the next full moon. The effects in this film are amazing and to this day with all the cgi and everything i have yet to see such a good transformation. The cast do a really good job in this movie and really play there roles well. I also really enjoyed the music in this movie. To tell you the truth i do not have a bad word to say about this movie.

343,J--B,Great movie,8,3 June 2003,"I first saw this movie on tv about 3 or 4 years ago and they had just finishing showing it on AMC tonight.  It was great to see this film over again.  Just reminds me of how advanced it was in 1981.For being, kinda, a b-movie, the scene where he first transforms into the werewolf, will always surprise me. AWiL's script, while filled with excellent black humor (i.e. the convo in the porno house), was alright. But in order for the script to work in the movie, you need good acting to back it.  Thats where it kinda lost points with me, but again, IMO, its a b movie and you dont have to expect it.Overall, it was a successful movie with me and I'd watch it again if given the chance.

As it turned out, they seemed less disturbed by the graphic scenes than I was. The film contains a superb blend of horror, sex, comedy and tragedy. The scenery in the moors and in London is beautiful. The soundtrack and cinematography are great. I enjoyed every moment of the movie and purchased the DVD at first opportunity.

My favorite scene: David in the cinema being given suicide suggestions by his victims, oh how I laughed.This films beauty lies in it's balancing not taking itself seriously, with taking itself seriously enough to invest in some excellent special-effects.

Some come close, Ginger Snaps and Dog Soldiers for instance. What seems to work best in the genre is an absence of Americans. Completely yank made films like Silver Bullet and Underworld tend to fail completely in terms of major elements involving werewolves. Transformation scenes, gore, and attached metaphors and themes all come together perfectly in AWiL, in so many others they are missing. I can't disparage on Underworld enough really.Anyways, in AWiL, the effects still look good today (no cgi at all of course), we have a straightforward but interesting story, sharp humour and dialog, and well rendered carnage.

351,lucy-locket,Howltastic,10,21 July 2005,"I love this movie. It is the perfect combination of Horror and Comedy. In fact if anyone can be said to have invented this genre splice it is John Landis. This film came out before any of the other Horror Comedy classics like Evil Dead or Brain Dead. Not only is it the truly great Werewolf movie just nudging past The Howling by a Fang it it also manages to inject a touch of the Ealing magic. Forget the Anglo Phobic comments of ""ctomvelu"" the two American leads are very ably to supported by the British cast. I can only assume he is not familiar with the differences in acting styles of British film and TV compared to American film and TV. Oh well! I am sure the people who flock from all over the world to see world renowned British actors will stop in their tracks now they know how bad at acting the British are ... Yeah and I am really a Werewolf. But back to the movie. As David has to negotiate the trials of being a Werewolf he also has to cope with the culture clash between Britain and America. Thereby fusing Body Horror with the Fish out of Water comedy. The romance between David and Nurse Alex is touchingly played and you really believe these two have a special bond despite the very short duration of their relationship. I think this film offers something for everyone, gore for gore lovers, romance for those who still believe in it and comedy for everyone. Finally Landis makes superb use of his lunar themed soundtrack.",An American Werewolf in London

The scene where it chased that unfortunate guy through the subway had me imagining something was going to come around the corner for me for a good while. I understand that werewolves badly maul and kill people, but this was the first were I saw it actually eat people. I wonder if David belched after turning human again ?! And the decomposing undead victims was a different twist. They kept there original personalities unlike traditional zombies that just limped along and moan and grunt. That left one for the imagination!

355,pcmg,"It has some good moments, but it's not worth watching",4,7 December 2009,"This movie tries to be a blend of horror and comedy. Unfortunately it fails in both respects. There are some '80s movies that successfully combine horror and dark humor; this is not one of them. In the '80s, special effects weren't as capable as today so film-makers needed to rely more on mood and atmosphere for horror movies. This movie had no sense of danger, no tension, nothing. One year after this movie, Carpenter released The Thing. That is how you make a tensionate atmosphere. Compared to it (and others of its time), An American Werewolf in London seems like a joke as a horror movie. Add to this the fact that it's not exactly brilliant in the comedy department either and you get mediocrity.But it's not even mediocre; it's bad, due to its script. I couldn't help but notice the many plot errors...if the movie would've been released in present day, it would probably be destroyed by critics (and for good reason: the script is worse than that of today's action flicks like GI Joe, which aren't really known for their great story). I don't know who approved the script, but he must've been drunk when he did. In the beginning, the two tourists can't stay on the road. This is pretty much impossible, even if you talk to a friend. But hey, it's not a big deal. Towards the end though, the script falls apart. After hearing about the 6 people killed, David goes crazy and tries to get himself arrested (which he fails). Logic dictates he should've listened to Alex and be kept under observation and probably taken to the police by the doctor (which he tried himself without result). As it is, the writer just needed a reason to keep David in the street and chose a stupid way of advancing the plot. Not to mention the ending scenes with the mob that (unrealistically and illogically) gathers around the cinema's entrance just to stop the police from doing their job...people usually run; i wonder in what alternative universe would people gather near the place where strange growling sounds are heard. There's also the scene where Alex couldn't be held by 3-4 policemen and escapes the police line and into the alley, but the doctor (a strong man) is successfully held by only two policemen. Another evident and stupid plot advancement technique, necessary to have the ending between David and Alex. And David's death scene...that scene is an example of bad direction added to a bad script. First you're shown a wide scene, in which there's at least 50 meters (i think there's actually more) from the police line to where David(werewolf) and Alex are, with Alex between the police and David. Then the police shoots and kills David. Two questions come to mind: 1)were there snipers on the roof?(because the policemen that we see shooting are too far away) 2)how did the bullets go around Alex and into David...maybe the policemen could bend bullets :PIt really doesn't stand the test of time. It has some good moments, but it's not really worth watching. You could probably find better horror-comedies to watch (i recommend the Evil Dead series). As a conclusion, I regret wasting my time watching this movie. The only good thing about it, is the soundtrack.",An American Werewolf in London

357,bowie114,Terrifying and hilarious; a truly original horror film.,7,3 May 2001,"Landis, a comical director by nature, ventures into the horror genre; creating a film both horrific and humorous.  This tale is anything but a cliche, as we watch a young man named David deal with his curse of lycanthropy (changing into a werewolf.)  The movie is filled with frightening sequences, including the now famous ""transformation"" scene.  The lack of computer technology is a plus here because the effects are all real, making them all the more scary.  The shocks, however, are matched with jolts of comic relief, such as when a walking corpse complains that the other undead are all boring to talk to.  Many movies try to mate comedy with horror, but this is one of the few times it actually works.  These elements mix with Landis' strong visual style, producing an exhilarating film experience.  The movie's one flaw is the lead actor, David Naughton.  His acting just isn't up to par with the rest of the cast (highlighted by Griffin Dunne, who plays the wise-cracking corpse.)

After they are asked to leave, they stray off the road and soon find themselves being stalked by something in the dark.

The movie follows David as he tries to come to terms with the death of his friend, the feeling that the authorities are lying about what really happened, and the terrifying nightmares and hallucinations that begin to plague him.This film was made before computer graphics so you get awesome makeup and appliance work. The film has a good story, characters that you can invest in and root for, and is very successful at delivering scares, laughs, and excitement.

359,grantkm,An American Werewolf in London is awesome,8,3 November 2007,"John Landis, director of Animal House, shows what an ingenious genre-mixer he is with An American Werewolf in London. At its best points, American Werewolf is a special-effects masterwork of splatter and gore as well as a darkly funny tale of death and the supernatural. My only regret is that I didn't see American Werewolf sooner; it's portrayal of a scary story as funny could've lightened up my viewing of horror films as a kid.American Werewolf is the story of David (David Naughton), a naive American tourist who embarks on a backpacking trip with his best friend Jack (Griffin Dunne). The trip takes a nasty turn when they're kicked out of a British pub full of suspicious villagers. As they're leaving, a bartender yells ""We CAN'T let them leave!"", a classic indication that they're probably not the most hospitable crowd. But David and Jack discover there's something lurking out in the night underneath the full moon. As they venture off the road, they're mauled by what seems to be a rabid dog. David is saved at the last minute by the villagers; Jack isn't so lucky.As David recovers, he is aided in more ways than one by an insanely hot nurse. This recovery is plagued by increasingly strange nightmares, which give the movie some of its eeriest and most gory spectacles. The dream sequences are very originally done, implementing shock factor and a ton of primitive violence to show how David's mind is being somehow affected by that strange animal attack. From there, things get a little hairy.The movie's use of music fits, but in an ironic fashion. The movie's theme is ""Blue Moon"" (it uses it three times, each a different version). The soundtrack also includes CCR's ""Bad Moon Rising"" and Van Morrison's ""Moon Dance"". The music insures you won't forget the real bad guy in this story.An American Werewolf in London has an original plot, some real scares thanks to excellent special effects and suspense building, awesome music choice and a hot nurse.

361,Max Headroom,One of the very BEST werewolf movies ...,8,27 June 2002,"This one, together with The Howling, belongs to the top of ALL werewolf-movies ever seen on this planet ! ;)The tranformation-sequence was a masterpiece of special effects, even today ! Animatronics, make-up effects (especially the undead guys ;)) and the settings itself are incredible ! Todays werewolf-movies (eg. Bad Moon) only set up a guy in a dark area, usually a forest, and turn on their computers to perform a CGI morph as introduced in Terminator II. This movie is old school morphing at it's best !!! The only two other transformations, nearly as cool as this one, are The Howling and Manimal ;)The Music ? Hey, I LOOOOOOVE the 'Moon' song during the morphing and the other great scores. Neah, there is a single one that I can't listen anymore... the one at the porn-cinema ;)The Storyline ? Just look at the other comments ;) They say it all... a bit outdated today, especially the two Americans, but it's still a great effort in mixing werewolf-horror/gore with comedy. And the really DARK british humour was very cool, too. Unfortunately I like Monty Python's kind of humour a bit more ;) Regarding An American Werewolf In Paris, the second part of this movie: It's not as good as this one, but still has some sort of ""nearly equal"" storyline. The morph-scene as far TOO short and CGI-animated, compared to this freaky masterpiece, but it has Julie Delpy in it ;) Werewolf in Paris is more a popcorn-cinema for fast visits.The Making Of and the Outtakes on the Collectors DVD are really nice, but the special-effect Making Of a bit too short for a glimpse beyond the scenes. Anyway, the Outtakes are a really must-see, especially at the end ;)My rating ? 10/10 for the special effects but 8 of 10 points for the rest ;)",An American Werewolf in London

You get to see living dead and many horror characters transformations during the film which are really well executed. There is also romance involve in this film as one of the problems our hero will encounter.

Not only a dark horror film but at times incredibly funny and moving. The effects are well worthy of the Oscar that they so richly won and even now do not appear dated or silly when compared to todays standards - the use of practical effects once again showing brilliantly the pros to the use of these effects against the use of CGI in this art form. The cast is made up of little known and more well known actors and the balance is perfect, with the less known and less experienced actors holding their own against the more familiar faces. The pace and delivery of dialogue is right on the mark, and this makes the comic timing perfect for those dark humored jokes, carefully placed throughout the film in this perfect script form John Landis. An equal measure of scares and laughs make this one of the best films to come out of 1981 and the 80's as a whole.

Releashed in the early eighties, ""An American Werewolf in London"" has to go down as one of the best horror/comedy movies of all time a real cult classic. diffently a DVD collectable but not to be watched alone . YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!!",An American Werewolf in London
366,MatildasJohansson,"I Got Bored, (but if u r a hardcore fan of werewolf movies, watch it!)",3,17 November 2018,"I've not watched a lot of werewolf movies and I heard that this one was suppose to be good. I personally got bored during the movie, it was way to slow and predictable for me, I also thought that there were some plot holes during the film too. The special effects and that kind of stuff are okay considering when the movie was made. The conversation between the characters seemed cringe worthy at times and the acting is mehh. I don't get why this movie is so well liked but assume if you are really into werewolf films you should probably watch this.",An American Werewolf in London
367,ryannewbold,Great horror storytelling!,10,28 October 2021,Such a great classic that defines the 1980s horror really well. Acting was believable and filmmaking was top notch from what I can see here. John Landis' werewolf story tells a bleak comedic duo David and Jack who travel to Britain and come across a strange urban tale that becomes personal to them.,An American Werewolf in London
368,onnozuidema,Poor acting and not scary enough,4,1 August 2018,"Saw this movie when I was young and impressionable...; remember that I liked it. I just watched it again with my sons, but it was quite a letdown. The opening scene, with the two American boys roaming the English moors is still pretty strong, but from there it goes downhill. The acting is flat and unconvincing, especially from David Naughton who plays David, the main character. Jenny Agutter and John Woodvine as nurse and doctor fare a little better. There is some attempt at humor, which does not really work; horror and humor usually are not comfortable partners anyway. The transformation scene is still strong and has survived the test of time, but thereafter the werewolf appears as a totally different creature from the one we see emerging from transformation. Weird. There are very few moments which are actually scary, and the ending is rather abrupt and disappointing. My teenager sons (who love SF/horror classics like Alien and The Thing from roughly the same area) found the movie boring. Cannot disagree with them. If this is the ultimate werewolf movie (which a lot of people claim it is), I shiver to think what the rest might be.",An American Werewolf in London
369,howardkrieger,How disappointing!!,3,27 February 2006,"This movie lost all credibility and suspension of disbelief in the last fifteen minutes. If he really cared as much as he was whining about the whole movie, then why run away when he was being brought to someone who wanted to help. And the Doctor character was rendered totally useless after doing some great ""Children of the Corn"" type of investigatory work.My only guess is that we are left to think of the werewolf, who out loud is crying in his milk about his sanity, must just be really, really dumb. Oh, and everyone in London, especially the bobby's are idiots to boot apparently.Instead he does nothing until its too late and kills more people!! What a shame... this really had great potential, but bad character decisions (really inconsistent character decisions) shot this movie in the foot.",An American Werewolf in London
