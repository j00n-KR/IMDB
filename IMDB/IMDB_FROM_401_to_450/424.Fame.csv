0,TheLittleSongbird,Entertaining musical drama that could have been better,7,11 August 2014,"Fame is, at least to me, not a flawless film and it is easy to see why people wouldn't like or connect with it, but I found it to be a good, entertaining film. It is true that Ralph is given too much prominence and he is never really likable while some of the other characters are barely fleshed out and that the ending is far too abrupt and riddled with loose ends that were crying out to be tied up. Some of the dialogue is also a little rambling in places and with a structure that could have been tighter than it was. Fame, while very of the time, is very competently made with the style of filming appropriate for the type of film and what themes are explored, that some of the song and dance numbers are shot like a music video didn't come across as that much of a problem personally. The songs are terrific, the timeless title song, the infectiously catchy Hot Lunch Jam and the poignant Out Here on My Own are the highlights though the ending number I Sing the Body Electric is fun enough too. The score also won an Oscar along with the title song and deserved it thoroughly. The choreography is toe-tapping and spirited, especially in I Sing the Body Electric. The story captures the high school performing arts atmosphere really well, how fulfilling and fun yet punishing and competitive it is and has themes that anyone would relate to, ones that were relevant then and while not as much reasonably relevant now. While the characterisation is not perfect, there are a few good characters like Leroy and Coco. The performances show the actors very into their roles and enjoying them, Barry Miller does overact but if there was a favourite in the cast it would be Irene Cara, who had the best singing voice of the cast and the one with the best songs. In conclusion, has some imperfections in the writing department but musically especially the film while an acquired taste was personally entertaining. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Fame
1,SnoopyStyle,somewhat too scattered,6,26 February 2015,New kids come to audition for New York City High School of Performing Arts. Leroy Johnson is a tough kid dragged to help a girl audition but he gets picked instead. Bruno Martelli is more interested in modern music. Doris Finsecker is shy pushed by her mother. Lisa Monroe is a dancer since childhood but finds herself falling behind. Coco Hernandez (Irene Cara) is confident at everything. Montgomery MacNeil is gay. The movie follows these kids and their teachers over the next 4 years.The beauty of this are the various unknown actors. The drawback is also the same thing which suffers from a lack of focus on a specific character. The numbers of characters are so many and the time spent is so vast. It becomes a series of disjointed vignettes. It does get into the foreign world of the performing arts and some pretty interesting dramatic aspects. Gene Anthony Ray is electric in his audition scene. There are some great memorable big energetic dance sequences like the cafeteria and on the street. They have 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'. Some characters are inevitably more interesting than others which is different for every viewer. It is simply a bit too scattered.,Fame
2,Hitchcoc,Lots of Talent Is Enough,8,4 December 2018,"There are so many television offerings that take the untried and untested talents of this country and showcase them. Sometimes these are people who have never put themselves in front of an appreciable audience; sometimes they are already professional. I'm thinking of the difference between American Idol and The Voice. The latter sometimes has people who have backed up major stars, or already have several record albums. So this is fresh because it gives us the idol makers and the forces that push people to succeed or fail. Most of the criticism has been done by others. I honed in on each character and felt the pain and the energy. Pretty good movie but of a different time.",Fame
3,claudio_carvalho,Seeking a Spot in the Show Business,7,9 March 2008,"In New York, a group of freshmen join the High School for the Performing Arts after being well succeeded in their audition. For four years, their dreams, deceptions, success, love and personal dramas are disclosed though the insecure Doris Finsecker (Maureen Teefy), the homosexual Montgomery (Payl McCrane), the aggressive Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray), the hopeful Coco (Irene Cara), the ambitious Ralph Garci (Barry Miller) and their friends until their graduation day.Twenty-eight years ago, ""Fame"" was a great success, with the story of teenagers seeking a spot in the show business, and I loved this movie and the soundtrack on CD. I have just watched ""Fame"" on DVD, and presently I would say that it is a good movie with a great potential only, but with too many flawed subplots. The story follows too many characters and leaves many situations without answer. I do not know whether Alan Parker had edition problems to reduce the running time of this movie, but what happened, for example, with the ballerina that goes to a clinic for abortion? What happened with Leroy and his teacher, did he fail due to his grammar problem? What happened with Coco after undressing her blouse in the apartment of that crook? The musician that plays synthesizer and his proud father are left behind in the subplot. Anyway, ""Fame"" is still a delightful entertainment and a cult-movie for me. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Fama"" (""Fame"")",Fame
4,jboothmillard,Fame,4,31 May 2010,"I don't know if I would class this as a musical, but it is certainly a teen drama with some songs and performances in it that I wanted to try, from BAFTA nominated director Alan Parker (Bugsy Malone, Midnight Express, Mississippi Burning). Basically the story is set at New York High School for the Performing Arts, where the newest students are training to achieve their goals to become great singers, actors and performers. The four students that the film mainly follows are black wannabe starlet Coco Hernandez (Golden Globe nominated Irene Cara), shy and less than confident Doris Finsecker (Maureen Teefy), gay and sensitive Montgomery MacNeil (Paul McCrane), and the often aggressive Raul Garcia (Barry Miller). The film follows their journey from auditioning to be in the school, singing and dancing rehearsals, personal downfalls in their bid to get somewhere, including Coco unintentionally going into pornography, and of course graduation with the whole gang performing on stage. Also starring Eddie Barth as Angelo, Lee Curreri as Bruno, Laura Dean as Lisa Monroe, Antonia Franceschi as Hilary Van Doren, Boyd Gaines as Michael and Gene Anthony Ray as Leroy. I mainly heard about the film first because of the title song ""Fame"" going to number one in the UK, and then again when Justin Lee Collins tried to get Irena Cera on board for the Bring Back... Fame reunion, which she refused. I will be honest in saying that I wasn't completely interested in the story, more the singing and dancing, but even that didn't stop me thinking this wasn't really my cup of tea, but it certainly wasn't bad. It won the Oscar for Best Music for Michael Gore and Best Song for the title song (it also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Song for ""Out Here on My Own"", Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music and Best Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy and Best Original Score. Okay!",Fame
5,BA_Harrison,I just can't control my feet.,8,29 May 2019,"Alan Parker's Fame is part gritty realism and part musical. When it's the former, it's a thoroughly engrossing character-driven tale, following the students' highs and lows during their four years at the New York High School of the Performing Arts; when it's the latter, it's freaking hilarious, the film verging on the absurd as the kids burst into energetic song and dance at the drop of a single musical note, the frenetic gyrating and warbling at complete odds to the more sedate drama. It's a good job I like absurd.A canteen musical scene sees the students striking up a song, combining their talents perfectly despite no prior practice, with even the dinner ladies getting in on the action, but the funniest moment has to be when the father of keyboard geek Bruno (Lee Curreri) blasts his son's music from speakers mounted on his taxi: like the Pied Piper, he draws the kids onto the streets, where they prance and pirouette, climbing on top of, and dancing on, stationary cars. It's all so silly, but played perfectly straight - I loved it!With fashion, music, and the city of New York having changed so much over the past four decades, the film has obviously dated, but that's a big part of its charm: it's a time capsule, capturing the energy and vibrancy of the disco/funk era, and of the city in which it is set.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for Paul McCrane as closeted ginger-mopped homosexual Montgomery MacNeil, who, seven years later, would appear in one of my favourite movies, Robocop, playing loathsome criminal Emil. Boy, that actor has range.",Fame
6,moonspinner55,It builds up--and then insults--its own characters,6,11 September 2004,"""Fame""--about a collection of students attending the four-year Manhattan's School for the Performing Arts--looks right, feels right and sometimes sounds right; soon, however, the film becomes a muddled soap opera about talented young people reaching too high for their stars. Screenwriter Christopher Gore builds up and then insults or humiliates his own characters--and for what purpose? To show that even eager, ambitious, talented kids have to learn humility? Director Alan Parker has alert eyes and ears, and he knows how to lighten the mood of any scene with a bit of raucous humor, so that things never get too heavy. Sharper editing might have left some of Parker and Gore's pretensions and absurdities, such as with the gay student who comes out not just once (to his girlfriend), but twice (to his teacher and classmates). In the next scene, that same young man is seen in tight close-up putting on lipstick; this is done for a sniggering effect, which is stupefying once one realizes that the entire class is getting dolled-up to look like characters from ""Rocky Horror"". This manufactured loss of dignity is then repeated with all the major characters, including the promising disco queen, the wealthy white ballerina, the talkative dancer, the stand-up comedian and the illiterate who may not graduate because of his failing grades. If people respond to the movie, it's due to the cinematography (which captures some of New York City's squalor and dusty classrooms with a bracing realism), the propulsive soundtrack and the cynical-funny talk. The characters are quite a different matter--they become plot-mechanisms, their pitfalls punctuated by a director who can almost be heard saying, ""Don't let this happen to you!"" Oscar for title song; Gore's script and another song, the ballad ""Out Here On My Own"", were Oscar-nominated. **1/2 from ****",Fame
7,Quinoa1984,I feel sorry for some people here,2,16 January 2001,"When I say I feel sorry for people here I'm not talking about the teachers who have to put up with the same kids year after year, or even the students who have to go through such horrible c**p to get in (they made there bed, now they lie in it).  Truthfully, I feel sorry for the people in the cars who have to wait in heavy NY traffic not because of an car accident or a pothole, because the dance kids have to break out into a impromptu dance number.I'm not saying this film doesn't have a good premise, but the way it is executed almost makes me want to execute the guy agreed to make this(which is ironic considering I like Parker's The Wall and Angela's Ashes and almost feel pity he was put here to direct).  The plot follows a group of teens who get accepted into the NY school of performing arts and shows how tough it is too get in and how tough it is to stay in.  There are some moments of insight and even some good performances.  But the overall corniness and horrible quality bring this film to a halt.  Blah.  D",Fame
8,sunwarrior13,A Musical Featuring High School Students,9,3 May 2014,"Fame is a film that is set at New York's High School of Performing Arts.It focuses on talented teens that train for showbiz careers. The story concentrates on five of the most gifted students namely:singer Coco Hernander,actor Ralph Garci/Raul Garcia,actor Leroy Johnson, and musician Bruno Martelli.They also include the story of the faculty members such as:Mr. Benjamin Shorofsky,a musical instructor; Elizabeth Sherwood,an English teacher; and Lydia,a dance instructor. The story covers four years of High School.It stars Lee Curreri,Irene Cara,Paul McCrane,Maureen Teefy,Barry Miller and Debbie Allen.Alan Parker directed the film.This is definitely an entertaining musical film.Anyone who wants to reminisce the 80's and their high school days will surely appreciate it.Aside from that,we are treated to great songs,musical performances and dance numbers.Who could forget Irene Cara's Oscar winning song,Fame and her other Oscar nominated song,Out Here on My Own?Aside from that,we are also treated to stories about High School students that experience different issues in life such as peer pressure,their sensitivity,overcoming pressures and expectations when showcasing their talents and achieving their potential in life.It may not be realistic all the time but is still one movie that will still surely enjoy after all these years.",Fame
9,preppy-3,GREAT songs but has serious problems in drama,7,6 April 2005,"Film follows a bunch of students in the NYC High School of the Performing Arts. There's Coco (Irene Cara) a black singer who WILL make it to the top despite everything. She's helped by Bruno (Lee Curren) a white musician. Then there's Doris (Maureen Teefy) who wants to be an actress--but she's shy and scared. She becomes friends with Motgomery (Paul McCrane)--purportedly the only gay student in the school and is romanced by Raul (Barry Miller). Then there's Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray--who sadly died in 2003) who's homeless and a great dancer--but can't read. Then there's various teachers (Albert Hague, Anne Meara stand out) trying to teach the kids.The songs are GREAT (the title tune and ""Out Here On My Own"" were nominated for Best Song--""Fame"" won), the dances are energetic and the young cast shows plenty of ambition and talent. BUT this film misses the boat in the drama department. Many plot lines are brought up and completely left open-ended by the end of the movie. Why did Coco do a porno? Did Doris and Raul remain together afterwords? Did either make it? How about Montgomery--what happened to him? And did Leroy ever graduate--and how? There are too many long speeches (Raul has two) and moments that just lead to nothing. I'm assuming there were cuts in the script--I can't believe the movie just left all this open. Still, it's worth seeing for the acting and, again, the music. There's basically not one bad song and the dances go full force (and at one point stop traffic--literally!). My favorites are ""Fame"", ""Out Here..."" and ""I Sing the Body Electric"" which is a great closing song. So I recommend it but can only give it a 7--the script really needed to tie up loose ends--and it didn't.Trivia: They wanted to shot this film at the actual School for Performing Arts but couldn't get permission. The dean of the school read the script and said there was way too much swearing in the film. That is true--there is a LOT of foul language but that's how high school kids talk. Avoid the TV version which abysmally overdubs it.",Fame
10,evanston_dad,"Silly, Contrived, But Somehow Lovable",6,5 December 2007,"Nobody broke out into spontaneous song and dance at my high school. Of course, I also didn't go to Juilliard.""Fame"" was a sort of transition film, bridging the gap between the more traditional movie musicals of the 1960s and 70s and the MTV-style musicals of the 1980s. In ""Fame,"" characters do break into song, but when they do, the song looks more like a music video than anything else.Some of those songs are terrific (like the iconic title number performed by Irene Cara), and some are just stupid, like the lunchroom number. The movie is full of hot-button issues and melodramatic subplots that would make any tweener salivate, but the film is nearly impossible to take seriously once you're past the age of, say, 25. Still, it's directed with a fair amount of style by Alan Parker, and it goes down easily enough.Grade: B+",Fame
11,JamesHitchcock,Too obnoxious to care about,5,24 December 2009,"Although the traditional cinema musical, generally based upon a successful Broadway show, went into something of a decline in the late seventies and eighties, this period saw the rise of a new musical genre based around dance and pop music. Like ""Saturday Night Fever"" and its sequel ""Staying Alive"", ""Flashdance"", ""Grease"" and ""Dirty Dancing"", ""Fame"" is an example of this trend. The original title for the film was, apparently, to have been ""Hot Lunch "", but this had to be changed when director Alan Parker realised that there was already a pornographic film with the same title. The change was doubtless one for the better; I cannot really imagine Irene Cara singing ""Hot Lunch! I'm Gonna Live Forever!""The film follows a group of students through their studies at the New York High School of Performing Arts, which was a real institution at the time. It is split into sections entitled ""Auditions"", ""Freshman Year"", ""Sophomore Year"", ""Junior Year"" and ""Senior Year"", and hence takes place over a time-span of some four years. The opening scenes have something of the feel of a ""fly on the wall"" documentary about them, As the film progresses we get to know the various students and something of their stories. New York, of course, is a famously multi-ethnic city, and the film-makers were obviously keen to reflect this racial diversity by including at least one representative of most of the city's various ethnic groups (Jewish, Hispanic, Italian, Black, Irish and WASP). Dance student Leroy Johnson struggles with his academic work, which at this school is given equal weighting with performance, because he is illiterate. Lisa Monroe, another dance student, is dismissed from the course for not working hard enough, and switches to the drama department. Montgomery MacNeil, a drama student, comes out as gay, probably a more daring plot-line in 1980 than it would be today, when it is virtually compulsory for every high school drama to have a token gay character. I wondered if his Christian name was a reference to the gay film star Montgomery Clift. Raul Garcia, an aspiring stand-up comic, prefers to be called Ralph Garcey in order to hide his Puerto Rican background. His great ambition is to be the next Freddie Prinze- not the future Mr. Sarah Michelle Gellar, who would only have been four years old in 1980, but his father Freddie senior, another Puerto Rican comedian who died in 1977. Unfortunately Ralph seems to feel that the best way of achieving this ambition is to ape Prinze's self-destructive lifestyle. ""Fame"" was clearly popular in the early eighties, spawning a television series and a stage musical. That irritatingly catchy theme song provided Cara with a huge chart hit. The basic concept is obviously still thought to be a viable one, because there has been a recent remake (which I have not seen). Yet like many of the musicals of this period, although not perhaps as much as the likes of ""Saturday Night Fever"", the original film seems rather dated today. (The one which seems to have held up the best is ""Grease"", probably because that was always intended as a defiantly deliberate anachronism, being twenty years behind the times even when it is made). The song-and-dance numbers are lively enough, even if the music is not always to my personal taste. Yet there are other reasons, quite apart from its old-fashioned feel, why ""Fame"" is not my favourite film. One is that, despite the film's apparent aim of celebrating New York's ethnic diversity, too many characters are seen in terms of ethnic stereotypes. (African-Americans are bolshie with a bad attitude, Hispanics ditto, Jewish mothers are domineering and over-protective, etc.)Another reason I didn't like the film much is that too many of the characters are just too obnoxious to care about. I would agree with the reviewer who found Ralph a ""boorish self-centred jerk"" but unlike that reviewer I found several of the other characters equally unpleasant. I could not sympathise with the bad-tempered, petulant Leroy and his frequent outbursts of rage, mostly directed at his long-suffering English teacher. Nor with Ralph's girlfriend Doris Finsecker, as keen to deny her Jewish identity as he is to deny his Hispanic one. (She renames herself ""Dominique DuPont"", largely because she knows this will annoy her mother). Nor with the bone-idle Lisa. Irene Cara's character Coco Hernandez is difficult to sympathise with for another reason; not because she is a jerk but because she seems too naive to be true. She is taken advantage of by a man posing as a film director who offers her a ""screen test""; she turns up at his apartment even though he is played as an obviously sleazy sexual predator. (Had he seemed more plausible this plot line would have had more credibility). Montgomery is one of the film's few likable characters, but the film does not concentrate on his story to any great extent. He largely functions as the school's kindly agony uncle, a shoulder for his heterosexual classmates to cry on. My final complaint about the film is that there are too many main characters. Even the film's two and a half hour running time is inadequate to do justice to all these stories, some of which could have provided enough material for a whole film in their own right, and few of them are fully developed. Alan Parker has made some excellent films, including ""Mississippi Burning"" and ""Evita"", but ""Fame"" is not really one of them. It is perhaps ironic for a film with this particular title that few of its stars, except Cara, went on to achieve any great fame of their own. 5/10",Fame
12,ElMaruecan82,High Spirits and Low Self-Esteems...,8,23 September 2021,"It would have been quite an unfortunately ironic title had Alan Parker's ""Fame"" not be the success and ultimately youth-defining movie it was. But his instinct proved right when he chose to retitle the film with this simple and yet emotionally loaded word instead of the initially intended ""Hot Lunch"" (referring to what the student gets besides seven courses a day). So the film doesn't kid itself, ""Fame"" is what drives the youngsters who come to the New York City's High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts (which includes dancing, acting and music) and in a sort of delightful paradox, they are both the ""performers"" and ""instruments"" of their own feelings, which captures the high spirit of young boys and girls who know what make their lives worthwhile and the torments of eventually failing in that oh so risky endeavor.One character would have been enough to embody all these dreams, doubts and their sets of emotional contradictions, but Parker and screenwriter Christopher Gore (was he related to composer Michael Gore?) gratify us with a gallery of characters who miraculously look genuine and sincere and leave us with the impression that they did gain maturity in these two hours that felt like four years when the film concludes as brazenly and flamboyant as it started. At that point, I feel I should list them all, there's Barry Miller as Ralph Garcia, a Hispanic histrion who idolizes Freddie Prinze and uses so much of bravura and confidence there's something suspiciously overloaded, we suspect it's a matter of time before his confidence starts shattering down and reveal the real vulnerabilities and the wounds that inspired him to make people people laugh at him so they wouldn't cry.There's Maureen Teeft as Doris Finecker a painfully shy girl who considers herself as flamboyant as a 'bagel' but through her restitution of ""The Way We Were"" reveals a sort of inner vulnerability the acting teacher (Jim Maugrey) immediately notices. Doris is the heart of the film, a girl who grew up under the protective pampering of a Jewish mother (Tresa Hughes), and could pass as a bland colorless WASP-ish girl and it also take time for her to grow a character and understand that one doesn't need to look exotic to take you places. There's Gene Anthony Ray as Leroy Johnson a young Black kid who only came to accompany his girlfriend only to get himself picked instead of her, a subplot shows him in conflict with Mrs Sherwood (Anne Meara) and provides a nice reversal of accusations at the end.There's Paul McCrane as a timid young man who's often with a nice thing to say and far before it became trendy revealed that he had a relationship with his psychiatrist, ""how do you call that?"", asks Doris ""Homosexual"". He's the one who maintains his gentleness and sweetness revealing that if you're not with a specific arc on your own, you can help other characters to fix their own. Irene Cara who sang the iconic ""Fame"" song is given a substantial role as a bridge between the dancing and acting departments, she develops a friendship with Bruno Mantelli (Lee Curreiri), a recluse player who incarnates the new synthesizer craze, which earns him a rivalry with the music teacher played by Albert La Hague. Finally, you have the newcomer played by Anthonia Francesca and who becomes instantly popular and Laura Dean as Lisa, a dancer who puts so much ""lips"" she forgets to let the legs sweat.In what I think is the most underrated scene, she's told by the dance teacher Miss Berg (Joanna Merlin) that she doesn't have what it takes and that exchange could sum up half the reality shows of the 2000s. And really that's what ""Fame"" is, it's got a taste of reality that Parker knows how to turn into a spectacular and entertaining energetic film, fully knowing that this wasn't the material for a character study but something to be both deep and enjoyable on a superficial level. The auditions part alone is nothing short of a masterpiece of editing, making swing back and forth between all the department, creating a sort of ebullient chaos from which the best creation can merge. The idea of creative destruction is almost efficiently conveyed in the first musical moment in the canteen where all students are jamming and then in a sort of symbiosis, perform the ""Hot Lunch"" song. The ""Fame"" part is perhaps the least authentic but we'd forgive it since it provides the film its signature song.Thankfully, Parker doesn't play these songs like musicals (à la ""Grease"") but like a performance musical making the art a continuation of the plot, until the graduation part and its ""Out Here On My Own"" song which is the apotheosis the story called for.But the true merit of ""Fame"" is to be long enough to make the passing of time feel real and with it the effect of its main characters, and to never over-dramatize it with subplots that would belong to other genres, we can almost see some maturity growing from the Sophomore to the Freshman years, more conflicts or deeper feelings in the later years until each one gets more or less successful breaks in the industry. Garci in the standup comedy routine, Coco meeting a sleazy auteur filmmaker in a sordid scene that oddly doesn't get any mention after, and Doris who finds in acting a new area of expression. The film also never implies that all these kids will ever be successful, subverting the film's every tagline, ""even everything they've got wouldn't be enough"".And it's that uncertainty that truly makes the frontier clear between arts and other jobs endeavors and that ""Fame"" effectively captures, making a bridge between the 70s a decade from which youngsters didn't emerge totally unscathed and the 80s with their premises of glitter-laden flamboyance and rehabilitation of stardom and success.",Fame
13,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Stars in their eyes.,5,22 August 2020,"Though it's supposed to be ironically titled, portraying the pitfalls of chasing its eponymous acclaim, 'Fame (1980)' ends up falling firmly in the category it's supposedly trying to subvert. It is slightly more experimental than you may expect, comprised of vignette-esque sequences only loosely related to character. Indeed, it takes a long time to properly focus on its half a dozen main players and, even then, some of them get lost along the way. Ultimately, it doesn't feel like it's about anything, really. Its characters don't change all that much and its intensity level remains similar throughout. Only a handful of scenes surprise with their starkness but they tend to feel out of place and tonally inconsistent precisely because of their infrequent nature. As it heads towards its finale, the film becomes more engaging. However, it's never exactly a compelling experience. For a long time, in fact, it's distinctly the opposite. 5/10",Fame
14,gbill-74877,Heartfelt and captivating,9,12 October 2018,"I love so many aspects of this film that I'm surprised it doesn't have a higher average rating. From its very beginning, with a brilliant audition sequence that has director Alan Parker switching between a number of characters and scenes, the film had me. Soon afterwards he hits it with the first of the musical numbers, an impromptu song and dance that breaks out in the lunch room, which captures the power of creative people feeding off one another. How that leads to the quieter girl (Maureen Teefy) escaping the noise to sit with a sensitive young man (Paul McCrane) and start up a friendship is also very nice. 'Fame' was ahead of its time in giving us a diverse cast, and that's in a lot of ways - race, language, body shape, sexual orientation, and economic background. It really captures the spirit of New York, and this is heightened by shots on the streets and in the subway. There are so many items it touches on - homophobia, abuse, violence, sexual harassment, and abortion. It celebrates the beauty of the arts, while at the same time cautioning just how difficult it is to make a career out of them. Its spirit is infectious, and it's filled with poignant moments.Parker effectively uses an ensemble cast, each of whom contributes, but Barry Miller stands out as Ralph Garci, with a number of fine scenes: his impromptu acting during the audition (""I'm God, see?""), his recounting the pain of finding out Freddie Prinze had died, his telling his friends the real truth about his father, his lashing out a priest after his 5-year-old sister is assaulted (""Since when are you in the thinking business?""), and in bombing at a standup comedy club. It's a brilliant, powerful performance.Irene Cara sings on a number of the tracks, including the wonderful title song, and also provides a heartbreaking moment when she's lured into posing topless in the apartment of a man posing as an indie film director. There are so many dangers that surround these kids, and the honesty of this predatory scene is a forerunner to the #metoo movement. It's too bad it's offset somewhat by Parker himself giving us two immature voyeuristic scenes of the boys peering into the girls changing room.McCrane's descriptions of his growing sexual awareness, and the reaction he relates from his therapist (""He said it was probably a life choice""), is also touching. I liked the simple earnestness with which he portrayed this character, and his scene consoling Ralph Garci at the end (where Garci says ""How do you know if you're good? Maybe you never know""). Without going through the rest of the big cast, I'll just add that I loved Jim Moody as the drama teacher, and wished his role hadn't tailed off after the sophomore year. That is one of the film's weaknesses - stories are unfinished and characters either disappear or certainly aren't all wrapped up with a big bow as in other movies - but this is also a strength in some ways. It gives the film the sense of how memories from the past are, and the ambiguity leaves it to us to imagine how the characters' lives played out. I think of 'Fame' as a collection of great moments, highlighting the arts, the human spirit, and growing up in a tough world which has so much danger and disappointment. Heartfelt and captivating, it's a great film.",Fame
15,kenjha,Music and Melodrama,7,17 January 2011,"Students go through four years at a NYC school for the performing arts. It gets off to a terrific start, as students audition for the various classes. These early scenes are well edited and full of energy, providing glimpses into the key elements of music, dance, and drama classes. Much of the middle of the film is devoted to exploring the backgrounds of the various students, and this is where it bogs down and feels too contrived and melodramatic. The music is good throughout, highlighted by ""Out Here On My Own,"" ""I Sing the Body Electric,"" and the title song. The students are played by mostly unknown actors, and ironically, for most of them this film was the height of their fame.",Fame
16,Rodrigo_Amaro,"Good Drama, Low Musical",6,23 May 2010,"For those who watched Bob Fosse's ""All That Jazz"" (1979) first minutes when Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is casting a few dancers to his show and we seen thousands of them dancing to the sound of George Benson's ""On Broadway"", and there are a few cuts when Joe and his crew are rejecting most of this dancers. Well, this first ten minutes of Fosse's classic equal half hour of Alan Parker's ""Fame"". All we seen on the screen is a bunch of young people trying their best in musical numbers, dance numbers and acting numbers, people working hard (or not) to be admitted in a art school. After they're get into what they like and the classes starts they need to proof to others and to themselves that they're capable of performing their arts on stage.The movie focuses on a small group of actors, dancers and musicians trying to find their place in the world. This world most precisely is an chaotic and loudly Bronx, New York. Here Irene Cara, Barry Miller, Paul McCrane (best performance here and better known as the adorable and hateful Dr. Romano from ""E.R.""), Eddie Barth, Laura Dean and others actors play several characters on the way to success. Between their dramatical ascension (sometimes funny moments) and auditions and lessons there's time for some musical stages (best scene is when ""Fame"" is played at the street with everybody dancing) and a few boring songs and musical numbers.As a drama film the movie works very well, and the unknown cast made the film looks very nice, something almost like an documentary about struggling teens. As a musical it's quite tedious sometimes and there's not enough interesting numbers. Not to mention the fact that all the dance numbers are confusing, didn't expressed emotion enough, and all the dancers are dancing and jumping in a very confusing way sometimes. There isn't order while they dance, looks like a rebellion of dancers that worked very wrong. Director Alan Parker made better in his future films (""Evita"", ""The Commitments"" and ""Pink Floyd The Wall""). But that doesn't mean that all the drama scenes were good. No, there's too much drama in some scenes (the dance teacher at the hospital and other scenes). If it wasn't for some funny moments or funny characters this could be a depressive movie. The best dramatic scenes are played by the acting class when the teacher says to his students that they need to show a painful moment in their lives and present to class the stages of fear and angry. That's when we find out that one of the characters is gay and he's in love for his annalist, the other hates to present herself singing at a child's party, and the one whose worst day was when he discovered that his idle Freddie Prinze had died. Those are some the richer moments of ""Fame"". It's also a good film if you enjoy those brain dead reality shows where unknown talented (or not) persons are performing live before a million of viewers. I liked many of the characters of this movie mainly because they're nice, they come from different backgrounds and had some good stories to share. The difference of ""Fame"" and those reality shows is that in the film you don't have a screenwriter trying to ""sell"" you a image, saying that a character is good and the other is bad, and you must vote because he's cute and not because he's singing and dancing. TV manipulates too much and at the end many of the contestants are only participating because they want to be on TV, making a fool of themselves sometimes. It's a public humiliation (not as hard as it was showed here when the talented actress Coco was deceived by a guy who wanted her to be in a film and it turned out to be a pornographer). Perhaps ""Fame"" lacked of a criticism or it has a few of it to show but it's more an entertaining film. 6/10",Fame
17,Ed-Shullivan,Past the freshness date around 1989,5,16 September 2018,"I have seen the film Fame a few times now over the past four (4) decades and unlike film classics such as (1961) West Side Story, or (1957) Jailhouse Rock, (1980) Fame is a period piece that may have had its admirers back in the early 1980's but it will never retain a film fan base such as the latter two films mentioned above.Maybe the film was inspirational and maybe even slightly ahead of its time back in 1980, but it has quickly lost its lustre with each song and dance number played. Another sign that the film is past its freshness date is to ask yourself what ever happened to the cast members of the film Fame? Just like the picture, the film stars also quickly past their freshness date and as the film so have the actors fallen into obscurity.I will kindly rate the film a generous 5 out of 10 rating.",Fame

19,LeonardKniffel,Ushering in Generation X,8,1 May 2020,"This chronicle of the lives of several teenagers who attend a New York high school for students gifted in the performing arts stars Irene Cara, who sings a number of memorable hits, including the title tune and ""Out Here on My Own."" The cast's rendering of ""I Sing the Body Electric"" is also memorable. This movie is often said to have ushered in the self-centered youth culture of the 1980s. I don't give it that much credit but it does mark the coming of age of Generation X. Movies, especially musicals, rarely usher in social movements; rather, they reflect them long after they are a fait accomplis. In 2009, MGM released an updated and blander version of life at the same school by the same title and featuring the title tune as a curtain call. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",Fame
20,KnightsofNi11,You don't have to be a fan of musicals to enjoy Fame,7,19 January 2011,"Musicals are something most people tend to have pretty strong opinions about either leading one way or the other. There are those people who adore musicals and others who despise them. I place myself somewhere in the middle of these two ends of the spectrum. I don't hate musicals by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm not particularly fond of them. I don't particularly enjoy the whole idea of characters randomly breaking into song for no reason, especially when it doesn't further the plot whatsoever. My suspension of disbelief is shattered when the characters begin singing away their issues with no clear motivation as to why. On stage there is a lot of greatness that can be done with musicals, but on film I try to steer clear of them. However, if I had to recommend one musical, Fame would definitely be up on the list. It is a musical that places its musical numbers in appropriate and relevant spots. The film is really a drama before it is a musical. Plus it centers around a group of characters who are the kind of people who would break out into song and dance in real life. Obviously not to the extent that these characters do, but that's because Fame is still a musical.Fame is about a group of high school students who go to school at a prestigious performing arts school in New York. The film follows a large ensemble of characters from their auditions to get into school all the way to graduation. Obviously it is a very character driven story and, for the most part, each character is very interesting and develops a lot throughout the movie. The characters span all sorts of personalities, backgrounds, and attitudes towards high school. But they all share one thing in common, and that is a love for performing arts. And it is through this that they can all relate. And they do all relate through some method or another. Friendships develop and enemies are made. Each character intertwines with the others, some more than the rest, but it all accumulates into a great character study.In a film with so many stories going on and intertwining at the same time, a directors juxtaposition skills have to be tight and concise. Alan Parker is a very skilled director, and he shows it in the beginning of the film. The film begins by introducing us to all the characters through their auditions to get into the school. It makes for a great opening to the film. Each character is introduced in some unique fashion and we get a good sense of whose going to be important and what archetypal role each character will likely play. Of course by the end of the opening I started to get the feeling that there were going to be a lot of characters. And there were a bunch. Towards the middle of the film a lot of the smaller roles stopped showing up as much and it was clearly defined which were the central characters of the film. However, towards the end of the film Parker's ability to juxtapose these story lines started to dwindle. There are three main characters that become the central focus of the story and the others sort of fade away. We don't hear from some of the other characters for a long stretch of time until they are brought back up towards the end.I'm still trying to figure out the ending and whether I liked it or not. It is very abrupt and leaves all the characters stories open ended. Nothing seems to be resolved in the end of the film. One could make the argument that this is a smart element to include in the film as it leaves it all open to interpretation. But I was still taken aback by the abruptness of the ending and its lack of explanation or catharsis. The film does end with an incredible musical number with a very powerful song. I still feel like I would have been happier if a little more work towards the storyline had gone towards the ending.Fame's greatest quality is its great balance between the fantastic music and its sincere dramatic elements. There is a deep story here that deals with the difficulties of growing up as a teenager and coping with the world around you, especially when you are trying so hard to express a passion for something so close to your heart. I said before that each of these characters comes from very different walks of life and this plays heavily into this storytelling aspect. There are some incredibly gripping monologues delivered brilliantly by the actors. The film is really well written to begin with, and some moments of the film are tear jerkingly gripping. There are some truly powerful moments in Fame, both through dialouge and music.Fame is good as a drama and a musical. It has lots of great songs that are performed by great actors that have a lot of acting talent as well as musical talent. I was very impressed by how great some of the dancing and singing was in this movie. Fame might have a few too many characters, causing it to get a little lost towards the end of the film. The ending is surprisingly abrupt, but can still be effective depending on how you interpret it. I enjoyed Fame a lot more than I thought I would and I would recommend it to anybody, even those who aren't big fans of musicals.",Fame
21,TOMASBBloodhound,Good. Could have been great.,7,10 January 2007,"A recent survey of children in the UK re-enforced the notion put forth by this film 27 years ago. That being more than anything else, young people want to grow up to be somebody famous. It used to be doctors and firemen that kids wanted to be. Now, everyone wants to be famous. Fame is a story of a group of kids accepted into the High School for Performing Arts in New York City. We seen them first audition, then take classes and learn about life for the next four years. The film has a lot of fine qualities, but ultimately leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied.Alan Parker's bold directorial style fits the story pretty well. The film has been classified as a musical, but more than anything it is a drama. Musical numbers and dance routines break out here and there, and Parker keeps them as close to realistic as they really could have been filmed. The acting is for the most part top-drawer with a few exceptions. The pacing is a little off, particularly toward the end of the film, but by that point, the story has already taken a few wrong turns anyway.First off, the auditions at the beginning of the film should have weeded a couple of the principle characters out. It seems unlikely that anyone would show up and audition for one department, then stumble their way through admissions to another. Some of these people just don't look that talented or interested to begin with. Once the first year of classes gets going, the film settles into a nice groove. The interaction between students and teachers is very well handled, and it leaves you wanting more. The film begins to lose itself later on as we see more and more of the students' lives out of school. Some of these people just aren't worth caring about.The film's biggest mistake is making the Ralph Garcy character so prominent. This guy is a boorish; self-centered jerk. A ""professional a-hole"" as he proudly declares on stage during his comedy routines. The audience is supposed to somehow feel for this guy and his tragic personal situation, but I was just hoping they'd throw his butt out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people you'll care about by the time this film is over. Try as I might, I still can't develop abs like Gene Anthony Ray had in this film.Overall this film is good. It is memorable, interesting, and full of daring scenes and performances. It runs maybe a little too long, and perhaps some of the wrong characters get fully developed while others kind of hover in the background. The musical numbers are great, and there is even a surprise or two waiting to be discovered by the time the film is over. Though not perfect, Fame will be a film that lives on in one way or another for many years to come.7 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Fame

If only they would carry on making movies like this. Fame is brilliant. 10/10",Fame
23,movieguy1021,Fame: 2/10,2,1 May 2004,"Fame did something odd. It was not only a musical that was created originally for the screen (most are based off of Broadway musicals), but it spawned a TV series and a Broadway musical. Let me correct that sentence. Fame is not a musical. Musicals have song numbers in order to advance the plot or to show characters' feelings. The singing in this music is not used to do either; in fact, there's no use for it at all. People just randomly sing to fit in with the plot. And that's not the type of musical I know.The so-called plot of Fame has an onslaught of characters (who are all introduced at once-last time I saw that in a movie [Gosford Park] it had disastrous results) who audition for, and get into, New York High School for the Performing Arts. All of them are in for different reasons-i.e. acting, singing, etc. Quote-unquote drama unfolds as these middle-aged people pretending to be teenagers go through their four years.My largest complaint is that the high school is supposed to be selective. After all, it's a free college, and they can't let everyone in. So how is it that some people who are really bad get into the college? Obviously so that drama could ensue between all of these different people. And why is the person top billed not even in the movie until near the end, for no reason at all, except to make us feel uncomfortable? There's many unsettling situations that these untalented people get into, yet you can't feel bad for them because you don't know who they are! These relationships occur between people whose names you don't know. And these characters realize things about themselves throughout the course of the movie, yet you don't realize that, because you don't know what they were like in the first place.As for the singing, it pops in randomly (and is supposed to be humorous?) and does nothing. When the title song is sung, it's played in the middle of a street and before you can say Ferris Bueller everyone's in the middle of the street dancing wildly and off-beat to it. The song itself is fine, but the whole scene, like the whole movie, is unnecessary. Fame is an unpleasant movie, to say the least. I would say more, but most of the movie has thankfully gone out of my head. Just don't see it. You'll be doing yourself a favor.My rating: 2/10Rated R for language.",Fame
24,bbewnylorac,Lovely film,10,20 June 2012,"Fame wears its heart on its sleeve -- unashamedly and it's brilliant. Recently I rediscovered on Itunes the song 'I Sing the Body Electric' and I just can't fault it. I realised it's one of my favourite songs. So much to love about it -- the beautiful singing of the different singers, in their own way; the lyrics; the orchestration and the blend of rock, gospel and classical styles. The song's ending is perfect. The song seems to embody the energy and poignancy and passion of youth, as did Alan Parker's much later film The Commitments. Sure, you can be cynical about putting a group of kids on screen and getting them to swear, sing and dance and emote, but if you put that aside, Fame rocks!!",Fame
25,Idocamstuf,Underrated Classic,9,8 September 2003,"I cant believe this film only got a 6.3.  I just finished watching it for the first time, and I was very impressed.  This is one of the last real and serious coming of age movies, I know I am probubly biased because I am studying acting myself, and I could really relate to all of those characters.  This is also a great example of director Alan Parker's(Mississippi Burning, Angel Heart, Midnight Express, and yuck!! ""Evita) work.  A truly great film that really shows what its like to be studying to have a career in performing arts, and also reminds us of that time period.  Once again, I am amazed at that low 6.3 rating, I think it deserves at least like a 7.2.  I'll give it an 8/10, though.",Fame
26,RiffRaffMcKinley,Lights up the sky like a dead firefly,2,13 April 2008,"No matter what you've heard, ""Fame"" is not a good movie. It's not worth the investment of over two hours to watch stereotypically troubled teens dancing, singing, learning, and staring at girls in the dressing rooms.Every cliché finds a cozy little home in this movie. There's a gay teenager looking for acceptance. That would have been great if it had been treated as anything more than a secondary plot point. There's a ghetto kid who has too much attitude-- what, was I surprised? And guess what? They all want to become big stars, finding fame and fortune, and they'd all be willing to crawl over their own mothers' smoking corpses to get it.Oddly enough, this film is remembered for its music. But in actuality, the only moderately good song is ""Hot Lunch Jam,"" which is still too cheesy to be of any real quality. The two most popular songs are nothing, either. ""Fame"" is meaningless fluff drowned out by the sheer spectacle of a massive dancing-in-the-streets scene. And ""I Sing the Body Electric"" (what in Bubba's name does that even mean?!?!?!?!?) is just an incomprehensible joke.Bad acting, tasteless dialog, and hack direction (it is, after all, from the director of ""Evita"") are only marginally helped by Michael Seresin's appropriately ordinary camera work.

But time wore out this picture, and what it remains is a story of how much you sweat and fight to be someone at show business.

We follow several students throughout their high school careers and watch them grow. We see them go through all the crap that is high school, the tragedies, the triumphs and the temptations. We want them to succeed, crying over the tragedies, and rejoicing in their triumphs.These actors, dancers, musicians and singers are all phenomenally talented. The music is memorable and is a wonderful fit for the plot.I just can't help but wonder why some of these genuinely talented people never made more of a name for themselves on screen after this movie.Gotta see this movie",Fame
29,Gideon24,A strikingly original musical,8,8 March 2015,"Fame was a hip and contemporary 1980 musical that was an inside look at the lives of a disparate group of talented teenagers at the High School of Performing Arts in New York. The episodic film takes a close look at the inner workings of show business and what drives performers to go through the work and constant rejection that being in the business involves. The film opens on a particular freshman year at the school and concludes four years later.Along the way we meet Montgomery McNeill (Paul McCrane), the neglected son of a famous actress who despite his lonely childhood, still finds the business enticing. Maureen Teefy is wonderful as Doris Finsecker, a painfully shy teen who has been pushed into the business by her mother, but does come out of her shell at the school and discovers a talent for acting. Irene Cara plays CoCo Hernandez, a triple-threat know-it-all, who learns that she doesn't know as much as she thinks she does. Lee Curreri plays Bruno, an electronic keyboard genius who loves sitting in front of a keyboard but is at a complete loss at how to act in the real world. Barry Miller is brilliant in an Oscar-worthy turn as Ralph Garcy, a bitter Latino teen who is trying to bury his resentment about his father deserting him as a child by being a stand-up comedian. The late Gene Anthony Ray also shines as a dancer who only came to the auditions to partner a friend who wants to get in the school, but he is the one who has the talent, a star in the dance studio, but not so much in the classroom who constantly butts heads with Miss Sherwood (Anne Meara), the school's hard-nosed English teacher.Just like a real-life school, students come and go as the years pass, most notably in the sophomore year, where we meet Hilary Van Dorn (Antonia Francheschi) a snooty rich dance major who comes between a budding romance between CoCo and Leroy and has her own career aspirations derailed in the process.This film is riveting from jump as we watch students going through the painful audition process and struggle to develop their talent while keeping up their academic studies as well. The actors are pretty much perfectly cast, with standout work from Miller and Meara.Alan Parker's direction is breezy and energetic, giving all of his very talented cast a little time in the sun and Christopher Gore's screenplay is surprisingly bold and uncompromising. The musical numbers leap off the screen, thanks to some inventive choreography and strong vocals, particularly Cara, whose rendition of the title tune won the Oscar for Best Original Song.A movie that will have you tapping your toes and wanting to watch over and over again. The film inspired a long running television series, with Curreri and Ray recreating their movie roles, and a remake.",Fame

It is proud of its directness and not ashamed of being over the top.What really matters here, is the journey, not the destination. Ignorant idiots with soap opera mentality, will never realize that 'Fame' is about the struggles, anxieties and triumphs of these young people, not about their careers.Ironically enough, none of the very talented actors of 'Fame' made it in Hollywood. 'Fame' marked the end of an era. The end of artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of commercialization and political correctness.

It was made back in 1980 but looked to me like it was made earlier in 1970-which stands against it-I think it was a throwback to an earlier type of film for 1980 that was surprisingly well received when it came out. Personally I found it hard to watch to the end. I thought it was overly melodramatic to the point of pain a number of times. It started out being a comedy of sorts and then turned into something else with younger characters spouting profanity as if that was somehow part of being 'gifted' when all it did was make the characters look dumb which didn't add anything in the way of credibility to the movie. Irene Cara's character is from the city yet doesn't pick up on a guy whose fishing for girls to do porn. To make matters worse/even less credible, she agrees to do an 'audition' with Mr. Phoney and then starts to cry when he asks her to take off her top-but does it anyway.

The soundtrack was definitely cool and the acting and dancing complimented it nicely. Some of the student's attitudes might have been a little far-fetched like Leroy's especially because I'm sure someone like that would've been kicked out immediately for refusing to read and such if this was the real High School For Performing Arts. The Coco screen test is hard to watch for any people out there with weak stomachs, please heed my warning. While it's very gritty I know it's the truth on what happens so in this respect the movie is right on.

35,wchngliu,Gritty Yet At times Moving Look At Performing Arts And Its Students,7,19 October 2009,"Fame was released in the U.S. a year before I was born; I was too young to ever remember the original version of Fame- and yet I heard and read numerous things about it. Such as the fact that it spawned a TV series and that its soundtrack was led by the Irene Cara, Giogio Moroder hit, 'Fame'.Fame was arguably the first of its kind to portray and showcase the world of performing arts in the form of a feature length film. The lives, the struggles, the hurdles the students and some of the teachers undergo themselves were under the eye of the viewers.The performances were great, yet one which caught my eye in particular was Gene Anthony Ray, who played the troublesome yet promising Leroy. Angry, frustrated and at first rude, his character later became less angry and frustrated and more committed to his studies- not just with the practical in the performing but in the theoretical too. Irene Cara was good as Coco- the scene with her taking her blouse off while some pervy director was filming her was rather discomforting to watch-, as well as Paul McCrane for his amazing portrayal of a vulnerable but closeted homosexual trying to cope with life and enrolling on a performing arts school in New York, after he had been kicked out of the military when he told them he was gay. Ralph played by Barry Miller was interesting but at times, his character did grate on my nerves.The choreography was excellent, there were some good dance numbers involved and the 'hot lunch' scene in the cafeteria was worth watching. Another scene that was great was when the 'Fame' song was played and all the kids started rushing out into the streets of New York and danced wildly and without a care in the world. It was a street jam like no other.The only star to ever truly benefit from this in the long run was and is Debbie Allen- she later became a producer, director and star- though she mostly worked behind the scenes on shows such as Everybody Hates Chris and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Paul McCrane later went on to star alongside Peter Weller in the movie, 'Robocop', where he played a villain and E.R. as the judgemental, obnoxious Doctor Romano.British director Alan Parker shot this really well- he allowed the performers to dance, act, sing to their hearts content without wanting to interfere with and affect their styles.Throughout the duration of the movie, we see the various stages the students encounter during their 4 years- from their auditions to freshman year, all the way up to graduation in New York's High School For The Arts.Fame is one of those movies which caters for or is aimed at a particular audience that isn't necessarily the general mainstream movie loving community- it is definitely NOT for everyone.I for one enjoyed it because I have an interest in the arts- not technically in terms of being a performer because I am not one but as someone who appreciates that creativity and artistic expression can be channelled through hard work, commitment and passion towards what one does with their talents. Therefore, if you are an aspiring dancer, actor- or just someone who is creative, you might be interested in a movie such as this- though whether the events in Fame are anything like what it is in a performing arts college/school in real life, then that is a completely different matter altogether.The 2009 remake of this movie was released recently and frankly, it virtually pales by comparison. As for the original Fame, almost 30 years on though yes it is a bit dated but it is still a great movie, nonetheless.It's not an outright classic but as a 80s cult classic, in line with other 80s dance hit movies, such as Footloose and Flashdance, Fame hits the spot. Isn't it a coincidence that all those dance movies begin with the letter 'F'? Gritty, moving and intriguing, this one is worth a watch.",Fame
36,R_O_U_S,Less naff than you think,9,20 January 2004,"Of course this came out right at the beginning of the 1980s.  Of course it did.  Those drama students dancing in the street to Irene Cara's famous theme song, it's an indelible eighties leg-warmer style image.  But there's more to the film than that.  There's deprivation, and one man's struggle to learn to read, and a struggle with sexuality, and an attack on a child, and one girl tricked into taking topless photographs, and contemplation of suicide.  In the end, though, it is also about that song.",Fame

And I ain't sitting through 136 episodes just to hear a few select tunes. iTunes, here I come.The movie itself takes the very fascinating subject of the pressures of fame and success, before essentially turning them into tropes worthy of a soap opera. We have the talented dancer from a violent background, the actor who later finds out he's gay, the singer who ends up taking her top off for a dubious 'screen test'... all of this could be good stuff, but not in the overdramatised, inauthentic way it's presented here.It's as dated as disco, as boring as ballet and as much a waste of time as listening to the greatest hits of Barry Manilow.

It could have been a really cheesy movie about kids wanting to make it big in show business so they learn all about it at a special school. That would have been disastrous. What makes FAME work is that you do have aspiring actors, singers, and dancers wanting success and dreaming big but they are given a hard wake up call about the rigerous demands that fame costs. Plus, what sets this film up is the fact that real life delimas hit these kids SUPER HARD. You don't get milk toast problems like bad acne or boyfriend trouble, you got exploitation, abortion, illiteracy and a genuine fear of being inadequate. There is not a single bad performance in this movie and that is saying something considering the unknown, at the time cast. As Debbie Allen said in the this movie and in the TV show, ""You got big dreams, you want fame, well fame costs! And right here is where you start paying, in sweat!.""",Fame

41,TVholic,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.",8,1 October 2000,"High school. Years and decades later, some look back on it with fondness, others with embarrassment. But few find it easy to forget. It's one of the most critical phases of our lives, when changes come fast and furious whether we're ready or not. No longer children, not yet adults, irresistible forces buffet us, pushing and pulling us in every direction.""Fame"" did its best to capture this turbulent, chaotic period for its cast of young characters. For the most part, it succeeded. It meandered, but did feel like a slice of life. This movie holds a special place in the hearts of the Class of '80. We had just bid farewell to the sensational '70s, and soon to the end of three or four stimulating and sometimes difficult school years. We were headed out into the cold, cruel world, leaving home for college then parts unknown. As we approached our watershed event, this newly released movie was like a two-hour yearbook for us. We couldn't escape the titular song on the radio. That was us up there on the screen. Those were our friends, rivals and classmates as we had faced our own dreams, frustrations, successes and failures. Except that theirs were peppered and punctuated with lively tunes from Michael Gore.It's especially poignant for those who attended any of New York City's other elite, top-tier high schools, especially Stuyvesant, Bronx HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech. Like the kids here, we were considered the best of the best. We had no auditions, but instead rigorous entrance exams. More than the Performing Arts kids, we were expected to change the world, although not necessarily become famous. Like them, not all of us made it. But the pressure cooker environment fostered extraordinary camaraderie and esprit de corps, not unlike the toe-tapping ""Hot Lunch Jam"" in the cafeteria. On our own graduation day, our spirits soared almost like the jubilant crescendo in the rousing finale. The film leaves us fittingly on a single, triumphant note at the end of ""I Sing the Body Electric,"" pointing to the blindingly bright, boundless future and all the promise it held.""Fame"" couldn't have been set anywhere else. This story would never have worked in a small or suburban school. Los Angeles has a stronger identification with movies and television, but NYC is a mecca for all of the arts. Home not only to what was then called PA, but also world-renowned Juilliard, NYC is a cultural center unmatched by any other city in the world. ""Fame"" is also a time capsule of the rest of the city of the time, showing the seediness, grit and grime that was endemic of a New York still struggling back from the fiscal crisis that had nearly bankrupted it. But most of all, it showed the vitality, since muted by the inroads of Giuliani, Disney and tourism. Having it filmed in and around an actual NYC school - although not the real PA - helped give it a wonderful sense of verisimilitude.What I wouldn't give to be young again. But with ""Fame,"" at least I can remember what it was like.",Fame
42,eytand94,"Entertaining, Touching, Inspirational, Brilliant! ""Fame"" is the ultimate teen musical!",10,16 September 2009,"This movie tells the story of nine ambitious teens trying to follow their dream at the infamous New York High School For Performing Arts: Coco, the singer, Bruno, the modern Mozart, Lisa, Leroy, and Hilary, the struggling dancers, Ralph, the comedian, and Doris and Montgomery, the actors. While they all think they have what it takes to really reach their goals, they are going to need a lot more than just their talent. They will have to deal with rejection, heartbreak, education, pain, and love in order to achieve their fame.""Fame"" is one of the most entertaining, classic, and inspirational movies of all time. It has everything a teen drama/musical should have: extremely catchy, entertaining, Oscar-winning songs performed by the amazing Irene Cara, stunning dance numbers, a very attractive cast that makes you believe in the characters, and a great story, including the heartbreaking scene when Coco meets the video camera.Like I said, the cast is awesome. Irene Cara can really act, and it's not only her singing that makes her shine here as Coco. Lee Curreri is very good as Bruno. Barry Miller brings a lot of humor to Ralph. Maureen Teefy is great as the outcast Doris, and look closely, and you'll see Paul McCrane of ""ER"" as Montgomery.This is truly an amazing film. ""Fame"" really touched me and inspired me to keep following my dreams as an actor and singer. Any movie that moves me this much is a winner in my book. A must-see! The film really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer.",Fame
43,Naughtia_Nah,Prepare for 80's nostalgia,5,2 September 2011,I only watched this movie because I wanted to see it before I'm going to watch the new version.'Fame' is from the early eighties and one can clearly see and hear the stereotypical eighties' fashion style and music style. This gives me a somewhat nostalgic feeling of that period.The movie follows some students as they strive to become successful performing artists. They all go to school in New York and they all have so many hopes for their future.You really get to feel the eighties' spirit when you watch this movie and the movie has probably been spectacular at the time it premiered but I think that the eighties are very weird and entertaining. This movie is a classic of its time and I'm now looking forward to seeing the new up-to-date version of this same story.,Fame
44,silva-w-pius,spontaneous soul-drenched dance numbers,7,5 June 2014,"Ginger Rogers, Katherine Hepburn and Frank Sinatra, fame is associated with glitz and glamour, big parties, more money than you can ever could dream off and millions of adoring fans all screaming your name. But what they don't tell you is that fame can also be associated with a world of no trust, self loathing, and drug abuse, loss of a perspective or reality and heart break. For every rags to riches story, is a slow painful descent from the heavens and the stars into a hell were you constantly face the dark side of humanity. For every Beyonce there is a Marilyn Monroe, for every Clint eastwood there is a Kurt Cobain and for every Jerry Seinfeld there is a Michael Jackson. Fame has the beautiful, yet macabre ability to change some people's lives, and destroy others. So why do we risk so much and seek it so adamantly? Everyone has their own reason for wanting fame, but the most common is our quest for acceptance, and when you're a young teenager in the most populated city on earth, you can still feel more isolated than if you were the only person there. 1980 was the very forefront of the massive boom in coming of age films, which details the lives of young people and their trials and tribulations of the difficult and confusing transition into adulthood whilst trying to recover from pain of watching their childhood end. But whilst later films like Dazed and Confused and American Pie took more of a light hearted and humorous tone, it was Alan Parker who brought us a more realistic, gritty and niche magnifying glass into the lives of teens in New York City. They come from all walks of life, from the poor Bronx to the right upper eastside of Manhattan, however what they all have in common is a whole lot of ambition, dreams and talent and insatiable hunger for fame, but the world is cruel and not everyone has what it takes to make it. Over the course of; Auditions, freshman, sophomore, junior and senior year we follow the lives of; Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray) the hot headed naturally gifted dancer who can't read, Montgomery (Paul McCrane) a ultra serious thespian struggling to come to terms with his homosexuality, Ralph a street wise compulsive liar, Bruno (Lee Curreri) who is by far ahead of his time and lastly Doris a personality less shrinking violet who soon learns to blossom. Besides Doris who seems forced by her mother to pursue a life in the creative arts, the exact motivations for each of the main characters reasons for wanting fame is generally unclear and the film never really explicitly defines them, but as the audience we don't care because in each of these kids we see a little bit of ourselves, and thus will them to success with all our hearts. Similar to a Robert Altman film we weave effortlessly through the ensembles lives, experiencing their uplifting highs as well as their crushing lows as if we were actually standing right next to them throughout. Warning don't expect any fairy tales and happily ever afters in Fame; there is abortion, exploitation, attempted suicide, racial divides, death and drug abuse in Christopher Gore script that never stops shocking you and sending you on an emotional roller-coaster, as you immerse yourselves in the lives of these teens, laughing and crying as they do and eventually falling in love with them. Working so expertly with such a young cast of relatively unknowns and producing such a excellent piece of filmmaking, wasn't a flash in the pan or fluke by Alan Parker, because you just have to look back to the toe tapping all kids gangster musical Bugsy Malone as a further demonstration of Parkers ability to work so well and nurture young talent into giving such breath taking performance. In particular the one that stood out to me the most in Fame was Barry Miller as Ralph we was able to pull of the most dynamic and layered character with ease and charm, but never being afraid to lay out his entire soul to the audience. You just have to look at the scene he shares with his mother, sister and preacher in church as an example, a scene absolutely dripping with raw emotion. I personally was one of those people to fall in love not just with the characters but with the film as a whole because it has the grace of ballerina, the power of a Ballard and the ability to provoke thought like a Shakespearean actor. Fame stands fearless, toe to toe with controversy and bat an eye lid, but it's not serious all the time there is a swimming pool full of fun gushing into every scene; the boys in the toilets trying to see into the girls changing rooms and the spontaneous soul-drenched dance numbers, that gallivanted a whole generation of New Yorkers to risk a beat down and try to pirouette on top of a taxi if you haven't already laughed enough. Bring him a well deserved BAFTA nomination, Fame sits aptly next Mississippi Burning and American Express as some of Alan's greatest crowning achievements, which helped him win BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award, the highest honour the British Film Academy can give any filmmaker in 2013. While the immediate legacy of Fame was the double Oscar Winning sing- along inspiring song named 'Fame' named after the film which won the film an Oscar for best original score and a Oscar for best song for Michael Gore. But what really stands out was the films ability to influence later coming of age films in the likes of Footloose and The Breakfast Club, however it should come as great surprise to know that the film only ranked at #42 on Entertainment Weekly's 2006 list of the ""50 Best High School Movies"". Shocking!",Fame
45,Pikchar,Excellent,8,8 April 2000,"Fame is one of the best movies I've seen about The Performing Arts. The music and the acting are excellent. The screenplay and Set Design are also excellent. My favorite part is when all the students start Dancing and making music in the Canteen. I can see this movie any number of times, and never get bored. I give it 8 1/2 on 10.",Fame
46,hokiemo,Overrated but great music and original plot,7,12 January 2006,"I expected FAME to be an uplifting film but it ended up the opposite. The overall plot which follows the lives of several determined students attending a performing arts school has strong potential. However, FAME builds its characters up beautifully and then leaves us with so many questions when its over. I was very surprised when the graduation scene pops up -- we thought the DVD had skipped or something. All of the characters have internal and external conflicts of some sort and virtually none of them are resolved when the movie ends! You might think there are too many characters, but its probably too many scenes. Its evident the film was cut up and shortened because its sometimes lacks transition. I think Laura Dean as Lisa Monroe is my favorite character. I really connected with her character's ambition and following her heart. Boyd Gaines as Michael, the stereotypical poor student who can't read but is a divine dancer, is also very good. I didn't especially like Irene Cara's character of Coco, but this is not Cara's fault since her script is weak and her character is not fleshed out. Her voice is beautiful and hearing her songs warrants watching the whole film. In summary, the film could use many improvements, but the quality actors and great music earn its place in film history.",Fame
47,adam-1009,Brilliant movie,10,2 March 2006,"I truly hate musicals because music numbers just start out of the sudden and usually spoil scenes, but this one is completely different - it's simply brilliant.

48,liamforeman,Had potential but all wrong,2,13 December 2009,"This was on TV last night. I painfully forced my way through it, and barely made it through. First of all, except for Leroy, Hilary, and possibly Coco, NONE of the other students we are supposed to care about have any discernible talent. It's like HSPA had no standards, just sign on the dotted line and you're in. The story lines were grating and obvious. Doris was just impossibly awful. The gay guy was such a thrown away cliché (funny how that school had only one gay guy, right...) I liked the Leroy character, but calling your teacher an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent Leroy packing. Lisa looks like she'd rather be anywhere else, and since she wasn't any talent, I wonder why they kept her. I would have rated this one star (awful), but the music wasn't that bad, and I did like the premise. It just would have worked much better if the students had been attractive and actually had some talent.",Fame

The film focuses on a group of students who dream of making it big while they perfect their craft at the now famous school. Director Alan Parker allows each of the highlighted students to mature on screen, allowing you to feel a connection with each one. The music here is infectious and fun. The dancing is exciting and fresh. The film eventually became the basis for an Emmy-winning television series starring Debbie Allen and some of the other actors from the film.

I saw ""Fame"" in its first release (btw, a movie released in 1980 isn't an '80s movie, it's a '70s movie) and couldn't sleep for at least a day. Dramatically it's a bit uneven, tho' storyline strengths knit it together well, but the music comes to the rescue every time. Interestingly, the ""impromptu"" street and cafeteria jams are no better (but every bit as good) as the staged choral numbers, which really are the full-throated heart of the movie. If you're looking for a movie that reminds you of high school, or even of your high school play, you'll more than likely be disappointed. If you want powerful music from energetic singers, this is your show -- ""42nd Street"" for kids not lucky enough (hah!) to have lived through the Depression.

I knew that she sang Fame, so I wanted to buy the CD. They didn't have the DVD though. When I went up to the front to pay for my CD, they had a bunch of copies of it on DVD! I was so excited! I just had to get them both. Later that night, my parents and I watched it during our traditional Saturday night movie. All I can say is that I was entertained every second of this movie. The music was great, the acting was perfect, and the movie was overall a wonderful experience. I was a little upset when the movie ended, because I didn't want it to end! It was just before school ended, and I watched this movie to death over the summer. I'm watching it right now, actually. This movie, along with Flashdance, has inspired me to be a performer.

We both agreed that we were probably remembering the TV series, which, in its one-hour segments, was compelled to actually wrap up plot lines.

It follows an interesting format ... but, it all really ends in a kind of mush.Where Parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into periodic overdrive - with the extremely poignant, sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score & performances.The film's climax is a song-dance fest of musicians,dancers, & score by Christopher Gore.

You care about these characters as they have to learn about the world around them. Their voices are real, and they remind me of teenagers I knew in the 80s and teenagers I see in my classroom now.And I haven't even mentioned the music yet...

Why is it so bad? Well they leave a LOT unresolved. For example, we don't know whether or not Doris and Ralph get back together. Also some other plot points are left unresolved.I think this is what makes it an 8 rather than a 9.I don't normally like these kind of films, but something about Fame sets it apart from the other Late 70's-Early 80's musicals.Overall it's a fun film with great songs, but a sh*tty ending.

Everything about it is honest and real and although some of the characters are cliched the believable performances and strong script keep it together. I was actually apprehensive when it came to watching the film as I couldn't forget the cheesy leg warmer fest that had been the TV show (which I did watch of course but there were only two channels in Greece then and I was 10 or so...)The film has great music. Dance numbers. The works. However all that is secondary to the story, they compliment it instead of overshadowing it. And as the story goes, it is true that several threads of the story are not adequately explained (at least not in the version I saw) but why should that matter? I can imagine my own ending for them, for poor Coco and that sleazy photographer and the girl who had to have an abortion (and I can't forget how funny and tragic the scene of the girl's monologue about what a great dancer she's planning to be, all the while not realising what she's on about until the very end of the scene).Everything about the story was amazing but those that really did it for me were Doris, Montgomery and Raul/Ralph both in terms of performances and of their stories.

The characters are real, they are not ""Hollywood"" and their stories are real. The film follows them through the four years of school, starting with a powerful monologue by one student at Auditions and finishing with a spectacular graduation show.Apparently some find the broadway show better, however it is my opinion that you should definitely see this movie anyway, and then have your own view. For anyone who enjoys movie watching and would like to have the ""classics"" down, this is surely one of them. It is an example of one of those movies that was really great, with actors that we loved for those 2 hours, and then never saw them again... they are classic ""Fame students"".

Just like the show, I found Fame the movie very intense although Fame the movie was more sexually explicit. The song Fame by Irene Cara is an inspirational song.

The editing i think is wonderful, really fast and often funny. Shure, maybe there would have been some more potential in the whole thing, all the story's stay somehow on the surface; maybe a bit too many characters are involved.But I don't care, because the real stars are......the musical scenes! One of my favorites: the hot-lunch-jam sequence. That piece is just so raw, funky and filmed in a special way (handcamera-style in ""music-hell-breaking-loose""), its just electrifying! I miss this raw energy in todays music-clips; the only similar energy I found perhaps in Bette Midlers ""the rose"", all of the concert footage.Its about capturing something ""wild"" that is ""realy"" happening, and not doing it just perfect; take by take.So, FAME is a wonderful nostalgia-trip to when synthesizers where heavy and walk-mans not available.I recommend it once a year; sure not for everyone.",Fame

However, I saw it on TV last night and the only words that spring to my mind are 'terrible' and 'outdated'.The lack of a coherent plot line interrupted only by random musical outbursts only help to worsen this film. I found that the character profiles are no longer relevant to the current generation, but mostly just struggled to understand the plot.However, the random musical outbursts were the main annoyance for me. It was like a musical without the singing, and instead just people dancing.

I remember watching in the early 80s just after Top of the Pops on a Thursday...never missed an episode.Then the film was released on video (to cash in on the success of the series) and I was sorely disappointed with it.However a few years after the series left our screens, I watched the film again and it grew on me.  It had a raw edge that the series was never allowed to have.The characters in the film appeared to be rather more seedy (maybe gritty is a better description) than in the series (even the very innocent Bruno Martelli had more bite) and most importantly, the film introduced me to The Rocky Horror Picture Show (another film I thought was rubbish on first screening).Now more than 20 years on, I have occasionally caught an episode of the series on satellite television and have now come to realise how crass it was...the film however is now a cult classic and has now been added to my DVD collection, wedged in between Grease & Saturday Night Fever (I might even add Flashdance & Footloose to this section one day).",Fame

How about Garci's sister? Is she better now? What about Leroy? We learned absolutely nothing about him. What about the electronic piano guy? How about the rich girl that got an abortion? What happened to her? That was an interesting subplot.Overall this is not a good movie and I recommend another musical that was in this film. LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN!!!!!!!,Fame
73,calvin616,"It is not perfect, but I wouldn't call it bad...",6,28 March 2005,"IF you've watched Fame the musical the actual musical itself, you may not like this movie that much because it is an almost different version compared to the original musical. Obviously I've watched the original musical, and I like the actual musical more.In some parts of the movie it was actually quite touchy.Personally I love every production of Fame since I am a musical person and the stuffs that happen in the movie are quite realistic.Due to the time restraint, the director needed to cut out a lot of scenes compared to the actual musical, some of them are quite important, and i agree that there are lots of loose ends for the characters. But this ""mistake"" is understandable.If you have not watch the original musical, and you're into teen's movie (well, not those teen movie like confession of the teenage drama queen and mean girls) you will like this movie. Also, the jokes in this movie are quite funny.",Fame
74,hillja,This is a great film,9,22 April 2005,"If you ever try to make a film, view this one. ""Fame (1980)"" has many starting points and one culminating point. It all comes together in the ""Body Electric"" song. The denouement is left open for individual reflection. This film is not, to my mind, about the characters on the screen. It is about us - ordinary everyday people -who wish to succeed. It is about opportunities, realising who you really are, and chances missed. Question: ""Are we all cut out to be ""stars""? ""Well are you?"" How do you measure up against the competition? Not in your mind - but in reality? Today, ""Fame"", may seem a little dated in style. But it is nevertheless relevant in more ways than many other films of this genre are today; perhaps in more ways than most imagine. Merely consider: Ethnic, religious and other cultural groupings - in all their variations. How many similar films featured similar comparisons in the same way in 1980?This film is beautifully edited with a well-mixed sound track. There are, however, some aspects of the edit and mix I would have done differently. But this is 25 years later!To the people who pan de Palma's work, especially ""Fame"" I say: Try to do it yourself!John CTIFS RSA",Fame
75,Smile-3,Talented,10,29 September 1998,Fame was one of the most talented movies I've ever seen. It captured the essence of gifted people from different races and backgrounds. Also it had great music and dancing.,Fame
76,run6kenny,Great!!!!!!,10,25 May 1999,"Fame, I think, was the best movie that I have ever seen.  In ways it was funny and dramatic, but that is what makes a movie.  True, it has a few loose ends, actually a lot, but I still think that it is a terrific movie. Some of the funny things happen in the audition at the beginning of the movie.  I think it is hilarious when the girl tries to act out O.J. Simpson in ""The Towering Inferno"" and Raul/Ralph goes around to every art department saying that his father was great at every one.  He says that his dad danced with the Rockets and left Ralph his tap shoes.  The Rockets, as far as I know, are made up of women.  And the tap shoes were just regular shoes with bottle caps on the bottom.  Also the guy who read the lines of Juliet in the Romeo and Juliet play was funny.  One thing about the movie that just turns me on is the music.  I have never heard anything like it!!!  My favorite song is ""I Sing the Body Electric"" and my second is the theme song itself ""Fame"".  Irene Cara has a great voice and is a great actress.  I like the way the movie focused on many ethnic groups.  It showed all of the kinds of people there actually are in what is now called ""La Guardia School of the Performing Arts"".  This movie showed the triumphs and trials of many young performers, including Angelo, Doris, Bruno, Coco, Montgomery, Ralph, Leroy, Hilary, and Liza.  They all had a hard time, but made it their own way.  This movie could have added on about another 30-45 minutes (before the graduation), but it is still my favorite movie no matter what!!!!",Fame
77,snjking,Wonderful film. Slice of life style.,10,2 December 2003,"I read the other review and had to comment.  No, this film doesn't tie all the loose ends up in a neat package.  That's what makes it to poignant. This film is one of just a few delightful musicals that you can file in the ""Slice of Life"" folder.  It chronicles a handful of teens who are given an extraordinary opportunity and shows how they cope with it.  We watch them develop over four years in their high school and then we see them graduate. We have no idea what will happen to them next.  But that's not the point of the film.  The point is that the choices they make and the obstacles they overcome contribute to who they are.  All the things they go through don't dull their desire for FAME, they are still out there, fighting, everyday to get it.I think the ambiguity of the ending only makes it a more powerful picture. It's truly a classic as few films are brave enough to allow the audience to draw their own conclusions.  I appreciate films that allow me to think and use my own imagination.",Fame
78,mrmaxmv,Smelly dance studios and ugly singing mouths,10,18 August 2020,"This film is the most realistic musical I've ever seen. It perfectly catches the essence of a performing arts school, I feel like I can almost smell those old New York dance studios. The music is essential to the storytelling, and the musical numbers and the actors are so real. You can see all those ugly faces people make while singing in a chorus. High school students look like high school students. The script is really good and it has a lot of one-liners I use in my every day life.And let me tell you this is one of the best film editions I've ever seen. The way the songs and dances fit and the way the transitions happen and connect one scene with the next one is mind blowing.This movie is a must watch for every musical or performing arts fan.",Fame
79,actorman-99,The passion is what makes Fame special,10,7 July 2005,"I saw Fame when it first came out. It deals with the high school class of 1980, which was coincidentally my year of graduation. I saw the movie in the summer between high school and college and, being a performer myself, it holds a special place in my heart.The biggest criticisms of Fame usually have to do with continuity, and there are definitely some story lines that either are not completed or don't make sense. However, those problems are more than made up for by the passion and emotion of the characters and the incredible music.I saw it again recently and was surprised that I still loved it as much as I did the first time. Fame is often compared to Flashdance, which I don't think is fair. Although Flashdance has some great music and Jennifer Beals is gorgeous, I think Fame is vastly superior in the development of its characters and the complexity of its stories. For anyone who truly loves the arts, this is a must-see movie.",Fame
80,kwalkomedy1,Fame Re-visited,10,29 September 2002,"It's early on a Sunday morning, and thanks to the miracle of satellite television, I've just finished viewing one of my all time favorite movies, Fame.  I've read some of the other user comments and I too, can feel the age of the film.  The story is predictable at times, but the music, atmosphere and energy of the film more than make up for its flaws.I can remember seeing this film in the theater and I remember a tag at the end telling what became of the characters.  Does anyone remember viewing this version?Watching the movie again really filled in the gaps for me personally.  I don't think I fully realized how much this movie impacted me.  It made me fall in love with a character.  In fact, my favorite character in the film is the city in which it is set.  This character called out to me and welcomed me to its shores almost a decade after seeing the film.  New York City also provided me the opportunity to live forever as I studied performing and struggled to keep pace with its gait.  Ultimately, time, change and terrorism pulled me away from my love, my city, but watching this film again rekindles my memories (good and bad) of my favorite city.As a movie and theater fan, I despise musicals and child actors.  In the real world you just don't break out in song, and not all children are cute. This is the one movie for which I break my rule.  The young actors here breathe in their co-star (NYC) and out flows a bit of the mosaic that makes this movie so enjoyable.  If you are reading the comments to decide whether to invest the two-hours in this film, I say yes.  Your reaction and journey with this film may not be as personal as mine, but love it or hate it you will have a reaction - and I'd be interested in someday reading your thoughts on this film.",Fame
81,cdainard,Time Of Our Lives,10,1 September 2017,"I have to say that this movie had a big impact on me in that it was a movie of opportunities, either missed or accomplished. Having your future in front of you knowing what you want to do in life and focusing on that one thing and just putting all of your heart and soul into it.This was a typical prototypical rags to riches story made for the era and told from the aspect of the student and teachers so you get a ""true to life"" depiction of what you sometimes have to do to get ahead in this world. I would definitely have young people watch this movie especially if they are involved in the performing arts. I know it is dated but the message is not.",Fame
82,baruchyoseph8,A really good film all around,7,23 June 2009,"This movie and its subsequent TV series followup has become the iconic stand-in for what is great about America. Fame is famous for its music and performances. There are several standouts including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara*, and the superb Gene Anthony Ray. The latter who plays a walk-on dancer with no academic or other than ""street"" credentials is an amazing personality and is worth watching for what is essentially a portrayal of himself. A wonderment to behold, as one king was apt to say.The plot follows an interesting format - chronological at times, genre at other times, personalities in some cases ... but, it all really ends in a kind of mush.Where Parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into periodic overdrive - with the extremely poignant and sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score that matches the performers step for step.The climax of the film is a climax for all times. And this climatic complete cast of many many talented musicians and dancers and music is thankfully repeated throughout the credits. These are one set of credits that are well worth sitting through ... an achievement for the ages. The music by Christopher Gore is a gift to behold.",Fame
83,nickmmartino,this movie sucks,1,11 September 2009,"This ""movie"" i use that term loosely because its less of a movie and more like soft core porn. I'm not a big fan of musicals but this movie is on a different world of how bad this musical is. I'm telling ever one DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. sure there's nudity but it not worth sitting through like two and a half hours of crap. One more thing i said it was a musical but there only like three dancing and sing spots in the whole movie. So its not a musical it just a terrible movie. As to why they decide to make a remake i don't understand, when every i see i preview for the remake i think it's better because it looks like they actually made musical a really musical. But do i think the remakes going to be good no i don't if you remake a stupid movie the remake is probelly going to be stupid. Yes there are spelling mistake deal with it.",Fame
84,mamboitaliano25,Wonderful idea: Musical much better than the movie,6,17 June 2014,"In the movie, I have to say that I found way too many problems (girl getting pregnant, coco becoming a porn star, Doris smoking, Leroy not graduating, and many more) that it took away from the light spirit of the movie and made me quite uncomfortable watching it and laughing at some jokes that were revolved around these problems. Even though people make jokes about these things, this film made me realize how bad these things can be. The musical was much better because it focused on one main problem- Carmen going into drugs. Even though there were smaller problems, they did not take away from the main problem. The musical had funnier jokes and the characters all seemed well built. It also had a great and very useful message saying that if you want to get somewhere in life, you need to work hard for it and not get distracted and fall into drugs for example. Again, the movie had just as much wonderful potential as the musical had but it was taken away because the writer over did it with the problems thinking it would enhance the movie.",Fame
85,larryleecollins,Is this really a musical?,8,6 December 2015,"This movie breaks down a lot of the expectations that most audiences have in regards to musicals. However, this movie is still very clearly a musical through and through.One of the biggest expectations audiences have going into a musical is that the characters will frequently just start singing and dancing for no reason. Parker decided to take a different route on how he presented the song and dance numbers. The movie revolves around a group of high school students as they progress through their four years of school at a performing arts high school. Since nearly every character in the story is a singer or dancer, it makes sense for them to sing and/or dance every once in a while. And since I'm sure every one of you knows at least one person that's involved in the arts somehow, I'm also sure you know that it's not completely out of character for these people to randomly start singing and dancing. The characters in ""Fame"" hold true to this personality trait. Whenever the characters start randomly singing and/or dancing throughout the movie, it may be ""weird"" according to societal norms, but for actual performers, it's something that could and often does actually happen in real life.""Fame"" also challenges the purpose of songs in the musicals. Normally, songs in musicals either are vital in progressing the plot or are simply for entertainment. The music in ""Fame"" does neither of these things. While the songs are vital to the plot, it is not in the conventional sense. Most of the songs in the movie are sung by musicians as they are auditioning, practicing, or performing, rather than simply being a tool to move the plot along. If someone were to take all the songs out of the movie the plot would not make as much sense, because without them the characters singing them would have to be removed from the script. Another thing that is expected out of most musicals is the big production number at the end of the musical that either ties all of the loose ends of the story up or celebrates everyone's good fortune. ""Fame"" still has a production number, but it fulfills neither of the expected uses. This production number takes place at the students' graduation. It serves as the final chance for both the audience within the movie and those of us watching the movie itself to see all of the characters perform before they go off into the ""real world."" None of the characters' story lines end with a sense of finality. No one is shown getting a professional job, or an agent, or even a relationship. The characters graduate and that's the end of it. For most audiences, they are expecting the final number to tie up loose ends. Sadly, these people will be left hanging.Even though ""Fame"" is definitely very unconventional in it's delivery, it is still very strongly a musical. The songs are still very vital to the storyline even though they aren't quite delivered how you would expect. In my opinion, it does a great job at trying to reach to both musical loving audiences and non-musical loving audiences.",Fame
86,ayefrsty,"vocal major, 2005.",6,8 November 2005,"I actually just graduated from LaGuardia HS, the HS that ""Fame"" was based on as a vocal major (2005). People do not know what LaGuardia HS is until I mention that it's the ""Fame"" school. In my four years of being a student there, I did not watch ""Fame"". In fact, I just saw it 4 days ago. There are two teachers from the movie that currently teach at LaGuardia, Penny Frank and Jim Moody.There were some things that did not connect, obviously. For instance, you would never do pointe freshman year. It captured the student's spirits very well, however we never broke into song and dance during lunch, we were too busy eating!! Some people will have their instruments and jam a bit in the lunchroom or senior lounge. In between breaks, the dance majors are still in their leotards grabbing lunch. Music majors have blackout days, where they come into school directly into the concert hall and not class and rehearse all day. What I do miss about the school is seeing people cut class to hang out in the hallway and work on their harmonies. Figuring out math problems while down the hall, a class would be studying their new Italian aria.I did not feel as if the movie was amazing. In terms of capturing the spirit of the students, it was incredible. The struggles that all the students went through was definitely a reality. There were many things left out in the movie, especially the endings of various situations between the students.I miss LaGuardia though. Never will I go to a school like that with people as interesting. I'm in college now and haven't really found people interesting enough to stimulate my mind. I am proud to be a graduate of the Fame school, for it was the best four years of my life.",Fame
