0,TheLittleSongbird,A lot of fantastic elements but not quite fantastic enough overall,7,3 December 2018,"Am something of a fan of Harry Potter, books and films. Having grown up with the franchise and cherishing the fond memories being engrossed in the books, the midnight shopping trips to get the latest one and watching the films in the cinema being entertained, dazzled and at times even scared. Found myself really enjoying the first 'Fantastic Beasts' film, though not all my friends and family did for understandable reasons.Had high hopes for 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald'. It became one of my most anticipated films of the year after being captivated by the trailer. Although the critical reception was mixed, the high hopes were not shattered because word of mouth from friends, whose opinions this reviewer always trusts, was positive and am someone aiming to see all the film for franchise completest sake. My thoughts after watching 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' were mostly positive though with a few fairly serious misgivings.'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' is a sequel that is bigger in spectacle, darker in content and bolder in its basic story. Yet, compared to some sequels that have earned that distinction by me, it is an example of a follow-up that fell short of being better. It wasn't for me vastly inferior and the drop in quality was not large, although visually this film looked better and preferred the cast here too the previous film had more focus and cohesion and the creatures were used better. Can totally see where critics are coming from while also seeing what those who liked it saw in it.Will get the not so good things out of the way. Do agree with those who have described 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' as over-stuffed. There are too many characters and not all of them are necessary and the others given too short shrift, the inclusion of Nicolas Flamel for instance was pointless with him having literally nothing to do and felt merely there as a thrown in Harry Potter reference. It was great to see life at Hogwarts and feel nostalgic with the references, but that was also hurt by that what was shown didn't seem to fit continuity-wise.There were too many story strands too, variably explored. Making the story feel cluttered and not always focused, which affects the cohesion. The big revelation(s) in the last act, especially for what seemed to be the conclusion of the main story strand, did confuse me and needed much more breathing space for the viewer to take it all in, one is left in a whirlwind that gets bigger.Some of the pace could have been tighter, with some of the middle act meandering and not always involving. The ending came over as a bit rushed to me, well-staged but a slowing down pace-wise would have made the crucial revelations much clearer.However, 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' has a lot of fantastic elements. Once again, it does look great and looks even better perhaps than the previous film. The production design is wondrous, especially once in Paris though loved the look of Hogwarts as well, and it is beautifully shot, with tighter editing and slightly more polished effects (though both were great in the previous film). Loved the little details too. The return of James Newton-Howard was a more than welcome one, with a score that is even more haunting, more whimsical, more ethereal and more rousing, one standout being in the beginning with the phantom carriage.Enjoyed enough of the script, with enough thoughtful, emotional (did feel for Credence) and amusing parts, the last one being provided by Jacob and the Niffler. Though there are parts that don't make the script here as focused as before and die-hard Harry Potter fans won't be squealing with delight as much and feeling as nostalgic over the references because the continuity fitted much more before. Although the story execution is flawed, there is charm, offbeat wit, imagination and nail-biting suspense, so the magic is there. Another improvement over the previous film is that the beginning gets to the point more and is better paced.David Yates' direction shows experience and he handles the set pieces very well. The phantom carriage escape and Ministry Library scenes really stand out, while the circus freak show part is suspenseful and intriguing. Would have loved to have seen far more of the creatures and more variety but when they do appear they are delightful and each serve purpose to the story. Again not only are they technical marvels they also have personality, the most used is the Zouwu, while the one that serves most point to the story is Pickett. My favourite will always be Niffler though. The characters are worth caring for generally and the cast are on great form. Eddie Redmayne has even more nuance and charm here and Johnny Depp's evil personified Grindelwald is vastly improved here. Ezra Miller's repression and Zoe Kravitz's empathy are moving to watch while Dan Fogler is amiable and very funny. Genius casting too is provided by Jude Law as Dumbledore, a fine example of creating enormous impression in relatively minor screen time. Katherine Waterston, while still commanding the screen beautifully, is on the underused side and Alison Sudol is not as charming.Overall, an enjoyable film with many fantastic elements. Just wanted it to be more fantastic than it turned out to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1,Leofwine_draca,Dreadful money grab,3,2 February 2020,"THE CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD is the FANTASTIC BEASTS follow-up that nobody asked for, but I guess there's more money yet to be made from the wizarding world. This turns out to be of the same quality as the first film, i.e. quite dreadful, and it doesn't help that Rowling herself turned in the screenplay. It's unfocused, meandering, almost plotless at times, with way too many uninteresting characters, none of whom appeal. As usual, the emphasis is on delivering snazzy CGI effect after snazzy CGI effect, but this gives the whole thing a real detachment from reality that makes it vapid to watch. Cast-wise, Redmayne is the worst he's ever been, while Johnny Depp's stock villain feels sleazy rather than menacing. It's also one of those mid-series films that has no real beginning, middle or end, and as such feels completely pointless.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
2,SnoopyStyle,overloaded,6,9 January 2019,"In 1927 New York City, evil wizard Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) escapes a prison transport and heads to Paris with his supporters. In London, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) refuses British Ministry of Magic's command to hunt Grindelwald. It's revealed that it was Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) who sent Newt to NYC and this time he sends him to Paris. Newt is joined by Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler). Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) is already there searching for lost pure-blood wizard Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) along with everyone else. Her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) falls under the persuasion of Grindelwald.This has plenty of wizarding whiz bangs. It has too much twisting back-bending back stories. Some of the characters are acting in strange ways. This is overloaded. J. K. Rowling should consider not writing for the novel but concentrate on writing for the movie. There is too much of everything. I don't understand Queenie's dark turn. I hoped that she was playing along but that seems extremely unlikely. For some reason, Tina has turned a lot colder. I didn't understand the significance of Credence at the start which makes his reveal less compelling. This movie follows a dozen main characters which is about six too many. For Potter fans, this is a must but this prequel franchise is not a necessity for casual fans.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
3,Horst_In_Translation,"Not a fantastic movie, but a good one and an improvement to the first",6,30 November 2018,"Let me start this review by saying that you should skip the watch here if you haven't seen the first or second movie. Now, here we go: ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" is the second film from the ""Fantastic Beasts"" movie series. This one here is a new 2018 release from this year and of course director David Yates is on board again here and the screen writer is J.K. Rowling, both from the Harry Potter series eventually. I did not like the first FB movie if I remember correctly, but rewatched it recently before seeing this second film and it grew a bit on me I must admit. This second one is fine too, but it never reaches greatness. I have read people say that they were disappointed how the character of Newt Scamander loses a great deal of screen time to the supporting players here. Well, I do agree, but I don't think it is a problem and I am writing this as a fan of the Oscar-winning actor Eddie Redmayne. After all, the title includes the beasts and it includes the main antagonist as well, played by Johnny Depp as we found out at the very end of the first film. But it does not include Newt Scamander, so you should not expect him to be a force as dominant as Radcliffe in the Potter films. And there is a certain irony that not one of them (eight in total I think) managed to win the Oscar, but the very first FB did. We'll see next year how this one fares awards-wise. I think it will maybe be nominated in two visual categories, costumes and sets or so. We'll see.But now about the film itself. I must say one very memorable aspect here was the presence of Jude Law playing the young Albus Dumbledore. Perhaps the best casting decision of the year and he really won me over and the actor is steadily growing on me too. I am genuinely curious what he will have in store for us for the next three movies. But not just him of course. The closing credits rolled in once again as a cliffhanger and we shall see especially what is going to happen with Johnny Depp's character. I am naturally not the very biggest Depp fan, but after some early struggles I liked him more and more and I was glad he and his character are included in the movie. The big spectacular scene towards the end with the circle and the powers around it is an absolute highlight here that makes this film probably infinitely better to watch on the big screen than on the small screen. Go pay these bucks. And yes there are once again quite a few memorable beasts included here too. Some new, some old. I will never be as much of a fan as Scamander is of this little locust creature, but I do love the little furry platipus lookalike. Really want one of these as my pet too.Cast-wise the film brings back many of the actors from the first film. More than I expected for sure. For example I thought the story with the funny guy who becomes the baker and his (potential) girlfriend was finished at the end of the first film, but no, they are both back, especially the female and her role is far more significant than in the first movie where she was basically just the other sister. Another character I was surprised to see back and that he hadn't died as implied in the first was Credence. I never thought his part in the second film would be so big. On the one hand, you could say they lacked ideas for new crucial characters as aside from young Dumbledore there isn't really anybody new, on the other you must say in Rowling's favor that she wrote everybody in a way where nobody feels for the sake of it and bringing so many old characters back with new and fresh story lines was quite the challenge I'm sure. And she mastered it and proves she is not just a talented author, but also a gifted screen wright, even if the subject all works in her favor of course.So I think it was a good watch and you should give it a go, especially if you like fantasy films and if you liked the first Scamander outing 2 years ago. I am positive that they will keep delivering quality with the next 3 as well. The argument it is all cheap cashing in is not really valid in my opinion. If it is really all quantity over quality, then how come so many people are seeing these films in theaters. The answer is because they are interesting and bring a whole lot of creativity to the table, plus solid acting and magnificent visual production values, which is simply impossible to deny. I can see people struggling with the stories and yes it is not a masterpiece, but good enough for me. These over 2 hours flew by pretty quickly. It's a thumbs-up from me and I recommend seeing FB 2.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
4,Prismark10,The slim plot is not enough to maintain the magic,5,22 November 2018,"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald shows that J K Rowling should not be writing screenplays although I am sure Steve Kloves who is credited as Executive Producer had a hand in the script.It is also evident that the directorial duties needs a new vision. David Yates has been too long in the Potter world.The film is a rehash of the early X-Men films. An allegory. Purebloods need to breakout and overcome the humans who are the true monsters. Grindelwald even shows them a vision of the man made future, World War 2 and the rise of Nazism. The trouble is Grindelwald has his own fascist foot soldiers.The plot consists of Grindelwald predictably escaping. Newt Scamander is sent by Albus Dumbledore to go look for him. The ministry of magic is stifling all dissent and free thinkers. In short they are driving wizards to the arms of someone like Grindelwald. Everyone is after a young man called Credence Barebone who just wants to find his mother and who he really is.The film has great spectacle but it is too long and the plot is too slim. Parts of the film is set in Hogwarts and actually makes you realise that these prequels are a cynical cash in by Warner Brothers.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
5,nogodnomasters,Who am I?,6,30 December 2018,"May have plot spoilers.About the third Harry Potter movie, they made the books longer and the movies shorter creating plot holes and gaps that only the reader of the books would know, or it was glossed over. It has gotten worse. We are introduced to our bad guy, Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) who is treated like Hannibal Lechter in 1927. He is albino looking and speaks like Mordevolt. He wants to start a second war with the non-wizards and rule over them in order to prevent WWII. Apparently, the wizards somehow lost the previous war which is why they are in hiding. Go figure.He escapes as we are re-introduced to the characters in the first film. Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) is the only wizard strong enough to stop him, but won't as it is strongly hinted that they were lovers. Newt (Eddie Redmayne) takes on the task with a gazillion subplots and backstories which took away from the overall entertainment value. Sometimes less is more. There is also a guy looking for his mommy, a fake news story, and a woman abducted and forced to have another man's child. We also see a young Minerva McGonagall.And the story doesn't end. It is left open for a sequel.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
6,kosmasp,More magic,6,6 May 2019,"I know I'm not alone, but I have to state again, that at this point in time, I have not read (nor listened) to any of the (audio) books. And that includes Harry Potter of course. Having said all that, I'm only settting the stage so you know that I can't compare this to any of the source material. Now this has a few things in it, that are callbacks to the first movie and we do get familiar characters back with their quirks.There's also new characters of course and for some it may feel convoluted. But this is just a fun ride and I can see that this is just a side step or just a filler like another reviewer stated to get to the next movies. You know introduce a few things that probably will pay off along the road. Technically this really looks good. Story and character wise there is not much happening though. Not anything note- or new(s)-worthy that is. Still decent and entertaining and isn't that what this all is about? (No?)",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
7,classicsoncall,"""You never met a monster you couldn't love.""",8,23 May 2019,"A preponderance of characters and a story line that seems intentionally confusing may hinder your viewing pleasure here. Part of my problem is that I'm not personally invested in the wizarding world of J.K Rowling, and ran out of steam near the end of the Harry Potter series of films. So I come to the Fantastic Beasts movies with an open mind and willingness to be entertained. There seemed to be some open ended, unresolved issues at the end of this story, not surprising as there are sequels yet to come. But for all the expectations for Grimmson (Ingvar Sigurdsson) to be a dominant character here, nothing really comes of his quest to kill Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) and he disappears into the background. The character of Credence is revealed at the finale to be a Dumbledore, and the only one capable of killing his brother Albus (Jude Law), obviously necessary for the titled villain Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) to effect his plan to rule over both the wizard world and humans. That much is known, though the plot thread involving Leta Lestrange (Zoë Kravitz) and the accidental death of her infant brother Corvus is left unresolved, as we don't know the identity of the baby that Corvus was switched with. Who thinks Corvus might actually still be alive? Seems to me there's room in the mythology here to come up with something to make things even more convoluted down the road. I'll check in again, but quite honestly can't remember things from one film to the next, thereby suggesting I should watch a series like this all in a row to keep things straight. If that's even a possibility.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
8,lee_eisenberg,I got what I expected,5,26 November 2018,"""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" was what I expected. A lot of CGI. So much, in fact, that it was sometimes hard to tell what I was looking at. I haven't read the Fantastic Beasts books - and probably never will, considering how long it takes me to get through a book - so this is my exposure to that franchise. The cast turns the characters into some cool individuals, but the movie can't get seen as anything deeply intellectual. Even so, it's neat to see the early days of the Harry Potter universe. Enjoyable for its run time, just don't expect anything profound.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
9,jboothmillard,Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,7,26 November 2018,"The first in the prequel series to the wizarding world of Harry Potter was very good, I was looking forward to another movie and seeing where it would go next, screenplay by creator J.K. Rowling, directed by David Yates (Harry Potter: Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows Parts 1 & 2; The Legend of Tarzan). Basically set in 1927, the powerful dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) is being transferred by the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) from their maximum security prison to New York City to be tried in London for his various crimes. While departing, Grindelwald is freed by Abernathy (Kevin Guthrie), his follower and a MACUSA employee, Grindelwald kills the guards and escapes using the transfer carriage. Three months later, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is appealing to restore his international travel rights to the Ministry of Magic, they were revoked following his visit to New York City. Whilst there, he meets with Leta Lestrange (Zoë Kravitz), an old Hogwarts classmate now engaged to his Auror brother, Theseus (Callum Turner). The Ministry offers to restore Newt's travel rights on one condition, if he will work for them, alongside Theseus, to locate the Obscurial Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller), who has been seen in Paris, France. There are suspicions that Credence is Leta's long-lost brother, Corvus Lestrange, the last of a long line of pure-blood wizards, and Grindelwald believes Credence is the only person who can kill Hogwarts Professor Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law). Newt doesn't want to choose sides and declines, so the Auror Grimmson (Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson) is sent instead. Dumbledore meets with Newt after he leaves the Ministry, he asks him to locate Credence. Newt returns home to discover his American friends, Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol) and Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) have unexpectedly arrived. The MACUSA's 1926 citywide Obliviation order erased Muggles' bad memories, most of Jacob's memories were good, so he remembers most previous events. Queenie says that she and Jacob have been following her sister Tina (Katherine Waterston) to Europe, Tina is in Paris searching for Credence. Queenie also mentions that Tina thinks Newt is to be married to Leta Lestrange after seeing reports in the newspaper, but Newt has been confused for Theseus. Jacobis brought out of an enchantment spell, put on him by Queenie, they squabble about the marriage ban between wizards and muggles. Queenie is upset and leaves to find Tina, Newt and Jacob decide to go together to Paris to reconcile with the women. In Paris, Tina searches for Credence at a wizarding freak show at the Circus Arcanus, he causes a distraction and escapes, along with circus attraction Nagini (Claudia Kim) who can transform herself into a snake. Credence and Nagini search for his birth mother, they find the servant who put him up for adoption, then Grimmson, revealed to be working for Grindelwald, arrives and kills her. Meanwhile, Tina meets Yusuf Kama (William Nadylam) who is also searching for Credence. Newt and Jacob catch up with Yusuf and Tina, Yusuf explains that he made an Unbreakable Vow to kill Credence, he believes he is his step-brother and the last of the Lestrange family. Newt and Tina enter the French Ministry of Magic searching for documents that confirm Credence's identity, but they are discovered by Leta and Theseus. Newt and Tina reconcile after he explains the false reports, their search for information about Credence leads them to the Lestrange family tomb. Yusuf explains to Leta that they have the same mother, and Leta reveals that she unintentionally killed her infant brother, the child was therefore not Credence. However, things have been fabricated to lead Credence to the tomb. Grindelwald is holding a rally for his followers, it is there that Jacob finds Queenie. At the rally, Grindelwald preaches freedom from laws forcing wizards to remain hidden from muggles, and he shows future images from the forthcoming World War II to call for worldwide wizard supremacy and domination. Theseus leads Aurors to surround the rally, but Grindelwald turns his followers against them and sends them across Europe to spread his message. Grindelwald casts a circle of blue flame to divide followers from enemies, those who oppose are vaporised. Despite protests from Nagini and Jacob, Credence and Queenie cross the line to join him. Leta appears to swear allegiance, but sacrifices herself to attack Grindelwald, giving Newt, Tina, Jacob, Yusuf, Nagini, and Theseus the chance to escape. Grindelwald escapes, while the remaining heroes, alongside the immortal alchemist Nicolas Flamel (Brontis Jodorowsky), stop the blue flame and save Paris. Newt realises he must join the fight against Grindelwald, he and the others travel to Hogwarts where Newt presents Dumbledore with a vial he secretly stole from Grindelwald. The vial contains a blood pact made between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, the two wizards were friends many years before, Newt surmises that this prevents them from duelling each other, Dumbledore believes it may be possible to destroy the pact. In Austria, at his Nurmengard base, Grindelwald tells Credence his true identity as Aurelius Dumbledore, Albus' long-lost brother and the only person powerful enough to kill him. Also starring Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as Skender and Fiona Glascott as Minerva McGonagall. Redmayne is still good as the eccentric magizoologist, Fogler is still likeable as the good-natured Muggle, Depp gets more time (looking a bit like David Bowie) as the villain, Miller is fine, and Law is well cast as the younger wise wizard (not yet headmaster). I will admit the story and pacing is a little uneven at times, but you get swept in the action with terrific chase and fight sequences, the magical special effects are great, and it is wonderful to have a return to Hogwarts castle, this certainly sets you up for what's to come next, a fun fantasy adventure. Very good!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
10,studioAT,weak entry to the wizarding world,1,20 August 2019,"You can't blame JK Rowling for wanting to keep the 'Harry Potter' saga going, especially on film, but this sequel falls a bit flat.The first 'Fantastic Beasts' film, while not being great in any shape or form, at least told a good story, one that could have stood alone, and there were some good performances.This one however tries to do way too much - set up future instalments (do we really need 5 of these films as is anticipated??) introduce us to all the key players who may or may not be useful in these future films, while also providing enough links back to 'Harry Potter' to please the fans.In the end it does none of these convincingly, and ends up being an odd, quite dark film that doesn't live up to its billing.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
11,oscaralbert,"Ever since this writer chick discovered the character of ""D. Umbridge . . . """,8,21 November 2018,". . . a few movies back, she's seemed obsessed--at least on a subconscious level--with the Dire Days of America's Defection to the Dark Side. This is understandable, since the flicks emanate from the USA's always eponymous Warner Bros., who cannot help themselves from warning about America's upcoming Calamities, Catastrophes, Cataclysms, and Apocalypti. In Hogwart's version of Reality, as in Today's U.S., a titanic struggle persists between a strong Death Eater Party and a much weaker and more loosely organized band who fancy themselves to be the ""Good Guys."" Warner warns us that whether we call this latter force ""America's intelligence community"" or the ""Aurors of the Ministry of Magic,"" these ineffectual bozos will always show up a day late and a dollar short until they grow a pair. It does not make much difference how much movie make-up and hair styling is used to make ""Grindelwald"" a dead ringer for the U.S. Oval Office Occupant if no one is willing to step in when Aurors are being massacred or American resident journalists are being tortured and chopped into little pieces in Saudi embassies. With FANTASTIC BEASTS: THE CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD Warner Bros. is warning us to strip the rabid base of ""core supporters"" of their citizenship, wealth, and assets under the Benedict Arnold, RICO Organized Crime, and Civil Forfeiture laws and permanently deport them to an escape-proof holding center in Antarctica. If we wait for the Ministry of Magic to do this, Freedom flies out our window for the next 3,000 years.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
12,ferguson-6,a bit darker and more sinister,7,16 November 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's been seven years since the final Harry Potter movie, and this is the second entry in the planned series of 5 prequels entitled FANTASTIC BEASTS, based on a (fictional) Hogwarts' textbook written by Magizoologist Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne). Of course the characters and stories are from the pen of J.K. Rowling, and who better to bring us the war pitting pure-blood wizards against Muggles?FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM was released in 2016, and it was mostly an introduction to these characters and to some of the cutest and oddest creatures we'd ever encountered on screen. This second entry is much darker and more sinister, and tries to develop quite a few characters ... perhaps too many. On top of the roster of players, romantic complications abound, and a search for one's roots/identity is yet another sub-plot. And then there's that whole Nazi element - leaving us all a bit bewildered at trying to keep up (although, it is fun trying).David Yates directed the last four Harry Potter movies, and now the first two Fantastic Beasts films. He kicks this one off with a spectacular action sequence featuring a black carriage being drawn by a team of majestic flying dragons during a driving rain storm ... all part of a daring 1927 prison escape by the titular Grindewald (Johnny Depp with a bleach punk do). It's a breathtaking sequence, and the best of many visual wonders throughout - including my favorite, a very cool statue effect and a fabulous kelp seahorse.Most of the key players return from the first film, though, as previously mentioned, their stories are more elaborate. Eddie Redmayne returns as Newt, our main guide through this universe. Katherine Waterston is back as auror and fringy love interest Tina, Alison Sudol returns as Tina's mind-reading sister Queenie, and Dan Fogler resumes his comic relief duties as Jacob. Jude Law is Albus Dumbledore (yes, the first name is needed), and he is prevented from fighting Gindewald (Depp) due to some youthful ""bonding"" that occurred years prior. Zoe Kravitz is Leta Lestrange, Carmen Ejogo is Seraphina Picquery, and Ezra Miller is the lost soul Credence Barebone. Newly introduced characters include Claudia Kim as shapeshifter Nagini, Callum Turner as Newt's brother Theseus, and Brontis Jodorowsky (son of renowned cult director Alejandro Jadorowsky, EL TOPO) as non-ghost Flamel. If that's not enough characters to track, you should know the story skips from New York to London to Paris and back around again.Expect some happy gasps from the audience as Hogwarts is revisited, but the darkness and similarities to Nazi beginnings may surprise those expecting two hours of cutesy creatures springing from Newt's coat ... although, those exist as well. We do learn that 'salamander eyes' are not to be used while flirting, and it will be quite interesting to see how these stories close in to the Harry Potter world over the next 3 prequel-sequels (scheduled through 2024). It should be a fun ride - though not as fun as riding that seahorse.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
13,morrison-dylan-fan,My first IMAX viewing.,6,20 November 2018,"For years I've heard about how IMAX offers a high-quality option to see the latest blockbuster, but due to having only read about the one in London, I assumed none were near me. Making plans to go Christmas shopping in Manchester, I found out that there was an IMAX at the Vue in The Print Works, which was getting a major upgrade with the brand new ""IMAX Laser"" format, this led to me booking a ticket for the first film to be played in the screening room.View on the film:Toning down the Steam Punk appearance of the first film which allowed it to stand (somewhat) separate from its roots, returning director David Yates & cinematographer Philippe Rousselot replace it with more of a delve into Harry Potter style Fantasy Action set-pieces, which whilst offering moments of magical thrills (Yates makes excellent use of the IMAX format to give the beasts a huge, towering appearance) does end up becoming the cliché brash blue lights in the sky. Appearing to have a tighter grip on the series, the screenplay by J.K. Rowling surprisingly feels half-finished, with Rowling offering tantalising set-ups (from illegal globe-trotting in a bucket, to ""real life"" events of the sinking of the Titanic and WWII being the first time real events have appeared in the Potter franchise) only to leave them hanging unfinished.Pushing all else aside to fill in background of Potter mythology, Rowling does well at giving a heaviness from history in the blood bond between Grindelwald and Dumbledore, but in spending all this focus on characters from Potter, makes those from Fantastic Beasts have little impact on unfolding events. Returning with a dapper Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston and Dan Fogler continue giving the best turns of the series as alluring Goldstein and gee wiz Kowalski, whilst Johnny Depp dabbles being a creep,as Grindlewald reveals his crimes.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
14,deloudelouvain,Eddie Redmayne is still the weakest link.,7,26 February 2019,"This sequel is of the same level as the first movie. It's a bit of entertainment, for the whole family, with some good CGI moments. If you don't like fantasy movies with weird creatures and alot of CGI's then you shouldn't watch this one because that's basically the whole movie. The story is okay, just a bit more complicated than the first movie, but still a movie to watch with the whole family, kids included. The acting is okay from most of the actors excepted from the main character Newt Scamander played by Eddie Redmayne. To me he's just a mediocre actor but that's my opinion. Like in the first movie he's the weakest link and both movies could have been better with another actor.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
15,siderite,A convoluted mess that depends too much on remembering the first movie and not enough on beasts,6,17 February 2019,"For a movie called Fantastic Beasts, there are few of them and not relevant to the plot at all. Instead, a lot of characters fumbling in confusion in order to get to the bottom of Credence's identity. Magic is ubiquitous, but feels more like technology in this film that doesn't feel magic, only CGI. Meanwhile Grindelwald plays the role of a politician in a world of idiots and every other character acts completely different from their actual role.Why can't women cast anything serious? Men do everything and women are helpless. Why can't Aurors cast anything serious? I mean, they're supposed to be trained for it. Why must a lot of people die before the others consider casting a counter spell? Who can take seriously someone who spouts accusations of persecution from authorities then proceeds on destroying Paris? Who is everybody in this film? Where did they come from? Why should I care? All these are questions that you will find no answer to in this film.The special effects are great, the actors did a good job, even Depp, who seems to be half asleep most of the time, but the plot is a total mess and has no roots and goes nowhere. My suggestion is, if you want to watch the film, wait until the next one(s) are released and watch them in order, starting with the first Fantastic Beasts, otherwise you will understand nothing.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
16,FeastMode,my notes,2,27 July 2019,"It's hard for me to say this is that much worse than the first movie. but i went into it unenthusiastically, and i lost interest within the first 10 minutes. half-paid attention for the rest of the movie with most of it on fast speed. the ""cool"" magic stuff really isn't for me. i could tell some of the CGI was amazing, but it didn't please me like it does in so many other movies. this series is outside of my taste range. it may also be a bad movie, but i didn't give it enough of a chance to say that confidently (1 viewing)",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
17,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Franchise Beasts: The Crimes Of Capitalism,4,18 November 2018,"In some ways, 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald (2018)' is more cohesive - or, at least, consistent - than its predecessor, especially when it comes to tone. The issue is that it's just more consistently dull, both in terms of visuals (including dark, muddy cinematography and difficult-to-watch, CG-based action-scenes) and story. It's almost exactly as structurally unsound, to boot, with the entire affair focusing on the filler-feeling side-plot of the first without much thought given to the more successful, actual 'fantastic beast'-based stuff that this series is now, somewhat erroneously, forever named upon. It seems like a feature-length 'B story' with only mere moments of entertainment, a few fleeing glimpses of interesting character interactions and surprisingly dark back-stories, and a whole heap of fan-service filled, sequel-bait set-up that makes the entire affair feel, ultimately, entirely pointless. It's just a simple, essentially skippable stepping stone in a slow-paced and, in itself, inconsequential story that we already know the outcome of. It seems that the real magic is the way that it somehow leaves you with the bitter taste of disappointment even though you didn't expect it to be any good in the first place. 4/10",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
18,ThomasDrufke,"Bland, Confusing, and Convoluted",2,8 December 2018,"I generally hate writing a review about a movie/tv episode that I hate. It feels like a waste of energy, especially knowing that there are plenty of people out there who genuinely enjoy this film series, but I'm just not one of them. I LOVE the Harry Potter movies and grew up with those 8 films, but I've never felt the connection to the Fantastic Beasts series that I did to Potter. It's not necessarily fair to make that comparison but alas, there's virtually nothing good about the Crimes of Grindelwald. Confusing, convoluted, and at times way too convenient for its own good, the film has nothing to grapple onto emotionally. In fact, the one decent thing about the first film (Queenie and Jacob) is entirely ruined in this film's third act. Disappointingly, the film has almost pushed aside the beasts side of the series completely, in exchange for a cliched villain with Grindelwald, who severely lacks in originality. Admittedly, I found myself lost for most of the runtime. Until they inevitably put out ""Cursed Child"" in 15 years, this may be it for me with this universe.2.3/10",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

24,The-Sarkologist,Felt like filler,4,26 November 2018,"I am starting to think that maybe this whole Harry Potter craze is probably starting to come to an end. I guess the main problem here is that this film really didn't seem to be going, well, anywhere. In fact it seemed to be simply setting the scene for the next three films in the series, and honestly, after sitting through this one, I'm not all that sure whether I will be able to then end up sitting through the next three, particularly considering that this one was starting to get rather annoying.I guess that is the problem when you are creating a film that is going to end up being a series, such as this one. Okay, it does happen to be the prequels, and we do have a number of characters from the original films that are making an appearance, though they are, not surprisingly, much much younger. However, considering that it happens to be set in 1929 it does make me wonder how old wizards actually live til, and whether they actually age slower than us muggles.I guess the thing with this film though is that we are dealing that more mature characters than the previous films, where the protagonists were all children. I guess this also undermines the films somewhat considering that since we are so used to seeing this world through the eyes of children, suddenly having adults running around is a little jarring. Mind you, I guess this is also following along with the theme from the books in that we would be growing up with the characters, and now that these films are progressively being released, most of those who grew up with Harry Potter would well and truly be adults now.This film sort of starts shortly after the previous film, and we have Grimwald being transferred to England to stand trial for his crimes. Mind you, whenever a movie talks about transferring a prisoner, you know what is going to happen - they will end up escaping to start rampaging across the world once again, and sure enough this is what happens. However, this film is set mainly in Paris, with a few sections in London which is really only there to set the scene.Once again we have the characters from the previous film come back, though there is this confusion over whether our hero is getting married or not, which basically means that the girl he met in New York is somewhat upset. Mind you, this is one of those things that I probably shouldn't be all that surprised about, namely because this is what one should expect when it comes to a Hollywood film. Yeah, I guess this one, while okay, was a little odd in parts, and somewhat dull, particularly since it really didn't seem to be doing all that much, and the ending was certainly a little off putting as well, since it was clearly setting the scene for the next film, and had no real satisfying conclusion.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
25,tomgillespie2002,Too concerned with moving the chess pieces into place to deliver a coherent story,5,25 February 2019,"Aside from Peter Jackson's epic Lord of the Rings trilogy (the less said about his more recent adaptation of The Hobbit, the better), no cinematic journey into the realms of the fantastical has captured the imagination of audiences in recent years quite as much as J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, a cash-making juggernaut for both Warner Bros. and the author herself. When the franchise came to a conclusion in 2011, it was never going to be away from our screens for very long, and the 'Wizarding World' universe was expanded in 2016 with the surprisingly charming Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Like Harry Potter, Beasts managed to find a nice balance between wand-swishing set-pieces, enduring us to a new set of compelling characters, and building a tangible new world for it all to take place in. And with Eddie Redmayne's Newt Scamander - a shy and awkward David Attenborough type - at the centre of it all, the pieces were in place for an engrossing - and different - saga to get out teeth into.The delicate balance found by Rowling and director David Yates the first time around is sadly nowhere to be found in this follow-up, The Crimes of Grindelwald. This is part two of a five-part story, so introductions are brushed aside in favour of plot, plot and some more plot. The first hour is taken up by bringing this new group of characters back into the fold, finding Newt grounded by the Ministry of Magic following his shenanigans last time around, just as a new threat rears its ugly face in the form of Johnny Depp's muggle-hating Grindelwald. The bad wizard is searching for the troubled Credence (Ezra Miller), who has emerged in Paris with a circus performer called Nagini (Clauia Kim), but Auror Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) is already on the case. It seems as though everybody is searching for Credence. Even the young Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law), who is mysteriously reluctant to face his old friend-gone-bad himself, tries to convince Newt to go to Paris in his stead. Muggle Kowalski (Dan Fogler) is also back with his memory mainly in tact, as is his girlfriend Queenie (Alison Sudol), who is struggling to deal with a Ministry ban on Wizard-Muggle relationships.The Crimes of Grindelwald throws everything it can into the mix: a rain-soaked battle in the air, Newt caught up in no less than three romantic entanglements, a detour to Hogwarts, and more name-drops and Easter eggs than you can shake a stick at. It's an unfathomable wall of information, punctured by an occasional set-piece that only truly come to life when the titular (and frustratingly sidelined) beasts are involved. The Harry Potter films dodged this bullet by allowing the audience to grow into this world, and often grow up with the characters, but Fantastic Beasts goes all out without really justifying its flagrant disregard for coherency, or earning the right to take such an approach. Although he is often pushed out of the spotlight by the many side-plots occurring, Redmayne just about holds it all together with another endearingly twitchy performance, and Law, who combines some of Michael Gambon mannerisms with a more youthful swagger, proves to be a shrewd bit of casting. Ultimately, this follow-up is too busy moving the chess pieces into place to focus on character, and many are pushed into the background as a result. There are great revelations, but after two hours of trying to keep up with who's who and what's what, they don't have much impact. It isn't enough to derail the series completely, but I'll have a hard time remembering where the hell we are by the time the third entry rolls around.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
26,cruise01,A great sequel with lots of characters and plot points set up but lacking in a story of its own.,8,17 November 2018,"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (4 out of 5 stars).Fantastic Beasts is a good fantasy film. It may suffer from some poor storytelling for being the middle chapter of a series. Being the second movie out of five. Which means there was a lot being introduced like characters and sub plots that are leaving it open for more sequels. The first may still be the better movie. This sequel is still good and worth while.The plot was a bit weak. Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) escapes during a prisoner transport. And is on the search for a missing Credence (Ezra Miller). Meanwhile, Newt (Eddie Redmayne), Jacob (Dan Fogler), and Tina (Katherine Waterston) are also on the search for Credence. When the ministry is trying to keep the peace and they have Newt's brother Theseus (Callum Turner) and their group of people on the search for him before he goes to the wrong hands. That is all I can say about the plot before it starts entering spoiler territory. That is one issue with the plot with this film. Not really much happens within the 2 and a half hour movie. Besides bringing in more characters like Theseus, Leta (Zoe Kravitz), and Nagini (Claudia Kim). While Credence is trying to discover his origins. Characters are all searching for something within the long running time. Until, the climatic showdown were characters are divided with joining Grindelwald or against him and trying to stop his reign of destruction.Otherwise, the film is entertaining. If you loved the characters in the first film, you will still love them in this one. Plus there are some brief backstories like Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) and Grindelwald. And a little revisit of Hogwarts which fans of Harry Potter series will enjoy. Plus a twist with one character's reveal will give you chills for the next movie in the final scene.The cast ensemble was great. Zoe Kravitz was only shown in a picture in the last movie and has a bigger role in this sequel. And she was great. Jude Law was also good as Albus.The visual effects are also good. I did think David Yate's dark lighting direction is getting a little old. Most of the film's lighting looks like it has a matte lens. The opening action sequence with Grindelwald's escaping prison was dark and difficult to make sense of what is going in the action.Overall, Fantastic Beasts was a good fantasy film. If you can set aside that the plot spent more time trying to set up for further movies than having a story itself. Or the dark lighting direction. The characters, visual effects, and story do make a surprising return in this sequel.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
27,Dr_Coulardeau,Lack of adulthood sanity,8,16 April 2019,"Dear Harry Potter has become an adult, though under another name, Newt Scamander, and yet in the second film the famous Hogwarts school and Albus Dumbledore are brought back because the first one was rather at the wrong place in New York and with the wrong argument against a bad Wizard, Grindelwald, who was only causing a lot of disruption in the muggle world just for fun, and maybe a little bit because he only likes purebloods. But that was only some kind of defiance, a defiant challenge to the established order among wizards and that establishment is rather a strict police state in many ways, with police - they call them Aurors - passports to go anywhere, and all kinds of magic surveillance.The second film tries to go back to some depth à la Harry Potter. Then Grindelwald is targeting the world of Wizards and their rather feudal government with an uprising against their weak stance as for muggles, non-magics or whatever the non-wizards can be called by wizards. He wants to unify the pure-bloods to impose a pure-blood government and the general assembly of his supporters is typical of some kind of Munich Meeting with Adolf Hitler as the main star speaker, or should I say keynote speaker.But that is easy, an easy use of Brexit and the craziness that goes along with it, or any other populist leader, including Trump, and his crazy weekly mass meetings where he speaks for hours, ranting and raving, improvising from his cuffs and agitating thousands of supporters with propaganda that has nothing to do with the etiquette of a president of the United States. He is more like a certain Eugene McCarthy, but that one never was a POTUS of any sort. But that is easy, and Grindelwald loses his battle and has to disappear again, till next time, next video. He naturally finds some refuge in Austria. It is true it could have been Hungary, but well Austria is the birth state of the Adolf I was speaking of before.The two films though will remain in our minds because of the phenomenal special effects that are so rich we find it slightly difficult to follow them, but that's OK since they are used only to mesmerize your visual attention and thus to prevent you from thinking too much and wondering what the meaning might be. This type of filmmaking is typical of either videogames or action films for vacationing teenyboppers or junior high school students trying to forget they are in a class and use their smartphones to have some kind of visionary escape.That's strange in a way because Harry Potter was more adult than that. To make the film slightly more sentimental, Albus Dumbledore has a brother who was in a way gotten rid of by a babysitter, if this girl is that much of something and this brother Aurelius Dumbledore has been raised by muggles as a muggle boy. What a mistake. But Albus Dumbledore did not have the courage of looking for his brother and freeing him from his muggle slavery. It is Grindelwald that does it and reveals his real identity to him and his magic power by finally giving him a magic wand. That's an end, isn't it? But that also means there will be a third episode. You can never stop business in this market economy.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
28,eddie_baggins,Nothing but dull filler,4,18 November 2018,"Two film's into the new wizarding world and I think it's now safe to say Fantastic Beasts is never going to be Harry Potter.Its a big void to fill and one that was always going to take some serious magic to fill anyway but poor old Beasts not only pales in significance to the simple joys and wonders of its much better cousin, its just not a very interesting or good film regardless of its bloodline.A big step backwards from the enjoyable if highly forgettable first film from 2016, Crimes of Grindelwald is nothing but a filler episode for a franchise that has been planned for five feature films, as we again follow Eddie Redmayne's slightly irritating and rather so-so Newt Scamander on another adventure, that this time features more of Johnny Depp's big bad Gellert Grindelwald and an abundance of side plots and straying's that matter very little.It's hard to remember a film from recent memory that literally has so little pay-off, clear reason to exist in the form it does or a film that spends so much time on plodding out a plotline with pure padding and fluff, which makes returning director David Yates event feel like such a skippable offering.The film still looks quite wonderous (as you'd expect from a film with such a budget) as we traverse an array of eye capturing sets, that features a highlight return to Hogwarts, while the films so called fantasic beasts are inventive enough but Crimes of Grindelwald lacks heart or soul or character depth needed to make all the magic or lack thereof come together.It's not like Yates film doesn't have enough characters to work with as returning cast members like Catherine Waterston and Ezra Miller or the rather annoying Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol as love interest Gracie are joined by Depp, Zoe Kravitz as Leta Lestrange and Jude Law as everyones favourite professor Albus Dumbledore.These new players all do fine in their roles, with Depp the best his been in a while and Law doing a typically solid rendition of a younger yet no less wiser Dumbledore but we don't really get enough meaningful time with anyone of these characters, much like all the others, meaning its increasingly hard to care about their dilemas and outcomes and by the time Crimes of Grindelwald's downright lame finale roles around, it feels like these performers have been duped, much like the audience has.Final Say -The first Fantastic Beasts didn't exactly set the world on fire but it feels like a masterpiece compared to Crimes of Grindelwald.A mostly charmless and dull affair that feels like it's whole point of being is to open the door for a seemingly more exciting chapter, after this effort, this still budding franchise sits in a precarious position with all signs pointing towards it sadly being lifeless in the water, living off nothing more than the goodwill of its beloved kin.2 public rallies out of 5",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
29,filipemanuelneto,"Much better than the film that preceded it, it makes room for a promising follow-up.",7,27 June 2020,"The Harry Potter universe is one of the most lucrative and striking cinematic phenomena ever and has faithful admirers. Personally, I am one of many teens who read all the books and saw all the films but I was very disappointed with ""Fantastic Beasts"". However, I decided to watch this film and see if there would be any improvement here. And I'm glad I did. Far from being wonderful, its much better than its predecessor.After the events of the first film, Newt Scamander is sent by Dumbledore to Paris in order to look for Credence, who survived. Also alive and gone missing is the fearsome Gellert Grindelwald, responsible for many deaths and atrocities, committed to starting a war for global dominance in which sorcerers are to dominate non-sorcerers.Its a generally better film than its predecessor, as it has a lighter pace and takes much less time to develop. The story told seems to have gained a logical thread and that's a good thing. The use and appearance of magical creatures was not as intense as in the first film, and this may have helped to focus the film on the story which, until now, was too weak and uninteresting. However, too much creativity is also a problem as some ideas in the plot end up useless. The development of the characters improved and the material given to the actors was certainly better. David Yates did a good job and takes advantage of all his experience, as he directed the most adult and developed films in the Harry Potter franchise.The cast, certainly due to a better script and material to work on, achieved better results. Despite all this, it continues to make unforgivable mistakes. Some sub-plots, sequences and even characters, like Flamel for example, are totally unnecessary. Eddie Redmayne finally manages to give Scamander a certain attitude and leadership, although he is still uncharismatic and boring. Katherine Waterston also improves here. Callum Turner is good, Zoë Kravitz was a good addition to the role of the psychologically complex Leta Lestrange and Jude Law shone as the intelligent and young Dumbledore. Less positive was Dan Fogler, who is no longer as funny as in the first film. If this ends up being compensated by gaining dramatic depth, the film gives a terrible excuse to justify his presence, given that the character had been ""obliviated"", that is, had his memories erased at the end of the first film. On the negative side, I would highlight the poor performance of Alison Sudol. It was not her fault but the fact is that her sweet and stupid character stopped being sweet and became just stupid. Finally, we need to talk more about Johnny Depp. If the cameo in the first film achieved to hide what his participation was going to be, this film shows us the greatness of the actor in the role of another fearsome villain, who is not far behind Voldemort in malice and cruelty. The actor is good and brought his character to life in a brilliant way. If everything goes well for Depp in the films that follow, this could become one of the most outstanding characters in his career, who has left us great jobs before.Technically, this is a very visual film, thanks to tons of very high quality CGI, as we would expect in the Harry Potter universe. Cinematography has good colors, a good use of light and dark and clear footage. To add aesthetic quality we have the charm of the Thirties, with its props and clothings. Much of the film is set between London and Paris, with a brief and unnecessary passage through Hogwarts, and the sets, in all these moments, were meticulously done. The soundtrack, by James Newton Howard, is good and epic, but not surprising.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
30,leonblackwood,Not that entertaining! 3/10,3,22 April 2019,"Review:
I'm not a big Potter geek so I was watching this film from a stand-alone point of view, and I must admit, I really didn't enjoy it. Right from the beginning of the movie, during the epic breakout, it just seemed like a right mess, and the straight-forward concept was over complicated. I would have preferred the director to spend more time on character building than the CGI, which seemed a bit over the top throughout the film. That's not to say that it didn't look amazing, it's just that the storyline quite boring, and I got a bit fed up with all of the technical jargon, which went straight over my head. I was also expecting a big showdown towards the end, which turned out to be a big build-up to the third instalment. On the plus side, Depp was really creepy and the costumes added to the unique look of the film but I still found it unentertaining. It kicks off in 1927, were the Magical Congress of the United States of America is transferring the powerful dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) to London to be tried for his crimes. Grindelward escapes, helped by Abernathy (Kevin Guthrie). Three months later, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is asked to work alongside his brother Theseus (Callum Turner) to locate Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) in Paris. Credence maybe Leta's (Zoe Kravitz) lost brother, Corvus Lestrange, the only person who can kill Hogwarts professor Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law). Confused! You Will Be! Newt declines, and the Auror Grimmson is dispatched in his place. Later, Dumbledore persuades Newt to go. Newt's American friends, Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol) and Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) visit him unexpectedly. Jacob & Queenie quarrel about marrying, and an upset Queenie leaves to find her sister Tina (Katherine Waterston), who is searching for Credence in Paris. Newt and Jacob decide to follow. In Paris, Tina searches for Credence at the Circus Arcanus. Credence and a circus freak named Nagini (Claudia Kim) escape after causing a distraction. While searching for Credence's birth mother, he and Nagini locate the servant who put him up for adoption. However, Grimmson, who is secretly working for Grindelwald, arrives and kills her. Meanwhile, Tina meets Yusuf Kama (William Nadylam), who is also hunting Credence. Newt and Jacob follow Yusuf to Tina, and Yusuf explains that he made an unbreakable vow to kill Credence, who he believes is his step-brother and the last of the Lestrange family. Their search for information about Credence leads them to the Lestrange family tomb. Yusuf says that he and Leta have the same mother, and Leta reveals that she unintentionally killed her infant brother and thus he cannot be Credence. However, a fabricated trail led Credence to the tomb, where Grindelwald is holding a rally for his followers. Jacob finds Queenie at the rally. At the rally, Grindelwald preaches against laws forcing wizards to be hidden from muggles and utilises future images of World War II to call for worldwide wizard supremacy and domination. Led by Theseus, Aurors surround the rally, but Grindelwald creates a diversion while sending his followers across Europe to spread his message. Grindelwald casts a circle of blue flame to divide followers from enemies. Credence and Queenie cross over to join him, while Leta sacrifices herself by attacking Grindelwald, allowing Newt, Tina, Jacob Yusuf Nagini, and Theseus to escape. As Grindelwald leaves, the remaining heroes unite alongside the immortal alchemist Nicolas Flamel to defeat Grindelwald's blue flame. Newt now realises he must join the fight. At Hogwarts, Newt gives Dumbledore a vial stolen from Grindelwald. It contains the blood pact that Grindelwald and Dumbledore, once young lovers, made with one another in their youth. Newt surmises that this has prevented Dumbledore and Grindelwald from duelling each other. Dumbledore confirms this but believes it may be possible to destroy the pact. At his Nurmengard base in Austria, Grindelwald reveals Credence's true identity as Aurelius Dumbledore, Albus' long-lost brother and the only person powerful Anouilh to defeat him. Blah! Blah Blah! Queenie uses her mind-reading ability to advise Grindelwald on ways to control Credence. A baby bird that Credence had been caring for is revealed to be a phoenix, a bird associated with the Dumbledore family. So Complicated! If you don't remember the characters names you will definitely lose the plot. I've had a chat with loads of Harry Potter fans, who also didn't think that much of this movie, so I'm not alone with thinking that it was a big letdown. I just hope the next movie in this franchise, cleans up the mess it left behind. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by David Yates, who also brought you Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, The Legend of Tarzan and the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. On paper, he was the perfect choice to direct this movie especially after the success of the Harry Potter and the first Fantastic Beasts movies, but something didn't quite work with this film. I don't know if it was because he was trying to keep close to J.K. Rowling's vision, or he caught the Johnny Depp bug, where everything he touches goes downhill. Anyway, I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with my review, especially the people who actually enjoyed the film, but I can honestly say that I won't be watching it a second time. With the next movie coming in 2020, and another 3 movies in this franchise to be released, I'm sure this is just a build up to how the story will unfold.Budget: $200million

31,TheMovieDiorama,The Crimes of Grindelwald committed the ultimate crime of being boring.,4,19 November 2018,"Firstly, let me start by saying that I am a fan of the 'Wizarding World'. 'Harry Potter' is arguably my favourite franchise and, whilst there were issues, I did enjoy the first 'Fantastic Beasts'. But please, sit back and do not go anywhere...because I've got some things to say. Credence somehow survives his obliteration from the first film, to which dark wizard Grindelwald sets him a path to join him and his followers. A young Dumbledore innocently asks Scamander to retrieve him before it's too late. There's also a broken family tree regarding the Lestrange ancestry, a few romances, the occasional spell and the odd fantastic beast. I have no joy in saying this, but this sequel is the first 'Wizarding World' entry that is bad. It's not good, in the slightest. Why though? How can such an assured franchise have such a dismal chapter? It's not the acting. Redmayne bumbles his way along sheepishly, which proves to be oddly charming. Law has the aura and spiritual presence of a young Dumbledore. Kravitz packed in some much needed emotion. Heck, even Depp was perfectly solid with his menacing demeanour. It's not the visual effects. The magical creatures looked glorious and the effects from spells were magnificent to watch. It's nothing extravagant as we've seen it all before, yet remains consistently good. It's not Yates' directing style. The experienced 'Harry Potter' director knows how to work the camera to propel that sense of wonderment and awe. It's not Howard's score. Seamlessly blending the Hogwarts theme tune with the new 'Fantastic Beasts' score. So, who's really responsible? J.K. Rowling.She proves that not all novelists can make the transition to screenplay writing, and unfortunately that's abundantly clear after watching this. Rowling's mind, much like the world she imagined, is thick with lore. Characters, spells, creatures, environments and plot details. It's all very elaborate. Yet, there's no focus. Consistently jumping from one plot point to another. Flashbacks, foreshadowing and the criminal offence of excessive exposition. She utilised all the uninspired narrative techniques to tell a story, and unfortunately her need for nostalgia and franchise building has left this chapter feeling like a ""filler"". The overall story hasn't progressed. It leaves more purposefully constructed gaping plot holes and unanswered questions, so that you come back in two years and watch the sequel. Then we come to my all time favourite criticism: plot conveniences. Remember when everyone in New York City got obliviated? Well, it coincidentally only affected bad memories. So that means we've got all the characters from the first film back again, for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Queenie and her No-Maj literally only provide comic relief, and even that is tame. Credence is back after being decimated, negating the emotional turmoil that the first film left with. Nagini has one or two lines. Oh look, Nicolas Flamel! Eyyy, he said ""Azkaban"". Wait, is that McGonagall teaching before she's born? Oh, who cares! The plot is messier than an Obscuris. But what I'm getting at is that the story and all of its details are aimed towards the more hardcore fans of Rowling's work. I honestly believe casual audiences will be left feeling confused and bewildered at all the questions this sequel raises. Everything was needlessly complicated! The ""jaw-dropping"" conclusion left me raising my eyebrows instead of exclaiming ""what!? No way! I must find out what happens next!"", and I would consider myself a fan of Rowling's fiction. Nothing entranced me. Nothing captivated me. Nothing was worth my time. An absolute disappointment.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

33,digitalbeachbum,Failure!,1,13 March 2019,I reviewed the first movie with four stars and this one was worse. The movie lacked any action and meaningful dialog. The characters were boring. The story was boring. There was no purpose for this movie. They pushed things along just to get it done.There is no denying that anyone who thinks this is a masterpiece of a 10/10 is nothing more than fanboy fanfare hardon for Harry. Period. This is far from being a masterpiece and I find it insulting to the fans who liked the books. The casting is meh. The direction is meh. The cinematography is meh. The CG is awful. The script is terrible. It could have been so much more.,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

I'm certainly glad I didn't see it in theaters because the Harry Potter Wiki was a necessary companion to keeping all the little intricacies straight. However, if you can stick with it, it's full of epic storytelling rewards.

35,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Fantastic Beasts"" series still looking for its footing, but remains interesting",7,30 November 2018,"The second film in the ""Fantastic Beasts"" series, ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" gives us a clearer sense of where ""Harry Potter"" author-turned-screenwriter J.K. Rowling intends to go with this supposed five-film prequel arc. The first installment, 2016's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,"" took us to a whole new corner of Rowling's universe - 1920s New York City - and tried to charm fans with the same imagination while introducing a whole new cast of characters. With audiences a little warmer to these names and faces, ""Crimes of Grindelwald"" goes for a wider scope with more ties to the original ""Potter"" series, and it proves very audacious for a second step.""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" isn't especially simple to follow. After Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) escapes prison, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) returns to London and at the urging of his old professor, Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law), becomes part of a four-way manhunt in Paris to find Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller), who was not only not destroyed in the last film, but also believed to be the last of a line of pureblood wizards.That sounds clearer and more concise than it is - Rowling's script feels as though it was adapted from the book she should've written to tell this story. The plot, and the characters especially, don't have the breathing room on the screen that a novel would allow. Consequently, outside of Newt, the core hero group of Jacob (Dan Fogel), Queenie (Alison Sudol) and Tina (Katherina Waterston) have still yet to win us over, and the events of ""Crimes of Grindelwald"" rely on that, which is challenging.Getting transported back into the Wizarding World, it turns out, counts for something, but not everything. Part of what made the ""Harry Potter' series magical was experiencing the story through the Harry, Ron and Hermione's coming of age. The heroes here are complicated adults, or worse - adults who seem complicated, but we don't understand why, so we aren't sympathetic. Audiences will likely remain curious about the characters as they did after the first film, but still not feel the emotional connection.Newt remains, however, a critical exception. His authentic awkwardness makes him a unique and special protagonist, one more interesting that Harry himself, and the kind of hero that only the Wizarding World could support given the kindness and inclusion of Rowling's universe. He can't carry this film given the sheer size of the ensemble, which also includes Newt's brother Theseus (Callum Turner), who's an auror, and Theseus' fiancé and Newt's old flame Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz) not to mention the suitcase full of endearing magical creatures.Depp's Grindelwald is the next most interesting. Depp exercises a healthy measure of restraint, which is shocking given he's playing the villain. Even with a preachy monologue that screams for him to chew scenery, he largely channels the attention he gets in this role into a calm and mysterious charisma. His measured performance might even be enough to coax those disappointed with ""Crimes"" into seeing at least the next installment. Similarly, Depp's counterpoint in Law's performance as Dumbledore also had the right amount of gravitas without trying too hard.As making Grindelwald the title character would suggest, ""Crimes"" differs most from the first ""Fantastic Beasts"" in tone. Whereas that first film was a bit more fanciful, there's a darker vibe to ""Crimes of Grindelwald"" that is much more reminiscent of the last four ""Potter"" films, which were also directed by David Yates, a fact that serves him well here. In fact, there are a lot of similarities between ""Crimes of Grindelwald"" and ""Order of the Phoenix"" in particular, not just aesthetically, but even in terms of the story and plot.""Order of the Phoenix,"" however, was the fifth installment, and here we are at the end of Round 2 of ""Fantastic Beasts."" The carriage is way before the thestral. Although some will declare this as evidence that Rowling's magic has run out, ""Crimes of Grindelwald"" still carries enough of the curiosity, wonder and a terrific hero to give her another chance, but she unquestionably needs to dial back on plot to give us a chance to really invest in these new characters. She must find a way to tell the rest of this story in a way more suitable for the screen, or the only audience she'll have left by the end of these films are the Potteriest of Potterheads.~Steven CThanks for reading!

37,southdavid,Franchise Beats and How To Make Them.,7,20 November 2018,"Newt Scamandar (Eddie Redmayne) is asked by both the Ministry of Magic, and by his old headmaster Dumbeldore (Jude Law) to head to Paris to try and discover the location of the powerful and troubled Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) before he falls into the clutches of the escaped zealot Grindlewald (Johnny Depp). In doing so, Newt reunites with his childhood sweetheart, Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz) but also with Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) who Newt has developed feelings for since their New York Adventure.Though I can see the flaws, I really liked ""Crimes Of Grindlewald"". As a film, in and of itself, it's fair to say that doesn't really work. There's little genuine arc or story to it, unlike the first film that was an introduction to the characters but also a self-contained adventure. Here we're genuinely in part two of five territory, it's is almost all about characters choosing their sides for the upcoming civil war that may be in the offing. Particularly, it's about Newt's initial choice to remain neutral and his ability to see the good in any monster, and what it will take to shake that. As a result, the film is a lot of ""lore"". Trips back to Hogwarts, chances to see Newt and Leta during the school days, the history of Grindlewald and Dumbledore as even younger men and the reasons that Dumbledore won't stand against him now, even at the request of the Ministry.It works for me, I'm probably right around the ideal target audience for the film. I've seen all the films but not really read the books, so I know enough about the backstory to catch most of the references, but not enough to get upset by the idiosyncrasies or contradictions that the film creates. I was mentally prepared that this film might not have much of its own pay off, and I know I'm going to see the next three anyway, so that didn't bother me. It's a bit too wordy at points for its own good - there's an explanation scene that rolls into the ending of the film that even I was struggling to keep up with and I'm sure some characters turned up in that scene without us seeing it. I'd also argue that it would benefit from focussing more on the four returning characters from the first film, rather introducing a dozen others to try and follow along with.Effects, costumers and set dressing are all excellent. And this story has a darker edge than anything we've seen in the ""Potter-Verse"" before. Could it be a better film, absolutely, but if you've any interest in the ""Wizarding World"" already, then you should definitely make the time.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
38,Vartiainen,Starting to lose its magic,5,4 October 2019,"I'm starting to question whether having David Yates direct these movies is really worth it. The man clearly has a vision for the wizarding universe, but it's not really a vision I agree with. Plus the man has a serious tendency to make these movies more and more grim as they approach the end.Case in point, the second Fantastic Beasts film. The first film was okay. I was not instantly in love with it like I was with the early Harry Potter films, but it was an interesting breath of fresh air and a good way to take a step back from Mr. Potter and his friends, and examine the wider universe only hinted at in Rowling's books. It had interesting creatures, good humour, relatable characters and it felt magical.Sure, the wizards still looked more like British government bureaucrats (despite being American) than wizards, most of the magic on display instantly created like a million plot holes and the whole idea of American wizarding society being even more uptight than the British one was a bit hard to swallow. But, a breath of fresh air, even still.And then there's the second part. Where there are very few fantastic beasts. Where old characters are railroaded back into the plot because they proved to be fan favourites, despite it making no sense whatsoever. Where everything is rainy, and wet, and grim, and dark. Where bad things happen to good people. And good people turn to bad people with no warning, rhyme or reason. Where J. K. Rowling, the screenwriter incidentally, once again reveals (cough: re-writes) something new and baffling about an old character from the Potter books.Yeah, this film unfortunately repeats all the flaws in the last few Potter books and movies. With very few of the upsides.That being said, it still is an interesting world. And I really like it. Even when it is given to me in less than ideal form. Plus, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is still very sympathetic and likable. The few beasts we see are cool and interesting. The chemistry between Newt and Tina (Katherine Waterston) still works. It is a shame that all the good things this film has it inherited from the original, but such is life.Well, okay, Jude Law as young Albus Dumbledore was all kinds of fascinating. There just wasn't all that much of him.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Eddie Redmayne still gives awkward charming performance has Newt, and Jude Law is okay has young Dumbledore. The story keeps you interested, so do the beautiful scenery and the awesome effects. Has you would expect in a Harry Potter type of film. Some moments take too long to get to the end, feeling a little to dragged out. But still an entertaining film.

40,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,17 November 2018,"Well, there was one too many twists here and I only say that because it was unnecessary. The plot would have been cleaner if they just let that one go...and don't worry, you'll know what is being mentioned when you watch it.It would have worked in a novel, but in a screen play it just made it a bit messy and loose. And, unfortunately, that is what the critics are going to focus on. But then, J.K. is a novelist and it got a bit lost in translation from one writing style to another.But, beyond that you have a wonderful cast and the film as a whole is delightfully fun.Eddie Redmayne is once more the lead, and he does a decent job...but what is better is how generous both Johnny Depp and Jude Law were in the film. Each have, in their day, stolen a show or two. They are both fully capable of stealing the spotlight...but instead they took a step back rather than hogging any of the limelight and, as a result, it allowed for everyone involved to deliver a solid performance.It could have easily gone the way of a Russel Crowe film with Law and Depp involved...however they didn't do the Crowe-hog and because of that the film ended up with more balance than it should have with the unnecessary plot turn.In other-words, they helped bring it back from being truly over blown.So what do you get? You get to walk into the weird world of Harry Potter again, and that is always fun. You get adventure and mystery and, again, that is always fun. You get decent performances and a solid (if bloated plot) and you walk away entertained.It's worth viewing even if it is unbalanced. It's still entertaining and fun and, after all, that is the point of making a movie.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

If you have seen it, then this will still not make much sense. There's a lot to unpack in this sequel, which has to do with the rise of a Voldemort-like character in late 1920s New York and Paris, and there are a lot of characters to keep track of, including many new to the series. There are some interesting connections to the Harry Potter series, and the effects are really, really well done...but this is still a mixed bag. One reason is that Eddie Redmayne, reprising his lead role, is a master mumbler and has zero charisma. Another is that the one Everyman in the movie (played by Dan Fogler) is relegated to a small, small role here - which makes it tough for us Muggles to relate to these magicians. A third is that the plot is unwieldy and depends a lot on viewers' knowledge of the previous film.

This is a sequel-which is a prequel to the Harry Potter movies-to the 2016 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Like the Potter films, it is set in the Wizarding World created by J.K. Rowling, where normal humans are called Muggles, among other things. She is also the writer. Eddie returns as Newt Scamander-a sort of magical animal whisperer-that gets involved in hunting down an escaped Johnny/Grindelwald. If you recall, Johnny was imprisoned at the end of the first movie. Eddie is reluctant, since he would rather study and play with his magical creatures but Jude/Albus Dumbledore says he can not get involved-and his reasons are later explained, as to why he can not-in fighting Johnny. Ezra is an enigma. He is searching for his birth parents but may have secrets that he had no idea about. Eddie is wanting to help Ezra and Johnny wants to use him in his war on Muggles. The visuals are fantastic, as usual, but the story was a little lacking-probably because it seemed like they were more interested in trying to set up the next movie than expanding on some of the themes of this one. Yes, it ends with a clear intention of more sequels to follow.

44,alindsay-al,A below average confusing sequel,4,22 November 2018,"I enjoyed the first Fantastic Beasts film for what it is but it was a step down from the best Harry Potter films. I had some excitement for this film but this was just a convoluted mess with a nice look about it. The premise of the film sees Newt Scamander sent to France to investigate the rise of the wizard Grindelward. Eddie Redmayne is back as Scamander but I didn't feel the charm of his character in this film like I did the first. He tried his best, but his character felt like he just shuffled into the background and became a non factor to the plot. The supporting cast is also a mixed bag, Dan Fogler is back as Jacob Kowalski and even though the explanation for his character being in this film is stupid he adds so much life and actual emotion to this film with the best comedic moments in this film coming from him. I thought Jude Law was a fanatastic choice as a young Albas Dumbeldore and even though he doesn't have a huge amount of screen time he absolutley owns this role and makes this character feel a bit human. Though there wa some performances I didn't enjoy, Katherine Waterson is back in this film and just like the first film i feel like her and Redmayne's chemistry just really isn't there again and her character asctually has very little to do in this film except be a love interest. So obviously to the controversy Johnny Depp cast as Grindelward and there are times where he delivers a charismatic performance, but too much in this film he comes across as a ridiuclous over the top villain that comes across as a bit of a joke. The story in this film is easily the worst part of this film, it is so convoluted with so many different people after different things that doesn't even involve Grindelward. I was confused at everything that was going on and i feel unless you are a huge Potter fan you will be too. The script has some pretty decent humour in it with a mix of decent drama but nothing ever truly hits the emotional factor that it was capable of. The style of the film looks great with some great wizarding battles and a great looking universe that this film has been set in. However, there is some really basic framing issues in this film that became obvious to me, also the pacing of the film is pretty poor and this film feels longer then it actually is. Overall this film is a really dissapointing sequel that may see this frnachise come to a halt.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
45,CubsandCulture,What was *THAT*?,3,2 August 2019,"This film has to be one of the weakest franchise entries since the Phantom Menace 20 years ago. The first Fantastic Beast wasn't great, but it had enough writing competence, visual charm and good humor to make an entertaining film. This one, however, was grossly incompetent. It feels much more like an entry in a tired tv show than a feature film. I could not tell you what the plot was, who the protagonist is or even where the act breaks are. The film is muddled mess of clunky exposition strung together by lazy world building. Why is the American magical government called the American Ministry of Magic? Why not the Department of Magic? And so many other questions. The characters, such as they are, are not given enough to do for character arcs. (Quick what change does Newt go under?) The film tries to build on the subtext from the Harry Potter books without making the point explicit enough to work. This is, at least in part, the story of jilted gay lovers fighting and it is laughable the way the script tries to say that without saying that. Also on that note, when exactly did Dumbledore decided to stop dressing in bland grey suits and start dressing in flamboyant colorful ropes?

THE CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD cannot claim any of these modest skills. The opening escape scene is a masterpiece of horrible editing, camerawork, and lighting. And it all goes downhill from there.This movie basically exists to set up later movies. The story just spins and spins, and when it finally goes somewhere, you've not only been bored out of your mind for two and a half hours, but annoyed by the preposterous decisions the characters make-- Queenie joining the wizard equivalent of Nazis so she can marry a Muggle is the most nonsensical thing, and the flashback on the Titanic would have made me laugh had it not been so infuriatingly stupid.The creatures are cute and the world design is nice, but that's all that saves GRINDELWALD from being 100% unwatchable.

W/a great opening sequence of Johnny Depp's villain's escape, we soon settle into the main thrust of this yarn where Dumbledore has enlisted our intrepid man of beasts to hunt down a nemesis who threatens both the existence of wayward magicians not in his thrall but the lives of all muggles as visions of an impending genocidal war preoccupy his visions of the future. We never get a sense as to why this particular reluctant hero is needed for this mission since his forte only comes in handy in a last clutch effort than in something which would give the bad guy any sort of competition (I felt his brother, already a member of the wizarding guild, was a more apt nominee). To further hinder the forward momentum of this film's flow is the insistent introduction of new characters or really redundant returning ones (did we really need Dan Fogler's American muggle to join in on the fun, what did he bring to the party eventually?) that obfuscate rather than elucidate things. Also I love CG as much as the next guy but even the next guy was begging for mercy to temper the onslaught of magic which bombarded nearly every other scene.

There was a sense of wonder and adventure that is rare.But this movie, focus much more on Grindewald and his claim to power. The fantastic beasts are there, but more an afterthought. The story is mainly about Grindewald (which the font and size of the title on the poster reveals, the ""Fantastic beasts"" have almost disappeared), and his feud with Dumbledore and the magical ministries. It also shifts the genre from the epic fantasy adventure to more of a thriller set in a fantasy world. The tone of colour is dark, grey and gritty. The sense of wonder is lost, and I miss it.

If you were to have told me five years ago that J.K.

As much as I love the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, this is a movie that felt more like a quick cash grab and fan service for its incredibly loyal fan base. So much happened in this film that it felt as if Rowling took the notes she had for a planned four hundred-page novel, and crammed all of that into a two hour and fifteen minute film.

55,jadepietro,Beasts of Burden,8,18 November 2018,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Characters suffer from a lack of depth, and the audience suffers from too much Depp in an enjoyable visual fantasy adventure.JIM'S REVIEW: Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald has escaped from his high security prison (of course) and he is ready to wreak havoc on the muggle world in the second installment of J.K. Rowling's fantasy series, Fantastic Beasts: The Curse of Grindelwald. This sequel, skillfully directed by David Yates, reprises many characters from the first film and also many of the same flaws too.While this chapter has a darker edge and downplays the endearing cuteness of the beasts, it still suffers from unnecessary convoluted plotting, undeveloped characters that may explain some backstories but take up valuable time from the central quartet, and far too much exposition. Fortunately, the visual look of the film has enough magic to continually entertain, even if the story is weighed down with an overabundance of subplots and both a hero and villain that fail to impress.Eddie Redmayne plays Newt Scamander, a magizoologist par none, and he is rather bland once again. His character is a mass of downward glances, tics, and hesitant line delivery that do little to provide any nuance of character. Perhaps as the series progresses, so will his interpretation. More troublingly is the new meanie. No longer in the form of Colin Farrell, our dangerous evil force is now Mr. Johnny Depp. His character has more vex than hex with his strange and odd performance. The actor emotes without any real menace and his mannerisms are stagey and overdone. He overplays his tantrums as if he is more troubled by a bad hair day. This hammy portrayal sucks all the tension out of the movie. (Bring back Colin, ASAP!)Surrounding these two extreme figures are more interesting characters, although some new individuals are less than memorable this time around. Still everyone is thrown into the mix just to advance the action and plot. Back in service are Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol as Jacob and Queenie, two mismatched lovers who are the heart of the film. However, their screen time together is shorten due to circumstances beyond their control, but not the filmmakers or Ms. Rowlings. Katherine Waterson returns as Newt's possible love interest. New additions to the large cast are a brooding Zoe Kravitz, Callum Turner, Cornell John, and Carmen Ejogo, all giving fine support.Perhaps the best casting comes from Ezra Miller as the troubled Credence Barebone and Jude Law as Albus Dumbledore. Mr. Miller creates a strong conflicted character that wears his tragic side to full advantage. Mr. Law brings his personal charm and class to his role. He is a catalyst to the narrative but becomes only a bookend in this installment. Both actors appear to have more heavy duty to be performed in subsequent future visits to the film series, no doubt. Their contributions can only enhance the series.While the story sometimes lacks coherence, there is much eye candy to satisfy the senses, visual and otherwise. Kudos to the splendid artisans behind the camera: Stuart Craig's production design evokes Paris Art Nouveau and Art Deco elements of the time period, Coleen Atwood's stylish costumes, James Newton Howard's lush musical score and Philippe Rousselot's stunning cinematography. The plentiful CGI effects are dazzling also.Fantastic Beasts: The Curse of Grindelwald is a technically well crafted fantasy. But one hopes future chapters cut down on the excessive plotting and focus on the likable major characters and their relationships amid all of the otherworldly goings-on. A bit of advice: True magic on the screen needs to come from more depth of its characters and, hopefully, less Depp in the next chapter.NOTE: As with most sequels, the film has no closure. It ends with a cliffhanger to segue into part three, a decision which always disappoints this reviewer as a compromise for a movie that cannot stand alone on its own merits.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
56,rgkarim,Is This Film A Crime? Crimes of Grindelwald review,8,16 November 2018,"The legendary wizard came out years ago and casted a spell to which charmed the world into a new frenzy. Harry Potter's journey through Hogwarts may have ended, but that doesn't mean the Wizarding World universe is remotely done. Thus, comes the Fantastic Beats franchise and as the subject of today's review it brings excitement, expectations, and wonder as to what is in store for this sequel. Robbie K here to bring his thoughts on the latest movie as he takes a look at:Movie: Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald (2018)Director:

Writers:
J.K. Rowling, J.K. Rowling (based upon characters created by)
Stars:
Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler
LIKES:
The World: Warner Brothers may not be the powerhouse it once was, especially compared to Disney, but their ability to make the darker worlds of imagination come to life is still incredible. Fantastic Beasts 2 as I'll call it, continues to show off the visual studios prowess to make magic explode in brilliant, and fairly realistic ways. The pyrotechnics and computer generated lights are stunning and add that edgy pep to the mix, or in some cases an impressive fusion of elements and imagination. Seeing various pieces of architecture come to life in a very integrated manner pulls you into the world, and in this installment it expands the limited shots even further with some international flavor. Finally, the beasts themselves continue to show off creature design prowess with gorgeous lines, forms, and colors. Yes, this may be the strongest element of this film, but there is plenty more to discuss.The Acting: It's a Harry Potter Universe movie, which means chances are of good casting recruiting some top notch players. Redmayne and Waterston still have the chemistry for this series, using their talents to take on the expanded roles their characters have to face in this movie, and Fogler himself is a champion of comedic sarcasm with his characters. So let's focus on the new players in a few sentences. Jude Law is a fantastic young Dumbledore, classy and mysterious, but somehow still that pal like authoritarian who continues to mix things ups. His involvement fits very well into the mix and I'm happy to have him into the universe. Zoë Kravitz knocked it out of the park with her recruitment, playing a complex character that is forced through the ringer and selling all the complex emotions of the movie. Cornell John another nice addition when he was in there, though I suspect there is more to see in this actor that will further his edgy, sort of crime noire atmosphere. Let's face it though, it's Johnny Depp that wins the new role. A fantastic villain that combines Whitey's calm collection with Voldemort's passion, Depp proves once again a king of adapting to the works and making a villain that will be the talk for many times to come.The Plot: My friends and I agree, that this movie's central element is the plot driven tale set before you. Fantastic Beasts 2 is all about the characters and diving further into the skeleton's in their closet and the ties that bound them in the first film. A fantastic evolution of everyone on board, this script is probably the closest thing to a J.K. Rowling story we have gotten in a while, with multiple subplots crisscrossing over one another, adding layers to what could have been another simple story. It's beautifully fleshed out, integrative of many hints Rowling has dropped over the years, that brings a poetic portrayal of a new level of Harry Potter that I think fans have been craving. In addition, prepare for lots of hot topics to come up in this tale, gripping you into the story for some element or another.The Emotion: And with all these elements, one can certainly be elated to find some power punches thrown on the feelings chart. Newt and his colleagues will face a lot of darker elements in this part of the universe, and you can bet die-hard fans and those who have connected themselves to characters will be feeling something deep down. While my group didn't particularly cry, there were some reporting tears spilling as the climax hit hard at the end.The Costumes: A small last like, Grindelwald and company have brought with it a fantastic wardrobe to again instill the times and inspire future cosplays. Quirky nerd fashion is only the tip of the iceberg, before other rich costumes that seem a blend of ""Muggle"" with Wizard/Witch flare that I believe added a subtle element to the film that is much appreciated. Hands down another tip of the wizarding hat to the design team.DISLIKES:Lacking The Adventure: While the plot component is very much appreciated, a Harry Potter universe movie often requires a little more adventure. In this installment, I found that area weaker in my opinion. Gone were the exciting battles, the chase/hunt for some creature or rogue wizard that involved facing some archaic or maniacal trial. We didn't have suspenseful fights or intense stealthy dives into the dungeon to help break up all the dramatic components in this film. As such, I found the pacing a little slower/off and missing that element the other films have had, to bring that additional wonder this world loves.A Couple of Underdeveloped Subplots: There are a lot of moving pieces in this film, with a cast of big characters to develop. Fantastic Beasts 2 does a wonderful job of mostly balancing these elements. However, there is a key subplot (to which I can't reveal for avoiding spoilers) that is only... okay. This one side story is an awkward love story mixed with identity issues, and while that concept is fascinating... it felt very shallow compared to everything else. Their inclusion was adequate to be on the screen, but there is so much there to be further discovered in whatever installments await. Almost to the point of not needing to be so spread out. Most will probably not mind the simplistic story understanding the direction of the film, but for this reviewer, we're already in the theater so make it worth it for me.More Beasts: The movie's overall series title is about beasts, so why do we still struggle to make use of the creatures. Rowling's first installment managed to keep most of the creatures somewhat relevant to the tale, and while this one did have some clever uses of them, it was nothing like I was hoping. Many are background or quick passing over, with very few actually having that involvement/integration into the plot I so craved. Sure merchandising will open up new alley ways, but I'm hoping in the future for a little more integration in future installments to make the title actually relevant.The Direction: We all know sequels fall victim to often being a build up for other movies, though there are a few exceptions where it stands on its own. Fantastic Beasts 2, falls into the category of being a film all about building up to the third movie. While this was good plot building and development, the movie fails to be a self-contained story on its own, (again missing that adventure element), and relies on the previous and the past to do more of the heavy lifting. Like the middle chapters of Rowling's works, Fantastic Beasts 2 has incredible heart for supporting, but just doesn't feel like a complete work that if you didn't have the others could survive in this day and age. It's not an awful thing, just a little disappointing that this movie didn't have more elements to be an arc in the ever evolving story of Wizards.The VERDICT:
The Crimes of Grindewald are certainly a wonderful addition to this universe mainly in character and plot design. It borrows elements from so many genres to establish a wonderful, deep developing chapter that Rowling is famous for. With designs and acting to support it, Warner Bros has new avenues to open in the future for their amusement parks and merchandising avenue thanks to the details made. Yet, the movie's main suffering is feeling too much like the middle chapters of the book and being unable to stand as a movie on its own. So much is geared towards build up for the third movie that it suffers from being a movie on its own, primarily missing that sense of adventure and wonder this series is famous for. It is still a great piece of work that, let's face it you will be seeing, but I think there is room for improvement in the next addition to the series. Overall, I loved the film and encourage a trip to the theater for this one at least once during its life in the next few weeks.My scores are:
Adventure/Family/Fantasy: 8.0

57,rannynm,Fantastic performances and visuals. Serviceable story that Harry Potter fans will enjoy,7,21 November 2018,"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is a serviceable entry in the Harry Potter universe despite its many shortcomings. Fantastic performances and visuals complete some truly great and pivotal plot developments. Any Harry Potter fan might want to check this out, but go with lowered expectations.
The story follows the breakout of influential dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) as he seeks to enlist his army of pure bloods. He starts by manipulating the transformation of Credence (Ezra Miller). All sides are divided by this as many find that killing both will fix the issue and many believe that Grindelwald upholds what is right. All except for the moral Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) who believes in stopping both but not killing. As a result, a younger Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) enlists him to work behind the lines as dangerous times approach testing the loyalties and love of all involved.Eddie Redmayne, as Newt Scamander, is always entertaining with his quirky remarks and unswayable morals. Also, he attempts to reunite with Tina (Katherine Waterston) to humanize his central struggle to find company. Johnny Depp, as Grindelwald, empowers with his powerful voice and fear-inducing actions. His presence holds well even among the likes of Voldemort. Jude Law, as Albus Dumbledore, is my favorite character with a spot-on recreation of a younger Dumbledore even if he's not in it for long. His wise remarks and enthralling character developments only left me wanting more. Zoe Kravitz, as Leta, is one of the most interesting characters with her fair share of story which leaves us craving for more regarding the mysteries of the lore. Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol, Dan Fogler and Ezra Miller return better than ever with twists and turns further developing their characters, even if a little too much time is spent on their side of the story.David Yates expertly directs with an eye of awe for each of the magical settings visited. It is always a delight to see the early happenings of events and monuments such as Hogwarts. However, my favorite scene comes from the opening escape which rips and roars with wonderous sound design and sets the precedent for a truly epic villain in Grindelwald. Despite this, the movie comparably falls flat resulting in some boring sections of exposition with forced moments of fan service. The movie feels considerably crowded and in need of a more compelling story in some sections. Despite this, the exceptional first few minutes and last third redeem the story from being a total slump.The message of the movie is to never lose your morals despite what could benefit you. Newt is a great example of this because he chooses what's right in spite of Grindelwald's powerful way with words. I give this film 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18 because of some intense action and themes.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

58,eric262003,The Sole Purpose To Milk In Other Sequels,5,5 April 2020,"The first ""Fantastic Beasts"" film can easily stand alone as engaging new series for the viewers who are still hungry for new material in the world author J.K. Rowling created which is the Wizarding World. And sure we were told in advance that we were going to get five more movie adaptations in the future, I was excited about seeing this spin-off from the very successful Harry Potter films that came out between 2002-2012. Sure not everyone liked ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", I managed to find it ever so enjoyable as a welcome addition to the Wizarding World. It may sound like a cliche what I'm about to say, but ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Griendelwald"" failed to live up to the standards that the first installment measured up to. I can't remember a time when a movie like this was so muddled, watching what could gave been a simple viewing pleasure would end up so labouring.If there was a plot to this installment, I wonder where it is hiding, because this movie is so convoluted it's all over the place. I tried my hardest to follow through, but it just meanders from one scenario after another and trying to decipher it gave me a migraine. I even watched it again to see what I missed, only to end up regretting it later on as I ran out of pills. It tries to stay in the tradition of the myth behind the Harry Potter lore, but fails to stand on its own. If you're a Potter fan you will likely get a better understanding of the goings-on in the movie. But casual movie viewers will be overwhelmed.I can at times just skim through the details knowing the series pretty much by knowing what to expect and the adventures of what's to come, but in ""Crimes of Grindelwald"" you don't see very all that much because the sole purpose of this film is only to cash in a reminder that there are other films in this franchise to follow. It gets to the point that it could become quite tedious as scenes are rushed with no full explaining which results in everything being quite empty. Sure there is some CGI magic featured here, but it still isn't enough to carry the film in terms of plot, story or theme. Just all style and no substance.The indecisiveness in where it wants to go can be nauseating and the editing seems very absent in the long turn. Scenes are presented in little fragments and then are forgotten and only come back later again without any full explaining going on. There are way too many characters in the movie and they have no real significance to them to care about or even have something to grab our attention. In order to get the better feel of the plot, the need to introduce the characters one more time and to find a surface where the subplots intertwine. There are old characters and newer ones, unfortunately none really do much service because too many things happening and very little is coming out.Though the bad outweighs the good stuff, ""Crimes of Grindelwald"" can at least claim that the characters coming back was a pleasure in addition the newer ones offer some kind of hope for the future like Jude Law as a young Dumbledore. Also though not very well-rounding the wizardry effects were very impressive. It would be a scintillating run if Rowling lets us in on the wizardry in Paris. However, there are some scene set there that are put into doubt. With a little hope, we might get more of our questions fulfilled. I guess we'll have to be patient until then.In the end, it's highly questionable if this sequel will be of equal significance to what is yet to come. Right now all I can say is this second installment is an utter mess. Too many things happening and not enough story being told. This can turn off a lot of people from wanting to see this movie. If this was like a puzzle it may have the pieces, however I hope that the next installments can places them together. We can only hope for the better.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The whole plot is out of touch with the big series, and the water flooding is serious. The whole plot that wants to advance may only take five minutes, but it has been lengthened and assembled separately. Whether it's magical creatures, Ministry of Magic, or aurors, it's nonsense. There are only two things I want to talk about in this film. Craydens can threaten Dumbledore. Dobledo and Greenwald are gay.

60,nancyldraper,More confusion than growing clarity,7,28 November 2018,"More confusion than growing clarity. This second (of fIve) instalments into the Fantastic Beasts story was a step down from the first. Where the first was full of delight and discovery, mysteries and rescue, this one lost that sense of awe and adventure, and got bogged down in twists and turns that made the mind dizzy and left us with more of a ""What?!?"" than an ""Aha!"" The acting was good. The special effects were effective. The deepening darkness was foreboding. But the end was so cryptic that the internet has lite up with theories as to what was actually revealed (because few left the theatre sure of what it had just told them). I am still curious as to where all this is going, but I'd like to see them return to the wonder of the magic, depth of relationships, and clarity of plot. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Fantasy Adventure}",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
61,Abdulxoxo,The entertainment value saved the movie,6,18 February 2021,"The movie is called Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. I have two major issues with that title. Firstly, this movie doesn't have anywhere close to as many fantastic beasts as it should; and secondly, (aside from escaping prison in the opening sequence) I'm not particularly certain what Grindelwald's crimes even were. Isn't these two supposed to be prominent elements given that they make up the title. But no, that's not what this movie is about. What this movie is about is getting from film 1 to film 3. One of the major problems is that this movie is packed full of plots and sub-plots to the point where you couldn't always understand, or even care, about what was happening. There are so many characters, each of them with their own underdeveloped storylines, that it became difficult to follow. Even when there was a major reveal at the end of the film, It was supposed to be a huge moment, but by that stage you didn't really care anymore. There was so much exposition! The performers, sadly were not served well by the script. Some of them managed to still give good performances nevertheless. Zoe Kravitz I enjoyed very much as Lita Lestrange. I thought Jude Law was an excellent casting as the young Dumbledore. Johnny Depp as Grindelwald was good too. I was, however, very disappointedwith Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander. he's just a rubbish character. I was also disappointed with Ezra Miller as Credence. His character's journey to discover his true identity is arguably the most important plot in the film, yet he was totally devoid of any charisma. As for the likes of Tina, Jacob and Queenie their returning characters have odd sub-plots that don't really go anywhere. They felt like characters that, having featured in the first film, had to be there, but play no major role in the main story.
Despite all of the problems that the film possesses, there were some positives the film also provided. I thought the score was very good. In particular there's a sequence when we see flashbacks to Hogwarts, where the old familiar music played. That was nice nostalgia. In fact the whole sequence at Hogwarts was great. I also liked the little twig-like creature called Pick that Newt carried around in his pocket. The movie's greatest strength however was most certainly its visual effects. there are some scenes on the streets of Paris which looked magical. I thought the opening escape sequence was really good. There was also a big flame based sequence near the end of the film which looked amazing. Overall, if not for the film's entertainment value, there's nothing interesting as the story was pretty much all filler.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
62,martimusross,Just Plain Dreary,4,19 November 2018,"This movie started well then lost its way in a bewildering display of CGI.The Harry Potter franchise is built upon strong believable characters that are loyal friends tested through adversity, with thorough investigation and humour. The films are masterfully realised from JK's books, this film in contrast had no hand of the master throughout, I cannot believe that Ms Rowling was anywhere near this aborted child.The action was relentless, the mood morose, the characters dreary. Voldemort was evil embodied, Grindlewald was a wet weekend in Southend. The script was missing and as for the magic creatures they had gone to live with Dobby and we were left with shadows.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
63,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"A fitting expansion of a beloved universe, even if it falls a little short of all the other Potter films before it.",6,20 November 2018,"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is one of those modern sequels that utilizes universe-building foreshadowing for sequels and so-forth, but it doesn't play the shared-universe thing as finely as the better MCU films pull off. It's entertaining but flawed, sufficient but lacking, visually engaging but not so much in the jumbled-up story department. It suffers from Star-Wars-prequel-itis, where you can tell exactly what they're going to cover in the story because you've already heard this stuff being overshadowed in previous installments, or because there's a recurring character whose appearance only brings up more questions than answers.Crimes of Grindelwald is entertaining but it doesn't have the perfectly realized other-worldliness of the eight Harry Potter Saga films. THIS film demonstrates that J.K. Rowling knows how to write a story; it's just that her unfocused visual writing and exposition-heavy dialogue makes a very strong case for why she can't write screenplays on her own. The Harry Potter films benefited from professional screenwriters refining, visualizing and adding to the pre-existing novel stories, whereas Fantastic Beasts has no such leverage to adapt upon.Crimes of Grindelwald is definitely blockbuster cinema worth seeing at the movies: it's just not a world-class example of when multi-million dollar films can be art in and of themselves (like The Godfather or The Dark Knight Trilogy) .Grindelwald gets 3/5 stars.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

66,rockman182,Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018),6,16 November 2018,"I like many other fans of Harry Potter have read the books and seen the movies. JK Rowling did a really wonderful thing introducing us to the wizarding world. Now though, JK Rowling is doing a bad thing writing these screenplay's for the Fantastic Beasts series. Just kidding. Sort of. While Crimes of Grindelwald is definitely better than its predecessor, it still fails to inspire or instill the magic that the HP films had on its viewers.Newt Scamander, fantastic beast catcher, is back once again this time to find his flame Tina, who has grown apart from him. Meanwhile, evil dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald has escaped and is now recruiting followers, to revolt against non magical beings and create a pure blooded wizarding world. Albus Dumbledore, enlists the help of Newt and his friends to take down the evil wizard. The film ups the starpower adding (a more prominent), Johnny Depp, Jude Law, Ezra Miller, and Zoe Kravitz.The acting and look of the film is good. I watched it in Dolby Cinema and it looked great on the bigger screen. The film is a fun watch in small doses and is definitely more entertaining than the first. That said, this film doesn't have the mystique of the HP films, There are no stakes at all. Where is the interest in the characters, the plot, and the story like we used to care for in the Harry Potter films? The plot is also problematic because its actually hard to follow, felt like there were too many plot lines going on that it got muddled along the way.There overarching plot still feels basic and ruined by the non focused nature of all the side information being given to you. Yates does a good job directing visually but Rowling's story lets everything down. This film is also clearly trying to build other sequels and it was a bit irritating. And there are five films planned in this series. I have the same sentiments of the Hobbit trilogy for this, lets not try to capitalize on prequels because it kind of ruins the magic established by the original franchise.6/10",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

68,RforFilm,Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is the first major disappointment of the Harry Potter series,3,16 November 2018,"Harry Potter, Harry Potter, Harry Potter. I've written about Harry Potter many times before, and this won't be much different other then the film itself. It's amazing that after seven novels, a couple of spinoffs and the eight film adaptations, the wizard world of Harry Potter is still as attractive as it was ten years ago. Wizards are nothing new, not even in book format, but with the way author J.K. Rowling put the focus on a child entering into that world, she broke into every child's curiosity about a place that's hidden from modern society. We never want to believe the world is as it is and want it to have something we cannot explain; magic.It makes sense that the author would want to build the Wizarding World further by establishing more history and lore. In fact, the original Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was not a bad starting point. I like the 1920's setting. I liked how it was set in the United States. I even like Newt Scamander as a character, even though his journey in that movie wasn't really his. Perhaps a sequel can correct that in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.An evil wizard from the first movie Grindelwald (played by Johnny Depp) manages to escape prison while being transported. Wizard zoologist Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne) at the same time is trying to get his travel rights reinstated, but is denied when he refuses to join the Ministry of Magical when he's asked to join his brother in locating a powerful but dangerous child Credence (played by Ezra Miller). Though he remains firm about being on his own, a visit from a young Albus Dumbledore (played by Jude Law) changes his mind. A lot of it is also because wherever Credence is, Newt thinks that he'll find auror Tina (played by Katherine Waterston).Before he leaves, he's visited by Tina's sister Queenie (played by Alison Sudol) and muggle Jacob (played by Dan Fogler). An argument over muggles being able to marry magic people forces Queenie to leave. Everyone seems to be traveling to Paris, where Credence is located. But it also happens that Grindelwald is searching for Credence, where he hopes he can use the boy's unstable power to rise in power. Sides are taken as Newt, Tina, Grindelwald, and the Ministry of Magic race to see if they can prevent a wizard war.It pains me to say that Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is the first genuinely bad Harry Potter movie. I should probably start with the story. Not only does this have to do little with Newt Scamander, but a lot of the plot with Grindelwald and the conflicts over having to hide the magic world doesn't make the story feel important. In fact, a lot of the stakes are so low that the real crime of the movie is that it's boring. It takes too long to get going ( I swear, the plot itself doesn't start till halfway), it pads out more then needed (much time is spent talking about the same morals), and the ending drags on forever (a lot is on Grindelwald making a windbag speech).I'll give some credit to the actors like Eddie Redmayne, Dan Fogler, and Johnny Depp for playing their parts the best they could. My favorite has to be Jude Law as a young Dumbledore, who brings a lot of needed charm. It's just a shame he has little to do with the story. You could have cut him out and it would have not changed the story. I would love to see a spinoff about a young Dumbledore on his own adventure.But what about this adventure? The other big problem is that because the stakes is on everyone finding this one guy, what is Newt learning on his journey? That it's important to take sides. This takes a very grey series that only had a few established bad guys, and makes it painfully black and white. The biggest shame is that it's all in the screenplay's faults, which was written by J.K. Rowling. It feels like three ideas for stories crammed into one and that this only serves to set up future movies without being a good one on it's own.I'll give this three broken wands out of five. This is a major disappointment within the world of Harry Potter. You're better off watching the original movies. This is a movie that feels cursed then entire way.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

70,bankofmarquis,"A deep dive into the backstory. GREAT if you're into it, not so much, if you're not.",8,21 November 2018,"It is a misnomer to call FANTASTIC BEASTS: THE CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD a ""Harry Potter"" movie. True, it is a film that takes place in the ""Harry Potter-verse"", but it should, more accurately, be called an ""Albus Dumbledore"" movie.""Crimes of Grindelwald"" (or COG as I will call it from now on) has a tone more in keeping with the later films in the Harry Potter original grouping of films. Gone is the ""fun"" and ""whimsey"" of building a world based on magic. In is a dark, grainy and grey film that focuses on relationship building that will pay off down the road. Keep in mind that this is the 2nd film of a proposed 5 film series, so there's quite a bit of ""set-up"" and very little payoff here.Because of all of this, the younger members of the audience in the theater I saw COGS in were antsey in their seats (as were the ""casual"" Harry Potter viewers who were just there to see ""Magic Battles"").But...and this is a BIG but...those of us (including me) who are ""into"" the world that J.K. Rowling has built were rewarded with a rich, complex tapestry of backstory and legend building, bringing in characters that were merely mentioned in the original books (and films) and filling out parts of this universe to make it much, much richer, indeed.And that's the problem with this film - and the problem that this film is going to have in finding an audience. I have heard criticisms such as ""it's too dense"", ""it moves too slow"" and there are ""too many characters"". And that is justified, if you're a casual fan. If you're ""into it"", then those criticisms don't hold water.I've also heard that Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, the ""hero"" of the Fantastic Beasts franchise is too bland to hold the center of these films. I couldn't disagree more. I found that Redmayne's characterization of the magizooligist to be interesting and quirky. True, his characterization is subtle, maybe too subtle for some, but it was intriguing and interesting for me.Returning from the first film are Katherine Waterson, Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol as comrades of Scamandars. They were ""serviceable"" in the first film and they are ""serviceable"" in the 2nd film.It is the newcomers to this series that were of most interest to me starting with Jude Law as a young Albus Dumbledore. I liked his interpretation of this character - he has the same ""mysterious"" atmosphere about him that Richard Harris (and later) Michael Gambon brought to the character. Johnny Depp is also well cast as the titular bad guy, Grindelwald. Finally, Zoe Kravitz gives a strong performance as a conflicted wizard constantly battling her compulsion to be ""good"" and ""bad"".David Yates returns to helm his 6th ""Potter"" film and he shows that he knows what he's doing. The world is rich (if grainy) and the action moves along as fast as the script allows. He does have a tendency to become enamored with the CGI aspects of the world he is building, but that is part of the charm of these films.Remember, this is the 2nd of 5 films, so don't expect loose ends to be tied up. Expect cliff-hangers.Letter Grade A- (B- if you are a casual fan)8 (out of 10) stars (6 stars if you are a casual fan) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
71,fernandoschiavi,"The Crimes of Grindelwald is carefull in the volume of information and in preparing the scene, however, it does not show much concern in telling a story",7,9 January 2021,"As much as it is only the second chapter of five, The Crimes of Grindelwald inserts a dark and complex plot, talking more directly with the reality that Potter lived decades later. The character who gains prominence in the title is none other than Gerardo Grindelwald, a wizard who has a strong connection with professor Alvo Dumbledore and who later faced him in a duel that the magical world considers the greatest of all time. The friendship and the differences between the two begin to be explored with consideration in this chapter and deliver a bit of curiosity about the past. The context of this arc has already been much commented on by Rowling and was started in an interesting way. The script (signed by the writer) also leads diversified arches that may seem isolated at first, but lead us to believe that they will have even more use in the future.While the script uses interesting artifices to develop its drama, it turns Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) into supporting roles. Newt has a more curious role in The Crimes of Grindelwald, as he can also be seen as an observer of everything that happens in this second chapter. While he introduces us to more creatures and captivates us with his sweet presence, he also silently watches the changes that Grindelwald is introducing into the wizarding world. Newt represents a chance for a necessary and primordial attitude to the current situation addressed: that of taking sides and acting according to beliefs and ideals. Tina, who in the timeline will become Newt's wife, walks the same path and proves the good application of reality that Rowling inserts in her novels.The Harry Potter saga gains more prominence from now on, delivering fragments (whether in the form of words, characters, objects, spells or environments) of nostalgia on specific occasions. Hogwarts, with all its physical and affective grandeur, gives a familiar feeling, while Jude Law's Dumbledore transfers liveliness and personality, delivering a close portrait of what he became when he was older. Of all, however, the one that really stands out is what a lot of people didn't want from the beginning: Johnny Depp, like Grindelwald. If we remove the reticent and cowardly way in which the author writes his relationship with Dumbledore, everything that Depp puts to represent the boxwood is applauding. His rhetoric is exalted, the delivery of politically tempting discourse in a calm and threatening voice and the promotion of a personality that tends to be stronger (in ideas) than that of Lord Voldemort himself, whose initial base was more narcissistic, selfish and product of personal trauma than anything else.Among the new characters are Newt's brother Theseus (Callum Turner), Nicolau Flamel (creator of the Philosopher's Stone) and Nagini (who is still far from Voldemort's snake), but the most interesting is Leta Lestrange (Zoë Kravitz), which has not only more attention but also relevance. Her family, so approached in the Harry Potter saga, gains new traits and a new approach due to her personality, detached from her future relatives. As for the other signed arches are those of the already known Queenie (Alison Sudol) and Credence (Ezra Miller), who insert a lot of intensity when treating the theme of identity as fuels for their actions. Both are part of the narrative twists that most impress and reinforce how far J. K. Rowling wants to go. The question, especially in relation to Credence, is how far should it go - because in this case it is where some weaknesses reside.Grindelwald's political and social speeches form another key point of production and will certainly be further worked on in the following chapters. The good news is that, just in this film, it is already possible to understand (even broadly) the reasons for the villain's behavior. Everything indicates that the three future features will give more ground to what Grindelwald wants, such as deeper motivations. The fact is that he knows very well how to induce his potential followers to think differently and follow his reasoning - however much it gives only an overview of the reality that he believes to be true. Unlike Voldemort, who was violent in his words and deeds, Johnny Depp's Grindelwald is as smart as he is meticulous because he knows exactly what the weight of his words will be. His persuasion may seem subtle in the eyes of some, but it is far more powerful than the spells he utters.On the other hand, the film is technically flawless. Visiting the magical world continues to be a pleasant walk and the already traditional visual care remains unchanged, whether in the production design signed by Stuart Craig or in the costumes by Colleen Atwood. The research carried out for the construction of the costume is of impeccable quality. It's amazing how the fabric and cut chosen to dress the characters say a lot about them: While Newt wears a typical English tweed jacket, giving weight to his shoulders and reinforcing his social retraction - so much so that, in one of the few moments when he takes off his coat, instantly gains a superhero aura (before diving after the lake-horse) -, Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) wears an overcoat that instantly refers to Nazi militarism. Thus, if the costume reveals much of the personalities, at the same time it reflects the real time that precedes the Second World War. In this relationship with the social, the attempt to build a story about the importance of having a side is clear.Visually speaking, the work is pure fun and it was not for nothing that I brought Yates' changes and effort to the direction. More than familiar with Wizarding World (this is the sixth feature in the franchise he runs), the director is also a strong point. His direction yields several eye-popping passages, especially with regard to the design of the creatures - the scenes at the circus in Paris are a separate show. The intense chase scene at the beginning of the film is an example of dynamism that continues more or less until the end of the tape, with parts in conflict very well related, excellent use of magic without creating a spectacle in itself, sometimes unexpected movement of camera and use of creative angles. This same signature can be seen in scenes such as the creation of the French Ministry and the equivalent of Diagon Alley in Paris, in one of the most interesting works of art direction in the entire film. There the wonderful creatures of the tape are also shown, in a circus sequence well edited and sounded (and it is worth saying that both the soundtrack and the montage go up many quality steps in the moments of struggle), with each animal in its highlight and brief moment naming and visual display of them that last long enough for us to get to know them and identify them later.Philippe Rousselot's photography brings a visual unity and richness of light and spectacular colors. Even in the moments when the worst thing in the feature (the script) makes us roll our eyes, the image continues with its role of making us feel inside a magical world. If Grindelwald's speech can remember the Aryan - with an obvious touch of magic -, the travels between countries are very specific in referring precisely to the Great War that entered the 1940s (Austria and France being the most important poles in the trajectory Hitler's army). In addition, it is enough to notice the visual allusions made by the villain to make a direct connection especially to the bombs dropped by the USA in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.However, the film presents serious problems of rhythm in the narrative. From the first to the last scene, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is made for fans. There is no space for the occasional spectator, as it is not a film with a beginning, middle and end. Although some explanations of what happened before are included, there is no clear journey to be followed, which makes it difficult for anyone who has not embarked on this universe for a long time. Those who already follow, are curious about what will come next, but also frustrated to have the expectation created by the first film only directed by the sequence.The entire second act of character development, takes place almost in overlapping dramatic layers, which makes many parts tiring and causes others to be cut before showing more of what was good. Rowling brings a schizophrenic script, which gets lost in several unnecessary plots and subplots and confuses the viewer with various excesses and disconnected and unnecessary characters. She is notoriously inexperienced as a screenwriter, as she seems to add much more than the film really needs, full of details, tiring monologues and extremely tedious moments. (when the next film hits theaters) not for the story to continue, but for it to finally begin.Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is carefull in the volume of information and in preparing the scene, however, it does not show much concern in telling a story. Instead, the author fills her text with digressions and creates a bombastic revelation in the end that narrowly does not gain anti-climax status, such is the lack of tact for the construction of surprises and the first big explanations. The magic continues to fill our eyes and the final balance still manages to be positive, but it is important to note that, while the visual side created by director David Yates is a delight, one cannot say the same about the story of this sequel is painfully tiring and complex.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

73,agmoldham,Only for the Harry Potter fanatics,4,10 December 2018,"I'm not really a huge fan of the Harry Potter franchise. I was already a bit long in the tooth by the time the books were written and could never really get excited by the evolving story. Dipped in and out of the movies, but did watch the first Fantastic Beasts movie which was a pretty good introduction to a new character.Have to say that the second installment of Fantastic Beasts left me feeling very flay. The biggest failure of the movie is that the script/story left you feeling very little empathy with any of the characters. I really didn't care what happened to anyone. Eddie Redmayne is reasonable in the lead role and quite sure some of the Potter fans will like the references to the franchise. Suspect many of the people who are not Potter fans will be left a little disappointed like myself.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
74,jrarichards,"Spectacularly artistic and intricate, but how much can we truly warm to it?",8,1 May 2020,"My view on the first ""Fantastic Beasts"" movie might be summed up by saying ""too many of the beasts, great 1920s New York, great/sexy/at times funny pairings of the two main couples, moving ending, can't see the connection with the Potter films"".My brief view on ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" might be ""right amount of beasts (i.e. not too many), great 1920s Paris, pairings of two main couples disrupted and value lost, FAIRLY moving ending, CAN see the connection with the Potter films"".To add a bit to that (!), the creation by the makers (at the top largely similar to in the first film) of the place under his house where Newt keeps his animals is just stunning, and the French Ministry of Magic with its Hector Guimard Art Nouveau-style Library likewise, so there really is a visual feast for the eyes here, often matched by James Newton Howard's score.Redmayne as Newt Scamander by no means hogs the screen, and again we ask a little what kind of a bit of a misfit character our Eddie is actually trying to portray. His brother Theseus (quite good Callum Turner) might seem a slightly normalised version, and it's actually a bit mean that we might prefer him!!Elsewhere in the ""big four"", we find Dan Fogler's Jacob returning (most welcome and thank goodness - he's great), but again with less to do this time round, and ultimately splitting from his Queenie (Alison Sudol) - a great (classic Rowling-esque) plot twist, but really quite hard on those of us who are romantics! Happily, Newt DOES consolidate his love interest with Tina (Katherine Waterston), so there's a bit of resolution there.We then add to that a list of characters intended to link the Hogwarts/Potter world with this one (it is the same after all). Jude Law as the young Albus Dumbledore is worth seeing, and by the way we get a hint of Rowling's big idea (only really revealed AFTER she had completed her vast set of books) that Dumbledore  has ""a thing going"" with (Johny Depp's) bad-guy Grindelwald. Add to that a brief chance to see the young Dumbledore teaching at Hogwarts with a young McGonagall and that's satisfying. The pupils include young versions of key 1927 characters Newt himself and Leta LeStrange, who are ""close"" as kids and adults, even though Leta is now set to marry Newt's bro).That said, to pick up on all the pleasurable tie-ups (and younger versions or relatives of known characters) you would need to know the books and their lore intimately. I got some of it, but by no means all. The appearance of Nicolas Flamel as an aged alchemist was part of that (and fun).Also fitting in to that wider picture are the said Leta (as a goodish element of the evil LeStrange family) and the also-later-evil Nagini the serpent (a metamorph, but here still mostly in female form and still ""good...ish""). Since these characters are done by the ""spellbinding"" Zoe Kravitz and Claudia Kim respectively, we cannot complain about any lack of female beauty on screen (all the more so given the presence of Sudol and Waterston too).At the end of the film, Flamel joins the good guys' quite-stirring effort to defend the world against Grindelwald from his followers (at heavy cost), but the definition of just who is good and who bad is (nicely) blurred just a little, when Grindelwald's (ostensible Nazi-esque) pitch is that he wants to put wizards in charge to PREVENT the Muggles from destroying half the world in the course of World War II, which he foresees and portrays to followers and opponents alike. A great idea, and a role Depp was just made to play.The fact that we've not even got to the centre-stage story of the identity of Ezra Miller's ""Credence"" alias Corvus alias ""XXX"" (no spoiler) will give an indication of how there is quite a bit of intricate plot stuff going on here (of course plot that never really appeared in any Rowling book). And, while we do get a lot tied up at the end (if only by bringing virtually all of the key characters into one small place), many viewers may well be like me and find it hard to CARE too much about all that.With the best will in the world, it is a little harder to invest much in many of these characters (except maybe Jacob and Queenie), so we probably fall back on enjoying the visual and musical side, along with quite a large number of acting pluses.So worth a go, in spite of everything?
For me, quite definitely!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The special effect are over used and the main beast looks like creature from neverending story.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
76,bob-the-movie-man,Lestranger than fiction,4,10 December 2018,"I'd really love to tell you about the plot. I really would! But I would struggle to pull all the multitude of strands together from J.K. Rowling's story and coherently explain them to anyone. If Rowling had put ten thousand monkeys (not a million - it's no bloody Shakespeare) into a room with typewriters and locked the door I wouldn't be surprised.Let me try at a high level..... The arch-criminal wizard Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) is being tortured in 'Trump Tower', but manages to escape and flees to Paris in pursuit of a mysterious circus performer called Credence (Ezra Miller) and his bewitched companion Nagini (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) played fetchingly by Claudia Kim. Someone needs to stop him, and all eyes are on Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law). But he is unable to do so, since he and Grindelwald are ""closer than brothers"" (nudge, nudge, wink, wink). So a reluctant and UK-grounded Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is smuggled into the danger zone... which suits him just fine since his love Tina (Katherine Waterston) is working for the ministry there, and the couple are currently estranged due to a (topical) bout of 'Fake News'.Throw in a potential love triangle between Newt, his brother Theseus (Callum Turner) and old Hogwart's schoolmate Leta Lestrange (Zoë Kravitz) and about a half dozen other sub-plots and you have... well... a complete muggle - - sorry - - muddle.Above all, I really can't explain the crux of the plot. A venerable diarrhoea of exposition in a crypt, during an inexplicably quiet fifteen minutes (given 'im-who-can-be-named is next door with about a thousand other people!) left me completely bewildered. A bizarre event at sea (no spoilers) would seem to make absolutely NO SENSE when considered with another reveal at the end of the film. I thought I must have clearly missed something... or I'd just not been intelligent enough to process the information.... or.... it was actually completely bonkers! Actually, I think it's the latter: in desperation I went on a fan site that tried to explain the plot. While it was explained there, the explanation aligned with what I thought had happened: but it made no mention of the ridiculousness of the random coincidence involved!The film's a mess. Which is a shame since everyone involved tries really hard. Depp oozes evil very effectively (he proves that nicely on arriving in Paris, and doubles-down about 5 minutes later: #veryverydark). Redmayne replays his Newt-act effectively but once again (and I see I made the same comments in my ""Fantastic Beasts"" review) his character mumbles again so much that many of his lines are unintelligible.I also complained last time that the excellent actress Katherine Waterston was criminally underused as the tentative love interest Tina. this trend unfortunately continues unabated in this film.... you'll struggle afterwards to write down what she actually did in this film.Jacob (Dan Fogler) and Queenie (Alison Sudol, looking for all the world in some scenes like Rachel Weisz) reprise their roles in a sub-plot that goes nowhere in particular.Of the newcomers, Jude Law as Dumbledore is a class-act but has very little screen time: hopefully he will get more to do next time around. Zoë Kravitz impresses as Leta.As you would expect from a David Yates / David Heyman Potter collaboration, the product design, costume design and special effects are all excellent. Some scenes are truly impressive - an 'explosion' in a Parisian garret is particularly spectacular. But special effects alone do not a great film make. Many reviews I've seen complain that this was a 'filler' film... a set-up film for the rest of the series. And I can understand that view. If you analyse the film overall, virtually NOTHING of importance actually happens: it's like the ""Order of the Phoenix"" of the prequels.I dragged myself along to see this one because ""I thought I should"". The third in the series will really need to sparkle to make me want to see it. If J.K. Rowling were to take me advice (she won't - she NEVER returns my calls!) then she would sculpt the story-arc but leave the screenwriting to someone better. The blame for this one, I'm afraid, lies at Rowling's door alone.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
77,silvermistvio,Great film with incorrect title. J.K Rowling should've chosen a better suitable title.,9,17 December 2018,"Fantastic beasts films are very difficult to write review because unlike Harry Potter, they don't have original materials (novels in the other word). J.K Rowling just directly wrote the screenplay and turned it into films. So, there is nothing to compare. Hence, it is difficult to review.This film is quite different from the previous one. Sad thing is that there aren't many special effects. Maybe those effects were already in the previous film, so, I felt there weren't that much effects. But still, it works.There are three things I don't get. One is the title. They gave the title the crimes of Grindelwald. So, like other people said, where the hell are his crimes? I watched every minute of the film and found no exact mentions of his crimes. The only crime I saw was escaping from those officers of Ministry of Magic. For the others, nothing! So, personally, I think they should have given other name rather than the crimes of Grindelwald.The second thing is about Leta Lestrange. The thing Leta afraid is the little boy (her half brother) wrapped in the cloth fell to the bottom of the ocean. That scene matched with that scene where Leta explained Credence how she killed her own brother. In that scene, Leta was on the boat and also, the distance between her boat and the place that place fell into was a little far. Furthermore, when that little boy fell to the bottom, the person who was trying to grab him was a woman, not Leta. So, she couldn't possibly have seen her brother fell to the bottom of the ocean, right? Thus, that scene that boggart showed her was impossible.The last thing is about Queenie. She could read minds. So, when that women (from Grindelwald) approached, why she couldn't know her intentions? And when she said to Queenie that she had to meet the host, why didn't she know that host is Grindelwald? Where did her ability go? It doesn't make any sense to me.Except that three facts, everything was enjoyable. Twists, fantastic beasts and all, are amazing. Effects and sounds are so perfect. I can feel that the events are happening around me. So, I'd say J.K Rowling has done a great job. After watching this film, I'm desperately looking forward to the next one. Job well done!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
78,kjproulx,Too Much to Swallow at Once,5,15 November 2018,"Being a fan of the Harry Potter film franchise for as long as I can remember, I've been looking forward to this expansion of this Wizarding World that has been created by J.K. Rowling. I enjoyed the first film, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, but I was looking for a little more material to latch onto. It felt a little too light on the story the first time around. Sadly, I have to say that Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald does the exact opposite of that, overstuffing storylines that will definitely confuse many average viewers. I understood most of the references throughout the movie, but I believe this an example of an extremely talented writer who's trying to expand her world while also trying to stick to her roots, which may hurt this new franchise as a whole.Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) is hunting for followers, a young Dumbledore (Jude Law) confides in Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), Credence (Ezra Miller) searches for his belonging in this world, Jacob (Dan Fogler) struggles to fit in, and countless additional storylines all clash together to form the plot of this film. It almost feels like an episode of Game of Thrones, as the movie constantly jumps from location to location, focussing on each of these characters, which didn't really work as a feature film. This movie tries very hard to be a faithful sequel to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, while also trying to introduce new elements, but also getting caught up in tying into the Harry Potter franchise. It's almost as if J.K. Rowling was worried about not pleasing enough of the fans, so she kept returning to her script and adding more elements for future instalments. This brings me to my biggest complaint.Rowling clearly knows where she wants this story to go, but the fact that this movie is a series of loose ends that are all still left unanswered by the time the credits began to roll was quite frustrating. The worst movies in a series of films are the ones that solely feel like a set-up for future instalments and that's honestly all I felt this film was. We got to know a little more about each of the important characters and then the film ended. Revelations conclude this film and leave you wanting more of certain story arcs, and even though I'll be in the theatre for the next film, based solely on my curiosity, this particular film didn't work very well for me. The story going in so many directions made it a pretty boring experience in my opinion.Eddie Redmayne, Dan Fogler, Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol, and Ezra Miller all return and work very well in their respective roles, but it truly was the additions of Jude Law and Johnny Depp that stood out to me. Although Depp isn't as revered as he used to be by fans, I thought his performance was very enjoyable. I thoroughly enjoyed Law's portrayal of Albus Dumbledore as well, but there wasn't enough of him. For how much this story ties into his backstory, I figured his screen presence would be much larger. This film advertises itself as an instalment with the majority of it taking place back at Hogwarts, but that's simply not the case. Only when the story demanded it was it to be shown, which was a letdown in my opinion.In the end, the ambitions of J.K. Rowling still leap off the screen and will dazzle many audiences around the world, the score stood out as a highlight to me, and the promising future for this franchise is definitely felt throughout the final moments of this film. That being said, there are too many plot lines to fully enjoy this experience and too many new characters that take away from the story that was set up in the first film. As a standalone movie, it doesn't work at all, but it's a fine watch if your knowledge of every previous film is the first thing on your mind throughout your entire viewing experience. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is a film that promises a lot in the future, but doesn't quite work as its own film.

Furthermore, a lot of the characters we were introduced to in the previous film are all muddled up. Queenie allies herself with Grindelwald; a child murdering genocidal maniac. Are we meant to be relating to her?The acting was ok but I felt it was worse than the previous film, Johnny Depp is definitely the best thing about this and I felt his character wasn't used enough, the character of Credence is the most confusing thing I've ever seen! I read up on it afterwards and his big plot reveal doesn't even make sense. The new characters weren't developed either like Nagini and Newt's brother, both rather bland.Additionally there just wasn't enough action or excitement as well, which is an unusual critique of a fantasy film, with the Harry Potter films some didn't have a huge amount of action but at least the plots were good and likewise the characters but here there's neither.4/10: Very confusing and just not exciting, a disappointment to be sure",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

And, like the 1980 sequel to the original STAR WARS, there is a lot of behind-the-scenes intrigue. From Grindelwald's escape, while being extradited to Azkaban, to the various aurors (American, British, and French) who are practically competing to recapture him to the various revelations concerning the identity of wizarding circus fugitive Creedence Barebone.That last one really blew my mind. I thought sure he was going to turn out to be one of HP's or Draco Malfoy's grandparents. Or maybe even Grindelwald's long-lost son by one of Lord Voldemort's maternal relatives. But, the sibling to Grindelwald's (ahem!) ex-boyfriend? Whoa!I am definitely going to see FB3 whenever it comes out.In conclusion, I give this a perfect ten despite all the hate-talk about the so-called anachronism of McGonagle being a young adult in 1927 when she was supposedly not born till 1935.

I usually like Eddie Redmayne in movies but find him almost irritating and incipient in this role.For me this movie franchise has none of the charm fabulous characters (just beasts) or magic of Harry Potter , it's very dark confusing and boring but judge it for yourself .It's marketed as a sequel to Harry Potter and there are characters like a much younger Albus Dumbledore and relatives of Bella Le Strange but the main character seems to have no connection whatsoever except that magizoologist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne)-the author of a famous Hogwarts text book became a teacher at Hogwarts .I'm confused but to be honest I don't really care .I found this Timeline after the movie that may have helped my confusion but I doubt I would have helped me enjoy this movie more.Take a look at the timeline to see how the events of Fantastic Beasts connect to Harry Potter..........1881: Albus Dumbledore is born to Percival and Kendra Dumbledore in the village of Mould-on-the-Wold.1883: Albus' brother, Aberforth Dumbledore, is born.1885: Albus' sister, Ariana Dumbledore, is born.1891: Ariana is attacked by three Muggle boys.

But once you watch the movie you can cringe at how badly they wrote him into the plot & That's what I hate about this movie industry they wrote everyone into the plot poorly, even the characters established in the previous film. This is the worst big budget film I've seen in years. I fell asleep in 20 min, I never truly understood what was going on not anyone's intentions good guys or bad guys. who are the characters and why am I supposed to care other then the cast from the first film Such a shame was really looking forward to this movie. The film is way too serious and dark, it needs a different dimension to make it feel adventurous and fun! The whole setup of Newt's adventure in seeking monster's is LOST (TEARDROPS). The plot is a setup for other upcoming fantastic beasts movies, and the Grindewald is a weak antagonist PERIOD. I'm not scared of the guy.I also found the film boring and confusing at times and massively disappointing even though I did enjoy some moments and characters.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

85,msbreviews,Rating: C-,4,21 November 2018,"First of all, if you wish to know what I think about the first installment of this saga, you can read my spoiler-free review of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by checking it on my blog. I apologize in advance for any writing errors I might have performed at the time. Regarding its sequel, well ... I'm not going to sugarcoat it: I didn't enjoy it. Like, at all.I don't read books, let alone the ones that have cinematic adaptations turned into big franchises. I know the statement ""books don't matter"" is overused, but considering we are discussing a movie, they truly don't. I don't care about the story that the book tells. Any book-to-film adaptation must stand on its own, it should never be compared to the other because these are two completely different methods of storytelling.I'm bringing this subject to my review because J.K. Rowling, contrary to her position in the Harry Potter movies (she was one of the producers of the last four films), decided to really get herself into the Fantastic Beasts prequels, by becoming the sole screenwriter for these installments. Trusting what other people say about her books, she is a brilliant ""book writer,"" but unfortunately, she can't hide her flaws as a ""film writer.""Screenwriters' number one struggle is the method through which they try to avoid unnecessary or heavy exposition scenes. It's just not reasonable to have a character literally explain (a.k.a. expose) what's going on, especially when there's so much information to transmit. In addition to this, most of these moments usually don't make sense because the characters already know everything and it ultimately feels like no one had the creativity or imagination to tell the audience what they need to know in a less boring and lazy way.Crimes of Grindelwald tremendously suffers from this storytelling issue. For such a long movie, its story overextends the wizarding world by adding knowledge that no one cares about or didn't even asked for to begin with. From creating new characters that break the previous saga's continuity to jaw-dropping plot conveniences, Rowling really messed this one up.Until the last 20 minutes, there are only a couple of moments worth watching. If those final minutes were deleted, we could basically skip this film, and we would enter the third one with 99% of the required awareness to watch it. From the moment the main plot becomes clear, its story becomes confusing with so many irrelevant subplots and backstories, eventually breaking its pacing and turning it too slow.It's clear that the movie is building up to what would be an incredibly strong ending, but it conclusively disappoints when more than half of it is pure exposition with a ton of plot devices. So much backstory is given in those last few minutes that I had to process the whole thing in the way back home. Not only the new ""data"" is confusing, but it carries so much plot convenience that it becomes hard to understand why Rowling decided to mess with the Harry Potter story.The one thing I loved about Fantastic Beasts' first installment was that it tried to separate itself from the Harry Potter films. It felt like a new world with new concepts, rules, creatures, and spells. It didn't try to connect with the other saga. Instead, it spent its time building up new characters with no relation whatsoever to the ones we know and love from Hogwarts. However, in this second movie, Rowling decided to make it all about ""connecting sagas,"" like they keep saying to the press.The main issue here is that not only it tries to connect them, but it modifies the original one. It messes with its continuity by playing with old characters' family members, and it inevitably becomes one hell of a mess. Regarding the action (magic) scenes, not only are they sparse but they lack the quality that became a trademark of the franchise. The opening sequence is so choppily edited and with so horrible lighting that I barely saw a thing.With such a flawed screenplay and questionable (to say the least) character's scripts, there are some good points here and there. Those last minutes that I mentioned above are, indeed, captivating and entertaining, delivering a good ending even if it feels better than what it actually is due to the rest of the film. Visually, the magic in display is beautiful to look at even if the editing team didn't follow the VFX crew's quality standard. James Newton Howard does an exceptional job with the score, and the settings are amazing. Production-wise, it pretty much accomplished what I expected it to achieve.In the end, the heroes are the actors and actresses who are able to deliver so many fantastic interactions. Eddie Redmayne continues to be an excellent lead as Newt, Katherine Waterston (Tina Goldstein) delivers a strong performance, and Dan Fogler (Jacob Kowalski) keeps his comedic role on-point. Johnny Depp is a great actor, and he elevates Grindelwald through his unique style of acting (don't pay attention to reviews where Depp is being crucified from the get-go by critics who don't like him as a person or by its personal life which has nothing to do with any movie he stars in), Ezra Miller (Credence Barebone) is definitely going to steal the show in the next films and Zoë Kravitz is another strong female presence as she shines as Leta Lestrange.I'm leaving Jude Law (Albus Dumbledore) and Alison Sudol (Queenie Goldstein) to last for bad reasons. Law is a phenomenal actor, but his character is profoundly underused, and I can't help to feel extremely disappointed with so little Dumbledore. It genuinely feels like they lied to everyone since they used him as an impactful bait for the film. You know how I hate false advertising, so shame on you Warner Bros. Pictures. Regarding Alison, I don't know if it's because of her acting or due to Queenie's script, but she is uncommonly annoying. Not sure about this, but I do think she has more screentime than Dumbledore... I'll leave it at this.All in all, Crimes of Grindelwald is a big letdown for any fan of the franchise. If not for its remarkable cast and its entertaining third act, this could dangerously be a contender for my Bottom10 of 2018. J.K. Rowling proves that she does not have what it takes to become a screenwriter, by constantly relying on unnecessary and heavy exposition scenes with no creativity whatsoever. She overextends her own wizarding world and even breaks the original saga's continuity with so much ""data upload"". Boring and magic-less, slow and uninteresting, confusing and insignificant. If you want, you can skip to the last 20 minutes, and you won't miss a thing. Disappointing.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

I liked the tone, I liked the pacing and the backstories. I liked the expositions of new characters. I am super interested to learn more about how Nagini's story will her to being the right hand man of Voldemort. I felt like a couple lines were forced, such as ""Grindelwald doesn't value that which is simple."" I get that it was a recall to what Dumbledore says about Voldemort to Harry, but I felt like there was no motivation for that line since Newt would've had no reason to say this based on Newt's experiences with Grindelwald. There were some interesting things that could potentially set up some plot holes in the Potterverse. And I would say that I am not worried at all, but Cursed Child made plenty of mistakes in terms of plot direction that cheapened or poked holes in the Potterverse.I actually like Grindelwald movie version more than Voldemort movie version (book version is a different story), he seems more sophisticated and his motives more reasonable.Overall, I liked the tone. And felt encouraged by this installment. It seems to be following the Potter series in that it improves with each installment.

89,Alexander_Blanchett,Better than part one,8,16 November 2018,"A worthy sequel that is almost better than the first part because it offers the same kind of twists and turns like the original Harry Potter films already did. I like the leading character Newt Scamander who makes a great and likable hero, also thanks to the fact that he is wonderfully played by Eddie Redmayne who is the absolute perfect choice for the role. The female lead character is rather boring tho, although well acted by Katharine Waterston. It wouldn't hurt the new franchise if hey got rid off that character altogether. Dan Folger was only brought back for the sake of a clumsy sidekick character... Like in the first part I liked Alison Sudol, although sometimes a bit annoying, but it was the right direction they went with her character. Zoe Kravitz has a great turn as Leta Lestrange. One of the most memorable performances of the film. Oh and then there is Jude Law who is pitch perfectly cast as the young Dumbledore and gives a fantastic reinterpretation of that character. I really hope he will have more to do in the future movies. His casting is real coup for the franchise. Johnny Depp was okay I guess.. nothing to write him about and his Grindelwald is no Voldemort and he is no Ralph Fiennes either. But only focusing on his bad reputation is wrong, his performance was fine enough. Ezra Miller was rather boring and his performance became very monotone after a while. Too bad as his a good character on his hands.
The visuals were great (despite those friggin cats... ) The score was good, the look was fantastic and David Yates proved himself once again as the best director for the franchise because he has a great vision about it. The final battle was breathtaking and the ending made me curious for more.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
90,cardsrock,Feels like a setup for future films,7,18 November 2018,"It's a shame that the most visually stunning Potterverse movie was wasted on its worst story. Rowling stuffs far too many characters and subplots into this film. The weird part about that is by the end, the only thing you really need to take away from this film is the big reveal. This felt like a story that got stretched out in order to accommodate 5 movies, which unfortunately is what happened. There is a quite a bit to like in this film though. Newt is as endearing as he is in the first one, Harry Potter references are sprinkled throughout, the performances are all good, and the most impressive aspect by far is the visuals. The beasts look fantastic and the action scenes are colorful fun. I wish that Rowling has taken a little more time to develop a worthy story.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
91,Jithindurden,Wizarding world is back,7,18 November 2018,"The title Fantastic Beasts doesn't really match with the way this series is going. The first part didn't make me feel like I was back in the wizarding world but this one did. From the first few scenes itself it was established that the tone is going to be quite different from the first part. The writing felt to be the strong part for me which for many is too mucb complicated and just set up for sequels. But the character developments, dialogues and the politics of the film is worth it. Grindelwald's speech not only shows how good he can twist facts to his use but also why many would think he is the righteous leader.

93,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10),6,25 April 2019,"The stage curtains open ...I had high hopes for this one going in ... some of the reviews praised this installment highly, so I put on the popcorn, turned off the lights and watched with anticipation. And though ""Grindelwald"" scores and does not disappoint visually, the rest of this film leaves a lot to be desired.The story starts with Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp), a dark wizard being held prisoner for his crimes, escaping while being transferred from the U.S. to London for trial. Newt is asked to follow a lead in France by the Ministry of Magic, but he declines. However, a younger Albus Dumbledore approaches him and convinces him to go anyway. Back to help are Queenie and Jacob, although there appears to be problems on the horizon for the two lovebirds. Also in the mix from the first film are Tina, Leta and Credence. Putting all of these ingredients into the magical blender, we are led down a visually impressive path to a final confrontation that will much more define future story lines for the film's survivors.This was a yawner. Even though, as I've mentioned, the visuals and special effects were amazing, they weren't enough to carry this movie. The final 20 minutes were almost worth the wait - but even after that extravaganza, I was still left unsatisfied overall. I applaud the fact that characters from the Harry Potter series are included and better defined and provided more history, and that J.K. Rowling is working to keep her fans happy - but this series of films, so far, does not have the same feel or emotional attachment.I recommend this film for the die hard fan. But, if you are looking for a reinvention of the Harry Potter movies, you won't find it here. Newt and the Fantastic Beasts series does stand on its own two legs - and I do like some aspects of originality. I only hope the next film or two gets impressively better.

97,dilipbts,Fantastic beasts the crimes of grindelwald,8,10 June 2020,"The second sequel in the fledgling spinoff follows a familiar pattern, but too many characters and too many storylines rob it of its most enduring charmsEven magic takes a little bit of planning, and in David Yates' ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"" both are in short supply. In it second outing, the cracks are starting to show in J.K. Rowling's much-hyped followup series to ""Harry Potter,"" a franchise that is at the mercy of slapdash planning (these films are cobbled together from various pieces of ""Wizarding World"" material, not single novels) and the kind of higher-up decree that promised five films (five!) before the first one hit theaters. It's a lot of time to fill, and while the second film in the franchise nudges its narrative forward, it's at the expense of a bloated, unfocused screenplay.Mostly, ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" is hampered by the unwieldy meshing together of disparate plots that could service their own films (some of them surely better than others). At the center (when he's not been shunted aside by all those competing narratives), there's ostensible franchise star Eddie Redmayne as nervous magizoologist Newt Scamander. Newt's ditzy charm grounded the first film; and when he's allowed to lead this second story, it's as whimsical and good-hearted as any in the franchise.It's all the other subplots that damage that notion, from a charisma-free Johnny Depp taking over the role of evil Wizard Gellert Grindelwald to a convoluted section all about the family tree of Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller). Portions involving a young Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) can't reach their full potential; they're consistently cut short to zing back to yet another plotline (and that's without diving into all the subplots about Newt's brother, his ex-girlfriend, his beloved New York friends, and Credence's companion Nagini). All this convolution promises to converge during Grindelwald's coming-out party, a fear-filled rally that is as timely as it is unsettling. Before that, Yates and Rowling must bring together a motley crew of wizards and muggles both good and bad.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Annoying, Jacob's character wasn't quite as good as in the first part, Leta's character was really bad, I didn't like Credence and didn't care who his mother was, and his relationship with Nagini was boring, Grindelwald looks like an amazing villain especially at the end of the movie.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
99,andrewroy-04316,"Lacking the charm of its predecessor, Fantastic Beasts is a dark, dull slog bereft of excitement or emotional attachment",2,26 January 2019,"Fantastic Beasts 2 doesn't have particular elements that stand out as terrible, but it's more of a letdown across the board. The biggest problems come from the characters being poorly developed and uninteresting. In the first, Newt was a fun, quirky protagonist who was easy to root for and a pleasure to watch in his adventures and with his animals. There are still a couple warm scenes with his beasts and interacting with his friends, but the movie spends less time with him and it feels less like his story and more of an overplotted broad one. Tina doesn't have a moment of development in the film, and Jacob is relegated from a funny muggle who dives headfirst into the wizarding world for his friends to irrelevant and frustratingly obvious as only having value in comic relief. Queenie was a terribly written character after being an interesting one in the first - her manipulation of Jacob seemed unusual, and her utter weakness and malleability for Grindelwald was at odds with her strong powers and character from the first. It felt like a lot of exposition and no emotional attachment to the characters. Even the character and performance I liked the most by a mile, Leta Lestrange, wasn't fully developed and we have no idea what goes on in her mind or why she's marrying Newt's brother. Nagini is a fascinating character to introduce, and Flamel holds significant weight for obvious reasons, but both felt like pieces thrown out as exciting, recognizable characters from Harry Potter who didn't actually do anything here.
The tone of the movie is consistently very dark, and the gritty, urban feel is pervasive. This contributed to the build and uncertainty of the core question of the movie: who is Credence? The theories thrown around are not clear until late in the movie, but for a reveal that was heavily built up, it didn't fit and felt more like a big twist for its sake. I also found the ""climactic"" battle scene with Grindelwald to just be atrocious. Sure, Grindelwald makes a ring of blue fire (though if he wanted to kill everyone why not shoot it at them immediately, and not just when they try to apparate away?), and Leta's sacrifice was reasonable. But then they go outside, Grindelwald starts tossing blue fire all over the city, so Flamel tells everyone to work together and they all just put their wands into the ground and make orange fire that cancels out the blue fire? I'm sorry, what??? How many died versus escaped, and exactly how Grindelwald's fire moved and affected people was very unclear due to poor editing and effects. Why Newt was so essential and more important to Dumbledore's plan and the Ministry than the others fighting Grindelwald was also never made clear. Grindelwald's view was simple and clear and drew obvious parallels to Nazi Germany (especially that last speech), but the concerted effort by the Ministry and friends to stop him was much less clear.
In general, from scene to scene I just wasn't invested in the characters or intrigued by the plot, and the big reveals and events the movie built to were disappointing and some even embarrassing. Plenty of elements that don't seem to fit with canon, so many plots and characters thrown in there for no good reason, and no real positives or enjoyable scenes makes for an utterly unenjoyable experience. It's a bummer, because the Harry Potter movies were so well made and Fantastic Beasts was light and warmhearted with great effects, but this one tried for a dark tone and lots of characters and major plot events, and managed to bungle just about all of it. Hopefully the third will be a return to form for Yates and this ends up as an aberration.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

104,PyroSikTh,Needs to Drop the 'Fantastic Beasts' Monicker,7,20 November 2018,"The series needs to drop it's attachment to the Fantastic Beasts line, and not just because I think it's the dullest part of this new franchise. Newt, Tina, Queenie, and Jacob have almost no effect on anything that happens in this entire movie. It's like watching four main characters get sidelined and swept up in a story that has nothing to do with them. Crimes of Grindelwald is almost entirely about Credence, Grindelwald, Dumbledore, and Leta Lestrange. The franchise needs to understand that it's perspectives need to shift. It needs to turn into a pseudo-anthology series where we don't follow the same unremarkable characters through five movies as the more interesting things happen around them. Make them appear as cameos, fanservice, or even as recurring support characters, but they all felt unnecessary in Crimes of Grindelwald, and I fear it's only going to get worse as the franchise goes on.As mentioned, the movie revolves around Credence, Grindelwald, Dumbledore, and Leta Lestrange. The whole plot of the movie is about uncovering Credence's heritage. If he's the son of a now-deceased magical family, who is he? What effect could his heritage have on the proceedings? Credence just wants answers, to find family, belonging, and a home. Grindelwald wants Credence to join him for his heritage (which he keeps to himself until the film's closing moments), rather than the powerful obscura Credence holds within himself - somewhat retconning the first movie. Dumbledore is revealed to be a clever manipulator and strategist, responsible for getting Newt in New York in the first place, and once again persuading him towards Paris. His frictions and personal issues with Grindelwald are also teased, but never fully developed (every Potter fan knows what really went on between them, but it's not like he can openly admit that in the 1920s). And then there's Leta who may or may not have some kind of attachment to Credence, tying Newt haphazardly into the whole affair.Newt, Tina, Queenie, and Jacob are just passengers here though. Jacob serves almost no purpose beyond being the reason behind Queenie's hysteria. She puts a charm on him in order to marry him in England, without his consent - pretty creepy. Tina is nothing. She's barely there, serves no purpose, and has no impact. She barely even registers her sister's existence. Newt travels all the way to Paris despite an international travel ban just to see her, at the same time Grindelwald just so happens to be there amassing followers. The whole Newt/Tina romance thing was one of my biggest gripes of the first film, and Crimes doesn't make it any better. It's forced, cringy, and is by far the least interesting part of the entire movie. In fact Newt's ties to Leta are far more engaging. Can we just drop Tina as a character entirely now please? The introductions of Nagini and Nicolas Flamel as fanservice were equally as unnecessary as characters as well.Okay so I've been pretty negative about this movie so far, but please don't let that give you the wrong impression. Sometimes a guy's just to rant. Crimes has a lot going for it as well. The whole family mystery behind Credence, and both Grindelwald and Dumbledore making power plays is really great. As I said, this is the story of the period I wanted to see. I'm getting it, and I'm loving it. There's some fantastic character building and flashbacks as well, especially when it comes to Dumbledore and Leta Lestrange. Leta's flashback in particular is great, offering us a tease of her fears which ties into a major revelation later on, and making her possibly the most interesting character of the whole franchise so far. It also gives us a little more time with a younger Newt, and more insight into their relationship. My only problem here is how all that backstory and potential is just thrown away in the movie's climax, and how her role in the family mystery just results in a convoluted mess that takes way too many leaps of logic to be believable.Grindelwalds big monologue at the movie's climax is also a marked highlight of the movie. His careful balance between going full Hitler, and yet remaining charming and persuasive, is done really well. Using the threat of WWII was also really good, and honestly I might have pledged myself to him then and there knowing of what he speaks. Weeding out his followers from non-believers was also really cool as well, although how the Scamander brothers can deflect it so easily while the other Aurors can't felt a bit cheeky. Finally the big reveal at the end was...I'm not really sure how I feel about that yet. In some ways it felt like a really good, unexpected twist, but in others the fact it was so left field and requires a bit of retconning just meant it didn't quite sit right, and wasn't quite the revelation it was attempting to be.Crimes of Grindelwald is a mixed bag, and I have no shame in saying I'm giving it a lot of the benefit of the doubt just because it's more Wizarding World. It's finally giving me the story I was craving from the first film, but also doesn't feel like a complete movie in it's own right, which makes it a little hard to judge (which I believe was something I said about the first movie as well). There's only so many setup movies you can make without much payoff until it just feels like teasing for teasing's sake. The flashbacks were great, the new beasts were great, some of the character trajectories, while unexpected, were delectable to watch, and of course the effects and cinematography are just as good as they were when Yates took over the Potter franchise eleven years ago. Despite my gripes, I'm left feeling exactly the same as I did after the first movie; eager to see the next instalment, and be able to watch through the whole thing from beginning to end. I give Crimes of Grindelwald a completely biased 7/10. I'd probably rate it a little lower was I not so invested in the world it inhabits.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
105,Darth_Osmosis,Painfully boring and joyless!,4,25 November 2018,"It's a huge mess, it's clear there was not a single focused idea, rather than many different scripts made to fit with each other... at least that's my best guess. Which means it's about a lot of different characters some who are boring, some who don't really matter at all and yes also about some who are interesting and matter, but when the movie gets to them it has previously wasted time on several side characters or plot lines that go nowhere. Which means it drags and feels unbelievably boring far too often(I can't believe I am saying this about technically a HP movie!) and while I get this period is supposed to be rough and not a joyride for the characters and the world at large, but it's utterly bleak and while there is humor, it has a distinct lack of joy!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

107,sweidman-28016,It's Fine,6,25 November 2018,"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald Review:The Crimes of Grindelwald is the sequel/prequel to Fantastic Beasts, a spin-off of Harry Potter. Newt Scamander, Eddie Redmayne, and the characters from the first try to find a way to stop Grindelwald, Johnny Depp, from trying to get rid of the human/muggle race. I thought the first movie was good but definitely not as good as the Harry Potter movies, except for Chamber of Secrets (I cant get into that one at all). This one isn't as horrible as critics are saying and it's nothing amazing. It's just fine. I think it's enjoyable as a Harry Potter movie but it had its issues. J.K. Rowling wrote the script for it and that was probably the worst part. For example: they tried fixing one plot hole with one sentence and it just didn't seem to fit. It wasn't exciting and kind of boring. The movie started off with a bang and then just died down a lot. By the end it picked up again but there was a long period where it was just too slow and not exciting. The title did have an issue too. 1: The Fantastic Beasts part wasn't much in there. We saw new creatures but I wanted more of that. And 2: Grindelwald was shown in it for 10 minutes, maybe a little more. So that was a bit of a disappointment. Grindelwald as a character wasn't my favorite. I didn't feel like there was much development on the character and seeing his views was a little difficult. The other character that I didn't like either was Katherine Waterston as Tina. She wasn't my favorite character to begin with but I just really didn't like her in this one. The rest of the characters were fine. I actually liked Queenie, Alison Sudol, and grew an appreciation for her. They did a dumb plot twist at the end with her character which was unnecessary but I guess they needed a plot twist of sorts. Jude Law as Dumbledore was probably the best part. He was so enjoyable and we got more backstory with him. The visual effects were great. The score by James Newton Howard was good. David Yates did well directing, like he did with the other Harry Potter movies he directed. Honestly this movie would've been just a little better had the script not been so boring and not exciting. I feel most will like this movie. Hardcore fans of the franchise will either like this or dislike it. I'm not a hardcore fan but I do like the series. This is tied in last place did my least favorite movie of the franchise with Chamber of Secrets.My Grade: B-",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

A cut and shut globetrotter with smatterings of disconnected pleasurable scenes that get all pushed together in to a formless, shapeless void; Newt is a fantastic character and some critters can be fun, but the story is so boring, the scenes shot on autopilot on a greenscreen, it's befuddlingly boring, worth nothing, and although Zoe Kravitz is an absolute gem, little else here is.

But sadly it drags - there's little in the way of discernible plot, other than the mid-series sense of pieces being moved around a board. However we don't know much about the pieces, or the board, so it's hard to care too much. The parallels with 1930's era Germany are none too subtle, and the colour palette is drab; which leaves you wondering why Jude Law comes off like Derren Brown on an especially smug day, and why Johnny Depp appears to be trying to channel David Bowie.

112,Marynewcomb2013,It was good,7,18 December 2018,"Unlike the negative reviews that are clearly in limbo when it comes to Harry Potter stories, this was good!! Has a couple problems but over all very well done!! This movie starts to tie in things we read about in the Harry Potter books!! The man who had the philosophers Stone is in this!! We see the beginnings of what we read in the Deathly Hollows between Albus & Grindelwald!! We see the beast from the first fantastic beasts movie & also some new ones!! We see choices being made by people for the good or bad!!
The problems are with JK trying to change her own story to be politically correct!! As we Harry Potter fans know, the Lestrange family was pure bloods & always stayed on that side of the fence, ( minus one member who was for good). We also know that families race!! In this movie, JK added a person of color to that family & had he basically good who was working for the MOM!! That as we Potter fans know, NEVER HAPPENED!! That's where this movie fails!! If JK would have stuck to her story she wrote in the past, this movie would have got a higher score!! With that said, I still recommend people to see this & cant wait for the next one to come out!!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
113,p-jonsson,Not really bad but quite dark and sad.,6,30 November 2018,"The first Fantastic Beasts movie was excellent. It was a bright and magical adventure. This one is going down another path and I cannot say that I was overly thrilled by that.This movie is putting emphasis on political machinations, division between the wizards and the non-wizards, betrayals etc. etc. Take away the magic component and you really have a fairly regular racial-differences, humans are bad and all that, movie of the kind that Hollywood is all too eager to mass produce these days. Sure it is not as blunt, preachy and totally ridiculous as a lot of their creations but still ... not the path I wanted these movies to take.At least there are plenty of magic and beasts around in this movie to make the dark and, at times, boring story a bit more compelling. The magic and the beasts, i.e. the special effects, are really the most enjoyable part of this movie.I was not too keen about Newt already in the first movie and he is not any better in this one. He is simply too nerdy and insecure for my taste. I prefer main protagonists that are more assertive and active. Having said that he is still a likable chap in general. Queenie is still annoying as hell though.I was very positively surprised by Johnny Depp as Grindelwald though. I was not at all sure that his normal half crazy and comical acting style would make for a good main bad guy. However, he worked very well in the role.The end is pretty much a big cliffhanger and not exactly on a good note. This is actually a fairly sad movie overall which is perhaps one reason that I, personally, did not feel overly impressed by it. That is not too say that it is not a good movie. It is just that is is not the kind of story I hoped for.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
114,Mike_Devine,A darker turn into the wizarding world,7,20 July 2019,"J.K. Rowling's wizarding world continues long after the sun set on the 'Harry Potter' franchise. In 2018's 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,' things take a darker turn as the film's namesake gathers power and followers in the name of achieving dominance over the muggle world.There are plenty of things to like about 'Grindelwald.' For one, we get to see new areas and characters from the wizarding world, many of which tie to things we are already aware of (Nagini, Hogwarts, Nicolas Flamel, for example). It's also important to see the backstory for why events unfold the way they do - Dumbledore's history with Grindelwald, the true identify and importance of Credence (Ezra Miller) and many other things. One of the issues 'Grindelwald' has is the complicated nature of the story. A lot is crammed into the film, but it can sometimes be difficult to follow.Still, there are plenty of things to appreciate about the film. For one, there's a good balance of action, humor, seriousness and attachment to the characters. It has the feel of a Potter film, more so than the original in the series, but still feels different enough so that it's not a ""seen it before"" situation. The cast is also very strong. Johnny Depp delivers the kind of performance he's been known for, and newcomers to the series Zoe Kravitz and Jude Law do not disappoint.It's clear we're nowhere near done with the 'Fantastic Beasts' franchise, and that's probably a good thing. But hopefully the best is yet to come.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

117,kgprophet,Less Beasts and More Politics,5,20 November 2018,"The first thing that I must mention here, as it affected my opinion of this film, was that the theatre was a bit stuffy. What happened during some slower parts of the film was that I became physically uncomfortable, eventually just waiting for the movie to end. I enjoyed the first ""Fantastic Beasts"" film and was entertained with the new characters and new dynamics. I was critical of the fact that JK. Rowling served both as original book author and screenplay writer. It is a golden rule that you need a fresh mind to take material from another source and know what to remove (without being too attached to the original material), what to hone, and what to condense. I never had read Rowling's books, never thought the movie adaptations felt like a book, and were very enjoyable as movies on their own.However, this sequel to ""Fantastic Beasts"" felt bogged down in extended scenes of character introductions and/or interactions. Worse, where were those fantastic beasts that is the namesake of this new franchise? There was more screen time for the charismatic beasts in the first film, and helped balance the story from getting involved with the politics of magic. Aah, but unfortunately Rowling goes George Lucas on us and involves a senate with an extended diatribe by our designated bad guy Grindelwald. I think a better screenplay would go with ""less is more"" and abbreviate the speeches given by Grindelwald, and let his actions speak louder than words.An enjoyable subplot from the first film was the bubbly Queenie character falling for a ""Muggle"", an ordinary man with no magic abilities. The consequences of that relationship are explored a bit in this film. There is also the establishment of the whole Dumbledore connection. It was scenes setting up those connections that started to bore me. For the last act of the film, there was more concern of setting up things for future films, to the detriment of the entertainment value of this film. This film is also darker than the first film. Both in the material and the look of the film. The general darkness of a lot scenes did not help with my enthusiasm for this film, again combined with the stuffy air in the theatre where I was. The characters of Newt and Tina were a good match, a bit of Scully and Mulder, in the first film. They were also the main characters that had the most screen time in the first film. Here, Tina does not show up until perhaps halfway into Beasts 2. And like I mentioned before, those fantastic beasts are pretty much just a side thought in this outing, with a large furry monster the only one who shows up here and there.The effects this time around were less engaging, but none the less nice looking, especially the recreation of London and Paris in the early part of the last century. In fact it was a nice change of convention, where the film did not feel obligated to go overboard with a big effects spectacle to end the 3rd act. Perhaps if I was a fan of the Rowling books, I would have enjoyed this more. But the fact was the first film had a lot of fresh ideas, where this second outing feels too concerned in configuring the story like a chess game. Which is also why the film started to drag after awhile. Perhaps if they worked more of those beasts into the story, it would've felt more like an adventure. There was also less humour this time around, something that could have helped save me from getting bored.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
118,jamiedarlow-37510,Overly complex but still fantastic filmmaking,7,27 February 2020,"The eagerly anticipated follow up to Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them is directed by David Yates who is a very trustworthy companion to work with J.K Rowling's beautiful Wizarding World as he has been at the helm of each film since the Order Of The Phoenix! I'm not going to discuss the plot of this one as I want to avoid any potential plot spoilers for fans who want to know as little as possible before going in but I shall discuss individual great and perhaps not so great elements. The opening sequence is absolutely edge of your seat, breathtaking spectacle! It's a full on fantastical chase sequence that is one of the best opening scenes this year. Eddie Redmayne is brilliant returning in his role of Newt Scamander; just the subtle nuances of Newt's mannerisms completely encapsulate his personality and his care for the wonderful creatures he takes care of is again present as it was in the previous film. It's great to see returning Fantastic Beasts characters such as Jacob played by Dan Fogler and Queenie played by Alison Sudal who are both fantastic! Johnny Depp nails it as Grindelwald; probably one of the most charming and seductive cult leaders I've seen in a film and Depp was a great choice to play him. Truly awesome costume design by Coleen Atwood (Sweeney Todd, Series Of Unfortunate Events) Jude Law is also extremely well cast as a younger Albus Dumbledore; providing a lot of the films most charming and sweet nostalgic moments. There are moments of real joy for Harry Potter fans here and needs to be seen! Unfortunately it is with a heavy heart that I have to admit the film in the end doesn't feel like a fully fleshed out piece as a lot of it is spent specifically setting up events for future films and it adds in depth backstories to distant family members of certain HP characters that although initially interesting did feel a bit over complicated and lost me along the way. This did stop it for being a classic for me but it is still essential viewing for any fan and I have a feeling I'll enjoy it more on further watches",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

120,kermitkid,Fantastic followup,8,31 March 2020,"I had mildly low expectations for this movie. I've kind of been over the Harry Potter franchise since Deathly Hallows Part 2 came out, and Fantastic Beasts ended up being a delightful surprise, but I doubted they could make this one as good. They did. Ultimately I was worried that Johnny Depp would ruin the movie because at this point he's almost playing a parody of himself, but for once, Depp does not play Jack Sparrow in a different outfit. The character of Grindelwald is fiercely acted by Depp, and even gives Lord Voldemort himself a run for his money. This franchise got dark really fast. The ""Potter"" movies didn't got dark until the 4th outing, but this one did not hold back. It earns the PG-13 rating, which was surprising since the first one was more of a fun fantasy romp. It was refreshing to see a film in this franchise where I did not know the general plot going in, since this is not an adaptation of a book, so there were some great surprises. There were some moments where I thought ""Ok, that's really stupid"" but overall, the story made sense. I really wish these films would stop ending on cliffhangers. I understand about wanting to make another franchise, but unless it has been set in stone that the story will conclude like ""Lord of the Rings"", don't do that. Each film should feel more-or-less self contained. Let's say this movie doesn't do well enough at the box office to warrant a 3rd one. It ends up being a waste of time. I do hope we get a 3rd one, because I'm excited to see where the story goes, and if my theories from this film are right.

121,ayoreinf,"Slightly disjointed, not evenly made, but still a fun installment in the franchise",8,24 November 2018,"Saw the movie two days ago, and debated with myself whether I had something to say, ever since. It's definitely not as good as the first installment in JKR's new franchise, but it's definitly not as bad as described by some, here and elsewhere. It is, as my title says, slightly disjointed, and therefore can be a bit confusing, but it's not plotless. I've seen the entire film, and did follow the story it told. In fact, I could easily repeat it here - I simply don't do this sort of things.Thing is, I think I know why it doesn't work as well as the first installment of the franchise. So I decided I'd throw in my two cents. I don't even expect most of you to agree with me. It doesn't work this way anymore. Not on this site. But here goes:The first problem is, that JKR tried here to tell a story straight as a film script, as compared with the books that preceded the HP movies. Movies don't work exactly like books do. We all know that. Books are faster, and can cover longer time span in a shorter time. She didn't even use the cinematic ploy for gaps in story telling - narration. And personally, I'm greatful she didn't. But the plot is not allways flowing sometimes it even jumps from one point to the other without explaining how it got there. In the books, it was often used when she wanted to insert the real reason later on in the development of the plot. As I already said, movies work differently.Problem is, the characters didn't carry us from one point to the next as well as they did in FBaWtFT. Why, because unlike Harry Potter and his two friends, both Newt Scamander and Tina Goldstein, are portrayed as extremely shy and introvert. Their characters are well built, in fact I consider some of their dialogues to be briliant, but they lack the charisma needed to carry the audience with them, unless the movie is dedicated to them like the first installment of the franchise was. In this one, there are way too many new characters competing with them for our attention and lacking charisma they simply get lost all too often. Here lies another problem, most of the new characters are either too one dimentional or too superficially constracted. One exception is Zoe Kravitz as the tormented Leta Lestrange, but she gets too little screen time to matter. When she does get her screen time she does shine. Another problem is the villain. Unlike many others I don't have a problem with Johnny Depp. He's theatrical, I think the role calls for theatrics. But he can't be as scary as Lord Voldemort, who's always in our minds when we're in the world of Harry Potter. Those who see Grindelwald as an early version of Lord Voldemort, may be right but he's also completely different in nature. He's not a demon, he's in fact very human and in a way more terrifying for it. But the immediate effect must be less scary.Bottom line: it's not a bad movie, but it does have some problems, and the biggest one is being compared with Harry Potter and with the first installment of this franchise, which was much better.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

the first movie was at best....not-interesting and this new one was so confusing and boring at times that you could take a head-ache watching it.
I don't know the problem. they just could not get them right like they did with the potter series. the magic is gone for good.
in my opinion one of the main problems is that new leading guy. the new....""harry potter"" called neut or something like that.
that guy is completely irrelevant...boring and I mean the actor.
they should never hire him to play this role.
the guy who played potter was perfect in any way and looked like potter also.
this new guy can not even...ACT properly. he is boring as hell also.
he can not even make a love confession right.
but there are also other problems.
too much story confusion in this second movie gets u tired.
the editing of the film also is not good at all.
the only good part was that great villain dude grindewald who is the one reason the movie gets an average grade C and not a straight F grade from me.
first and last 30 minutes in the movie are the only worth minutes u should watch. the rest is a big boredom.
if I was not a huge fantasy movie fan I could have walked out from the theater by the middle of the movie.
so here it is.
like the first movie this was also not better.
it's worth for the grindelwald story and a few things here and there but overall it's only for the fanatic wizards of this planet.
it's another boring entry which will make you miss the harry potter movies more.

125,austin0731,Setting up hype for the future of the Wizarding world,7,19 November 2018,"Crimes of Grindelwald takes us back to the wizarding world of Harry Potter, as a fan of the original series and someone who enjoyed the first Fantastic beast I can say that I had an enjoyable time watching Crimes of Grindelwald. I have certainly heard a lot of backlash towards many of the films twists and the incoherent storytelling/messy pacing. From that point of view I completely concur, as a standalone Crimes of Grindelwald hardly stands out and in many ways relies on cheap pops and expository background information, much like an encyclopedia of the wizarding world rather than a coherent narrative.In many ways I find that this new series, the 'Fantastic Beasts' series mirrors that of the Harry Potter films in terms of the film structures. The first Fantastic beasts movie was a lot like Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone in that it takes us into this wonderful world of magic and wizardry, we see through the eyes of Jacob much like we did through Harry in the original series. Now that we have reached the second installment, I find that it is a lot like the original series' weakest link, 'Chamber of Secrets', in that it is slow, expository and mainly serves to set the chess pieces and begin to tease a darker story. Although arguably, Chamber of Secrets does have more of a narrative than, Crimes of Grindelwald's ""who is Credence's mum"".But as a fan of the series, I find myself still enjoying Crimes of Grindelwald despite it quite literally being more like a 10 fun facts of the wizarding world rather than a film. I think this just goes to show what a complex world Rowling ahs built, how intricate and interesting this world is in that it can make such a film interesting despite not being 'good' in terms of being a piece of cinema. I think Crimes of Grindelwald does set the franchise up for greatness, by filling in all the missing parts, and a very well done final act, I think it sets this new series up for a really interesting future.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

No character development whatsoever, messy plot with too many questions raised than answered. Yeah, I know, it's building up for more sequels but 130 minutes of exposition is a bit too much. Literally nothing happens in a movie except for the last 10 minutes which is like the most disappointing minutes in the whole movie which up to that point I could've described as slightly enjoyable and then it took and ruined everything with a twist that I, as a huge Potterhead, took as a spit in the face. A twist in the sake of a twist - no, thank you. I cannot believe J.K. had written it.
I could've closed my eyes on many things that don't add up in this movie but after this revelation at the end I think I will just skip on the sequels.

127,FelipeCarrillo,Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Yates and Rowling,5,31 December 2018,"Which is the most successful representation of the nearly glorified wizarding world? The books or the films? Depends on who you ask, but many might agree that staunchly loyal Potterheads will always take refuge in feature adaptations after their precious seven-part book series came to an end several years ago, both inside and outside the pages. Box office-wise, going from ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (2004) to ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" (2011), this long-running film journey captained by a young and innocent Daniel Radcliffe brought in a mammoth estimated- not adjusted for inflation- 7.7 billion worldwide, which crowns it as one of the privileged billion-dollar club members as well as the most successful YA film franchises of all time. So will Warner Bros. and J. K. Rowling leave their pupils adrift for eternity? Yeah!, we all know the answer.Industry trend, there is a pattern of consecutive use nowadays. Lionsgate confirmed to be in talks to return to Panem in form of a ""The Hunger Games"" prequel/sequel series some years now; ""Twilight"" reincarnated in an insecure literature student and a sadist billionaire with ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" worse luck. ""The Lord of the Rings,"" J. R. R. Tolkien's equally hated and loved fantasy world, expanded its mythos with ""The Hobbit"" as it'll return as an Amazon Original in, by the way, the most expensive TV series the company has ever produced. ""Divergent,"" an unfinished franchise due to ""Allegiant"" gigantic box office flop, is up in the air after rumoring about moving it into TV ground, either to close the original story or to find a new path to cover Veronica Roth's dystopian Chicago-set love-drama.Having said that, that a new book series worthy of bringing it to the big screen joins the list just like the previous ones- the ""Maze Runner"" franchise, which has just ended earlier this year, doesn't participate this round -is almost impossible; so, in the face of the creative stagnation in Hollywood no longer productive YA world, the first response of the major film studios was to spawn products, either inside or outside the original writing line, which means sure incomes.The fantasy cosmos the whole world fell in love with is back under the title ""Wizarding World,"" this time around no Potter included. Mr. Newton Artemis Fido ""Newt"" Scamander takes up the torch, a famed Magizoologist known for being expelled from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, his gorgeous and naughty creatures and his duty to helm supposedly five entries.Directed by well-known filmmaker David Yates and written by the author herself behind the books, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" arrived in theaters two years ago, cooking a spin-off/prequel franchise up that got more positive than negative opinions among the stern fandom. Enjoying acceptable box office numbers both domestic and overseas and mostly positive critical reception thanks to the modest-yet-charming performance of Academy Award-winning Eddie Redmayne, wonderfully crafted visual effects, the unexplored pre-Hogwarts world, the fabulous titular beasts and mythical creatures, an enticing plot twist and the delightful journey across New York; ""FBWFT"" was a pleasant and far-seeing surprise that shocked us sooner rather than later.""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" is the second extension set in this long-running sub-Potterverse, directed by the same director of the last four films in the original saga and penned by prolific writer J. K. Rowling. A bolt from the blue is that even with the creative backbone almost untouched, this second part happens to be a pyrotechnic and enjoyable misfire, plenty of deficiently unified sub-plots that ultimately saturate the not-so-eye-popping visual spectacle, introducing untidily so many narrative threads that, instead of complexity, utterly erode the core story.Admittedly the dark beauty of some gigantic, messy set-pieces works not quite right because of the writing individuality, but still, by composition, they're simply bracing, as ever. Philippe Rousselot also returns as director of photography, which benefits visual cohesion as for the franchise' look and tone even when the action moves from America to Europe, mainly to Paris, France. Some shots really work, others shine, but none of them are part of the confusingly edited, overextended, strange action sequences. As usual, imagery is rich in content, not as cozy, universal and relatable as the previous ones, but at least it's impressively appealing.The titular 'fantastic' adjective is tailor-made for these beasts. The two adorable creatures who stole the show last time come back in order to edge into the spotlight with their naive behavior and mini-treatments; but it's Europe which hypnotizes with engaging animals. The Circus Arcanus holds important gears for the plot, so when madness is unleashed in the Parisian streets, it showcases a range of magnificently designed creatures who take over the screen, and therefore, the audience. Newt's traveling zoo/suitcase gives us short glimpses of unexplored habitats, in which the most prominent feature is a visually overwhelming underwater seaweed-seahorse. They monopolize a large part of the long title, but their greater and short splendor takes place only in the first act in visual terms, as story-wise, the greatest trick comes up.Scamander must win back the love of his life, keep his animals alive and save the world from a sort-of apocalypse; Dumbledore must stop his innermost enemy through other's hands, build up via his pupil's origins via flashbacks and develop tangentially his life as a magician and professor; Grindelwald must overcome all obstacles on his way, convince some detractors and pull his malicious plan off; Lestrange reappears in Newt's life and tries to do the impossible to hide her darkest secret in order to save him from the destiny the magical forces have for him; Credence, a supposedly main pillar for this whole universe, stops swimming against the tide of evil, so he tries to heal the wounds of the past and recruits the only being he has ever trusted. Each and every one of the main characters and a couple of supporting ones propose, develop and saturate the storytelling with convoluted sub-plots, hardly interconnected and poorly solved.
Rowling's widely known for erecting fantasy worlds brimming with mythos, facing good against evil, going through an ambiguous area of grays which create beautiful, knotty stories. The primary thread here is clear and synthetic, but to strengthen it and nourish it she draws upon clumsy narrative saturation that ends up throwing an all-star cast, a few engrossing performances and some gloomy digital effects out. The script has no focus to unfold, its ambition to put too much information into a single two-hour-plus feature is atrocious; Dumbledore's true origins are only tested by giving more plot weight to Jacob Kowalski's love affair, mitigate the prominence of the beasts and deliver a worthy development to its great villain are some of the sins that neither the strongest cinematic spell achieves to break. This is a perplexing mythological disaster of endless derivations that, without the talented central figure, would have been the longest headache of this year at the movies.""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" by David Yates mesmerizes us with gorgeous beasts, good performances and special re-encounters with characters from the original franchise; but a hodgepodge of overlong, untidy plots doesn't enrich the main world as it should, instead, weakens and endangers this new franchise of dissimilar entries. ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" loses its magic, is darker and more tedious than its predecessor, a longueur which tries to provide emotion and thrill with wrongly placed provocative twists that the only thing they achieve is to sink progressively this magical world which is lost in a mess of sequels, spin-offs, homages and Hollywood rip-offs.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
128,Chalice_Of_Evil,Fantastic Niffler! And WHERE do I get one?...,8,15 November 2018,"I rewatched the first movie in preparation for seeing this film, and when I compare the two...I think I like the first one somewhat more, but this film's still pretty good (it's certainly better than the negative critics would have you believe). And if you don't like the movie...blame J.K. Rowling, since she wrote it.Eddie Redmayne's Newt Scamander still has his eccentricities, but remains likeable...primarily due to his obvious love for the 'fantastic' beasts' he keeps/cares for/protects. All of them are fantastic, but I personally think the Niffler remains the 'best'. The echidna/platypus hybrid is as much of a klepto as ever, and we even see baby Nifflers (which are just too darn cute!) while also proving just how useful its special set of skills can be, playing an important part at the end. When the Niffler emerges, it's a total ""Aww""-worthy moment.My other favourites would be two of the new beasts we meet, the Kelpie and Zouwu. The seaweed-looking horse/dragon-like Kelpie makes for a memorable scene when Newt rides it underwater and leaps into the air (bringing back memories of Harry's first riding of Buckbeak the Hippogriff). Meanwhile, the large feline-like Zouwu appears somewhat fierce at first, but is more pussycat than anything when it's distracted by something similar to a cat toy. There are plenty of others too, but those are the ones that stuck out the most to me. Pickett the Bowtruckle is also back and shows how cute tree-like creatures *should* be done (without three-word annoying catchphrases). Anytime these creatures are onscreen is magical.We're gradually reintroduced to Jacob Kowalski and the Goldstein sisters, Tina & Queenie. Dan Fogler remains a highlight of these films, as his Jacob is likeable and funny (without being annoying). His relationship with Queenie has gotten a tad complicated. She's not talking to her sister (thus any sisterly interaction is sadly absent), still has some 'boundary' issues and one of the film's biggest surprises is where it takes her character by the end. Alison Sudol still makes Queenie as endearing as she was before, but this time her character has more complexity.Poor Tina seems to be regarded as 'boring' by some, but I personally think Katherine Waterston is doing the best she can with the character who might not be 'eccentric' or 'fun'/'funny', but is still a complicated character, and I for one appreciate the scenes between her and Newt (which, admittedly, are a tad awkward...but then, they're *supposed* to be. Clearly, expressing their feelings for each other isn't easy for them, but it allows for some amusing moments/exchanges).There are new characters too, as well as ones who were in the first movie but didn't get much screentime such as Zoë Kravitz's Leta Lestrange. She plays an important part in the movie and has a history with Newt, despite being engaged to his brother, Theseus (who we don't really get to know much about, but we're given a brief idea of the brothers' relationship, with the promise of more in the next movie).After Jude Law's introduced as young Albus Dumbledore, he seemingly vanishes for a while until we reconnect with him at Hogwarts. Law does a lot with what he's given, saying so much with mere looks/inflections in his voice, allowing you to draw your own conclusions as to his meaning. His interaction with Newt is nice/welcome and hopefully there'll be more to come.Less welcome, I'm afraid (at least for *me*), is the return of Credence Barebone. I've no idea whether Ezra Miller's performance can be considered 'good' or not, as I just find his character brings the whole mood of things down. His energy is the complete opposite here to that of his Flash in Justice League (whether you consider that a 'plus' or 'minus' is up to you) and his scenes tended to bore me. However, he plays a crucial part in the story...so I guess we're stuck with him.If this film can be accused of any 'crimes' it's that things feel a bit 'scattered' and it breaks up the core four characters of Newt, Tina, Jacob & Queenie who I came to enjoy so much in the first movie precisely due to their interaction/dynamic *together*. WHY split them up? Also, partway through the film things seem to come to a screeching halt as we receive a major info dump via Yusuf Kama's (William Nadylam) exposition/flashbacks that might be considered 'important', but it disrupted the flow of things, I felt.However, no matter what 'crimes' this film might be guilty of, they pale in comparison to Gellert Grindelwald's (or as Jude Law's Dumbledore pronounces it, 'Grindelvald'), who is the true 'beast' in this film. Johnny Depp doesn't seem too popular these days with a lot of people, but I thought he was pretty 'restrained' with his performance here and didn't venture into typical 'weird/quirky' territory. He exudes quiet menace, without resorting to over-the-top yelling like so many villains do, as he unfeelingly tosses away his 'too needy' pet Chupacabra (which quickly cemented him as a villain in my eyes) and has a minion 'Avada Kedavra' a child. As Grindelwald's right-hand woman, Vinda Rosier, Poppy Corby-Tuech doesn't get a lot to do, but she and her hat still make a memorable impression and I'd like to see more of her.While things may have felt a bit 'muddled' in this film, hopefully the next one will have less split storylines going on all at once and will be more cohesive. There's still a lot to like about this movie, though. Despite being 'darker' (at least moreso than the early HP films), there's still a sense of 'wonder'/imagination, along with humour/lighter moments and emotional scenes. The music helps a lot, and clearly there's more story to come, so it's worth not writing things off yet if this particular movie wasn't quite your cup of tea. However, you should judge for yourself, rather than be swayed by unfair critics. After all, it's still pretty fantastic.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
129,Gresh854,"As A Devoted Harry Potter Fan, It Hurts Me To Say That This Was BAD",2,18 November 2018,"I find it grievously sorrowful that being a colossal fan of Harry Potter-considering I grew up with the books, movies, etc. and saw Philosopher's Stone 362 times on TV as a child-I had scarcley to no anticipation for Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. This could be due to the fact that the first Fantastic Beasts-while certainly not bad nor even mediocre-was kind of just a nameless, yet, amusing entry in J.K. Rowling's saga.So conclusively, I didn't have virtually any expectations going into this new Wizarding flick, besides having the accustomed mindset that it'd at least curve out to be ""decent.""""Psyche!"" - Warner Bros.Who would've guessed that the newest HARRY POTTER MOVIE would be the most boring-not necessarily the worst-movie of the year? Like...how? Y'all have got to be seriously talented to somehow make such a magnificently splendid and enticingly alluring crafted universe seem so manifestly tiresome? Trust me, Fantastic Beast 2 is a SNOOZEFEST.J.K. Rowling, I know you and I have an on an off relationship. Let's face it, I appreciate the world you've constructed for all of us; You're basically the co-creater to some of my most fondest childhood's memories. But... sometimes...you can get a little kooky with your work-and your public influence but I won't dive into that due to the controversial incentives behind it. This screenplay Rowling...it's not working for me, and based on most reactions I've witnessed, it's not working for most critics/audiences/fans.There is no proper reason for this movie to exist in terms of how it impacts the lore. You could literally release Fantastic Beasts 3 today, erase or ""obliviate"" my memory of seeing Crimes of Grindelwald, and I probably wouldn't be too thickly, disoriented in the storyline. This movie is a spree of superfluous, aimless, and furthermore, disconcerting, expositional information, which on top of that, happens while way too many side-plots are all cooccurring at once. The filmmakers here have managed to make so much appear like so little. Now, that's some real magic, ay?Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald needed at least thirty-two more cuts until it should've been distributed. It's a messy, messy, messy mess of a blockbuster. Glad to see that we've officially shattered the streak of never having a ""bad"" Harry Potter movie. (I raise my glass) Here's to you, the studio who made this garbage pail of a catastrophe happen!

131,skpn123,Pure Magic,10,18 November 2018,This is a wonderful film that fills in so many gaps in the backstory of so many of the characters in the Harry Potter Series - anyone who has marked it low does not deserve to rate any such film. My only hope is they won't attend these quality movies again and leave these sort of works of art to those of us with an appreciation of this wonderful age of magical stories.I do appreciate that it take a bit of IQ to follow the plot which it appears some 'critics' lack. I am all for free opinion but when it is just a loud noise of nonsense and it pans a wonderful film one realises how sad some people's lives must be.There are some films that are bound to polarise an audience and the creators expect this and perhaps play on it but this is not one of those films.

133,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Plently of Grindelwald...not so much Fantastic Beasts,6,21 November 2018,"Why can't Fantastic Beasts be its own thing? I mean honestly with the title alone, it should feel like the emphasis on these movie should be on the beasts. I feel like these movies should have been more of adventure type a la Indiana Jones. Instead I feel like they just want to do Harry Potter again. Which isnt necessarily a bad idea, I just dont know what these worlds cant be separate. But oh well, we're too far gone at this point to make these movies more about the adventure of finding creatures.In some ways, I liked this movie more than the first. One of my problems with the first is that there were sideplots that didnt really go anywhere or have anything to do with the main plot. I felt like this one was more streamlined. Sure, it was pretty lore heavy, but I felt like the side stuff in this one (like Leta's backstory or Queenie's love troubles) helped build character and make you understand their actions later in the film (that were tied more around the central plot). And I do find the Grindelwald stuff interesting. I also liked that they brought Jamie Campbell Bower back to be a young Grindewald since he was cut from the Potter films.But other Easter eggs didnt necessarily work and I only felt were thrown in to go ""Remember that from Harry Potter?"" Like Nicholas Flamel for instance. He doesnt serve much of a purpose in this movie. Like, Jacob could have still looked into the crystal ball without him and found that Queenie would be at the graveyeard. Or heck, the rest of the characters end up there so if he was with them they all would have ended up there without that sequence anyway. And besides that Flamel then shows up towards the end of a battle to tell them one spell (which Im sure the aurors would already know considering their aurors) and thats it. Like, maybe he would have been suited if his knowledge of alchemy was used in the film to help foil Grindelwald. But you could have done away with him and the film could have ended exactly in the same way. Again, I feel like he's added in for no other purpose to go ""Oh yeah, his name is mentioned in the first Harry Potter film and oh wait is the Philopsher's Stone in his vault?"".And I dont know what they're going to do with Jacob. Yes, He's a fun character but he doesnt provide much except comic relief. I mean, all the guy does is get dragged around. He doesnt actually help the team in any way. And I get thats because he's a muggle but maybe if he at least had some good ideas once in awhile or was able to help in other ways, like helping the team navigate the muggle side of things or something. But he doesnt. I mean they even task him with watching an ailed wizard and he distracted from that. If this is a character they want to keep bringing back then I hope he actually provides something to the story besides just saying a joke here and there.But the thing that annoyed me the most is Dumbledore/Credence reveal. This is completely changing canon and for what purpose?There was a lot that annoyed me, but I didnt completely hate the film. I for the most part liked the characterizations and am excited to see where it can go from here. Theres some good action sequences (although I found the films opening sequence pretty dumb). Theres still a lot whimsy that I love. And I probably will still go out and see a third movie. I just hope JK can make some course corrections.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
134,sirwillisiv,"A talky, complicated, boring, clumsy slog of a sequel...",5,21 November 2018,"Oh man, what a mess. The first Fantastic Beasts was a fun, well-paced return to the wizarding world, but The Crimes of Grindelwald takes the complete opposite route. I'm actually in shock with how bad this film is. Granted, it's not the worst I've ever seen, but the movie I thought I was gonna get was gonna be much darker, establish more chemistry with the leads, and up the fun factor by 10. Instead, it's a dull, talky, and complicated slog. Each scene just bombards you with exposition, and it's very difficult to follow. Too many faces, and too many motivations to keep track of. The film also expects you to have studied the wizarding world from top to bottom, taking nods at many subtle subjects of the mythos which end up serving a pivotal purpose to the story. It's just so cluttered and unfriendly to an outside audience. Even as a life-time Harry Potter fan, I got easily lost, and I'm certain the average movie goer with no knowledge of the wizarding world would have no clue what's happening throughout the film's duration.You're suddenly expected to invest yourself in new characters that were only mentioned or had minimal screentime in the previous film, and they are quickly thrown into Empire Strikes Back-level extremes with their own complex histories to be explained on the side. It's as if the filmmakers didn't have time to establish backstory in the last installment, so they just crammed it all into one movie with scene-after-scene of boring, cliched dialogue. Heck, some elements received no introduction whatsoever. There's a minor character from the first film who is suddenly one of Grindelwald's followers with no explanation given, and I don't entirely understand why Jacob, the No-Maj, remembers everything after having his memories erased a film ago. The entire reason behind it is just glanced over comedically, and it's not satisfying. There has to be a better reason than ""only the bad memories go away"". That's not how oblivation worked elsewhere in the series. Is Rowling just retconning stuff now? She's making an already perfect universe broken and confusing.I must single out a few performances, and not positively. Johnny Depp just wasn't the right choice for Grindelwald. Honestly, I'm sick of seeing him. He's not a terrible actor by any means, but at this point I just can't distinguish the character from the actor. I just see Depp playing a villainous wizard, and he still can't shake the somewhat goofy, deadpan demeanor that defines 70% of his filmography. I also didn't find Jude Law that convincing as Dumbledore. He seemed a little too charismatic, not exactly a match for the quiet, pondering, and wise character we always read and watched before. It just seemed like a forced move to cast a handsome actor as a well-known fictional character.I had some issues with the cinematography as well. The camera work is very awkward. Was it really necessary to shoot uncomfortable close-up shots of the actor's faces when they're speaking? The editing is quite a mess in some scenes, with much of the choreography not adding up at all. For example, there's a sequence where Newt and Tina are escaping some kind of vault in the French Ministry of Magic. In one shot, they're holding onto some kind of floating locker object, then another shot later they're on the ground running away. It's a real shame that after multiple dialogue-heavy scenes, we finally get some action happening, but it's incompetently put together and equally difficult to follow like the story.Despite all my bellyaching, the film's got some upsides, and given how much I've lamented about this convoluted story that requires much effort to grasp, there is one twist near the end that I found satisfying. A twist that I wish Star Wars: The Last Jedi had utilized, as a matter of fact. One major character does turn their back on the protagonists and join the antagonists, and it leaves one of the other main characters in total heartbreak. It was the only part of the film where I was emotionally invested and made me curious about where the story was gonna go next. Granted, there was an overwhelming large amount of exposition to sit through in order to see this happen, but it was unexpected and deeply affecting to witness. Secondly, the costume design and art direction is still very well done. The wizarding world does have a very grand vibe to it and it's always a dazzling treat. Sure, it was charming to see Hogwarts on the big screen after so many years, and Newt's eccentric interactions with the magical creatures has it amusement factor, but aside from these small elements, The Crimes of Grindelwald is a clumsy, tedious dud of a sequel. It's talky, rushed, and very lacking in thrills. Unless you know your Harry Potter facts top to bottom, you won't find this film comprehensible at all. If it weren't for the fact that I was seeing this film with a friend, I probably would've walked out of the theater. The spell just isn't strong any more, folks.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
135,scb_coldsteel,"An improvement in the Fantastic Beast series, but it's still can't quite capture the magic of the Harry Potter films.",7,20 November 2018,"So I watched Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald opening night last week. I have been putting off writing a review because this is a difficult one to write for me. I am a big Harry Potter nerd so I am a tad bit biased when it comes to the franchise. That being said trying to be as objective as possible this was not a great movie. It was not bad, but it had many glaring errors.The plot of the movie of course follows Newt Scamander and his gang as they attempt to solve a mystery and save the day. Macguffins are introduced, battles are fought, mysteries are solved, and characters develop and change. Of course the actual conflict of the movie deals with the escalation of Grindelwald and his militant force and the wizarding world. The plot certainly has a very dark tone and has ample amounts of magic and intrigue to keep any Potter fan entertained. There are also a few Harry Potter lore Easter eggs that were fun to spot. The movie provided a number of twists and turns that no one could see coming and has really made me want to see how the series ends.Unfortunately the plot was also a mess. The film tries to do entirely too much in the span of two hours. The film introduces a wide and almost unnecessary assortment of cast members that just convolute the narrative. At any time there are multiple storylines being told that all come together eventually, but it all feels too big for a screen and unnecessary. This jumbled narrative really created a pacing problem that slowed down and made parts of the movie boring. Boring is something that should never be synonymous with the Harry Potter world. I don't want to ruin anything for anyone, but there were just too many parts of the movie that felt unnecessary and unexplained. Ultimately this film wanted to be Empire Strikes Back, but it felt more like the Attack of the Clones.As I said the also film introduces a large assortment of secondary cast, but very little is put into explaining who they are or their motivations. I would have preferred a smaller cast that we could really focus on instead of a rogues gallery of characters we don't care about. Ultimately a few characters and their motivations never really materialized, so the viewer is just left guessing.It should be noted that the story was written by JK Rowling. A lot of the flaws in this film come from the fact that it would have done so much better as a book. JK Rowling just wrote herself into a corner with a jumbled plot line that feels entirely too much like a segment of a larger movie than a complete story. It's tough because I'm sure a lot of these questions and characters will be fleshed out in the next film. As it stands though as a stand alone film it suffered from many of the same errors as the first Fantastic Beasts.That certainly doesn't mean it wasn't fun at times. I absolutely love Newt as a character. Eddie Redmayne is a great actor and he really brings Newt to life as the neurotic and withdrawn hero. I also genuinely find his gang of allies to be funny and likable as a whole. It was great seeing the development between Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Of course their conflict is what we are all sticking around for. The film did flesh out both of these characters a bit more making them feel human and relatable. There is not a Harry Potter fan on the planet that will not have their heart melt when Dumbledore looks into the Mirror of Erised. Turns out Dumbledore desires more than a nice pair of socks.There was also some excellent World building done in the movie. One of the reasons I love the Harry Potter franchise is the world that it creates. The settings of the film were wide and diverse and were a treat to see. Seeing the Ministry and the other wizard cities was all around fun and immersive. We also got to finally visit Hogwarts again which is always nice. The movie certainly expands on that World by introducing and building a upon establish lore. The movie also had a giant twist ending that will leave any Harry Potter fan begging to know more.I actually liked Johnny Depp as Grindelwald as well. He was a Magneto style villain who did bad things, but you could almost understand his reasoning. He wasn't like Voldemort, he didn't rule by fear but by charismatic authority and pushing Wizards superiority. He wants to stop the unwanted death and destruction that mankind is capable of in wars like WW2 and protect Wizards from destruction. He was overall a great complex villain and I look forward to seeing more of him in the series.Directing wise the movie was well done overall. David Yates has been at the Harry Potter franchise long enough to know how to capture fun and interesting magic. There were truly some very interesting uses of magic in the movie that we have never seen before. Grindelwald in particular showed why he is such a feared adversary with his brutal magic skills.Animation and sound were spot-on as always. The Fantastic Beasts were quite fantastic and helped to immerse you into the world. The score also provided a nice range from whimsical to dark and tense. I really can't complain about any of the technical aspects of the movie.So all-in-all the movie was a bit of a mixed bag. I loved the world building and the conflict between Dumbledore and Grindelwald. The movie provided some much-needed lore building and established an overarching central conflict. As a fan of the world I really like what the series could evolve into, but as a standalone film it really drops the ball. Unfortunately the movie was also a tad bit too ambitious and it just had too much going on for its own good. While it was an improvement over the first Fantastic Beasts, it still fell short of the magic of the original Harry Potter series. A 6.75 out of 10.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

137,loco_73,A Step Backwards For The Potter Prequels,6,18 November 2018,"While I absolutely loved both the Potter novels and movies, I don't feel any such kinship with the new would-be prequel franchise ""Fantastic Beasts"" .To be honest, my main attachment for these new movies is JK Rowling herself and her well earned title as a master storyteller. So it was in that spirit that I went to see the first instalment ""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them"". And while the movie lacked the magic and charm of the Potter films, there was still enough in there to like and enjoy. While not up to par as it's former counterparts, it was a solid entry.Well all that is gone with "" Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald"". Instead what I found was a a mediocre movie. Yes mediocrity is the best quality that could be assigned to it. There are too many characters, plots and subplots. It's as if there are several movies packed into one...neither very good on their own. It's like they decided to throw everything but the kitchen sink into it.Right off the bat, Jude Law is the standout as a younger Dumbledore. As well, Queenie (Alice Sudol) and Kowalski (Dan Foggler) retain their charm from the first film. Johnny Depp wasn't as bad as I thought he could and thankfully he wasn't Jack Sparrow. The rest of the cast frankly I didn't care about.""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald"" is not necessarily an awful movie, but definitely not as good as it's predecessor.

Rawlings inspired adventure is four-fold: 1) Rawlings has bitten off too much (as Writer and Executive Director), 2) an over abundance of special effects doesn't make a film special, 3) working again with ""Harry Potter"" (2007 & 2011) director David Yates has officially proven to run it's course, and 4) way to many characters and storylines. Here, the adventures of magizoologist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne ""The Theory of Everything"") is so confusing and time consuming that Redmayne's pouting Wizard (this character gets old fast) feels out of place and lost. Add in Johnny Depp's freaky eyed white haired arch enemy Grindelwald (who garners way to much time at the beginning of the film) and talks in whisper throughout, a son (Ezra Miller ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"") who may or may not be a son, several unsupported love interests (Zoe Kravits ""Mad Max,"" Claudia Kim ""The Dark Tower,"" Carmen Ejogo ""Selma,"" Katherine Waterston "" Inherent Vice"") and Jude Law as Albus Dumbledore (still don't know where/how this character fits into the mix) and you've got a ""fantastic"" mess on your hands.

142,achyutaghosh,Convoluted and rehashed,6,18 November 2018,"One feels sad for JK Rowling after watching Fantastic Beasts Crimes of Grindelwald. Her once rich fountain of creativity has gone dry, and everything served up is a rehash of the original Harry Potter saga. Same old megalomaniac rising against the orderly world of wizards, and everything building up towards an epic duel over a course of 5 films. Franchise building and expanded universe is all good if you have a treasure trove of characters over time you can dig into like Marvel. No offence to Harry Potter lovers, but that universe is just not deep enough, or frankly, interesting enough.The first movie plot was relatively simple and it ended with the capture of Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp). Crimes of Grindelwald starts soon after, with the evil wizard escaping from captivity in fine style. Meanwhile the budding relationship between Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), and Jacob (Dan Fogler) and Queenie (Alison Sudol) seem to have been nipped in the buds itself by plot points straight out of tv dramas. Maybe adult romance is not Rowling's thing, like kid infatuations are. For a change the focal city is Paris and all the characters converge there in search of Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller), who somehow survived his end in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.Albus Dumbledore: ""I can't move against Grindelwald. It has to be you. In your shoes, I'd probably refuse to""The plot becomes more and more convoluted as new characters come in. Who is Credence? Why is everyone after him? Which side is Leta Lestrange and Nagini on? When is Dumbledore going to make a decisive move? Is he ever going to come out of the closet? Who is Yusuf Kama and what is his problem with the Lestrange family? What is the context of the new prophecy and why are the wizards so stuck on prophecies? Who is Nicholas Flamel? When is the titular character going to commit some major crimes? Nothing against Johnny Depp but isn't Grindelwald the most boring movie villain ever?Rowling tries to tie the prequel plots into the Harry Potter saga, but it is complex, to say the least. Search for unknown origins, family relations, wizard Nazi uprising, and some intermittent romance drags the first half down considerably. The plot twists are incredulous- Queenie, even though she is a mind reader, betrays her friends and joins Grindelwald. Leta Lestrange is in love with a Scamander all right, but not the one she is marrying. The mother of all twists is at the end, where we discover that all things powerful are essentially Dumbledore, so as to speak.The magical creatures (fan favorite Nifflers, along with Kelpies and the astounding Zouwu), Eddie Redmayne, and Jude Law make up for it partially. Pity there isn't too much of Law, but every scene those blue eyes are in, the movie seems to come alive.After these two prequels, you kind of appreciate the original Harry Potter series even more. There was magic in them, and we grew with the characters. Maybe the next few films will surprise, but as of now the expanded universe is not half as interesting.

143,n-kefala,Great special effects,6,18 November 2018,"This movie feels like a small upgrade from its predecessor, adds star power, introduces key characters and lays the foundation for a ""Wizarding World"" franchise. But it is far from a perfect adventure. Thanks to all those special effects that they fill the screen with a series of eye-catching spectacles, the characters and the plot are not so confusing. Rowling and director David Yates, along with their likable cast, make the ride an enjoyable one, even when you're feeling overwhelmed with new information. Despite being light in the story department, ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" offers plenty of small pleasures and the fans of Harry Potter I think will find it interesting enough.

2) I respected the film for some of the risks it takes and not being bland
3) The final act speech and action set piece in the cemetery was fantastic
4) I really cared about the relationships between the characters
5) The childishness of the Harry Potter films always bothered me and so these films centering on adults and having more adult themes has always been a plus for me. It also means the wizards are all actually of a high quality rather than students who don't know anythingNEGATIVES:1) Some elements of the script feel lazy and the dialogue is cringey at times
2) There are two long monologues back to back at the start of the third act, supposedly about who Credence really is, and putting them back to back made it feel so boring
3) The beasts feel largely irrelevant at this point, and all the beast scenes just bloated the runtime and made the film drag",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
145,mohit_sinsniwal,Lestranger then fiction,6,26 May 2019,"I'd really love to tell you about the plot. I really would! But I would struggle to pull all the multitude of strands together from J.K. Rowling's story and coherently explain them to anyone. If Rowling had put ten thousand monkeys (not a million - it's no bloody Shakespeare) into a room with typewriters and locked the door I wouldn't be surprised.Let me try at a high level..... The arch-criminal wizard Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) is being tortured in 'Trump Tower', but manages to escape and flees to Paris in pursuit of a mysterious circus performer called Credence (Ezra Miller) and his bewitched companion Nagini (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) played fetchingly by Claudia Kim. Someone needs to stop him, and all eyes are on Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law). But he is unable to do so, since he and Grindelwald are ""closer than brothers"" (nudge, nudge, wink, wink). So a reluctant and UK-grounded Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is smuggled into the danger zone... which suits him just fine since his love Tina (Katherine Waterston) is working for the ministry there, and the couple are currently estranged due to a (topical) bout of 'Fake News'.Throw in a potential love triangle between Newt, his brother Theseus (Callum Turner) and old Hogwart's schoolmate Leta Lestrange (Zoë Kravitz) and about a half dozen other sub-plots and you have... well... a complete muggle - - sorry - - muddle.Above all, I really can't explain the crux of the plot. A venerable diarrhoea of exposition in a crypt, during an inexplicably quiet fifteen minutes (given 'im-who-can-be-named is next door with about a thousand other people!) left me completely bewildered. A bizarre event at sea (no spoilers) would seem to make absolutely NO SENSE when considered with another reveal at the end of the film. I thought I must have clearly missed something... or I'd just not been intelligent enough to process the information.... or.... it was actually completely bonkers! Actually, I think it's the latter: in desperation I went on a fan site that tried to explain the plot. While it was explained there, the explanation aligned with what I thought had happened: but it made no mention of the ridiculousness of the random coincidence involved!The film's a mess. Which is a shame since everyone involved tries really hard. Depp oozes evil very effectively (he proves that nicely on arriving in Paris, and doubles-down about 5 minutes later: #veryverydark). Redmayne replays his Newt-act effectively but once again (and I see I made the same comments in my ""Fantastic Beasts"" review) his character mumbles again so much that many of his lines are unintelligible.I also complained last time that the excellent actress Katherine Waterston was criminally underused as the tentative love interest Tina. this trend unfortunately continues unabated in this film.... you'll struggle afterwards to write down what she actually did in this film.Jacob (Dan Fogler) and Queenie (Alison Sudol, looking for all the world in some scenes like Rachel Weisz) reprise their roles in a sub-plot that goes nowhere in particular.Of the newcomers, Jude Law as Dumbledore is a class-act but has very little screen time: hopefully he will get more to do next time around. Zoë Kravitz impresses as Leta.As you would expect from a David Yates / David Heyman Potter collaboration, the product design, costume design and special effects are all excellent. Some scenes are truly impressive - an 'explosion' in a Parisian garret is particularly spectacular. But special effects alone do not a great film make. Many reviews I've seen complain that this was a 'filler' film... a set-up film for the rest of the series. And I can understand that view. If you analyse the film overall, virtually NOTHING of importance actually happens: it's like the ""Order of the Phoenix"" of the prequels.I dragged myself along to see this one because ""I thought I should"". The third in the series will really need to sparkle to make me want to see it. If J.K. Rowling were to take me advice (she won't - she NEVER returns my calls!) then she would sculpt the story-arc but leave the screenwriting to someone better. The blame for this one, I'm afraid, lies at Rowling's door alone.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
146,EddyTheMartian007,An okay Set Up Movie For the Sequels.,5,18 November 2018,"(No Spoilers) The Fantastic Beasts Sequel is a Set Up Movie. This doesn't make it bad, but it's certainly not a good movie either. The Technical aspects of the movie are of course great. The effects (even though I thought they were overused at times) were really good for the most part. The cinematography, sound, sets, costumes, and editing, everything is good. The Actors all do a great job again. My favorite parts of the movie were definitely Johnny Depp's Grindelwald, and Jude Law's Dumbledore. Dumbeldore was surprisingly underused though. Grindelwald had a great set up, where it's said he's very manipulative, and can almost control people, and this could've been a very interesting part of his character, but it's never really shown enough. I did really like Grindelwald though. He was definitely my favorite part of the film.
This movie just doesn't feel like a fantastic beasts movie. What I mean by this is that this isn't a story about Newt, or the beasts anymore. There's basically no plot, the movie is all over the place. The only plot I could think of is Grindelwald trying to get Credence to join him, and Credence trying to figure out who he is. The movie is really setting up for the finale and for the next films. A lot of scenes in the first 2 acts just felt unnecessary, and boring. A lot of it is just filler, and too focused on Harry Potter fan service. It was really choppy, going from character to character. Honestly I had a hard time following it, and I was confused in some moments. It's just not focused. An example of this is Voldemort's snake, Nagini, who's a character in this film. She doesn't really do much, she's just there. A lot of the moments just should've been resolved quicker. They just dragged on for too long, and it made the movie somewhat slow and boring. There's a bunch of scenes that contribute nothing to the plot, or not even character development, which should've been entirely cut. There's also barely any character development for the most of the main characters. They are the same since the beginning to the end of the film. Characters just feel shoved into the movie, and it just isn't interesting. The third act was actually good though, and it's when the movie finally picks up. This is when everything finally starts to get revealed, with some very good twists and revelations, and it finally becomes entertaining. There's some actual dark moments, and the final twist was really shocking. I'm not sure if it makes sense in the overall universe though. Make sure to not get it spoiled because it will probably ruin the movie. I just really enjoyed what they did in the third act, and it was just genuinely shocking, even though it's just left up in the air for the sequel. That's really the biggest problem for the movie.
Even though the third act was good, the rest of the film is filled with filler, unnecessary fan service, that just made it boring. Also I thought some of the characters motivations didn't make sense at the end of the film. Like I said before Grindelwald is supposed to be able to control or manipulate people, so that's what I'm assuming happened, but if so it's lazy, and just wasn't shown well. Some other nitpicks I had with the film are characters like Newt, Grindelwald, and Credence who are supposed to be found, but are just going out in public almost like If nothing happened, nobody notices them. Overall this movie was boring for the first 2 acts, the third act was much better, but not enough to save the movie. This is definitely the weakest entry in the Wizarding World, but it isn't bad, It's just okay.

147,bastille-852-731547,A Disastrous Entry to the Wizarding World Canon,3,19 November 2018,"I'm a (fairly casual) fan of the Wizarding World and love the original Harry Potter series. I enjoyed the first ""Fantastic Beasts"" film, but this sequel (""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"") is a dumpster fire. The film is focused primarily on trying to set up sequels. In fact, it's so focused on trying to set up sequels that it completely shuns good storytelling and entertainment value. The film's first 20-25 minutes are admittedly good, with a thrilling and suspenseful opening scene and some good set-up of the narrative. After that, though, it's all downhill from there.What also makes the film a complete misfire is that the film even fails to develop a primary conflict arc between Newt and Grindelwald. After all, do we really care that much about the extended family trees of various supporting characters? The movie gets unbearably convoluted even for fans of the Wizarding World, and goes out of its way to alienate casual fans. Unbelievably, the film's characters are either too developed to make further sense of them (which almost never occurs in mainstream filmmaking) or underdeveloped. After all, while I like the first ""Fantastic Beasts"" film, I'm not a huge fan of any of its main characters besides Newt. The acting is mostly sub-par, and Johnny Depp's performance as Grindelwald is flat and wooden. Speaking of Grindelwald, he's a very disappointing villain: one devoid of motivation or even any sort of personality. The Wizarding World was never going to top Voldemort or even probably Bellatrix as villains, but J.K. Rowling should have been able to write a more engaging antagonist. Jude Law is good as Dumbledore, but gets far too little screen time. The Hogwarts scenes probably only last a total of 10 minutes, which was very disappointing.The film's messy climax lacks any sort of impact on the viewer and rather simply comes off as ""blue lights vs. orange lights,"" and the resolution at the end makes the narrative even more convoluted and ridiculous. All in all, barring amazing marketing or reviews, I'm out on ""Fantastic Beasts 3."" 3/10",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

I used to be able to say that their wasn't a bad film in the series but now The Crimes of Grindlewald has halted that great streak. While not without its positives this film is very weak due to its messy story and sloppy pacing.The cast of characters that return from the original film are retain their likability with solid performances. Eddie Redmayne is great as Newt again he's much more vulnerable in this film and he plays that part of the character well. Tina, Queenie and Kowalski all remain good additions to the cast that sadly do not get their due screen time. Jude Law is excellent as Dumbledore, he's in the film very little but lights up the screen whenever he is. Johnny Depp carry's a great presence and good charm that makes his character captivating whenever he's on screen.The visuals of the film also retain their quality and continue to build this side of the Wizarding world. The beasts continue to look excellent and the production design for the new setting of Paris, I'm glad this series is taking us to new parts of the world that continues to flesh out the magical universe.This films is in one word: boring. There is almost no story to speak of and simply follows the characters on vague quests around Paris for 2 hours and the pace never picks up or builds its characters in interesting new directions. It's messy to no end as it suffers from a major lack of focus.While Johnny Depp is good as the character, Grindlewald is yet to establish himself as a worthy villain. The character is fairly one note and simply wants to take over the world. The past between him and Dumbledore is hinted at, not so subtly, but never truly goes anywhere or adds anything new to the conflict.The film also spends far too much time in setting up the next entry in the franchise. I know the films needs to have conflicts to carry over into the next film but it takes away from the narrative of this entry when there's no story that makes this film worth the watch on its own.The Crimes of Grindlewald is a complete disappointment that forgets everything great about this franchise. It's a complete corporate product that fails to stand on its own. There is no focus to its characters or story that make the film relentlessly boring and messy. I hope Rowling learns from the mistakes of this movie and improve upon them in the next entry so I can get back on board with this franchise.4.6/10 - C (Poor)",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

What I hated about this movie:
The pace: soooooo boring. Damn, I almost fell asleep again. Twice!The plot: One major flaw of the first movie was the characters. People generally liked Newt and Tina, but hated Queenie, Jacob and Creedance. In this movie, here we go again. 3/4 of the movie is dedicated to Creedance backstory and Jacob/Queenie ""complicated"" relationship.So many useless subplots: soooo many backstories, sooooo many red herrings.The acting: I didn't see Grindelwald. I saw Johnny Depp with a ton of makeup.Fanservice: Oh, god, the fanservice is so heavy in this one. The plot is so unnecessary convoluted, stretched and boring, they had to put a million references to the HP universe, so that people can be excited. ""Look! It's the guy from HP"" / ""Look!

The film also suffers because the films aren't backed up by a book - you take these more on their own merits, rather than from loving the books, which means there is more unknown. The story is not as grand as the other in the Harry Potter world - the main arc is finding out a characters name, with no backdrops of peril at Hogwarts, or competitions etc, which means the pace is much slower, and more meandering in direction. That said, the final showdown is worthy of the series history and makes up for much of the slowness of before.

153,samyoung-82648,"Overwhelming, but absolutely superb",9,15 November 2018,"Rowling is a master story teller. Fantastic Beasts part 1 was a brilliant popcorn flick. The series is filled with solid actors who you can love and admire.The second movie is crammed full of scenes, story, characters and art. This sounds crazy, but, there was almost too much to this movie. However, most of the highly intelligent and non-prejudiced movies are all coming from outside of the US in recent years - it seems the more the US push for ""inclusiveness"", the more sexist, racist and intolerant US movies become. This movie is no exception in avoiding the current US trend of prejudice. Not once did I feel that someone was pushing sexism or racism on the screen (cf Zoe Kravitz antics off-screen which have made me lost a lot of respect for her and her superficial ""skin deep"" judgement of people).The movie is dark at times, definitely darker than the first movie. However, my young child (about 10yrs old) was not scared at any stage. The themes, whilst intelligent, were not beyond my little one. It's also wonderful to see a villain that's more than one dimensional. Depp played the character very well (despite the misandrist media's intolerant and unfounded ""mob rule, fact devoid"" statements).If you're looking for a good popcorn flick, this is certainly one of the best for the year. Suitable for most kids 10+. The movie avoids sexism (which is extremely rare today - cf sexist movies like Wreck It Ralph 2 that we as a family will gladly skip).

Seeing the wider world of the wizardry community, and the emergence and back story of characters such as Grindelwald, and Dumbledore is compelling viewing. Even if the road to the infamous battle between those two is a long way off yet....Eddie Redmayne as always is a joy to watch as the awkward yet admirable protagonist (Newt Scamander), and the supporting cast are for the most part terrific, (Jude Law, Zoe Kravitz, Claudia Kim and Johnny Depp in particular).All in all though, the story follows too many character arcs, which makes the whole narrative of the film a little perplexing in parts... Too many people start behaving ""out of character"" with little or no explanation / provocation and whilst the backdrop for all this is beautifully displayed and keeps you engaged, the story does feel a bit lightweight and confused in parts.The film could be summed up with; ""Grindelwald is being a conniving Machiavellian baddie, good guys are trying their best to stop him, but in the end, we all know Dumbledore will step up to save the day"".In some ways these movies are always going to suffer in the same way the Star Wars prequels did, which is to say that the end is already known, and they're fleshing out the story that gets us there.

This film has so many problems right from the first Fantastic Beasts which unsurprisingly continues with this installment also. This film desperately tries to feed of your sense of nostalgia and franchise building.
There are so many plot points involved connecting to the original Harry Potter series that almost it seems for a moment that I am reading some crazy fan conspiracy theory and not an original material (Because sometimes it becomes really hard to wrap around the reality). So many links!

The most basic comedy writing everThen the only true character development included has no warning or indication beforehand, which makes it quite confusingThey do succeed in making the Newt annoying if that was what they were going with by making him so awkward when speaking and interacting with others (probably why they casted Redmayne)Overall - very weak plot and dialogue results in a non compelling movie which other than its visuals borrowed from HP movies doesn't offer much",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
165,Harhaluulo54,What about the crimes against Grindelwald?,3,11 December 2019,"This movie is an ideological preach. Grindelwald is tortured by the government because he has different political views. He wants to be cautious and save the wizard race from the wars of humans before it's too late, but apparently that's not cool because, despite humans being trashy, the ministry of magic wants to maintain the illusion of a happy world where everyone, despite their magical abilities, is under a totalitarian equality rule a la liberals. Albus Dumbledore is also gay in this movie.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
166,Dannyboi94,"Ignore the bad reviews, this is an entertaining addition...",8,17 November 2018,"The Crimes of Grindlewald was a very entertaining movie, filled with outstanding imagination and characters. A lot of the bad reviews aim that the film is boring, while this film is very slow, I wouldn't call it boring. It is filled with great character moments, and some brilliant instances of visuals.There are some issues I have with the film, from the pacing to some of the dialogue. But I can't really blame JK for that, she works better as an author than a screenwriter, but she does a decent job. But I'm glad she kept her political views out of the film.The biggest surprise in this film, is Grindelwald himself. I didn't like the style of the character, he looked very 80s metal-head. But Johnny Depp shocked me, he was very charismatic, intimidating and sinister at times. When I was watching his scenes, it gave me a sort of view of how Voldemort would have worked if we had seen more of him. Except with Grindelwald we see that he at least has a human side, as at times he looks reluctant to commit some of the horrific crimes we see him do.Jude Law as Dumbledore was great, but he had very little screen time, but I have a feeling we will see more of him in the next movies. But I do hope he grows out his beard to bring us the classic wise, old hairy wizard.The other characters are also good, there are some new additions which feel pointless and boring. I didn't see the need for Nagini, she felt useless, some of the side characters have nothing to do other than stand in the background. Some stood out like, Leta and Theseus, who were interesting, others were just eater eggs for Harry Potter fans.The whole film's plot resolves around Credence Barebone's character, who for some reason survived the last movie, they sort of brush over that here. He is played brilliantly by Ezra Miller, but has little to do in the film.Our four heroes, Newt, Jacob, Queenie and Tina are all back, but only Newt and Jacob really stand out. Queenie and Tina aren't in the film that much, and still have little to do, but Newt and Jacob are that entertaining that sometimes you even forget about them.This movie isn't brilliant, it isn't the best in the series, but it isn't bad, it does feel necessary, despite having an off pacing. It feels like the filler episode you get in a TV series, it feels pointless, but at the end it feels necessary.Crimes of Grindelwald is a good film, with good characters, visuals, soundtrack, but has a lot of issues, but hardcore Harry Potter fans will find enjoyment in it, like myself.8/10",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
167,alon-dar1,Garbage with CGI,1,17 February 2019,"No plot, lots of nothing. One of the most boring films ever. And they ""force"" you to watch the next one, well, maybe they think that they make you watch the next one, but from the show i was in, when 80% of the viewers left the cinema long before the end of the movie, i presume that less than 20% of total viewers will watch the next one. i feel that my money was stolen, i really do.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
168,brianjohnson-20043,Did I miss a movie or two?,2,29 November 2018,"The first fantastic beasts wasn't all that complex and the quantity of characters was few enough that I was able to follow everything. At times it seemed like the first film spent too much time on just visual antics of trying to find the missing creatures.I read a few reviews claiming that this film made similar miscues, and I heartily disagree. This one did have some boring stretching of action and cgi. But it wasn't boring because tbe film was lacking in ingredients. Crimes of Grindelwald seemed to come up short because it was overpacked with new characters, new settings, new relationships and new dilemmas without much of a foundation as to why we should care about the ordeals the new characters were going through. There were a few Hogwarts scenes and flashbacks which were likable. Although, I thought Dumbledore taught Transfiguration rather than DATDA. Jude Law as Dumbledore almost seemed to make up for how terrible it felt to have Johnny Depp playing Grindelwald. I'm not a fan of Johnny Depp playing sinister or wacky characters. Letta Lastrange or her fiancé didn't come off to me as very well established, but it seeemd we were supposed to care deeply about them. There were about 4 other characters which were similarly thrown into the fray without much to go on.The actions scenes seemed entertaining and dramatic. But I was never on the edge of my seat because there wasn't enough established leading up to the war for all the new characters to carry significant interest. And this is probably what made the film seem boring. As I hinted in my title, it felt like there should have been an additional movie or two to set up all the stuff prior to the climax of this film. It felt a lot more like Justice League than the first Avengers movie in that there were so many characters together who we had so little time to know anything about prior to the war starting. There were a lot of peices to the story. But not enough depth regarding the peices to warrant a ton of interest.There has got to be more than familiar names, characters and creatures to keep me excited. And I'm a big Harry Potter fan. But Harry Potter is good because the story and adventure for the characters is more engrossing than the sum of its parts. Fantastic beasts so far is looking a bit like a mess to explore many things including things to setup the Harry Potter. Which is unnecessary and often uninteresting. Even though I like the calls to the original source material, it almost feels the story would have worked better if they had kept the bulk of the story showing the American environment or British environment, and only introduced a few new characters rather than throwing so much into action.I hope this chapter in the story is at least more interested after the later films are released or perhaps after a review. But for now I was more mystified than pleased by what I saw.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
169,brianjohnson-20043,Bad in almost every way,2,15 February 2019,"The cinematography looks fine and the actors apart from Johnny Depp are adequate. But apart from that the entire film is a groan.I was hoping to like it. But no. It didn't seem appealing to casual or hardcore Potter fans. It was like that awful death-eater attack scene at the burrow in the half blood prince movie.Remember the scene they added for the film where Harry STUPIDLY (even for Harry) leaves their safe house to go outside alone to fight the death eaters? And he goes right to the middle of that pond surrounded by reeds along the edges? So he goes to the one place where they could easily see him without him likely seeing them. Meanwhile, the order members, apart from Ginny, can't get around a fire to help Harry for a good long stretch of time, because adult wizards including Hermione apparently forget how to get around or through seemingly ordinary fire. Ginny joins Harry in the really vulnerave spot too. Can't have anyone acting rationally in the scene.Then, the moment the order at last get past the seemingly ordinary fire to help them, the death-eaters fly to the Burrow, which they are supposedly now able to reach despite the magical enchantments, and once inside the area decide to set the place on fire and crash into it with their flying smoke cloud things. But they leave all wizards alone.And don't worry. The house is fine in a few months later when Harry arrives after the 7 Harrys flight from the Dursely's house. It's like the incident never happened or needed to happen, or make any sense happening. The heroes acted stupid. The villain seem to be mean for the sake of being mean. But not mean enough to attack any of the order members or Harry's friends like any viewer would expect given the established goal of Voldemort or characteristics of his followers.Crimes of Gridelwald is like that scene. But the scenes lasts for the entire film.I know people are going to watch it anyway because they will watch anything Harry Potter related. But you have been forewarned.The story makes no sense. It has a bunch of unexplained moments or coincidences. The attempts to tie the story to historical events is awful. They ruin much of the canon established in Harry Potter related to Dumbledore, Grindlewald and McGonagall. Some characters seem to exist for no reasons. Queenie make decisions which make no sense at all. If all the characters, hers is the one that behaves most bafflingly.Almost all the jokes aren't funny. The likable characters are no longer likable and most of the long list of new characters aren't give enough time to really shine or make decisions where the viewers seem to care about their decisions. There are characters that I wish were evil that turn good and characters I wish remained or became good who turn or go evil. There is also a lot of stuff which seems to have been setup for a later film rather than an interesting part of film we watched. ItThat's the kind of thing that doesn't fly well in a feature length movie.JK Rowling's visual world has seriously let me down for the first time. At least the Half Blood Prince issue was for just one scene in an otherwise satisfactory movie.If I were in charge I would make a new Fantastic Beasts 2 movie and pretend this one never existed. Limit the storylines and characters to a reasonable number. Don't try to impress the diehard fans with references to Harry Potter characters or references to real historical events. It you can work that sort of thing in, fine. But don't force it. Just make a good story that respects the characters you established in the first film.I'm sure JK Rowling has some good ideas. But they are NOT translating to the movie screen. And it seems they specifically aren't translating for this last film because there were too many small ideas. And no structure.If you try to enthusiastically equally emphasize too many ideas, you invariably will end up positively emphasizing none of them. That seems to be what happened here.And the movie wasn't even that long. It just felt REALLy long because it got off to a REALLY bad start. It could have used a prologue to get everyone reminded of what happened in the last film and provide some exposition for a few false f the new characters.That way the movie could have time where the audience could enjoy watching the story play out, rather than trying and failing to figure out what was happening and why things were happening for the entire run of the movie.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
170,TheGreatMarkukini,Beasts are still fantastic but the crimes of Grindelwald are bigger that we have imagined,2,25 April 2019,"Johnny Depp has always attracted outlandish vibes to himself so it was inevitable that he would appear in the magic world and for a moment there I was genuinely happy about that. That was before I have watched the movie.Pushing the boat from the pier we still have the previous part in mind with its miraculous imagery and creatures that make you melt in your seat from cuteness. However, as it was with Harry Potter the age limit of the movie made a huge leap and now we are facing not a story for children but an undeveloped action with some bits of politics and insights on ethics.While watching the trailer for the 10th time I was hyped to the core to see aforementioned Johnny Depp and Jude Law, especially the latter. In the end, what we've got was a stomachache from the very undercooked Grindelwald and some rumbling in the bowels from the tasty scent of Dumbledore in the kitchen that was apparently served to a wrong table.The consolation prize by means of showing almost the same tricks of Eddie Redmayne is not enough to cover the cruel crime of ruining the expectations and the franchise itself.I would not say that the problem was in Johnny Depp, it was in his character and the way the storyline went. It was because of the dumb ways to bring back the characters for the pleasure of the audience, which was not found there. It was because of the ""novelties"" that seemed like a cheap trick on the fair leaving with a feeling of being scammed by a greedy bearded scoundrel.I don't even have to wake up from the dream, no magic enchantment was cast while watching this mistake. All that I can say is that the cast was fooled into performing a bad screenplay, of course, a lot of people will tell that it might be an important step towards the future chapters but I will cut the talk and say that I would gladly jump over it and rather have some flashbacks in a good story than a crappy plot with rare breaks of genuine magic.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

There are a lot of needless sub plots in the film that go nowhere. The romance between the characters feel forced and uninteresting. Even some of the friendships that were created in the first film don't have the same spark anymore.The Wizarding World as a whole feels pretty empty too. The first film still had this sort of magical flare to it that made each part of it somewhat enticing. This film drains that away and turns it into this empty shell of what it once was. It not fun, and not nearly as energetic either. It's just lifeless.The main villain is fine. Johnny Depp I felt like did a decent job as him. He was not nearly as wild and cooky as he usually is, but it still left a lot to be desired, and because of that I ended up leaving the film feeling very lukewarm on him.The movie makes a lot of really bad jump cuts through out. There times when we get a evil villain scene and it then cuts to our heroes then cuts to a entirely different scene with another group of characters, and it just felt too much for one film to handle. There is also a lot of exposition dumps in the film that really hurt the pace of the film too.In Conclusion this film is just a jumbled mess of a movie. The characters aren't as interesting, the editing is poor, the dialogue feels very weak, and the villain feels like wasted potential. Overall I left the film feeling very disappointed as a result.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
175,CriticalOfEverything,An absolutely disappointing snore-fest.,4,19 November 2018,"Wow, I am actually in disbelief in how bad this movie is to the point where I just find it boring. After the first Fantastic Beasts, I was ready for a sequel that would hopefully remove the few problems that the first had because, even though I think the first one is great, it does have it's flaws. This movie, however, has even more flaws and I can't believe that I'm saying this, but I would rather watch ""Harry Potter: The Chamber Of Secrets"" over this. That movie is bad, but at least it isn't boring and has the same wonder/magic feeling of the original Harry Potter series. This has absolutely nothing going for it other than a younger Dumbledore and continuing the story. I cannot recommend this at all, and given how the first Fantastic Beasts, despite being good, felt a little bit empty after ''Deathly Hallows Part 2'', I don't think this series will be improving in quality anytime soon. Who knows? The third might be great if it's following the Harry Potter quality line of having a bad sequel and then having a great threequel, but with Fantastic Beasts, it just doesn't seem likely.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

180,Benslie,Slow paced film with no main plot,5,18 November 2018,"First of all, just like in the last movie the acting in this film is excellent but with a few exceptions. Eddie Redmayne was still excellent as Newt but I think he did a better job in the first film. Same thing with Dan Fogler who didn't seem as funny but useless and could have just been written out of this film. But I did really like Jude Law as a younger Dumbledor and Joshua Shea who plays young Newt. Joshua played younger NEwt so well that he actually looked like a younger version of Eddie. Jude Law brought the same kind of attitude towards Dumbledor that we all know and love. The special effects and set designs still looked marvellous. The creatures special effects just like last time were great and looked like if we saw them in real life that's what they would look like. The sets looked directly like they got taken directly out of a history book. Now with this film being a sequel, you would think they would fix the problems they had in the last film but for this one, they didn't. The main thing that bugged me was Johnny Depp. He didn't do a good job of playing the main villain. It could be because of the writing or just because of his acting. Next is all of the subplots. I counted there are around four of them. But seeing how I couldn't really figure out the main plot one of those subplots could have been the main plot. The last thing is the pacing in this film. Some scenes just seemed like the plot stopped for this one scene that could have just been taken out. The entire film felt really slow and only in the action scenes did it seem to pick up. At least the music was good. In the end, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald just seemed like a cash grab film.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
181,christophershobris,Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindlewald Movie Review,5,21 November 2018,"What a dumb title. I know titles don't mean much other then for marketing and recognizability, but the two have nothing to do with each other. They might as well called it Fantastic Beasts: (insert title here), would have made more sense. Actually now I think of it, the title does represent one thing about this movie...it's a jumbled mess. It's another one of those films that can't just focus on one main storyline. The film has 3 or 4 pointless subplots, resulting in the film having very little to do with Grindlewald, you know, the name that's in the title of the movie? David Ayers as a director is clearly running out of steam. He did a marvelous job with Deathly Hollows Part 2, and did a good job with the first Fantastic Beasts film, that was more focused and actually enjoyable to watch. This was a snoozer, none of the storylines were interesting, too many characters I have no interest in, the few action scenes that occur are short lived, the final ""battle"" is lame, and this film relies heavily on exposition. Talking, talking, talking, and more talking with nothing interesting for me to really get invested. Now understand this, I am not a Potterhead, so maybe I'm missing something here. But I do like the Harry Potter world, I love Deathly Hollows Part 2, and Goblet of Fire, but this is probably the worst of all of the Potter universe films. Now let's talk about the elephant in the room...Johnny Depp as Grindlewald himself. Admittedly, he was the thing I was looking forward to, I was thinking if nothing else, at least Depp can keep me entertained. Well, the problem is...he's barely in it! But when he is on screen I was a bit underwhelmed. He didn't give that electrifying performance like Heath Ledger or even Ralph Fiennes. Not that I'm asking for Depp to outdo them, that's tough, but I felt Johnny Depp was just playing Johnny Depp, in that he had a bit of some Jack Sparrow-isms, almost like Depp played an evil version of Sparrow with different hair and not as comical. Depp was not the best choice for Grindlewald. So, now that I've trashed on this film, what do I like? The visuals are great, the costuming and makeup are well done, but on par with the first film, because all of those things in the first film were well done too. Jude Law as Dumbledore gave the best performance out of all the actors, though he too was underused. And the relationship between Redmayne's and Fogler's characters is pretty good. Other then those things, I would say this film is sadly for me a total skip. I have never given a Harry Potter film a bad review and it's sad to see this happen, but it had to happen at some point. One the flip side, it took 10 films to finally make a bad film, that's not bad. Neither Star Wars or Lord of the Rings can say that. If you are a massive Potterhead and you can understand the underlying stuff, and get into the politics of the film, then you may enjoy it, but for a regular film fan, sorry, I can't recommend it.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

185,andrewmerritt-31652,Where's Grindelwald,5,25 November 2019,"Fantastic Beasts the Crimes of Grindelwald is the second installment in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them series. In this one Newt is given an assignment by Albus Dumbeldore to stop Grindelwald before he kills Credence. It stars Eddie Redmayne, Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Zoe Kravitz. It's also directed by David Yates who has given us the Harry Potter franchise ever since Order of the Phoenix. The biggest question I had after watching this is where was the plot? The first ten minutes hook you in, but after that the plot becomes one big mess as you have no idea where this is going or what's going on. I feel like David Yates was exhausted in making so many Harry Potter movies that after those first ten minutes he tapped out and had a random crew member take over for him to direct the first half. And after that another person came in to direct the middle, and David Yates directed the last half. I love the Harry Potter universe and I liked the first Fantastic Beasts, so you expect the sequel to better and stronger than the first one, but it was the weakest one of the Harry Potter movies. It cracked under pressure as it shoved Easter egg after Easter egg from previous Harry Potter movies so we could remember certain events, but they tried way too hard. Everything about this was forced as nobody could decide whether to give fans what they want or have the studio tell them that it should be done like this. And when I watch this this proves that nobody was on board and the actors looked bored or confused as what they were doing. I will say that Jude Law, Johnny Depp, and Eddie Redmayne give good performances with what they were given, but it didn't work out in the end.

Never read any of the books either.. not into hypes at all. I'm also not that impressed by the GOT craze. Those fantasy serials (books/films/series)
are big cash-cows for the studios. A lot of imagination, but story wise they're not that original. Most of the stories have been told in one way or another (I don't care to explain, but I guess people who read this will understand anyways).
Also, didn't like Radcliffe & Watson (the ginger was my fav) the CGI sucked most of the time (referring to Harry Potter).Where HP fails, FB succeeds. A more stylish make-up. Seems more grown-up.
And COG was genuinely funnier than all HP movies combined.
Better CGI. Story's not that exceptional either, but at least better-looking.
There are certainly more babes in this: Zoe Kravitz, Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol, Carmen Ejogo and the French girl, are only a couple.I give it a 7.4/10 so I can round it down to 7, because it's still nowhere near an 8 or a 9.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Quite likely. Secondly, there's plenty of critters.Additionally, I found the acting both compelling and personable from all parts. The production is top-notch as have been all the Potter-verse movies.Where the movie bogs down a bit is in the section providing historical background on one of the primary characters. It seems about five times as long as necessary and really puts the anchor out. It could have been done in thirty seconds and everyone would've gone ""Aha!"" and been out of the theater a lot earlier and more satisfied overall.I don't know why they went into such depth or took so much time on that but a less long-winded cut of this movie is in order. Really, not every movie has to be over two hours long.Regardless, if you didn't see it in the theater, grab the disc and FF past the scenes I'm talking about. You'll know them when you start to get bored.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
189,WooderIce64,"Magical, but Could be More",7,15 April 2019,"Crimes of Grindelwald is a movie that some may call unnecessarily complicated. It continues with Newt Scamander, Tina, Queenie, and Jacob, and introduces new characters and plotlines, brings back some old favorites, and delves deeper into Grindelwald as the main villain for this series. It also goes into much darker territory, giving us a historical parallel with the events leading up to World War II and a villain that's clearly supposed to resemble the fascist dictators of the 1930s. It's quite a lot to take in in 2 hours and 13 minutes. And oddly enough, it feels too short. Or perhaps unfocused is a better word. There are too many characters, too many plotlines for that amount of time. Now, it's impossible to discuss this movie without the spoilers, so be warned.Some things in this movie don't get as much screen time as they deserved. For instance, Queenie siding with Grindelwald is important, and while her motivations make sense, she does it way too quickly. She doesn't show any sign of being conflicted, she just gets up and goes with him. There's a great character arc in there, the movie just doesn't give it the time it needs to develop properly. If this were a book first, it would've been great. The whole love triangle with Leta and the Scamander brothers was unnecessary. But then again, the amount of relationship drama in Harry Potter is also unnecessary. The whole thing with Leta was interesting, but led to absolutely nothing, and she's dead. Why is she even in this? Also, having her last name be ""Lestrange"" for fans would imply a connection to Bellatrix. Turns out that's a red herring. As for the Dumbledore twist... I have no idea. I'll wait for Fantastic Beasts 3 before passing judgement.Some other things people complain about are how dark it is and the canon breaking issues. With how dark it is, it is at some points excessive. The World War II scene was necessary. From the perspective of someone listening to Grindelwald, it makes him seem like a much better option now. The apartment scene, where Grindelwald and the gang kill all the muggles in it, men, women, and children, is definitely excessive. At that point in the movie, we get how evil he is. With the canon-breaking issues, nothing too egregious happens. Plus, the Harry Potter series itself has many of the same problems, like how the time turner isn't used after Prisoner of Azkaban. The rules of magic bend to the demands of the plot. But that's part of having such a wide array of spells. Not even J.R.R Tolkien could keep the continuity on them (although if anyone could, it would be him)The movie introduces or expands on a whole slew of new characters, most notably Gellert Grindelwald, the villain, who had a minor role in the first film. Johnny Depp did a spectacular job as Grindelwald. Say what you will about Depp as a person, but he is a very good actor, and it shows here. Grindelwald is charismatic, intimidating, and clearly completely evil. And with the speech scene, he shows why people would be convinced to follow him. He's a great villain. Jude Law plays young Dumbledore, which he does a very good job at, but he's mostly a minor supporting role. Since he's Dumbledore, it captures everyone's attention. And even though he looks nothing like Richard Harris or Michael Gambon, Law nails the role down. He feels exactly like young Dumbledore. Zoe Kravitz gets more time as Leta in this movie. She portrays this character well, but as stated earlier, she's a waste of potential. She either should have lived or not have been in this at all. Nagini is in this too. Why that was necessary, I don't know. We'll see. With the returning characters, we have Newt and his beasts, which mostly just distracts from the main plot, but is still enjoyable to watch, and the beasts look great. Eddie Redmayne gives a good performance. Tina and Jacob didn't change at all. They're no different than in Fantastic Beasts 1.What this movie succeeds in is that it's never boring. There may be plotlines everywhere, but it never gets dull. Much like the first, it explores aspects of the grown-up Wizarding World, showing us Paris in the late 1920s. The environments, with the circus and the French Ministry of Magic are, well, fantastic. That, and I have a thing for Paris. The return to Hogwarts, as short as it was, was great. Seeing the castle and hearing the music just made me happy. Another thing worth noting is that this movie has some great action. The Wizarding World, compared to other movie franchises, isn't very action-packed. This movie has some great scenes, like Grindelwald's escape and the battle at Pere Lechaise.Is this movie as terrible as the majority of YouTube seems to think? No. Could it have been much better? Yes. This could've been legendary. This could've been one of the all-time great fantasy movies. But there's still time. What needs to be done with this franchise is that they need to make it into either a movie about Newt and his fantastic beasts, or a proper Harry Potter prequel series centered on Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Either one would be fine.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
190,MsMovie,"This is one for the true HP fan - tons of details, tons of subplots!",10,17 November 2018,"I will agree with many people who have said they had trouble following all the subplots because if you're not a fan of the books, which had tons of words in them that never made it onto screen, then you might not enjoy this one as much as the first movie.Having said all that, we really loved it and I wanted to put this out there now: Nagini and Credence have a kid and that's who Tom Riddle is, and that is why Dumbledore rescued him from the orphanage. (It also is why Tom could talk to snakes, and Harry could too, and is why he was so close to Nagini - anyone else feel this could be how these two connect?)OK, it's out there, this is where my mind went during the movie.I do think there was not enough of Newt Scamander in the movie - that would be a gripe (and not enough beasts perhaps too).My biggest gripe is how DARK the movie was, and I do NOT mean ""sinister"", I literally mean it was murky, hard to see, needed more lighting.If you read these comments and have anything to do with the movie, PLEASE brighten it up a little for the next movies - I'd like to be able to see some details!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
191,kevinmorice,It really is damaging the originals,4,11 January 2019,A series very much suffering from the idea of trying to do a prequel set while being forced by the studios to crank up the special effects every time. This results in more and more powerful magic decades earlier. Any one of these super-powered wizards would have completely overwhelmed everyone we see in the entire 8 film original set. Including several of them who are still present in the originals but who seem to be 90% less powerful by the time Voldemort shows up.Every time they break the rules for their own universe it just damages the validity of that universe for the original set.,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

J. K. Rowling' writing might be the main problem, because of the freedom that the studio are giving her and also making the story very inconsistent.

193,ElliesWonder,Theater review,6,23 December 2018,"Theater review: if you like CGI works, you have to go to the big screen! The beginning was so eye catching and hold my breath. (Although I wasn't able to remember the prison escapee Grindelwald was the one who got caught from the first movie.) To be honest, the plots are kinda messy for anyone who is not a novel fan of JK Rowling, even I watched the whole series movies of Harry Potters and Fantastic Beast 1, and I still have troubles to figure out the storyline. Enter Fantastic Beast 2, the confusion built up more by unable to catch the characters' moves and the plot developments, I confused, I doubt myself: did I skip any plots or dialogues? But I did not, the movie has so many store-lines to tell, it breaks down into so many different pieces for different characters, made it uncomplete as an individual movie. The novels might have a largescale with many epic stories. But a 2 hours movie can never tell all of them; Audiences can't tell which is primary because the karma was made up with so many causes and effects. Fantastic Beast 2 is a fans mobie, a super long extended trailer, a novel image supplement that built with amazing CGI, however and anyway, this is not an individual movie that tells a complete story.Lastly, the movie only tells a little about Newt and his beasts, wasn't the novel name Fantastic Beast and it should focus on Newt and his beasts?",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

197,Mike_O_Dwyer,An awful lot of not very much,4,19 March 2019,"The best thing that can be said about this is that it looks very pretty in a way that most CGI heavy films don't. Unfortunately that's as good as it gets, because everything else is unnecessarily convoluted and a rather dull mess of a thing.While the first film had no small amount of charm and good humour, The Crimes of Grindelwald barely rouse a smile, let alone generate one good laugh or even a half-hearted thrill. There's not enough of any one person to root for, and too much of everyone to make sense of what's happening or why. More than once I found myself asking why something is happening, or thinking I'd missed a scene because there was little connection between one bit and the next.Performances are okay. They hum along without making anything stick in the memory, which is a pity. Depp feels particularly reigned in from his usual OTTness, which feels like a lost opportunity to create some spark of enjoyment.

I'm glad he's been replaced.But I fear it wasn't Depp's personal choices as an actor but the executive direction that made Grindelwald's portrayal so bad.

200,StregaAsuka,The book that we never read,7,21 November 2018,"So, here we have the latest Harry Potter... er... Fantastic Beasts installment, which takes place only a few months after the previous movie, but it seems like the previous movie happens in a different universe, with a different style, and not so Harry Potterish as this one (so, we loved it!).This movie feels like watching the book that J.K.Rowling never wrote and that we never had the change to read!! A book with a more than two hours length, where our brains simply explode with all the new information we are presented and all the new characters and new relationships that we didn't know! Firstly, there are the characters from the previous movie, that serve as a connection to this one. Secondly, new characters whose names and occupation is harder to follow than if they lived in Westeros! Finally, is it necessary all those Harry Potter characters references? Really?What made the first movie special were the characters that weren't directly related with the Harry Potter books, or at least not that obviously! In here, they want to give the fans so many Harry Potter Easter Eggs, that the whole movie is an Easter Egg itself. Where is the plot!? More than two hours to explain that Grindelwald is gathering followers and tha Dumbledore can't kill him himself (that is, until the end of the movie). Why so much ""interest in revealing who Credence is? Hopefully, we will get our answer in one of the next three upcoming movies! Plus, let's not forget! Thanks to our lovely Hermione in a deleted scene from Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, we already know that Dumbledore will indeed kill Grindelwald in 1945. As an extra, Why tilting the movie ""the Crimes of Grindelwald if we see none of them?Two hours that could have been better spent if they made the movie different. It's not that bad, but it felt really long, slow and not moving forward at all with the main story. The actors are pretty good in playing their characters, and we get even some fantastic beasts moments, which personally are the best part of the movie, as they keep on with the spirit of the previous film. But let's not forget: they only appears to justify the presence of Newt Scamander and his friends on-screen, who by the way, will continue to appears in the following three movies.Potterheads will probably don't like the movie much because of too many Harry Potter references and the lack of plot. On the other hand, non-Potterheads may be entertained. Anyhow, prepare your wallets with all the new merchandising that is coming out! (Did you notice that Hogwarts students cloak are different?). And please, pet your dog or cat!BONUS - Question arised while watching the movie as a Potterhead:-Why create the characters if Leta Lestrange and give her so much mystery in the previous movie, only to kill her here?
-Why show Hogwarts at all? So you can use new cloaks designs, so we go buying them?
-Are you showing how Gryffindors are mean to a Slytherin, for a specific reason? Before #Mudblood came #SnobWitch.
-Why in the DADA lesson against the boggart are we seeing students from the fours houses? Shouldn't it be only two houses together?
-Why is Dumbledore teaching DADA instead of Transfiguration?
It's 1927. And McGonagall was born in 1935. Why does she appear in the movie at all!!?
-Aurelius Dumbledore. Albus is 45, and according theories his brother should be 27. why does he looks like he is 18 years old then?
-Nagini a person? Was she already a permanent snake when Voldemort met her? Die he speak with her using parseltongue to know that she is a person? Didn't Harry met and freed her at the London Zoo?
-One Lestrange dead. How about the others? Because obviously Rabastian and Rodolphus have parents at some point and Bellatrix in-laws.
-Why they don't explain which crimes has Grindelwald specifically committed?
-Nicolas Flammel and the philosopher's stone are in Paris. Necessary Easter Egg?
-Because of the last place that Grindelwald ans his fellows are, are they going to show some nazis in the next movies?
-Why don't show us the truth? There was no blood pact, there was a thing called love. Way to miss an opportunity!!

201,e-m-hobo,The main themes felt largely understated...,6,28 September 2020,"Once again, I'll shy away from creative vernacular to convey obscene language, since it tends to get cut out of my reviews.Watching this movie, the notion that they didn't really know what it was they were looking for was worked into the story in such a way that it obscured the main plot and the subplots of the movie. I feel the movie could have been way better if the personal stories of love, longing, and either finding or losing each other would have been handled more explicitly, rather than being brushed upon.The fact that they didn't really know what they were looking for even though they figured they did, as well as the theme of Newt protecting Credence Barebone, should have been brought out more also.All of the ingredients are in the mix when you watch the movie, but they simply forgot to stir.

The acting did a good job although the script doesn't allow for anyone to standout apart from Johnny Depp, who seems to make audiences aware of the fact that he's Johnny Depp every once in a while.

There's very little character development and the frenetic cutting from scene to scene gives you no time to make sense of what you are seeing nor even catch your breath. If you want to know who the main characters are or why they act the way that they do, better start studying the voluminous online documentation because there's precious little discussion in the movie to catch you up. The first Fantastic Beasts movie was far more muggle friendly. (Muggles are non-magical people largely unaware of the Potter universe.)

It's like getting invited to a four course dinner, being handed a Snickers and spend the rest of the night eating tasteless crackers. Some people are praising the CGI, but i won't even do that. Sure, the environments are pretty, but the beasts are typically ""floaty"" and ""weightless"" and even simple things like smoke looks like cotton candy. No. This wasn't even a movie.

214,rustonreviews,"Bloated and ultimately unnecessary, this second installment feels more like an extended prologue for third film.",4,24 November 2018,"J.K Rowling and David Yates return as writer/director duo for the second instalment (of a planned five) in the Fantastic Beasts franchise. I was unimpressed with the first film of the series; it was a distractingly inconsistent film in terms of tone, and any semblance of a focused storyline appeared to be lost underneath the plethora of distracting CGI and bland characters. With The Crimes of Grindelwald, I was hoping the series would pick itself up, dust off its previous shortcomings and present us with a more consistent film. Magizoologist Newt Scamander (Redmayne) is recruited by Dumbledore (Jude Law) in order to prevent Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) from achieving his dastardly schemes after he escapes from his prison cell at the Magical Congress of the United States of America.It pains me to write this. It really does, because I greatly admire Rowling's colossal imagination and storytelling capabilities she displayed so effortlessly in her Harry Potter books. The Crimes of Grindelwald is a bloated, convoluted mess of a film. Rowling's screenplay feels unfocused; there are too many subplots threaded within the central storyline, and it's at times difficult to follow. Too much time is spent with characters spouting endless amounts of exposition, and character development is practically non-existent. The plot drags, and worst of all it just isn't interesting. Grindelwald is more or less absent for the majority of the film, as is Dumbledore himself. This is a terrible shame, because their backstory is the most interesting (not to mention essential) part of the story, but it's shamefully pushed to the side so we can sigh our way through meaningless couples' quarrels and dull, bleak moments with characters who should be a lot more interesting than they really are. Credence (Ezra Miller) is stunningly bland, and it's frustrating that a significant chunk of the film is centered around his character as he strives to discover who he really is. When it boils down to it, Credence is just dead weight. Instead, the story of Grindelwald and Dumbledore should have been the film's primary focus because sadly, Newt and his gang of dull duds just aren't strong enough to carry the film on their own.Redmayne does his best with what he's given, but Newt isn't exactly the most remarkable of leads. Tina (Waterson) and Jacob (Fogler) return to the fold, but their return feels more obligatory than necessary. Johnny Depp is serviceable as Grindelwald and Jude Law is quite exceptional as a young Dumbledore, but due to the weak script, just about everybody else looks bored to be there. Even Nagini (Claudia Kim) is wasted, and serves no purpose being in the film whatsoever. What's missing from the film is the sense of wonder; there is little action or spellbinding moments to remember, and the finale is nothing short of unspectacular. After trudging through two hours of general plodding and drawn out filler, the ending goes for an emotional wallop that sets the stage for the third film, but by that point I had lost interest entirely. For me, I don't have an emotional attachment to these characters, and the writing certainly hasn't warranted such investment from me at this stage.The Crimes of Grindelwald feels more like an extended prologue for the third instalment in the franchise rather than a genuine movie in its own right. Rowling shows she still has a fierce imagination and knack for creating, but the main sin here is that there is perhaps too much going on that the plot becomes lost in a convoluted, unfocused maze of storylines that never tie together in a satisfying way. The ingredients are there, and I believe there is a genuinely brilliant movie buried somewhere underneath it all. Sadly, the magic feels well and truly lost.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

All of the Potter books and movies with perhaps the exception of HP7 pt 1, had a great element of fun to them. This movie had none. It took a great deal for granted in that one movie had made us grow attached to these characters, when in fact HP movies gave us several stories to grow with. Even the creatures weren't that magical. One of the biggest disappointments was Jude Law as Dumbledore. He brought no personality to the character whatsoever. Literally Dumbledore in name only. Johnny Depp had a great deal of fun playing Grindlewald, but there were no onscreen characters for him to play against, so it just ended up being one big monologue. HP had the Voldemort story build slowly over 8 films. I thought when the expanded this trilogy to 5, we would get the same, but the whole point of this movie seems to be to set up future stories. The only real point is to get individuals to line up on one side or the other, and literally once that is done, the movie ends.

Any J.K.Rowling fan would love to see more magic, better characters, exciting story, some humor to lighten the darkness of the events, and of course more beasts.Unfortunately most of those are absent here, the plot is really foggy, there is no real movers for the events, there are a lot of coincidences, a lot of unjustified actions, and a lot of unexplained reactions.You will get the feeling that they arranged all the events in order to reach to the final surprising scene, but what's the point of reaching the top of the mountain while the journey is not enjoyable ?!There are more characters and we get to know more about the background of them, just enough to run the movie but most of them are dark and unnecessary.The chemistry which was between""Jacob"" and ""Queenie"" is absent here, and this led to lack of humor and funny situations, so you will stay most of the time lost in the dilemma without a single smile on your face.The magic and beasts are the best part in the movie, although they are not the best in the series.You will have some nostalgic moments for watching some scenes of Hogwarts school.They tried to make something new by showing the evil parties as blue, and the good parties as red while they fight, but it wasn't really genuine and it looked like toothpaste commercial.Finally, it's an average drama fantasy movie, it runs in a very slow rhythm most of the time, it can be boring if you are not excited enough to watch it till the end before entering the theatre, as you will absolutely lose the excitement gradually while watching it.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
218,heatsink98,Plot in a blender,4,14 July 2019,"Unfortunately, this second outing with Newt Scamander heads farther downhill than the first film traveled. The plot is so nonsensical that the movie plays out like five script revisions were tossed down the stairs, piled back together, and then handed out for shooting to begin. The script also suffers from the disparate themes of fantastic beasts and Grindelwald's antics being held together by duct tape to form one story. There's a plot buried in this mess, but it needed a story editor to clean it up first before making the movie.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
219,HollisWoods,"Not that bad, it's just a beginning. The beast comes from within.",8,16 November 2018,"While Fantastic Beasts and where to find them was a celebration of the wizarding world, Crimes of Grindlewald was the true beginning of the huge story JK Rowling wants to share. Overall I loved it. It was intense and dark. There were as many magical scenes as there were expositional scenes. Though it had flaws, as every movie does.
Rowling said that she had so much she wanted to share with us, so the series will have 5 movies instead of 3. This fact was the one disadvantage to this movie. So much was thrown at us, I couldn't breath. It was an overload of information, which is great for a Potter fan like me, but it was still a lot to handle. This did feel like a set up movie, but I think that was the point. This is the beginning of Grindlewald's regime, there are 3 more movies to go, and I feel that the haters are forgetting that, I'm giving the series the benefit of the doubt. I did hate Queenie's story, I think we don't know her enough to understand her decision. And Credence being a Dumbledore I think is just a facade that give him the will to do what Grindlewald wants him to do. Jacob was a little underused, but I guess that was expected. And Leta wasn't as great as I thought she would be.
Those were my criticisms, so now I'm gonna point out the best parts:
1. Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamandar. I knew from the opening scene of the 1st film that he was the best choice and I am absolutely in love with both the actor and character. Even if everything else is done wrong, I think Newt will always be what's done right. Even critics have to admit it. He's a beautiful character, and I can't get enough of him <3
2. Johnny Depp as Gellart Grindlewald. Say what you want about Johnny, but he played this villain perfectly. He was creepy af and his speech at the end had me breathless.
3. Newt & Tina are my new otp. My favorite scene was the records scene where they almost confessed love. We know they get married at some point, but it's just adorable seeing these to characters interact. My heart can't take it.
4. Magic. The ending scene in the graveyard where Flammel takes charge left me speechless, it was so beautiful and epic. It was almost better than Dumbledore vs Voldy from OoftP. And Newt is an amazing wizard, from his briefcase, to basement, to the scene with gold sparkles trying to find Tina. His magic ability is what this universe is about.
5. The true message that the Fantastic Beasts that this film focuses on is the beast within humanity. How humans can be animals amongst ourselves and be vicious and cruel. We are the destructive race.
I hope when you see it, you won't be too critical. I honestly think this movie will be the most forgettable of the 5 when it's over, but this movie is so promising and it left me wanting more. Hang in there fans.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

223,Abranth-d,Cashbrab,5,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of Harry Pott... I mean ""Fantastic beasts : the crimes of Grindelwald "" first of all the title is just absolutely misleading there aren't much beasts in this movie unlike the prequel and no series of crimes committed by Grindelwald , In fact his screen time is very less in the movie . That being said Johnny depp was great as Grindelwald and Jude law was amazing as Dumbledore. The rest of the cast weren't bad but they weren't great either like I wouldn't care less if any of em died. The story is like this giant spider web and has a lot of subplots, sure you can keep up with them but they're just so messy. The movie survives using a lot of Easter eggs and foreshadowing from the Harry Potter movies , this coming from jk Rowling who also wrote this movie. There are a lot of things which are mostly into franchise building like that fat dude from the prequel , this guy has his memory intact cause the "" obliviate "" spell didn't work apparently and now he's in this. This movie forces the chemistry between characters which simply doesn't work at all. The reason why the HP movies worked was because they were confined to a school which meant magic had restrictions instead of people just "" apparating "" and there were 7 movies to develop the characters and this just feels very rushed. Remember how I said the story is like a giant spider web earlier ? Well ironically this movie is a lot like the amazing Spiderman 2 it is more of a set - up for the third movie, which I'm really looking forward to cause there is a lot , like a LOT in this movie and those things might be good when deciphered in the third movie. In the end , Crimes of Grindelwald is again a book turned movie and the chances of it working were a Gamble and they're doing pretty well and that's only cause of the Harry Potter fandom and if you're a part of it you might even enjoy this movie and geek about things before the third movie comes out.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
224,rachelgallit,"Less than Stellar, Enjoyable Nonetheless",6,19 November 2018,"To keep it simple, this movie was a disappointment. As a Harry Potter Universe movie, it was ultimately lacking in the magic and whimsy I have come to expect. As a movie in an isolated experience, it was rather enjoyable! Visually, the movie had the high-quality special effects one expects from such a high budget Universal Studios movie. The audio was crisp and clear to understand, which is always a feat when dealing with a myriad of different European accents and loud music. The music was fantastically integrated and distracted from any less than stellar emotional moments by popping up lackluster moments with an emotionally pleasing soundtrack. Magic is an intangible concept, so the solid sound effects of explosions and spell casting solidified the abstract. The use of Shepard-Risset Glissando in moments of intense emotion or tension enhanced the sense of immersion.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
225,Lost_In_Translation_,"Mixed bag of Rowling's magic, too many characters and sub-plots",6,18 November 2018,"When the first Fantastic Beasts came out I was one of the few people who I know who loved it. Sure, the plot was kind of thin, but it was the lovable characters who brought it to life. It had a slow whimsical magic to it that felt right at home with the HP saga. But not everyone wants a slow magical movie, so the Grindelwald saga needed to be attached to this and this movie is it's true stepping off point.This one leaves off 1 year after the previous movie with Newt banned from traveling, Tina off in France hunting Credence, Queenie and Jacob back together with some complications. The start is really strong and you are ready for another 2 hour adventure with the gang from the first movie, but then they introduce 8 more characters and their stories. There's Leta and Newt's brother pursuing the dark wizard, the ministry vs Dumbledore (again), Credence and his new friend Nagini trying to find his mother, Grindelwald starting his revolution, and a mystery man who Tina meets. This movie has no less than 5 plots going on at once.Infinity War this year showed that a movie like that with 4 different groups of characters can work if paced and written well. Crimes just has too much going on for what should be a simple story. You'd think that the lead characters of Newt and Tina would be one of the focuses of the movie, but with the 4 other stories going on they feel relegated to tertiary characters.That said, there is still bits of that same magic that made the first good. Jude Law as a younger Dumbledore is spot on casting, you can see bits of him becoming a future Michael Gambon. It's sad he gets so little screen time with them having 4 other stories going on. The original characters are still good, but there's just so little of them. There are some fun moments with Newt's beasts, the nifflers are back as well new ones like the Kappa.Overall it's not a bad movie, it just got a little too much going on to be a great one. With 3 more planned movies, I'm kind of hoping that JK lets someone else take over the screenwriting duties with her making the story and giving input. She is a great novel writer, but a so-so screenwriter. The next movie just needs to focus itself a bit better and it will be a much more complete package. The magic is still there, it just needs some refinement to be truly great again.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

I didn't like so much the first Fantastic Beasts, in my opinion lost part of the typical magic that we were used to see during the original movies. So my expectations were quite low about this sequel.The Crimes of Grindelwald is a nice movie but hasn't the typical and magical vibe that every Harry Potter's fan wants. The first half of this sequel is more of the same that we've seen in the previous installment, however gets better during the second half, when we visit Hogwarts again. Then we feel we don't need a world trip to catch a dangerous wizard or a lot of complex and adult characters, we just need a simple story about magic, love and friendship able to make us smile and wish to live in that wizard world.Fantastic Beasts 2 has a bit more magic than its precedent film, however looks more like a blockbuster made for the Marvel/DC generation than to everybody that grew up watching the Harry Potter's movies.
I liked the scenes in Hogwarts, some twists, the third act and some cameos. Jude Law is a great actor but he doesn't look like Albus Dumbledore, he hasn't the long beard, the long tunics/jackets and even his personality seems to be a little different than the Dumbledore we met in the original franchise.Fantastic Beasts 2 is not bad, is a good blockbuster for a new generation, my generation had seen better stories.Rating: 7/10",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Whatever storyline is there is rambling and disjointed.From the CGI special effects almost at the very beginning of the movie, you can tell that Warner Bros. had given the director an unlimited CGI budget and told him to go for it. Younger viewers who like lots of CGI will probably like the movie, but anyone who actually wants a story should avoid it like the plague.After 7 HP movies and the first Fantastic Beasts movie, I'm done with the Wizarding World of J.K.

Yes, this movie IS much darker than the first but why does that mean it's bad? It's not gory- just not as much goofs/messing around/happy music.

The niffler stole the spotlight everytime it came on screen while there were also a few new amazing beasts. Although most of the focus was on Grindelwald the audience had a fair share of beasts on screen.The on screen romances were a little forced but they didn't linger on it too long. I expected more from Nagini but maybe this movie is not for her and the next night be. Did not like Zoe's character arc and either a lot of wasted potential on a few other characters or just left open for the next 3 movies to come.The young and charismatic Dumbledore played by Jude Law was my favourite and he added so much more depth to the character while staying true to the Dumbledore portrayed in Harry Potter .A healthy dose of magical spells and a dash of misunderstood beasts kept me hooked to this incredible little universe that I'll re-live in my imagination forever.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

As everything else about it is really enjoyable. At this point if you're watching these not being a fan of Harry Potter I don't know how you're going to enjoy this movie. One of my problems with the first one was not really knowing where Rowling was going with all of this, but here, there's some nice foreshadowing. I'm genuinely interested in seeing where it all goes. I love all the performances, Jude Law is perfect as Dumbledore. I surprisingly really liked Johnny Depp as Grindelwald too. He was the perfect contrast to Voldemort for his more subtle agendas and manipulative personality. This is also one of the most visually stunning HP movies. Great special effects, production design, and shots. Also heard some pretty music in there as well. Which is refreshing as it seems to get shoved in the background in most blockbuster movies these days. Despite some excessive plotting and questionable cannon breaking, I think fans should really embrace this movie and just trust her with where it goes.

247,sashamyshkina,Major disappointment after the first one.,5,30 October 2020,"I love the first Fantastic Beasts movie. It defined my childhood, and to this day, it remains one of my favourite comfort movies. And despite its flaws, I enjoy it to this day. My pre-teenage self was looking forward to this coming out for the best part of a year. This was just.... a disappointment.Please note this also has spoilers for the first film.Now, when this first came out two years ago and I watched it in the cinema, I hated it. I decided to give it another go thinking I was maybe blinded by my ridiculously high expectations back in 2018 following my love of the first one. I was sorely mistaken.First of all, there is absolutely no plot. The whole film is just a massive info-dump. There were half a dozen poorly-explained plot lines which made no sense and just confused you. About half of said plot lines were completely unnecessary (for example, the Nagini-is-a-maledictus thing. Sure, it's an interesting Harry Potter canon fact, but what did it add to the story? Claudia Kim had three lines). As opposed to the first film, where the story was very much about Newt and his creatures, here you didn't even know whose story it was. Despite being the movie's literal namesake, there was very little about Newt and the beasts themselves, with his story being used as a Trojan horse of sorts to tell the story of Grindelwald... or is it Dumbledore's story? Or, wait, is it about Credence? I genuinely had no idea.Also, I know that both the Harry Potter books and the movies get consequently darker as the story goes on, which I'm fine with because it's done pretty gradually. And I was probably expecting the same to happen with the Fantastic Beasts movies as the story built up to the climax. But the jump between this and the first movie is so sudden and jarring... The first movie had an undeniably light-hearted feel whilst still incorporating some intense action scenes. This was completely the opposite. The entire thing was so dark and completely opposite in feel from the first one, which really prevented me from enjoying it. I mean, I don't mind some darkness, but here the jump was so abrupt and this kind of stuff would probably be the kind of thing I would expect to see in maybe the third or fourth movie.Also, the character development in this... I feel like there is so much focus on plot exposition and info-dumping, plus combined withe sheer volume of new characters, that there is literally no room for any character arcs whatsoever. I mean, in the first film, you have some very nice character development: Newt opens up to Tina, Queenie and Jacob, Queenie matures and has to let Jacob go, Jacob is introduced to the magical world. Here, none of the characters' actions have any progression or reason: for example, what is the reasoning behind Queenie joining Grindelwald? That is literally not justified at any point during the entire film.I've read about there being an extended cut of this film that has an additional 14 minutes of scenes which apparently solves most of the issues I mentioned before by introducing some of the plot threads more gradually and earlier on (e.g. Leta attending a party where there are literally whispers going around about her brother being alive). However, I have not seen that and I sincerely doubt that it can fix this movie.I must say, I'm very aware of the fact that this is going to be a five-part series, and this could just be one of those filler movies that every series has *cough* Order of the Phoenix *cough*, but I honestly don't know.This could have been so good, but it just didn't go there.-Sasha.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

250,josephrygaard,Before Watching: Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018),5,2 September 2019,"""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" (2018) is the second movie in the Fantastic Beasts-franchise and aims to expand a bit more compared to its predecessor. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie asks a lot of its viewers. You need to pay attention to names and connection, which may become a challenge if you're not overly familiar with the Potter-verse. The main quests this movie present are (1) to find out the identity and history of a character, and (2) defeat Grindelwald. Needlessly to say, there are loads of references to people, events and places, which again require attention.Visually and audibly, this movie is in line with its prequel. The monster designs are playful and enjoyable, but they are given less screen time compared to the first movie, and not quite as much as one could have hoped for.The Crimes of Grindelwald is also a very grim and dark movie. There are a lot of on-screen deaths and some off-screen deaths that can be very unsettling and disturbing. Sensitive watchers should be warned.Finally, the characters in The Crimes of Grindelwald is not quite as interesting as in its prequel. Character arches are almost non-existent, and some choices made can feel extremely unmotivated and alienating.

I wouldn't call it filler but I would call it backstory. It plays out like the real story is later on. Newt, the main character is good, and interesting enough but overall, I started to get lost by the end of it and sleepy. If you're a potter head who just loves being in this space, this one's for you. Some in the audience were laughing their heads off like they were seeing something I wasn't.

This Fantastic Beasts sequel was just thrown together to appease Harry Potter fans. The slight tie ins to the original books were more like slaps in the face to true fans. There were so many random subplots that could have been interesting if it didn't make the story feel rushed. We get it, Grindelwald is a fascist and Dumbledore is a bad guy who uses everybody.

258,terrellrobinson71,"""Fantastic Beasts"", a darker and hair-raising, but very busy sequel of extraordinary depth, imagination and powerful secrets.",10,16 November 2018,"""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" is a movie that left me breathless and stunned. Here is a sequel to a prequel that had me entranced from the floating, zoomed-in Warner Bros. logo with the luminous and ominous score courtesy of the great James Newton Howard to its stupendous cliffhanger ending that had me excited for the next adventure. There are a couple of movies like that this year that had left me with a glowing smile on my face, this one is certainly it. It's very hard to explain the plot(s) without ruining the secrets for your experience. But let me elaborate as much as I can about it. As we know from the first film, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", a dark force was terrorizing the Wizarding World. We finally get to meet him in the flesh. That dark force is none other than the notorious Dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald (played to menacing perfection by Johnny Depp). The movie begins with a captivating chase on a magical coach (with thestrals, to be exact) that turns into Grindelwald's escape. Meanwhile, Newt Scamander (the charming Eddie Redmayne), the magizoologist, has been called upon on a very secret mission by Albus Dumbledore (the wonderful Jude Law) that also leads to what the other characters want as the story progresses. That would be the young boy Credence (Ezra Miller), who not only is finding his own identity, but is also the uncontrollable force known as the Obscurial. As Grindelwald starts to gather more followers for his preparation to rule over the Wizarding World and the No-Maj world, each of the characters including the Goldstein sisters, Tina (the delightful Katherine Waterson) and Queenie (Alison Sudol, a genuine heartbreaking presence), No-Maj Jacob (Dan Fogler), the Maledictus known as Nagini (Claudia Kim), Newt's schoolmate, Leta Lestange (the amazing Zoe Kravitz) and Newt's Auror brother, Theseus (the intimidatingly remarkable Callum Turner) will make their choices and decisions that will lead them to more unexpected territory than they (and we) never imagined. As a 17-year fan of J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World, it's amazing to see what J.K. Rowling as a screenwriter can come up with next. There are clues and secrets and twists and turns that will tie in to the ""Harry Potter"" universe. (Believe me, my face lit up like Christmas lights on a tree when I saw Hogwarts again.) But what's important about this film, beautifully directed by David Yates with awesome cinematography courtesy of Philippe Rousselot, is that it's a movie of extraordinary depth, imagination, and secrets that you have to see for yourself. Some critics has said that this movie has too many characters and too many plots running around the place. I consider this to be folly, for this is a crowded movie, a magically entertainingly crowded movie about the characters that we always loved going on more darker and different directions than before and the events that they follow will lead them to what they will become as the stories continue. This is a magical movie. It's darker than the first, but still has its sense of magic and humor and its love for the choice-making characters (good and bad) and the production design by Potter vet Stuart Craig are remarkable, followed by the sensational costumes by Colleen Atwood. It's tough for a sequel to pull you in again without repeating the formula that made it so successful. What J.K. Rowling and David Yates has done with the ""Fantastic Beasts"" films is that it blends and grows into something more grounded but captivating us with its own magical appeal. The first film was the set-up, this one continues the set-up, but adds some pay-offs into the mix. It's definitely worth your time and effort to see this can't-miss experience and keep some of those secrets to yourself.

Wonder about some future things until the next one comes. Grindelwald is played awesomely by Johnny Depp. Who downvote this movie? People who hate Jonny Depp?

264,LBarlane24,Surpasses its predecessor,9,11 April 2020,"Once again directed by David Yates, The Crimes of Grindlewald is the direct sequel to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them. Eddie Redmayne returns as New Scamander, as does Katherine Waterston as Tina Goldstein, Dan Foglar as Jacob Kowalski, Alison Sudol as Queenie, and Ezra Millar as Credence Barebone. Johnny Depp (my #1 favorite actor of all time) reprises his role from the previous film as the titular character, along with new faces including Zoe Kravitz as Leta Lestrange, Claudia Kim as Nagini, Callum Turner as Newt's brother, Theseus, and Jude Law as a young Albus Dumbledore.First thing's first, did I like this film? The short answer is hell yes! Why you might ask? Well let me start by saying it actually has a coherent narrative, unlike the previous film. It also has character development, and I mean ACTUAL development. Many reviewers have said otherwise, but I'll get to that in a little bit. Reviewers have also said that this film has no plot, but I highly beg to differ; again, I will get to that in a little bit.First, I should talk about the direction. Yeah, one of my biggest gripes with the previous film was, ironically enough, the direction. That is definitely not the case with this film though, as everything about said direction is more than spot on, including the cinematography and, of course, the CGI.I've also seen countless reviews calling the film as a whole BORING. And honestly, that baffles me to no end. I mean, seriously, what was so boring about the whole thing? Was it because it had too much dialogue? I mean, that's understandable. But let's not kid ourselves and ignore the fact the previous film was littered with cheap exposition. There have also been some (if not, many) saying that the characters in which they loved from the first film were ""ruined"" in this one. Um, okay, so giving the characters ARCS is problematic apparently.Last but not least, the film does not a have a plot, or so many have said. To which, I ask, where were all of you during the scenes with Nagini and Credence when they try to find out who he really is? The scene with Newt, Tina, and Leta Lestrange when they fight off those ugly cat-like creatures? Or what about the climax? I guess the mass majority were so bored that those parts must have slipped their minds.All that being said, I have to ask, what did the first movie have that this one doesn't? Why do the critics favor this one less than the first one? Was it because they were misled by the trailer? I'm not entirely sure. But that's the thing, the movie itself is not at fault, it is the fault of the audience and their expectations. Sure, they'll call the film as a whole bad, but they'll say that about any movie that does not live up to their expectations.All in all, The Crimes of Grindelwald is a sequel, not that the first film deserved, but the one that it needed. It one of the most underrated sequels in movie history, I'm definitely looking forward to the third installment, and I'm giving 9.1/10.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

This is the quietest, most-whispered, languid summer blockbuster I've ever seen. I'm all for introspection and longer shots, but that's different than a movie that takes its time to say nothing important. There are a few exciting scenes but they're few and far between. Adding to the problems are a plot that is literally ""titular character = bad,"" and a couple other smaller b-plots that don't really go anywhere nor do they make you want to find out where they're leading.This review is scathing because I wanted this movie to be good. I was rooting for it, especially with the great cast, cinematography, special effects.

What in the first chapter was merely a side quest, here becomes the center of attention, sadly, and makes everything crumble.

273,mvrk,David Yates produces another bomb.,2,16 November 2018,"First of all I don't know why Warner Brothers has made David Yates as the permanent director for all the wizarding world's movies. David Yates is a horrible director. I hated all his four Harry Potter movies and now he's made two horrible Fantastic Beasts movies. The best were Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire. I'm sorry but they were. The problem was that the book readers kept complaining that they left out so much material from the books that WB decided to just use one (bad) director and make sure that he cram everything from the books into the movies.Another thing I don't understand is why they didn't get Micheal Gambon to return and play Dumbledore??? I mean he's a 100 year old wizard right? And in a few years he's going meet young Tom Riddle looking like Micheal Gambon rather than Jude Law. Jude Law doesn't make a good Dumbledore.So this movie is bad, but as a ritual you have to go see it because everyone's going to see it and you don't want to be left out.

279,nandidot,The Spinoff Fans Deserve!,9,14 November 2018,"Now that's how you do a spinoff! In a surprising turn of events, 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' truly lives up to its name. If you recall my review of 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' from a couple of years ago, I asked for more depth and meatier backstories and boy does this film deliver. I appreciate you taking my words to heart, Ms. Rowling. Too cheeky? Ah well, can't blame me for trying.The sequel picks up a few months after the events of the first movie. Newt Scamander is given the difficult task of finding Credence, the mysterious boy from the previous film, before Grindelwald gets his hands on him for his own sinister agenda. We already know Credence is special but how special...only time will tell. I can't reveal more of the plot without going into spoiler zone but trust me there's a whole lot of story and a whole lot at stake. A significantly darker film than its predecessor, this one talks about the beast in all of us. We encounter new and unpredictable faces but the greatest joy is seeing characters we already know come back to life on the big screen.Our beloved Dumbledore. What fun it is to meet a young Albus Dumbledore, all charm and wit, hiding many secrets and only just beginning to scratch at the surface of greatness. Jude Law is spectacular and my one complaint here is that his role is too short. I know there will be more in the movies to come but for now I'm impatient. Johnny Depp's Grindelwald is characteristically evil but there is a depth below the surface here as well. Tidbits of his relationship with Dumbledore are shown to keep the audience intrigued. So much is left to be explored of this fascinating and ultimately tragic bond.The original cast is still spot on. Eddie Redmayne's Newt is just as wacky and sweet as the first film as is Dan Fogler's Jacob. The Goldstein sisters played by Katherine Waterston and Alison Sudol do a fine job. I particularly enjoyed Zoë Kravitz as Leta Lestrange. That surname means a lot in the Potter World and Ms. Kravitz does it justice. There are a lot of characters in this movie and a lot of subplots but they all come together seamlessly. I am in awe yet again.J.K. Rowling has furthered her own world beautifully by digging up the past. Twists and turns are aplenty. Some reveals are delicious and others heartbreaking. It's top-notch writing which I hope stays on course and doesn't mess up the original story we've all been besotted with for years. Once again, David Yates shows off his directing chops with a flourish. The scale is grand, the characters grander, and it's all so magical.I got goosebumps when certain locations and characters were shown. Such is the power of this world.

No honestly the crimes of Grindelwald I didn't really see much of a crime element of it except for a death here and there but nothing to ""bad"" The film starts off with Grindelwald escaping prison which is in the trailer .Newt goes to the ministry of magic to try to get his traveling ban removed so he can travel to America and look for Tina the girl from the first movie but finds out that she is not even in America because her sister Queenie came to see him with Jacob so they have to go Paris and all these events hapoen to lead up to Dumberdore coming into the picture for the events in Harry Potter.

288,Anttell,Grindelwald on the move,6,15 November 2018,"I'm a fan of the Potter-books so I had been keenly anticipating The Crimes of Grindelwald. For me, the first two Potter-films were the ones that caught the atmosphere of the novels the best, and I really appreciate Cuaron's the Prisoner of Azkaban too. After that it was a bit of a downhill with the films, although they all were solid entries. The first film of the Fantastic Beasts -series was a big surprise: Rowling's first movie-screenplay was an original, fun and sweet outing that really took it's time with everything, I felt it was a very novel-like script but at the same time with great understanding of what makes a movie work. But on to the Crimes of Grindelwald...The Fantastic Beasts -series follows Newt Scamander, an expert of magical creatures, who was mentioned in the Harry Potter novels as the author of a Hogwarts' school book ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"". The series takes place in Rowling's wizarding world, way before Harry Potter's time, in a time where Gellert Grindelwald, a dark wizard who was also mentioned in the Potter-novels, is causing havoc. The Crimes of Grindelwald immediately puts pedal to the metal with an ultra-fast escape-scene. The film is altogether faster paced and more straightforward than the first film, and it's even more clearly a part of a series (three more films incoming). Involvement of a prophecy is also a very familiar element in the world we're exploring. I enjoyed the film and had a great time watching it with a fellow fan. Having said that, the first film is, to me, considerably better as an individual film, and I can see many who don't have deeper knowledge of the story seeing the Crimes of Grindelwald only as another fantasy-actioner. The screenplay is also a tad hard to fully understand, I'm still trying to put all the pieces together. Complicated plans are not unfamiliar in the books either.Some pros for me:-The prologue
-Deeper look into the Lestrange family
-Jude Law's young Dumbledore
-The Niffler and it's involvement in the third act",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
289,grantbullert,A Severe Letdown,5,12 June 2019,"""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" suffers a lack of true story. It's merely a collection of scenes, most of which are unfortunately total rubbish.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: It seems that there was a complete lack of effort and sense in this department. The only attempt at connecting with the audience was through very weak fan service. Rowling has either totally lost her touch or passion. She throws in her trademark twists, but they have not impact this time around. David Yates either needs to step up his game or move on. He couldn't bring any of the magic of the Wizarding World to this film. *Cinematography/Editing: Incredibly strange choices in both these departments. Once again either a lack of effort or imagination. It all seems rather bland and sometimes random. This was especially noticeable in the opening scene in the Ministry of Magic with Newt and Leta. *Acting/Dialogue: The main characters kept the film from sinking too deep, but it was still below water thanks to terrible writing. Jude Law is incredibly charming and outshines everyone in each scene he appears in. *Music/Sound: Here we experience a complete lack of the traditional Wizarding World wonder and it's a shame. *Production Design/Special Effects: The costumes were impressive in this film, as well as some sets. However, the computer generated images were less than impressive in this film.*Conclusion: ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" is not really a movie about anything. Apart from a few decent scenes the whole film is a convoluted mess. What is worse is that fact that it is as boring as can be.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

291,lennybuttz,Made me feel like a Thick-Head.,4,22 November 2018,"What I really liked about the first Fantastic Beasts movie was how everything was new and different yet still part of the Wizarding World that I was familiar with. I loved all the characters. I really liked that Grindelwald was a subplot and not the focus of the story. I guess I should have understood ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" was a clue on what this movie is about.I can't even tell you how many times I've watched the Potter movies but it's been a lot. I do appreciate the little snippets of background information and a few of them are quite exciting and surprising. That's my favorite part of this movie. To be honest I felt like a thick-head most of the time. I really didn't understand what was going on, sometimes I wasn't even sure were the action was taking place? I was confused, I kept feeling like I missed something. It almost seems like they edited out a bunch of scenes making the movie really choppy. I wanted to like the movie but it left me feeling empty. The characters were not as lovable or endearing, they were chaotic and emotionless. They didn't seem consistent with their original portrayals. Frankly I don't understand why they even brought some of the characters back? I saw familiar faces but felt like they were totally different people. They didn't make sense.The special effects are amazing, the scenery is amazing but also frustrating. I cannot understand why a production spends so much money on making everything look real then they film in almost total darkness or in the rain. This movie was almost entirely filmed in the rain, obscuring the wonderful sets. The rain was really distracting, it was so heavy and loud it became irritating, it was so dominant it should have received a co-starring credit. I can imagine the director sitting in his chair behind the scenes screaming through a megaphone ""More Rain! MORE RAIN! I NEED MORE RAIN!!!"" like some kind of rain maniac. I wonder if he was having some kind of depressing manic episode in his life and felt the need to transpose it into the movie?I do love Jude Lawe as Dumbledore I love that we get to see more of who he is and how he became the Dumbledore we're familiar with. Jude seems too young to be playing this part, the timeline seems off. Ron and Harry made jokes about Dumbeldore being incredibly old and gave us the impression that he was abnormally old yet this movie suggests he aged naturally. Newt seems more like a minor character, well everyone seems like a minor character, no one really stands out. I think they missed some opportunities to make the characters more realistic. Remember in the first movie we had a lot of ""awe, isn't that sweet"" moments? I liked that and I miss it. I wanted to see sweet, adorable, sad, loving, caring, funny Newt but all I saw was, confused, cold, boring Newt. It's like he's not the same person.I feel like Magical Creatures sold me a bill of goods and didn't follow through on it. I had the impression the show would be more about Newt and his magical creatures and not another set of movies about good vs. evil wizards. I've seen that already, I know how it ends. We see Grindelwald in the last 2 Potter movies, we know what happens to him. I want to see what happens with Newt and his friends, I want to know their story.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
292,Pinouchipop,Much Too Much...,5,3 February 2020,"The movie seems like an excuse for an overdose of special effects... without a plot. Good actors still playing as wonderfully as ever the characters they were given to embody. But just tell me: what exactly was the story? The development is pretty confusing, but there were delicious moments - the imagination of Rowling still enchanting - although these felt more like a succession of sketches than a flowingly running story.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

There were so many sub plots, introducing new characters merely for the sake of it making the plot convoluted and difficult to follow. Having said all that aesthetically its visually stunning. It's everything you expect from this franchise (and possibly more), with CGI in nearly every scene.

296,deandsouza15892,I don't even remember it,4,16 November 2018,"The one thing this movie successfully does, is cast an obliviate on you. I literally just watched it, and I don't even remember what it's about. The magical element of this film is simply having so much happen, while simultaneously, nothing really happens.There's a little bit of nostalgia, with Easter eggs and great visuals; the actors are great- Johnny Depp has the most menacing introduction I've seen; Jude Law convinced me that he is young Dumbledore; the music is spectacular. But none of that can hide the truth of the fact that this movie is just BORING.There is literally so much plot thrown at you non-stop. The movie expects you to care about, invest in and remember so many characters, that at some point, you mentally clock out. I'm an intense potterhead, and I love learning more l about the wizarding world. But this is just too much information, being force-fed in very little time. I've enjoyed every single Harry Potter film so far... but I just can't stomach this story.Remember at the end of the first Fantastic Beasts movie, when you enjoyed watching it,but you hesitated to gravitate towards it. You had a small shred of doubt if it was a one time thing,or does this genuinely have the potential to be something incredible. There's no longer a doubt.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

This, on the other hand, was mindbogglingly good. All of the actors did amazing jobs and I loved the fact that it was a bit more intertwined with the Harry Potter franchise than the first movie had been. The turn of events was also maddeningly good. Definitely go and give it a watch while it's in theatres, you'll love it!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
298,kane_1371-117-231060,Well here is yet another 8,8,14 November 2018,"I gave an 8 to the first film and this one is also a worthy movie with a rather high score in my opinion.
So strap in and lets go through what works and what does not work in this sequel to a very promising franchise.Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is the sequel to the Fantastic beasts and where to find them, and it faces the second movie curse head on, not unlike the second movie (and the book) of the Harry Potter series this movie suffers from a rather slow pacing, but where the second film (not the book) in HP series was pretty bad in overall quality this one is not, really even in the slowest moments of the film it is still heaps and bounds better than Secret Chamber.I will begin once again with the writing, well this is where a lot of the pacing issues lie at, I believe that the problem is Rowling showed her hand maybe too early for her own liking by basically giving away all the real twists in the first film with our main antagonist and our victim.
The lead characters never had any need for twists or big reveals and that leaves Rowling with far less to work with, so she started to flesh out most characters (Tina still is as mysteriously blank as she was in the first movie) and even introducing or debuting new characters, however most of the new characters are not vital and probably have no big impact on the next films and might not even be in the coming films.
This reveal she did in the first script also strips her of the famous twist and reveals she has done with the other stories, here basically everything is as clear as a bright summer's day, you have clear motives, and that is that.
So the impact of the story itself is not as much as one might like, which is something that I would liken more to the first Harry Potter book where sure we get our first introduction to the world and a fair amount of hints and information but basically everything else that followed it had bigger impacts because the first story was laying the foundations for the future and this is what The Crimes of Grindelwald is doing too, the menace of Grindelwald is subtle and spreading itself far and wide but very much unlike Voldemort, he is as of right now playing the long term game, and trying to play the good guy (we will get to that later on), the good guys are trying really hard to get a grasp on the developing situation and our Victims are too trying to survive, everything is in the open so the story flows flat and does not get you pumped like... lets say the Prisoner of Azkaban.
However the story is well written, the consistency in Rowling's writing shows itself very well in characters that we had learned about in the books and this is a thing that is very important, these movies are not a part of the movie canon, these are a part of the book canon so you need to be familiar with the books to really understand the genius that Rowling put in use to write these new stories.
The computer generated images are really well done once again, and I really enjoyed the scale of them, in the first film they were somewhat more tame, here there are several scenes where the CGI is very prominent and feels fairly natural, although I think the first film had somewhat better CGI, not because this one is bad, but because I liked the style of the first movie better.
The sound and music has improved, the music is more prominent and feel more fleshed out, I am hoping to see it become even better by the next installment.
We get to acting and oh boy, what can I say, Redmayne is still portraying Newt in a very well done manner, you can feel how awkward this man is to be around, he really is not easy in presence of people and that feels good, it just is well done, and Johnny Depp (I did say we will get to Grindelwald later) is just natural, he feels right for what we know of Grindelwald and this shows his acting prowess, many people write Johnny Depp off in recent years because they feel he reprises his Jack Sparrow in all films (which I do not agree with) but here you can not find even a drop of that character in Depp's performance, he is Grindelwald as Ralph Fiennes was Voldemort, you see the contrast between these two great evils of the Wizarding world, in their mannerism, in their reactions and their way of presenting their menace.
This of course also goes back to how well Rowling has done in distinguishing these two characters from each other already in Harry Potter books and it comes to its peak here in these movies.
Grindelwald is cunning, he is smart, he does not cling to stuff, he knows how to act and he knows when to strike, that is everything Voldemort was not and Depp brings this distinction to life on screen very well.
The Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol duo get less time in this film (and probably even in the next film) in favor of fleshing out some of the characters with flash backs and similar methods which is sad because they did steal the show in the first movie, here the emphasis was on the creatures to replicate that sense of show stealing and well they don't really achieve that, they are good, but not enough, although the movie itself has a more serious tone to it too so maybe their humor wouldn't work well enough.All in all I don't think this movie was bad, the writing was somewhat lacking, but the music had improved, the acting job done by Johnny Depp was refreshing to see in a sea of over the top acting in many recent movies and the cgi was awespiring.The score for this film is 7.5 out of 10.
If only the story was written better.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
299,burkholdermicah,Amazingly Dark Movie! Johnny Depp RULES!!,10,16 May 2019,"Johnny Depp truly steals the show as Grindelwald and every single scene that he's in is the Movie's greatest moments. Eddie Redmayne is also a truly great Actor and his role as Newt Scamander is astonishing.
This is a Great Movie and an Amazing addition to the Harry Potter Franchise no matter what haters think of it. And for the love of God, please give the Composer an Emmy Award for some of the best Music I've ever heard in a Blockbuster.

300,SharkByteAudioProductions,Less focused on the beasts but a complex plot with plenty of fan service,8,12 December 2018,"I thought I was going to dislike this film from the start because I heard that the beasts were less of a focus and this was easily the strongest part of the first film, while the Credence plot meandered and wasn't particularly that compelling.However, I was pleasantly surprised that the film had quite a complex plot that develops the characters further along and builds upon character motivations.This is a darker sequel in that it doesn't shy away from the darker parts of Harry Potter lore with some particular scenes that might be a bit shocking. However, Newt, Jacob and the beasts do lighten up the tone when it calls for it which I actually found pretty amusing, much like the first one.There are still enough moments with the beasts to satisfy fans of the first film with some interesting new beasts introduced (which I won't spoil here) though they could have been integrated much more. Grindelwald is a somewhat compelling villain but as I fan I want to see the plot call for Newt to use his beast taming abilities against Grindelwald a lot more. This plot very much sets the franchise up for the next film but leaves a firm mark to invest in the next movie.Visuals are excellent with magic looking really impressive (especially with its destructive nature) and the score is of course excellent as to be expected with the Harry Potter series,.Some audience members might dislike some of the more complex scenes as it can be confusing at times and kids will especially find it hard to keep up with conversations.7.5 / generous 8 out of 10",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
301,cinemawithcj,Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - Cinema with CJ Review,4,1 December 2018,"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald isn't quite the disaster it sounded it was going to be after finally watching it, but soon into watching it you can definitely see why this weak sequel doesn't bode well for this probably consistently weak spin-off franchise.Whether you rewatched the first film or not to get a primer on this one, it feels like the continuity doesn't even matter. Rowling has written a sort of fresh slate for most of the situation, writing out issues in what feels like the interest of pacing and throwing characters back into the fray because they are just needed.Of the returning characters, it remains to be Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander carrying the others, while the other returning cast seem very very secondary this time around. And they don't make great character choices. In fact sometimes they make the absolute worst, completely out of character choices.The titular Grindelwald sorta pulls away all the focus in this film. Gay wizard Hitler is in full force here, and ignoring the fact it's Johnny Depp (better than he's been in the majority of things he's done recently), you do get the attempt to make him at least different in ways from Voldermort.He's looking for his own way to get the purebloods in control and once again that calls for Ezra Miller's Constance who has just...survived the previous film. And for some reason he's rolling with Nagini? As in, Asian lady who turns into Nagini for...no reason at all. She's set up to carry into the sequels, but it seems very inconsequential that she's here.Most choices in this film are inconsequential. Jude Law's Dumbledore has so so much promise it's one of the few silver linings, but himself, Hogwarts, and even young Professor McGonagall feels very much for fanservice more than anything. And even then it's annoying some picky fans because timelines just don't make sense.But McGonagall isn't where that confusion begins or ends with timelines. Rowling has lost touch and fails once again as a screenwriter. She might be one of the better modern mystery writers, but goddamn she still hasn't nailed what a movie is constructed. It's even worse that she hasn't quite nailed her lore either.Crimes of Grindelwald can so very easily turn into one big fanboy criticism and believe me, this is just the tip of the iceberg here. So much can be said of Rowling's script and how each subsequent Harry Potter work after the initial books and films really fails to capture the magic, but ignoring all that...the films are just basically serviceable.David Yates can make these movies in his sleep by now and it certainly still feels like that. The first Fantastic Beasts managed to capture a different time and slant on magic and have all the wonder and adventure, but Crimes of Grindelwald feels more of the same and somehow also a lot less. It's safe, and while it still hasn't quite nailed the tonal problems like the first (Grindelwald's men and women do what Michael Myers cannot and kill a baby off screen), it all just feels so middle of the road once again the world of film has something that's not special at all in its hands. All the set pieces are bland and lack escalation or stakes, and the music is so forgettable it feels like a crime for a Potter-related flick.Crimes of Grindelwald is too occupied with trying to blow your mind and once again set up bigger better movies (just give me young Dumbledore doing brilliant things, movie) that it fails at what it should be doing in the movie you have here. That's the problem compared to Harry Potter, each of those were contained mysteries with the propelling force for a series, whereas Fantastic Beasts throws few mysteries over these five films with barely any character, threat, or excitement to make it all worthwhile.Rowling really needs to step up her writing game and understand more of why Potter works and this doesn't. Pulling random sh- out of the air doesn't make for interesting storytelling, it feels like midichlorians are supposed to explain the force. Plot twists aren't fun in the way they're being pulled off here. Characters coming in aren't gonna feel worth it if they are wasted.Weak, lacking in logic, still unsure what kind of story it is, and still employing Johnny Depp, Grindelwald would be deserving of bigger more passionate rants if it were criminally bad, but it's not. The crime here is that once again, it's a film that's barely okay, and not fantastic.And also because Nicholas Flamel is in the movie and isn't so much wasted as he is a complete eyebrow raise of why he even is in this movie.Oh well, at least he's not secretly a snake, or an Asian lady who turns into one.That would be stupid.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

303,pinemaples,The Setup for the Real Story,8,18 November 2018,"I was very grateful I rewatched Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them before I went to see The Crimes of Grindelwald, because this second movie strongly builds and relies on the viewer's memory of the original. I was surprised to see the two movies had the same director in David Yates, as this one felt very different.
Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, and Alison Sudol all were the same quartet we love, but they seemed to have less screentime than before, to make way for Johnny Depp's Grindelwald stealing center spotlight. Newcomers Zoë Kravitz and Claudia Kim fit perfectly into the universe, and Jude Law made the perfect younger Dumbledore.
I enjoyed the ways in which the movie revisited the wonder of watching Newt tame and tend to the animals, introducing new creatures for us to admire through the masterful CGI. Dan Fogler, as Jacob Kowalski, is still at the top of his physical comedy game, and is always a joy to watch. I appreciated how his character was more sure of his place in the magical community. We got more of a glimpse into what goes on in Queenie's mind, and were introduced to some sadder moments through her insecurities.
The Crimes of Grindelwald also attempted to connect to the original Harry Potter movies through some nice surprise characters and Easter eggs, which I won't spoil for you.
The central plot is much simpler compared with the first movie, and easier to follow. Unfortunately, it was also not near as tightly scripted or edited, with a bit too much exposition that tanked the pacing at times. As well, there were some scenes that didn't quite know where to end, and dialogue that liked to meander a bit.
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was a much more self-contained story, easy to enjoy on its own. Conversely, The Crimes of Grindelwald is very much a bridge film to set up more plot threads to come to fruition in future installments. I personally didn't quite like it as much as the first in the series, but it is still absolutely worth seeing, and I will definitely be rewatching it - both in preparation for the third movie, and whenever I go back through the series on repeat viewings for fun.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

306,natsuka_arei,"Potentially interesting one, yet feels lacks of focus on the story",10,18 November 2018,"Got to read so many negative comment about this one. I read all the books of Harry Potter, all the movies (still prefer the books rather than the movies), and of course, the Fantastic Beast series as well. I found this one is enjoyable and very interesting with the stories and characters revealed. It bring us to new connections and possibilities of the magic world history of the past.Very dark and complicated indeed but still feels magical, not to mention how the CGI is stunning as always. Yet, it lacks of....what I might say, a focus. It is not concentrated enough at the life of Newt Scamander, which kinds of confusing despite the title itself ""Fantastic Beasts"". The magical creature in this movie or even the Newt himself and his companions seem like just passing through the whole movies without any significant role. They...don't do anything important in the movie. It is more about the rise of Grindelwald and Credence.When you see on that perspective you will wonder what is the main story of the whole series of Fantastic Beast? I mean in HP, we all know it is all about the magical world HP live in and his journey in fighting the rise of Voldemort along with his companion. In this one, it kinds of blurred and mixed up with one and another. Is it about Newt's life journey? Will the magical creature still be the highlight of the story? (since the title is not so relevant anymore with the series). Is it about the dark age when the Grindelwald ruled and contaminated the magical society they lived in? Is it about the young Dumbledore past and his glory in defeating the Grindelwald? Why bring the past of Nagini into the whole story, what's her role, what's the purpose? I mean of course it is maybe connected one to each other and served as a side story for the era where HP lives, but the way they connect each of the stories kind of weak so it may causes dissatisfaction among fans (and a lot of confusion). Last but not least, I am not really happy with Johnny Depp as Grindelwald (don't take me wrong, I am his fans in his other movies but he doesn't give me much impression as Grindelwald. The genius, narcissistic, a little bit crazy in the head, and power obsessed Wizard. Except the last scene when he portrays brilliantly the conductor of death). Perhaps, Cumberbatch can do better to play the role. Not that I give up on Johnny, I am expecting something more from him for the next FB movies.To sum it up, it is still a worth to watch. Just don't expect too much from it. After all it is served as materials, something to complete our imagination about the whole HP world. The past and the future won't be there without their past right?

I particularly enjoyed the twist at the ending of the first film.So when I heard that a sequel was being made that would focus on Grindelwald, I looked forward to it, hoping to see a conflict that took place that I always had an interest in seeing put to film.Sadly, what we got was a romance love story that really trails off into a borefest. The pacing is wrong. The editing is a mess. The film itself is a mess. One of the few times that I wish they cut off at least a good 20-30 minutes off the time. 2 hours of this was just far too much.The film has very few saving graces, but ultimately, the script, pacing and editing all combine into a really bad film.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
318,KingCritic,Just not good.,6,26 October 2021,"I saw the first Fantastic Beast film prior to this one, and while it had its fair share of problems, I really did enjoy most of the film. It's a fun action and character flick, manages to sell some very good character development with a good deal of fun and tense action.This movie however somehow manages to set up what is going to be a very disappointing end to a trilogy. While the first Fantastic Beasts film managed to sell a very convincing three act structure led by a clear A and B plot, Beasts 2 has so many plots occurring at the same time it's hard to follow them.To make matters worse, Johnny Depp as Grindelwald is not given a chance to shine. He gives a good performance, but the script just isn't there, for any character. Especially Dumbledore.This just doesn't feel like the Albus Dumbledore I know from the books or films. Even as a thirty to fifty year old man.There's fan service and plot holes galore, made dozens of times worse by the poor character writing, pacing, and plot. These don't feel like the same characters from the last film, and worst of all, most big reveals or plot beats come across as either retcons, nonsensical, or at times worst.In simpler terms, this film can't even get by on the skin of its teeth like the last film.I actually wanted nothing more than a film depicting the first Global Wizarding War and Grindelwald's reign of terror. The problem is, everything is so messy and rushed, that they don't have enough time to flesh out anything.And again, anything that is developed is too rushed and or clumsy and nonsensical to be considered solid.The film's fatal flaw is that this series probably wasn't planned as a trilogy except without pushing from marketing and the studio. This didn't need to be a trilogy, but they combined two very different aspects of the Harry Potter universe into this rushed mess of a film to make more money. And what we got is just this odd disappointment.At this point, with Johnny Depp leaving the franchise, there's nothing left but a very predictable and boring third film in this ever dwindling Harry Potter movie franchise.In my opinion, if JKR, Warner Brother's and the Wizarding World corporates want to save the movie franchise they need to make films the fans actually want to see in a coherent way. Like of course, a Marauders film that can be an alternate universe of the book's original events.Or even a Marauder's AU miniseries.This is of course entering fanfiction/AU territory, but at this point with how incongruent with canon they've gotten it wouldn't be a step too far.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

That old Harry Potter Magic Is Back.,9,19 November 2018,"The Crimes Of Grindelwald has really upped the ante for Fantastic Beasts. a race against time in stunningly created settings. The villain of the piece is an absolutely hypnotic presence, you hang on his every word. Its a fantastic and frightening set up for whats to come, and i for one cannot wait for the next instalments.I loved the Harry Potter series, all received perfect 10's from me. Fantastic Beast & Where To Find Them, i gave an 8/10, it was still an absolute joy to watch but it almost felt like a stand-alone film, but now i see that it was an introduction to this new wizarding world and its characters. But The Crimes Of Grindelwald really takes flight, i loved it. It felt more in the realm of storytelling that we were accustomed to with the Harry Potter series, a great blend of drama, emotions, action, urgency and bucket loads of charm.Johnny Depp is inspired casting as Grindelwald and you can see that there's A LOT more menace to come behind those steely eyes of his.This one seems like its budget has been doubled from the previous film, FB: Where To Find Them, there are trips to various countries, each with there own beautiful scenery, architecture and the costumes, clothes are absolutely stunning. The whole world and its creatures and magic are a feast for the eyes.The film is in constant motion and accurately so given the circumstances and urgency of what unfolds and what is to be done by all the characters involved.If you loved the Harry Potter series then this will be a warm blanket of fun, charm, Awe and excitement that no other franchise can offer you. It's truly a magical world to be a part of.I was lucky enough to watch it in IMAX and i'm glad i did.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
321,alvesmarceloalves-73751,The imminent war in Fantastic Beasts,6,22 November 2018,"If there is anything interesting to note about what is being built with the saga of ""Fantastic Beasts"" is the genealogy of the Harry Potter story and all that involves the events we saw in seven books and eight films whose successes gave JK Rowling the power to do what she wants. Among them, writing the screenplay based on what would have happened before Potter got to Hogwarts.The second installment of the new franchise, ""The Crimes of Grindelwald,"" begins to swallow the Potter story and bring the time line further separating the events of the future already reported with those of the past yet to be known.And David Yates knew how to lead a little better story than in the first film. Rowling's veteran collaborator - he directed half of the Potter films - Yates gave the second film tones of doubt and uncertainty, and let the fears and insecurities of the characters speak louder in the story. What may be related to a Europe in a period between wars. The film takes place in 1927, when the continent is still rebuilding at the same time as there was the fear of a new war that would actually begin 12 years later.Moving into the magical world of Rowling, the division is even more glaring, as Grindelwald escapes from prison and begins to gather a series of wizards unhappy with the life they lead, hidden from humans, living in the shadows, unable to use their powers or even to marry someone who is not a witch. Many want to be the dominant species on the planet. Natural evolution. And Grindelwald's speech, lived by a Johnny Depp in a slightly more accurate tone, without exaggerations and eccentricities of his later works, is highly seductive and gregarious for those who feel excluded and oppressed by the ministry of Magic and its aurores. Depp's scene in Père Lachaise's cemetery is one of the best in the film.The point of the story is one. It is J.K. Rowling's motto at this point: ""You have to choose a side."" It's what Theseus (Callum Turner) tells Brother Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) at the beginning. Throughout the film, each one is choosing its side and regrouping its armies in the war that seems imminent. Scamander, who, in theory, has no interest in choosing sides, but only wants to take care of his creatures, gives his answer only at the end, although we always knew what it would be. He is the hero and has been proving much more than an expert on exotic animals, but a powerful and shrewd wizard. At the same time he has a shyness and the difficulty of relating to humans in general. Maybe that's why the person with whom he feels more comfortable is another strange being in the magical world, the human Jacob (Dan Fogler), whose participation in the film, however, borders the nullity.Another interesting point of this second work is to know a little more of the past of one of the most beloved characters of Harry Potter fans. Alvo Dumbledore, who was very well into Jude Law's hands. Better than Michael Gambon ever was. Incidentally, in a general way, an advantage of this still beginner franchise of ""Fantastic Beasts"" over that of ""Harry Potter"" is the quality of its actors. Many of them are very good and occupy leading positions. And this was a problem in the previous franchise, because some actors, especially the protagonist, were suffering.But back to Dumbledore, in ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" we know of the teacher's once solid alliance with his former friend. Something well documented in the books of the Potter saga, we see how Professor Dumbledore was, always loved in the school of magic, and we know a little more about this honorable character, the eternally pacifist arm of the relation between the wizards and the defense of a peaceful coexistence between witches and humans. Dumbledore is the education bias in Rowling's world. It is the way out of education and knowledge that brings prosperity, tolerance and empathy. At least that's what Dumbledore believes. And he sees in Scamander the same spirit detached from power, at the same time curious to participate in the events and to seek justice, which he would see in Harry Potter. Certainly pure spirits who do not crave the power awaken in Dumbledore a father figure and the need to welcome these souls he foresees as vectors of change in the history of humans and magicians.Therefore, we must not deceive ourselves. What J.K. Rowling is trying to do with ""Fantastic Beasts"" is to reproduce the same ""Harry Potter"" narrative. Scamander, as we have seen, is the counterpart to the wizard protagonist of the previous story. Grindelwald, it's Voldemort's turn. Jacob is the idiot friend doing the times of Ron Weasley, while Tina is Hermione of the time. Dumbledore is himself younger, while Queenie is a bit like Gina Weasley.In comparison to the first film, which seemed to me too long and with little relevant content, the story advances considerably in ""The crimes of Grindelwald"". Which is a plus point. There are also some shadowy and unnecessary elements in the trajectory and holes already common in Rowling's work. But I understand that the interest in accompanying the main narrative still prevails.And what remains is the mystery about Creedance (Ezra Miller). What is your real past? Where does it really come from? The movie plays some cards in the air, but you can not trust any of them. At least for now, was Grindelwald right? Or is there more to Creedance than we need to know? What remains, however, is the knowledge that he is one of the most powerful wizards to emerge. And that war, whether between humans or between wizards, is imminent.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
322,luningyuan-23687,"J. K. Rowling please let the professionals do their job, and u just write ur book.",6,21 November 2018,"The new Fantastic Beasts movie finally released last weekends. For two years waiting, fans of this magic world finally can see the latest story of Newt.
Like the first film, the film has superb visual effects, especially in the IMAX3D, the jump effect is amazing, let the audience feel in the magic world.
As a work of the big world view, this film incorporates more characters, and each has its own separate story line, but the obvious shortcoming is that Rowling is only good at showing different people's stories in books. However, in the movie, the story cannot be well balanced, and the story cannot be smoothly switched between the stories. Even the same story line cannot be smoothly told. Frequent jump cut in the film have greatly discounted the entire story. Additionally, the big world view, many roles, it is difficult to explain the identity of every characters, but the film does not seem to care, perhaps because the audience of the film is mainly fans, so it is not necessary.
The good thing is that the film is still the same as the first one, the first-class clothing design, so fabulous.

Oodles of characters appear, all without any sort of comprehensible introduction. Or if there is an introduction, it's obliterated by the distraction of the special effects. Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) has mastered the sidelong glance (as opposed to the direct look in the face of the other characters), like Caine (David Caruso) in CSI Miami.

Maybe I'm slightly biased, but I'm not the avid fan of the Harry Potter films as I am the books. The books were special. As a reader of the books you could watch the films and appreciate the basic story telling of the films but revel in the knowledge you know secrets and details only to be found in the books. J.K. Rowling has a fantastic imagination and includes many subplots that all tie in to a big finish in the end. It makes for a great book. Unfortunately, not a great movie. I know J.K Rowling is heavily involved in the story telling of these films. I can see the same method she employed when writing the HP books is being used in these films, ie, subplots. Again, it keeps books interesting, but makes for a drawn out, boring film. It's just not working. The characters don't have chemistry, and the focus is being put on a character that I don't see how anyone could find interesting (I refer to Ezra Miller whose characters name I don't remember. My point exactly.) It has been several months now since I've seen this film and can't remember much about it to be honest. Except for Jude Law as Albus Dumbledore.

335,lanycera,"A great movie, can't understand the bad reviews",8,16 December 2018,"I would call myself a hardcore Harry Potter fan; I grew up with the books and loved them dearly, and it became a huge part of my teenage years as well.In all honesty, I can't believe that some reviewers who call themselves Harry Potter fans don't give JK Rowling some credit. She knows what she is doing, and I strongly believe that this is only the beginning of another great series. It contained a lot of information, but by no means was it confusing...I appreciated it when Fantastic Beasts came out - it was funny, lighthearted, and the actors great, while giving us back a little piece of magic that we didn't have since Harry Potter ended. But I didn't particularly love it.Fantastic Beasts II is much darker, much more thrilling, and while there was no apparent plot other than locating Grindelwald and introducing the baseline for the later instalments - I enjoyed every second of it. JK Rowling is giving us new stories and information, so who cares whether it was there in the original books or added later to the lore? Yes, the individual characters came a bit short because of the nature of this movie - but this shouldn't be seen as a standalone movie, more like Deathly Hallows Part I. It's a setup for a greater scheme of things.Grindelwald (who is surprisingly well portrayed by Johnny Depp, after all his ""typical"" Depp roles I was more than sceptical) is actually a much more reasonable villain than Voldemort. I appreciate that the premise is not black & white but rather ""are the bad people really that wrong in their intentions?"". I thought this was a really great part of the movie, same as Leta Lestrange and Queenie surprising us ultimately with their revelations.And...are people seriously complaining about the CGI?

I'm not a Potter fan, but I've been alive the past 2 decades so I've gotten th gist of the universe. Basically there's always ONLY one guy who can save the world (Harry, Newt, Dumbledore) and then some side characters for comedic effect or light love interest. This film was not even half of the entertainment of the 1st fantastic beast movie. At least that one had all the adventures in the suitcase. This one had two brief interactions with beasts. Katherine Waterston thankfully had less screen time. Her portrayal in the last film was totally boring and uninspired. In this one she has a chip on her shoulder, b/c of a tabloid story about Newt and a schoolmate. Such poor writing. The whole movie was just filler space for the next installment, much like the Pirates installments became boring and pointless. Overall, just boring.

The fx are good, the characters work, the creatures are likeable and the old Potter-feeling is still there.I have one major concern though. This movie onky works as part of a larger story because it sets up parts 3-5. As a standalone experience it's not very good. It's fine to embed the story into a larger context but it also should work on its own as an entertaining experience.This one feels more like two or three episodes of a tv series. But thus is made for the big screen! We now have to wait another two years to see how the story moves on. For a tv series this is fine. Worst case, we have to wait til the next season comes out.So, filmmakers really should treat the material like a movie and not pretend it's part of a series. When you go to the cinema, you can expect to have a satisfying ending that gives closure to the story. This is possible even if you tell a larger story. The Potter films and the Lord of the rings are good examples.Rowling is capable of writing such stories which is why I'm optimistic about how thus franchise is going to evolve.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The first spin off was promising, with a good original story, strong new cast and a wonderful main character. However the second movie is all over the place. The plot suddenly decided that Newt was not the main character anymore, while still following him. Also the studio was desperately trying to cram the movie full with any reference to the Harry Potter movies. Even if those were incorrect and obviously made as if the viewers are idiots. Dumbledore is introduced so we take a trip to Hogwarts. The only class the movies ever paid any mind to was defence against the dark arts, so naturally Dumbledore was put in the role of professor (even though the book readers know he taught transfiguration). McGonagall who was not old enough to be a student at that time is walking the halls as a teacher, because we wouldn't recognize Hogwarts without another familiar face. Last but definitely not least, but just something that really bothered me, Nicholas Flamel, who owns the philosopher's stone and is immortal, is displayed as a brittle old man, to highlight the fact that he is extremely old. Like we as a viewer are not smart enough to know that this man is immortal, and thus old, by just telling us. And this is without the weird twist and turns the plot takes to tell something that resembles a story.

352,cineastFGD,I'd never thought I would write a bad review on a Rowling project,1,23 March 2019,"I'd never thought I would write a bad review on a Rowling project, but here it is.
This film sucks, period.Maybe Rowling should remind herself where her strength lies and start writing stories again, instead of creating opportunities for the special effects guys to run wild. The story has no plot, zilch, and Joanne it's freaking boring. just throwing in some crumbs from he Harry Potter world won't save a deadbeat horse, sorry.
The plot munches through side plots and introduces new characters at a speed where I periodically was at a total loss of where we were going. None of the characters or places are properly introduced, remain mere schemes throughout the film, appear, disappear, reappear, and disappear to never appear again, the majority involved in small side gigs that add nothing to the overall story, but still seem important somehow.The music sucks too in my opinion, whilst the Harry Potter soundtrack was an epic musical master piece, this film's music is as forgettable and bland as the rest.And don't get me started on the cast. Whoever came up with the idea to cast Jude Law as Dumbledore should be shot. Jude Law is not an actor, he's a smug-faced shallow mannequin who's made a career from looking good and from fertlising the romantic fantasies of his female fans (Hugh Grant comes to mind as an alternative, should Law be prevented for any reason next time). And this is exactly the Dumbledore he plays, nothing of the warmth, kindness, and fine humour that a Richard Harris or a Micheal Gambon brought to the role. He really has defiled the role, completely.Ezra Klein runs around with the same silly facial expression as in the first movie, why didn't they just take a picture of him and plastered it on a cardboard cut-out, I'm sure it would have been hard to know the difference.Finally, Johnny Depp. I loved the guy in the Pirates movies, in Chocolat, in Sleepy Hollow, as Williy Wonka, Gilbert Grape you name it, but he literally sucks in every role he's played ever since. He seems like a washed-up lazy bum today, who mumbles his way through his roles, creating the weirdest of accents and hiding behind even weirder costumes. How is the guy still cast? Producers must believe the audience are brain dead zombies who just suck-up everything that is dished out to them. Well, here's some news, we won't. If you guys want my dosh, then make sure to produce some quality work with quality actors, otherwise bye.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

356,glstrom-14260,What the hell is going on?,4,16 November 2018,"I guess I should have read the book or revisited ""Magical Beasts"" because pretty much from the opening sequence to the ""epic"" battle at the finish it was difficult to know who was who and why we should care about what happens to them. Lovely rendering of the cities I must say and the CG was simply amazing, it was just the plot that was lacking clarity. The highlight for me and I am sure all Potter fans was returning to Hogwarts and seeing Dumbledore teach Defense against dark arts class (like so many before him), then having the ministry dicks be unkind to the cool wizarding children...so unfair. Would have liked to see them rise up and duel which would make more sense motivation wise than that motivationless display I saw at the end.Credence Barebone, who is he, and why do we care. Seems unclear as Grindelwald spends much of the picture mumbling. Flashbacks are well done and understandable, love interest miscommunication frustrating and seemingly an afterthought while I am still wondering what Jacob and Queenie are doing there in the first place (as I am sure they are as well) Big battle at the end with blue swirls vs red swirls then some kind of explosion? Dude and his undefined evil woman killed some fine people and their lovely small child just use their apartment as headquarters? WTH? Yeah, I know he is a bad guy and all but seriously. Seems he also had the elderwand which I am sure I knew at one time how he came across it, but then if his pal Dumbledore has a blood vow and can't fight him how does he end up with it in the end? Nice visit to ministry and revisit of ol pal polyjuice potion, but the light heartedness, fun and overall plot one could follow or care about was lacking.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
357,jbencker,All over the place,4,6 December 2018,"""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" is - like its predecessors - very good in creating character moments. Most characters are interesting and appealing in different ways and seeing them interact is just a joy. All the actors did a great job - Jude Law was very convincing as young Dumbledore and even Johnny Depp was solid - and had a lot of chemistry.Visually the movie is also well-made. There are lovely locations, sets and the beats are - with the exception of the horrible CGI cats - wonderfully brought to the screen.But these aspects do not make up for the many, many problems with the writing of the movie:First of, there are some technical aspects: there are a few scenes that are so unrealistic that they pull you out of the film, for example, how after Credence and Nagini flee from the circus the place is immediately cleared, or how Leta reads out loudly to herself as is she had a audience. These may be just minor aspects but these kind of scenes can be really jarring.Secondly, a large problem is that the movie doesn't stand on its own. Instead of creating a coherent plot the movie is mostly concerned with setting up future installments. Characters that have no function in the narrative (read: Nagini) are introduced and the viewers are left with countless questions at the end of the movie. Presently franchises are the trend and countless other movies showed that it is very much possible to set up future films without failing to deliver a plot on its own.Thirdly, the movie features a number of characters with own storylines. This means a lot of characters don't get the time they need. This is especially noticeable in the case of Queenie and Leta. Queenie's storyline has such a potential but the way her joining Grindelwald is presented falls flat; that could have been avoided if we could have spent more time with her. The same case with Leta: while we get some of her history we still don't know much about her, especially her relationship with Newt and Theseus. Considering Newt's past relationship with her I really expected some sort of explanation what exactly happened between her and Newt and what kind of relationship she has with Theseus. Considering she is dead we will probably never get to know. Speaking of which, her death could've not only been avoided but is sadly another case of a female character dying in order to motivate a male character.Fourthly, a number of problems stem from the fact that the movies seem to be unsure about its relationship to the Harry Potter canon.
On the one side, there are some things it expects the viewers to know about: We all know Dumbledore is a powerful wizard because we watched Harry Potter. But wouldn't it be more interesting if he was not yet regarded as the only one capable of fighting Grindelwald? So that he could actually develop in 20 years! Or if we maybe had some reasons Dumbledore is regarded so highly by the magical law enforcement of all people!
On the other side the movie repeatedly breaks with canon. The film invents a magical doohickey preventing Dumbledore from fighting Grindelwald which not only contradicts the canon (Albus, Aberforth and Grindelwald fighting) but also decreases the pay-off we will get if Albus decides to confront Grindelwald. Albus fighting Grindelwald out of responsibility despite his feelings is way more powerful than Albus always being ready to confront him and only not being able to because of magic.
And there is, of course, the terrible twist about Credence. The sad state of things is that either the twist turns out to be true and JKR is majorly breaking with canon, or it turns out to be false, and JKR is screwing with us for shock value. Neither of which is a promising sign for the Fantastic Beasts movies.I don't really understand why the movie was lacking to that degree. JKR is a great writer and I don't know if she just isn't good at being a screenwriter, or if the studio insisted on setting up future installments in this movie, but I really, really hope the next movie will be better.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

361,FilmLiquet,Film Liquet on Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,7,16 November 2018,"The Crimes of Grindelwald is a direct sequel to the Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and the 10th movie based in the Wizarding World. The story picks up right after the events of the first movie and takes place in Paris, where Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) escapes to and seeks to find his army of followers while Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) attempt to take him down.Despite resting in the adventure genre, the film shows good detective work with some unexpected twists. The movie by itself is a bold experiment, that follows several storylines with different storytelling paces, dynamics and humor, which come together by the end of it. It worked despite the fact that it was necessary for the plot to introduce new characters without throwing away the old beloved ones.Overall, the movie only makes sense if you have been following the Wizarding world or at least have seen the previous iteration. While the first Fantastic Beasts movie was a perfect standalone introduction to the wizarding world outside Hogwarts with just a few references, the second one has a lot of information, making it hard for the new viewers to sort through.

Overburdened is because of Yusuf comes after Credence based on some childhood petty grudge, Queenie joining Grindlewald, Flashback between Lestrange and Scamander, and also the addition of the character Grimmson, might have a part future sequels but this picture does not have any consistency because the writer tried to keep the running time under 2 and half hours.There are no strange creatures, only blinkered people!A safe house in Paris, reinforced with enchantments.You don't seek power or popularity.

I liked the tone, I liked the pacing and the backstories. I liked the expositions of new characters. I am super interested to learn more about how Nagini's story will her to being the right hand man of Voldemort. I felt like a couple lines were forced, such as ""Grindelwald doesn't value that which is simple."" I get that it was a recall to what Dumbledore says about Voldemort to Harry, but I felt like there was no motivation for that line since Newt would've had no reason to say this based on Newt's experiences with Grindelwald. There were some interesting things that could potentially set up some plot holes in the Potterverse. And I would say that I am not worried at all, but Cursed Child made plenty of mistakes in terms of plot direction that cheapened or poked holes in the Potterverse.I actually like Grindelwald movie version more than Voldemort movie version (book version is a different story), he seems more sophisticated and his motives more reasonable.Overall, I liked the tone.

367,HalBanksy,Slow death of a mediocre series...,2,24 December 2018,"The first 'Fantastic Beasts' film (while fairly dull) did at least show some potential - unfortunately that has been destroyed with this next instalment. A tone of senseless direction is established from the start - Grindlewald escapes in the opening scene, rendering his initial capture completely pointless. The audience is given no reason to feel tension for anything that happens - apparently events can be reversed or ignored at will in this series. Laughably, Jacob has also retained his memory completely and Credence is infact alive (suddenly in Paris somehow.) How and why is of course never explained...There is barely even a plot to speak of. The movie is reduced to explaining convoluted family trees. J K Rowling has clearly put a lot of effort into working out how this parade of tedious characters are related to each other. Unfortunately she seems to have forgotten to think up any reason for the audience to actually GIVE A DAMN. Maybe we will get to that part over the next 3 films (give me strength!)A terrible cast. Newt the pathetic wet blanket whimpers his way through scenes. An unbearable character surrounded by boring sidekicks. In hindsight the hype and controversy surrounding Nagini is hilarious! She says barely 10 words through the film and has absolutely ZERO impact to anything that happens.Scenes where we return to Hogwarts are just terrible. Looking past the glaring plot holes and inconsistencies to the original series - It's just a sad reminder of how uninspired and empty everything feels compared to Harry Potter. The lazy art direction doesn't help - sets, costumes and CGI are all a colourless haze.Even the title is confused and messy. Attempting to amaze the audience with ""fantastic beasts"" and terrify with ""Grindlewald's crimes."" It fails at both! Resulting in a film that is neither fantastic nor thrilling.

There is a real big surprise about one of the most present day repudiated families of Harry Potter. The young woman for once shows that she is beyond her name and shows the moral fortitude and moral obligation to engage evil one on one, what one character that appeared a good person shows the evanescence of how men and women think about themselves. Indeed in the first movie this turn cloak character in the second belittles Newt´s friend as a taker and not a giver, the tortilla and the table is really turned this movie, this is clearly the best scene and best part of the movie and the last words of the doomed character has a echo that goes beyond words.
Now with that in mind, in that powerfully scene in where Grindelwald says that he truly hates Paris after the denouement of the transformational scene. Grindelwald proves himself a winner, taking into his own volition the once broken character that the last movie barely escaped destruction by the American Aurors, Credence is back and now with a lover, the shift and shape shifting Nagini who cares deeply about the broken Credence but even her love cannot stop Credence from his search of self and who he really is. The cradle of Credence´s origin is the most revealing fact of the movie, even if half the movie teases another family connection, Credence truly shall become Grindelwald and Albus Dumbledore equal in due time according to this well placed and suave Grindelwald paternalistic new relationship with Credence who now owes in his new collection a powerful bird that cannot die, a bird that burns to ambers and cannot die and lives again to fly.

Their motivations are lacking, their development is either minimal or immature, and we cannot possibly find ourselves caring for the new ones, since they as well are very badly developed.One would think the writers would manage to make us care for Leta at least, but even her character is not exactly clear in her motives, and doesn't manage to gain our sympathy. I couldn't possibly blame any of the actors for this, since it is clearly a faulty script.Of course, all this led to a plot that was either pitifully pulled ahead with things we did not care about, or things that were dropped there like obvious plot devices such as all of Newt's creatures. Other times the story was nonsensical, in the sense that you could understand what was going on, but it was entirely insignificant, when it should have been holding you at the edge of your seat.For a character driven story that was inspired by our collective childhoods, I'm afraid I found myself leaving the theatre disappointed, having spent two hours with so many characters and yet not caring for any of them, not even the ones I liked in the previous one.I will confess that the one moment my heart stopped was when Hogwarts appeared. It was out of nowhere, completely unexpected but the theme came on and we were there.

379,kevinthecritic,"The Crimes of Grindelwald: Potter Prequel Only Steals Time, Disrespects Legacy",4,20 November 2018,"2 out of 5 stars (Has Some Good Moments, But Is Overall Bad)
The Harry Potter series is one of the most successful and respected fantasy epics of our time. J.K. Rowling captivated both readers and audiences with her story of a young boy who discovers the existence of magic and ultimately must fight to save it. Despite an understandably mixed reaction from book purists, I believe the films are entertaining on their own merits. They aren't all perfect, but the good far outweighs the bad.
The series hit a road bump with 2016's Fantastic Beasts And Where to Find Them, based upon the in-universe book of the same name, but with an entirely new story written for the screen by Rowling herself. I watched it in preparation for this film, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, and found it a passable yet underwhelming installment that would likely entertain youngsters. However, the Potter series improved over time, so I hoped it might be a similar case here. Therefore, it is with a heavy heart that I report Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald a thudding disappointment. Most adult fans will likely gawk at this installments' outrageous rewriting of lore and needlessly convoluted storyline, though young kids may enjoy the creatures when they appear. Despite a brilliant cliffhanger, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is a long, tedious, and pointless cash grab that further dampens the franchise.
Newt Scamander (An admirably dedicated Eddie Redmayne) is asked by Albus Dumbledore (An underused Jude Law) to capture escaped convict Grindelwald (A surprisingly enjoyable Johnny Depp), and only agrees so he can locate his love interest, the Auror Tina (Katherine Waterson). Newt takes Muggle friend and comedic relief character Jacob (An annoying Dan Fogler) for the ride, who is having forced relationship drama with Tina's magic sister Queenie (Allison Sudol). However, all must come together in order to stop Grindelwald and save the wizarding world. I'd mention the other characters and subplots here, but their presence in this story is either unnecessary or would be a spoiler.
This is the worst film of the series. The storyline is needlessly complicated, the script and direction are reminiscent of a soap opera, and some of the actors read their lines as though seeing them for the first time. The beasts are barely present and are still less convincing than the creatures from 10 years ago. The lead characters remain frustratingly boring (with one exception), being rushed from one action scene to the next and talking about romance problems rather than receiving development so we might care about them. I've spent 4 and a half hours with these people, but they all have less depth than Harry and Co. did at the halfway mark of Chamber of Secrets, before the storyline even got juicy. Lastly, J.K. Rowling's continued insistence on thinly-veiled political commentary will turn off a portion of her audience and fly over the heads of the children who just came to see magic and creatures.On a positive note, Depp, Redmayne, and Sudol make most of this mess bearable, and the ending twists are potentially brilliant if utilized properly in films 3-5. The tone is more consistent and the film has fleeting moments of charm. However, the overall product is too mediocre to warrant seeing in the theater. I sincerely hope J.K. Rowling can realize the potential of her story at this point and use it in the fullest. If Fantastic Beasts 3 is anywhere as bad as this, I will give up on this prequel series and mentally decannonize them.Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is a slow, poorly-executed mess with uninteresting heroes, mediocre effects, and the intrigue of a bland soap opera. Despite some devoted performances and two devilish twists, this film's biggest Crime is turning a once brilliant franchise into yet another generic and forgettable blockbuster.

What I don't understand why people think it's a ""bad idea"" for an author like J. K. Rowling to be the one pulling the strings, especially with everything she's been doing to make the Wizarding World bigger and connecting the series to where it makes sense. There were lots of references to Harry Potter that you could go ""Oh! That's in Harry Potter and the such and such!"" The characters are interesting, including younger Dumbledore and Grindelwald, and I feel that Jude Law and Johnny Depp fit the roles really well.
I also don't understand why it's the people that either hate the Harry Potter books/movies, or are just not into it, see movies like this and say it's horrible. If you're not into it, that's fine but don't ruin it for those that are really into the series. As a Harry Potter fan, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I'm sure many other fans will too.

The plot is so jam packed that I had a little trouble thinking it through the first time, but the second time was a real eye opener. This is just a great movie. It's not what you expected in a Fantastic Beasts sequel, because it's almost nothing like the first one, but it has some similar themes. I did however feel that there was a decrease in set quality during the beginning scenes, especially when Grindelwald was on screen.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

394,markcasa-63624,Entertaining but decent,6,18 November 2018,"Ok granted I wasn't really excited to see this movie honestly I think the only reason I was interested in seeing this movie was so I could see Nagini but she barely does anything in the movie only has like 5 lines and is just there looking all freaked out in all her scenes that's all.Basically the film is pretty confusing like near the end of the movie there's this super complicated backstory about the character Creedence origins and it makes no sense really. Like why did Leta switch the babies was it annoying did she just hate it if she hated the baby she already had why did she switch them out and don't think this will be answered in a future movie because the only person who knows about all of this is dead right when I was starting to like her character or at least her appearance because she's super good looking but now she's dead.The old characters are back again and they're all ok. Eddie Reedmen is good as Newt he still does a good jib but he kind of feels out of place in this movie and his creatures don't really do anything besides cause some comic relief and for his one platypus like creature to steel something in the end.Tina is back she's played by that character in aliens who everyone thought was Riplys mom. She's fine but I just kind of forgot she was in the movie a lot until the last third.Jake and Queenie are but I have some issues with them. Jake doesn't really play any real role in the movie he doesn't really even do any as funny as in the first movie but he's still enjoyable to watch so I want critic to much about him now. But Queenie oh Queenie oh my god. She becomes a bad guy in the movie and its just so stupid and happens just out of nowhere, and all those parts where she cries are super cringe why can't people not make crying not cringe like come on they made Gamora's crying not cringe why not QueenieDespite all the marketing Dumbledore doesn't really anything in the movie. Jude Law still does a good job as the character I can definitely see him as a young Dumbledore but its just that he doesn't really do anything to motivate the story. He appears at the beginning than at the middle and at the end that is all.And now we get to the main antagonist Grindelwald. And I thought he was good. He's overpowered and I do like that in a villain but its just that I just don't get him. He's always quiet and slow which is strange because I just thought he was going to do a lot but all he does is make some fire and kill of a attractive character I wanted to see more of.In the end Fantastic Beasts 2 is a fun movie still theres still a lot of action especially near the end and the special effects are good. Thats why I give it 6 out of 10. I still think this movie is still flawed and at the end of the day Nagini is just standing in that corner all freaked out looking and Im just there sitting in the audience yelling in my head.TURN INTO A SNAKE AGAIN!!!!I do hope you enjoy this movie and I will dare to spoil the twist at the end.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
395,Rageypoo,"It's OK, but not on the level of the original series",7,16 February 2019,"I know this has probably been said before, but the movie just isn't going to ever be Harry Potter. The reason that film was so interesting for so long is because everything was new, and the characters were kids. It's hard to follow a movie filled with adults that is based on a call to adventure with magic. The plot is just far too grown up for us to be enthralled.Newt is a rather tired character and so are his creatures, there is only so far these characters can go before we grow weary of them. The biggest seller of the movie was obviously Dumbledore and the chance at seeing what the magic world was like long before the reign of the ""Slytherin heir"" comes. The problem is this really doesn't bring much insight into the world of magic any more than fantastic beasts did, at least for most of the movie.There are parts in it that ramp up and they do a good job but it's not the same magic as HP delivers. Grindelwald however I feel did a great job and wasn't too over the top or hard to believe and I found the few twists that were in the story was interesting at least. I dunno...it just leaves you wanting more which is ok for being the second movie in an otherwise long series, but each HP movie always had an interesting story of its own to tell, where as this one didn't feel like it did, it was more of a continuation of the first and it's still not over with.I wont give it a bad rating but I'd say it doesn't live up to any expectations and there were some plot holes that need to be filled. I would say the animation and effects were much better than the first one at least in some parts, so that's something to look forward to. I'm hoping moving forward this series really starts diving into core characters and gives them some serious development and backstory because they are far too interesting to leave out like they did in this one. Grindelwald is interesting sure but the other characters are basically forgetable aside from he and dumbledore.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
396,mshackletonchavez,Most Disappointing Film Of The Year.,2,1 December 2018,"Truly horrendous. Easily the most disappointing film I have seen all year, on a fundamental level this film was flawed, the primary culprit bing J.k Rowling and the extreme amounts of creative dominance she must have been given in the writing process.First, I must praise certain aspects of this motion picture, although there is little to commend. The performances were for the most part a strength (Although some let the side down), most notably Jude Law as Albus Dumbledore was wonderful as the caring, charming and more complex young Dumbledore. In addition to this, I must comment that Johnny Depp was a surprisingly positive cast member, also Eddie Redmayne was alright, a little overdone on the mumbling aspect but still a pleasure to see. The rest of the cast was fairly competent with the exception of those that will be stated later on.The screenplay of this film, what can I say. I have only negatives to deliver on this aspect. I can only image that what occurred was similar to George Lucas during the Star Wars Prequels - constantly surrounded by people who would only say 'Yes' to all the decisions. Because they are the one who mad the great original series, surely they can do no wrong. Oh how history has repeated Itself.This screenplay fails on the basic fundamentals of story telling, show don't tell. Most of this picture is two hours of continuous uninteresting drear, badly written with actors struggling to convey the poor choices and dialogue delivered by Rowling. I may be mistaken but in one scene in particular, in Hogwarts, Theseus Scamander gets called a 'Weasley' - If this is memory is true, it is symbolic of the shoddiness and laziness of the screenplay and many of the the basic failures of this film.The film follows two almost entirely unconnected threads, one of Credence and the other of Scamander. Both are boring, and the juxtaposition between them is jarring and fuel for confusion. The Credence plot-line is particularly of failure, it is highly unclear and unexplained, and is just 45 minutes of useless meandering with no emotional impact or significance to the plot as a whole. I even found Ezra Miller to almost seem as of he was struggling to even portray this incredibly bland, standard and boring character. I am one who knows a fair amount about the Harry Potter universe and at first I even didn't get the Nagini reference, until she became a snake in a very unnecessary and out of the blue scene, for she has zero effect upon even Credences story, I cant remember if she spoke a single line, and was so badly delivered by her actress by the fault of Rowling's screenplay.Newt Scamander's plot-line was almost equally as uninteresting and badly executed, for in his plotline, he barely does anything. Once could have removed Tina, Jacob, Queenie, Leta Lestrange, Theseus, Yusuf and Abernathy and the plot-line would have ended in petty much exactly the same place. It is overcrowded, and it is truly a waste of acting talent. For all these performers are of a high caliber and here do nothing. All these characters were uninteresting with the exception of Queenie who had a somewhat interesting arc but was executed badly due to Rowlings screenplay, this singular arc had much more potential.This plot-line is extremely convoluted, Newt Scamander has just over an hour of screen time, despite this being his movie, he is surprisingly not in it a great deal. There is one scene in particular which evokes my mention of the lack of the basic ""show don't tell"" fundamental of story telling. In this scene Leta Lestrange, Yusuf and the rest of the gang excluding Queenie, they use flashbacks to explain a plot thread about one characters lineage. It is extremely convoluted, and involves the Titanic, forced exposition and some complain about forced diversity (In making one of the Lestrages Black) but I dot not say that is a valid criticism. Overall this is supposed to tie up and be an evocative emotional moment for the majority of the characters in the narrative, but as the characters had little to no initial characterisation, the convolutedness only adds to the boredom, as the audience simply does not care for what is being presented, as well as how it is just exposition bing vomited at the audience, it is flimsy, boring and at the most fundamental bad film making, and entirely undefendable.As a result, all of the new characters introduced in this feature hold no significance to the plot, nor are emotionally invested in, thus a waste of time. In addition to this, Jacob is fairly wasted in this feature, he doesn't grow as a character and simply tags along like a fish out of water that is no longer funny for the most part. Although the running salamander joke was effective, but this was his sole contribution to the film, all he does is look shocked or hold buckets.Tina Goldstein played by Katherine Waterston is absolutely wasted as both a character and an actress. Such promise laid in this films precursor and yet contributes nothing to this feature, she had no function to the story nor any emotional impact on the audience at all. A total waste of Katherine Waterston who is a great talent in other motion pictures.Gellert Grindelwald was played by Johnny Depp. And wow, what a mixed bag, one the one had he was handled well by Depp however in terms of characterisation and villainy, Rowling has really let the side down. Apart from the reasonably good opening scene, Grindelwald is unthreataning, bland and disappears for large chunks of the narrative. Fo a film which bares his name, he was hardly the focal point (Nor was Newt Scamander, thus who is the foci of this film?) Grindelwald flat out says he doesn't want to kill muggles, or hurt them, so why is he a threat? What are his crimes? All the characters simply talk about how bad he was, it is never shown apart from one cliche scene of killing a family, it hold little emotional wight or significance. Once again this flaw falls on Rowling and fundamental rule of ""Show don't tell"". Which I needn't divulge again. But this displays the fatal flaw of this film, how it fails on a very basic level, to deliver a crude, boring, uninteresting and convoluted product. In addition to this, Rowling includes very unsubtle Anti-Trump undertones which when delivered well can be thought provoking but in this film, are not delivered well and give an even more jarring and convoluted third act.Now in must explore the screenplay as a whole. Of the greatest holes in the consistency of this feature is its two concurrent plots. For they are strenuously linked and are left unexplained, this results in headache, confusion and boredom. Nothing is resolved by the end, since there was no real problem at the beginning either, it feels like over two hours of useless meandering just propped up by bad hints to earlier greater works and setting up a future series, and every single film ever made in which isn't focus was to set up more films has been bad. For this film has no describable plot, it's a mess. Unlike other more successful films that have set up a future, such as phase one Marvel or heck even the first Hobbit film, they had discrete narratives of their own, and characters to invest in, this film does not have those fundamentals.The plot-twists of this film are unconvincing and unimaginative and hold no weight other than that hey relate to earlier films. This a lazy trick used by Rowling and is simply bad storytelling. For due to the lack of proper character development or emotional weight, the twists hod, no impact to the audience and thus are simply cheap ploys used by Rowling to try and save the feature, which clearly didn't work on most of the audience.On a technical level, this film holds some good aspects. The sound design and visual effects are for the most part fun and vivid but are fairly standard by modern blockbuster standards. The cinematography though, oh my god, it is terrible. Extreme disorientating closeups then suddenly standard unimaginative angles. It is truly jarring. The colouration is so incredible bland, other than the blue fake dragon at the end, no other image sticks in my head as memorable or even noteworthy or fun. It is almost black and white, so grey and depressing. This doesn't feel like a family friendly fantasy film about fun silly creatures and a Magizoologist, this feels like a fascist take over. If I had children I wouldn't show them this film, its grey, boring and jarring, all things unsuitable for young children over great distances of time.As a result of the abhorrently bland cinematography and colour palette, the costume design, set design, makeup and visual effects all suffer. The image becomes flat, uninteresting, after the last film won the Academy Award (Oscar) for Costume Design, this colouration choice really does an injustice to this achievement, and to the hard work the costume designers must have gone to to trump their previous achievement. Nothing about this films image is good, its truly a mistake and must be fixed if people are to remember any future instalments, or find them fun. For this blandness works against the film, it is not stylish but instead is boring. Not like 'Schindler's List' which was in almost pure B&W which gave the film character or more recently the film 'Her' which used a lot of red hues to heighten the loving and bemused atmosphere. This film has no clear focus as to what its colouration/cinematography was seeking to achieve. For if it seeks to be dark, it belongs not in a film called 'Fantastic Beasts', the pathetic fallacy fails on a fundamental level, the semantic's do not match up. This film sis so confused in so many aspects. Even the score was completely unremarkable and completely forgettable, I cant remember a single part of it. Showing that its only function was to dictate emotion, not to heighten or compliment it as a good score does. 2/10.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

398,zain-nov,everyone involved in the movie made sure that they all do go wrong.,4,19 November 2018,"I went with almost no expectations after lukewarm first movie, but J. K. Rowling along with David Yates still manage to disappoint me. Grindlewald starts off with a brilliant sequence but within that you could see that the director does not have that grip and lacks the crunch. A promise which is thrown soon after.Rowling needs to understand that writing a movie is different than writing a novel. You can't keep it that slow and almost no character development is offered in the movie that's why. Much like it's ancestor series, Grindlewald hardly did not lose any of the character from the first movie even though strict criticism over the talentless cast.
Here is what is wrong with the movie
1. Baggage of the first movie
As said earlier, fans failed to identify with almost all of the lead characters from the first movie. It was needed to drop some of the characters (Jacob atleast) but next movie kept them on even though Tine, Queenie and Jacob play no role in story. Even new characters don't help much. Dumbledore, Theseus and Nagini are merely decorative items. Someone should tell the producers that the beasts are not as interesting as they think and presenting them. Neither are they cute not funny and no one wants to see them. People want the darker tone and a better goal (not credence again).2. Who to follow
Although movie is flooded with the characters but there is a confusion who is real protagonist. Series started with Newt, but his role and contribution has diminished to only avoiding direct eye contact. Dumbledore was expected to have a strong role but he has only an extended guest appearance.3. Marvel's Formula
Harry Potter has always casted diverse actors but here it was diverse too much. Much of the cast was unnecessarily ethnic. Smaller roles to only bring some interest or color in the story were played by international actors. Also this single movie has more special effects then all of the 8 Harry potter movies combined. Many of the actors are in 20's or 30's. It can't be swallowed that there is not mature aurar on the team. Everyone is just out of school and holding a high rank and important position in ministry. On the other hand, they were too old for kids to connect with.4. Weak writing
Screenplay is vague and even by the end one is not sure what's Gindlewald's real motive. May be it was explained in the novels but not in the movie which audience came to watch. Last movie ended with Gindlewald's capture and this started with his escape, that was too quick to digest. He was shown to be very strong and powerful from the start of the movie which should have been a work in progress. A slow escape and gradual raise to the power involving obtaining of a special object to cast a citywide curse which would kill that many aurars. Instead they kept Ginglewald doing nothing after escape and in climax (which was hard to identify) Gindlewald casts a spell so massive to kill a lot of powerful wizards.
5. Waste
Like Harry Potter, we don't have ""Cream of British Film Industry"" but we do have ""Johnny Depp"" an actor known for his vast versatility and what a waste. He never was given a chance to show his true colors (especially with all white makeup). Series' fans were against his casting but producers could have benefited from Depp's following which they totally lost as he does nothing out of the box except wearing weird lenses.Still I liked the movie better than the first one as it had a better second half.
Here is what is good with this movie.
1. Jude Law and Zoe Kravitz
Only two actors stood out of the mediocre performance. Jude looked like he studied Michael Gambon very well and transformed his personal accordingly. With all his movement, one can see Michael Gambon's Dumbledore. Zoe had only one chance to shine in the series and she sure did not miss it. She brought much needed depth to her character with mysterious air and elegance.2. Magical effects
For fans, it would be satisfying to see there are a lot of magical sequence.When you are directing a movie after a fan favorite series, a lot of things could go wrong, and in case of Grindlewald, everyone involved in the movie made sure that they all do go wrong.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
399,letande,Surprisingly nice.,8,16 November 2018,"I had a lot of problems with previous movie. Like... A LOT. It was extremely stylish with all those coats, hats, haircuts, 1926 New York and other stuff that used to make the movie look so charming. Unfortunately, the entire thing was ultimately one big Doctor Who rip-off. Wands were a nice replacement to the sonic screwdriver, Newt Scamander looked and acted almost exactly like the 11th Doctor (Matt Smith), while his briefcase (which was bigger on the inside) was pretty much the copy of TARDIS. And to make things worse, the plot was pretty meh. Characters were extremely likeable, but there was no big drama and no big plot twists. Just some cute love stories and a funny guy with briefcase full of ""fantastic beasts"". Which felt pretty nice in 3D on the big screen, but at home... those were not enough to make you want to re-watch the movie again and again like the old Potter movies did. Personally, I expected the same from sequel. I was wrong.Fantastic Beasts 2 turned out to be a huge improvement over the first movie. And not only because the atmosphere is totally different here. Fantastic Beasts 2 feels more like the late Potter movies. With dark colors and depressive mood, but that's just the tone. What makes it better for real is the fact that it is not afraid to play with the lore and give us a lot of plot twists. I mean, what made the Potter stories so charming was 100% British atmosphere of mystery. Where the simple teacher was able to turn out to be a villain, while the villain... well, you know the story better than I do, I'm sure of it. Anyway, the first Fantastic Beasts, aside from other things, missed exactly that. And Fantastic Beasts 2 brings it all back. Even though most of the movie will take place in France, that exact feeling of British mysteries is back and that alone is enough for me to like the movie. Can't say that it gets close enough to Harry Potter's plot twists, but... it's sure a step into the right direction.Drama is also back. Remember Cedric Diggory and that ""Noooooooo!"" moment from the Goblet of Fire? Fantastic Beasts 2 has something very close to it. It was even able to surprise me at one point. The cost was the fact that a certain character feels pretty strange now, since it's hard to see the entire motivation, but still, it was a very interesting move. It's not that simple, though, since the entire plot is pretty much a bunch of twists and revelations, so, for some people it may feel like there's lack of something bigger. Like... you know, the main plot. For example, Goblet of Fire had some twists and revelations too, but there was a Goblet of Fire to play the leading role. Here... it's a lot like Goblet of Fire without Goblet of Fire. If you know what I mean. A lot of twists, a lot of big revelations, a lot of lore, but kind of not enough main story to give all that a proper form. Not the biggest problem out there, at least in my opinion, but still, it's a problem.Thankfully, Fantastic Beasts 2 stepped away from being Doctor Who rip-off. All elements are still there, but now they're just that - the elements. It's not like we have Doctor Newt with his Sonic Wand, TARDIS briefcase and a bunch of companions anymore. Fantastic Beasts 2 feels more like Harry Potter and that's a good thing. Well, at least for majority of viewers. For die hard Harry Potter fans... there's a lot of very confusing things. Fantastic Beasts 2 breaks the old lore in many places and in many places it makes a lot of weird mistakes. For example, in this movie we'll see character who wasn't even supposed to be born yet. How? Why? Is it actually a relative? Why no proper explanation? Those who just watched the movies won't even notice all that, but die hard fans of the source material may feel a bit confused. And still, I feel that it was all worth it. Just because the movie feels more interesting thanks to all that.And it looks beautiful too. It shows us France, but not in a mainstream way. I mean, most of the movies just show us the Eiffel Tower, while this one actually discovers something more interesting and uses it for its purposes. Beasts still look amazing, 3D is better than before, etc, etc, etc. Even the soundtrack knows exactly how to play with our hearts.So... yeah, Fantastic Beasts 2 is better than the first movie. In every place possible. As a casual viewer, I'm glad that Harry Potter's world is bigger now and got its old charm back at the same exact time. Sure, it's still not good ol' Harry and sure, hardcore fans may be confused here and there, but... it's a charming and interesting movie for those who like the setting.

401,s-maniatopoulos,A JK Rowling creation.,8,20 February 2019,"It seems I may be the minority voice, but I felt that the first ""Fantastic Beasts"" movie was devoid of plot, personality and came alive only during its last ten minutes. I thought it had no pace, and it left me with the impression that it didn't know what kind of movie it wanted to be.Contrarily, the 2nd installment reminded me of the complexity and plot richness that was found at the latter Potter books, starting from the Goblet of Fire and all the way to the Deathly Hallows.In my opinion, the basic flaw of this movie is the heavy useb of CGI, especially in the final battle, which seems out of place and not very wizard-like. This, however, did not spoil the overall experience for me.In my humble opinion, what most reviewers identified as ""lack of plot in order to set up a franchise"" was rather similar to the complexity of Ms Rowling's writings: a story within a story, a plot hidden inside another plot, and it all comes down to one grand finale that paves the way for the next part of the saga. As such, and given that this is not a book adaptation but an original script, I enjoyed it immensely, and though I may be the minority opinion, I feel that ""Fantastic Beasts"", a franchise that initially (and especially after the first film) seemed like an explicit cash grab, totally devoid of character or even reason of existence other than making its producers, cast and crew richer, has now become an new and exciting JK Rowling work in progress.And I will be very happy to see what Ms Rowling will come up with next!

I'm not a die-hard harry potter fan but I like the atmosphere.This movie's atmosphere, visuals, settings and creatures are stunning. The actors are great. But then it feels like this movie is stretched so long to just ""hang out in the universe"" and probably make 3 or 4 movies out of it instead.While there are many different story lines that are thrown up in the air (love, act of love, betrayal, seeking purpose, loyalty, ...) it becomes segmented and is not further persisted. There is a scene where two lovers admit to their love, but the emotion isn't conveyed. The visual effect of their environment seems to overshadowed the deep passionate and conflicted emotion that could've been in this moment. The entire movie is filled with these moments that ultimately disengage you with the characters as everything is so sterile.The buildup of the movie, then, becomes effectively a slideshow of beautiful scenes. Where all the attention goes to glitter and fire animation. Where the actors just float in between without integrated purpose. As if you're on a animatronic ride in Disney Land or a linear progression 3D game world towards a hook for the ""next episode"".So see this movie if you have time to spare and like the universe.

It felt disjointed and there was no substance. The visual effects are stunning. Eddie Redmayne and Jude Law are brilliant in their roles. I feel they cast the wrong person in Johnny Depp, he doesn't give a vibe to the character like he had done in other roles in the past that he has done. It's too forced. The whole movie is forced and felt rushed. What a failure for the franchise and most importantly as the second instalment of Fantastic Beasts. Any future films for this franchise, I'll wait to watch on the TV rather than going to the cinema.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

408,RAMALAX,What happened,3,1 December 2019,I actually really liked the first movie. Probably a 7/10. But this movie is just boring af. It is also really confusing. I have read all the books two times and watched the movies multiple times and I still had a hard time following the plot of this movie. The ending twist does not make any sense. Just bad.

411,linhchi-1993,Love it,10,16 November 2018,"I actually love the plot of this ""fantastic beasts"" sequel. It's mature and dark and deep with stunning visual screenplay and outstanding performances. Indeed everyone've known the wizarding world, i am not talking much about that, the beasts're absolutly beautiful and well designed in every details, maybe that's because i'm a cat lover. And again, Niffler stole the spotlight.
I love how the story has been developing so far. The whole story of the 1st installment was given us a background about our main beloved characters, the whole story of the 2nd installment has been going deeper to the main ""dumbledore and grinderwald conflict "" thing, and credence, i once thought that this character was unnecessary but mannnnnnn, he was the one that built a link the next installment.
I love Newt, Leta, Grinderwald and DUMBLEDORE. love this Character through each and every HP universe movies and the way they exploited another ankle of dumbledore story as well as his background.
The visual was stunning, as always. The beasts we're fantastic, as always.
And the first thing I thought when I walked out was ""man I gotta wait for another 12 months, at least, to see the next one? "".",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
412,Kajohns49,Muddled,4,14 July 2019,"Definitely a filler movie. Lots of exposition but not much of import happens. The special effects are very good, acting is excellent but the story is just filler until the end then its ""huh?""
Spoiler here: It is revealed that the baby LeStrange was swapped out for a random child (Credence) before the ship sank. Then Grindenwald tells Credence he is Dumbledore's brother how can that work according to the Dumbledore family timeline and besides that what are the odds that the LeStrange and Dumbledore baby would be on the same ship?
Then the movie ends. I saw this online and actually checked that it was really over and not a glitch. Huh?",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
413,Mikheil-H,It's amazing how a bad script can tank a film!,3,14 November 2020,"The wizarding world returns with the sequel to the spinoff based off a textbook for the 8-film long series based on a 7-book long best-selling franchise. Is there still life in this universe? Or is it time to leave Hogwarts and the magic behind for good?Our returning guide into this world is Eddie Redmayne's forever charming Newt Scamander who is on the hunt for Johnny Depp's Grindelwald. There is a mix of new and returning characters such as Ezra Miller's Credence, Katharine Waterson's Tina Goldstein and Jude Law's younger Dumbledore. Matched with fantastic and ingenious visual effects this a-list cast gives life to this ever-expanding world.However, this film has a flaw, and it is the writing. JK Rowling wrote the script for this film and it is a messy, convoluted and overstuffed story that has a few too many plot-twists which, according to many ""Potterheads"", contradicts the lore. There is a good story in the film somewhere, or more accurately, there are about three good stories piled into it. The problem is there are too many characters with their own stories that the film keeps harshly cutting to. As a result, you only see one character move forward with their story, then not see them again for another half an hour, meaning it is difficult to keep track of the various plots that play out. Furthermore, the ending sets up the next film and encourages a far more interesting plot, which, in my opinion, is the story Rowling wanted to write. Unfortunately, she had to write this mess to get the characters to the correct place.However, the film does have positives in the form of the effects and acting. Whilst there are not as many Beasts as the title implies, the visuals are still top notch, especially any scene involving France's version of Diagon Alley. Plus, thankfully, the magic battles have evolved beyond the wizards pointing at each other as hard as they can and turned into wizards being more creative as well as being a visual treat. Furthermore, the majority of the cast play a beautifully nuanced version of witches and wizards, although I am not quite sold yet on Jude Law's Dumbledore.I confess, I am not a huge Harry Potter fan, I have read all the books and seen all the films, but it's universe has not captured me as much as others. Despite this, I have enjoyed the majority of the franchise, including the first Fantastic Beasts, however this film was a disappointment for me. Ultimately, the film is a set up for another sequel, and whilst it introduces interesting plot lines, it takes way too long to get there and wastes too many opportunities. For example, I am not normally a fan of obligatory love interests, however a character is introduced and is perfect for Newt but is completely side-lined for another character who has no chemistry with our lead at all.Fundamentally, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald acts like a crime epic but fails to realise that's not its purpose. Despite strong acting, spot on visuals and a beloved established universe, Fantastic Beasts unfortunately is not the chosen one and will more likely be the film that must not be named.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
414,aaakarunarathna,Noo,6,10 May 2020,Movie could not live up to the expected standard. Couldnt find the quality and the feeling of realism we found In Harry Potter movies. This is too much I believe,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
415,huey2088,Just like a soap opera with touch of PC,4,18 December 2018,"I never got into the Harry Potter's stories. After reading the first three books, I gave up having no stomach for the repetitiveness and glaring mistakes in plotlines. I didn't bother to watch the third HP movie and beyond that either. So I decided to give Fantastic Beasts a go. The first movie was fun and enjoyable. I can't say the same for Crimes because it seems to distance itself from that movie to make its way back to Harry Potter.At the half way mark, I became really bored and couldn't care less about the characters anymore. This is because the film is moving towards a climax which I already predicted will be in the fifth movie - the biggest duel between two wizards of all time. Until it gets there, this film is busy trying to explain where Credence played by Ezra Miller comes from as well as other characters' history that are already established in the Potter serie. The explanation of Credence's upbringing bizarrely involves the Lestrange family. Meanwhile the four main characters, Newt (Redmayne), Tina (Waterston), her sister Queenie (Sudol) and Jacob (Fogler) attempts to develop their love stories but with so much action and other subplots going on, they don't get a lot of chance time to do so.Having written so many characters for Harry Potter and then trying to create a related wizardry world that took place decades prior was going to be complicated. I wiki some of the Crimes characters just to clear up the confusion. It seems the mistakes that put me off HP have appeared in this movie again. Rowling has either decided to change the timeline of events in HP or she's made glaring errors that she'd hoped no one will notice. For example, Crimes show briefly the young Professor McGonagall (Glascott) with a clear Dame Maggie Smith voice and tone. However in the Potter franchise, her birthday stated that she would have only been a child at the events of Grindelwald but here she is and confirmed by Rowling to be the very Minerva, an adult already teaching at Hogwarts.The explanation and climax about who Credence actually is towards the end had me rolling my eyes in disbelief. There is no way Credence can be the brother to Dumbledore given Albus' complex family events. How Credence happen to be an infant on the boat bound for America and the massive age difference leaves a lot of questions. But since it is like a soapie there are more twists that are more than necessary and more will come no doubt. The likelihood is that Credence is probably the offspring between Dumbledore (Law) and Grindelwald (Depp) but in trying to draw out to the fifth movie, Rowling naturally had to make it more complicated. I will hate having to watch poor Credence be told that he's almost killed his father or mother in Dumbledore.It's a common feature now to include actors from different culture because of the diversity representation movement. So you see a character that is Asian or African with mediocre contribution, one is left wondering if it's necessary to include them. Take Nagini (Kim) who apart from CGI scenes where she violently transforms into a giant snake doesn't do much else except frowns, breathes deeply and shouts ineffectively at Credence. Krall (Sakurai) has even less to offer. Being initially part of Grindelwald's gang sulking away, he eventually tries to kill him but ends up perishing in the dark lord's magic flames.The whole Grindelwald uprising is clearly about the rise of Hitler's Third Reich. At the cemetery gathering, his followers can be heard saying, ""Mein Fuhrer"" as most of them appear in grey coats and knee high boots. Scenes in black and white of rolling tanks and cities in ruins leave little to the imagination. This is clearly indicating that there will be more epic battles between good and evil to come.Crimes of Grindelwald is too hectic with nothing new to offer. The main actors are great but unfortunately the CGI has taken up a lot of screen time. A bad indication that a movie's plot and script are rather unimportant. Where Rowling tries to make it more interesting, there are plot holes and confusion instead. Thank goodness, the next film will be years away because the soap opera pace and more twists than ever have left me unimpressed.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
416,mikethieme,Great addition to the Wizarding World movies.,9,11 January 2019,I thought this movie was great!

There's lots of story to get stuck into and lots of magic!,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
417,gigitville,So much missed potential,3,20 November 2018,"This is the first movie I walked out of. Believe me, I didn't want to have to, but my god. I didn't care about anything that was going on, it felt so sloppy and lazy with countless short cuts plot wise, and they ignored every opportunity to be creative with the interesting source material.
Again, I had to leave about an hour and twenty minutes in, so I can't speak for that last fifty minutes, but the movie up until that point was just so lazy and ordinary. The opening scene could've been done so well with the chase scene in a lightning storm, instead it was just borderline epilepsy inducing. The plot was aimless and had countless tangents that barely had anything to do with the main plot. The movie avoided interesting character moments at all cost, playing into the capitalization of the Harry Potter brand and not caring about much else. Every possible conflict within the film was easily fixed: The bowtruckle can easily get Tina, Newt, and Jacob out of the sewer they were trapped minutes after being trapped, Newt has some dust stuff that shows exactly the interaction between Tina and Yusef that he needed to see. That brings me to another thing that made me upset; the magic aspect. There's so much potential to have creative and cool uses of magic in this universe, but this film is satisfied with just zapping from place to place and projecting a smoky image. And there are still limitations and rules regarding magic from the Harry Potter movies that are ignored! And don't get me started on the ill-treatment of characters in this. Queenie's character was so different than the first movie, in a bad way. And for Newt and Jacob, it seemed they just took what people liked about them in the first movie and amped it up to the point of annoyance.
There were some things I liked, kind of. Newt's huge basement of worlds and creatures in his apartment was great, too bad it was only used in two scenes. There was a scene where Grindelwald killed two people and took their apartment (for no real reason besides showing he's the bad guy) but it was filmed as a tracking shot from outside the windows. That was a pretty inventive way to film. Um...Eddie Redmayne is great. That's about it.
Ugh. This universe has so much potential, and it upsets me that the filmmakers were just fine with skating by, doing the bare minimum. Details didn't matter, it seemed. It makes it worse for me personally that the director of this also directed my favorite Harry Potter movie; Order of the Phoenix. How did he go from that to this?",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

It can be interesting but DO NOT MIX IT ALL..and I like the fact that they kept Jamie Campbell Bower as the young Grindelwald as we saw him in Harry Potter7 Part 1 when he stole the Elder Wand !

419,hetalkstoangles,A dreary and disappointing money grab,4,24 November 2018,"I enjoyed the first movie but at best, this one was 'meh'.Basically, this movie was way too long on CGI, and way too short on plot. There weren't a lot of important events but the few did occur, were telegraphed long in advance so pretty much nothing was a surprise.In fact, the biggest surprise was that this movie had almost nothing to do with any Fantastic Beasts. Sure... we saw some interesting CGI critters, but they were treated as accessories... pretty, but not very consequential. At best, they were background, playing no role in moving along the strained story line...such as it was.****SPOILER ALERT****There was a very forced plot twist where Queenie switches sides for absolutely no reason other than to elicit something in the way of emotion from the audience... and it almost worked but only because there was absolutely nothing suspenseful about anything else in the movie. They pointlessly turned a complex, interesting character into a pitiful, simpering waif as if flipping switch.The acting was universally wooden and everyone looked bored for most of it. Come to think of it, the best acting came from the CGI characters. Even though they contributed nothing to the plot, without them the movie would have been completely lifeless and colorless.it was so transparent, by 10 minutes in, you knew exactly how the movie would end.Even the 3D effects were ho-hum. I generally think most 3D effects are little more than a distraction but these ones were especially uninspired.More than anything, this movie felt like filler. It was an empty shell... merely a cynical way to glean more cash from fans while they wait for the interesting movie to get made.The first movie was fun. This one just wasn't.

While it may not be fair to compare both the series, the second installment of Fantastic Beasts crammed too much of Harry Potter in it, that it forgot about its own characters and story.Pros
The score was fantastic, the casting was perfect and it bought back a lot of memories. The action was amazing (opening sequence was one of the best I have ever seen). The visuals were gorgeous and mesmerising. The characters are lovely and honestly, the characters are the reason I watched this film.Cons :The entirety of the movie was sloppy and many scenes were badly executed. Some of the best characters in the first movie are not the centre of attention and are barely there in the movie. Sometimes, it felt like watching a play where there were more plots and more reveals and the movie wanted to run badly on the 'shock factor'. The chemistry between the characters was off , unlike the first film.Final review : A wonderful movie which may have taken itself too far. Worth a watch , but watch it on 2020 along with the third film as the ending may not be satisfactory.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
427,lmadorski,Pretty disappointed,3,16 November 2018,"(Upfront, I'm sorry for any misspellings)
I'm under the belief that there hasn't been a bad film in the Harry Potter franchise. At worst, they're enjoyable, so I would definitely say I'm a fan of these movies. However, I haven't read any of the books(though I do own them). I've always remembered the movies way more, they're kind of like another Star Wars to me. So when I say that Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is a bad movie, you have to understand that it's coming from someone who really wanted to say it was good. I'm not saying there isn't good stuff in here, because I think there is a good amount.
First off, Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander really works for me. I like his charm and he's a protagonist that I enjoy watching. Dan Fogel also continues to be a highlight, being the comedic relief character, a character that could go completely wrong but ends up keeping me entertained. In terms of new inclusions, Jude Law was amazing as Dumbledoor. There was a specific moment where it felt exactly like a younger version of him, but also took on a while new personality, seeing a new side to him that we haven't before. Most of the other performances were fine, though one stood out as not bad, but kind of disappointing in Johnny Depp's Grindelwald. Without spoiling anything, there was a certain piece of information that he reveals that is really important. However, I couldn't hear a thing he was saying because he mumbled the line. I asked my friend after the movie and he didn't understand it either, so good thing I was with someone who uses a closed captioned device so I knew what he said. Other than that, I thought his performance was fine.
I would get into the characters themselves right now, but I would like to save that for when I go into the story. However, I would like to talk about Grindelwald, though if you want to remain completely free of what some would call spoilers, I would recommend skipping this section. I found there to be a significant flaw with his character, that being I don't know why he's doing what he's doing. I'm only told he's a really dangerous guy without being shown or actually finding out WHY he's a dangerous guy. I'm going to get into some more topics along these lines later, but I wanted to mention that while I was talking about Johnny Depp.
Music is great as always and that's all I can say on that. The score always feels magical. Directing is also great as always.
Okay, now I want to get into the issue of this movie. That's the story, or the lack of one. The best way I can describe this movie is that it begins as a normal movie, has the exposition and goes from there. Here's the thing: it never GOES from there, it just keeps giving us some exposition, and most of it feels useless. It's just a bunch of events that happen but don't add up to anything. I honestly don't think there is a plot in this movie, it's only trying to set up for the next one. So when I brought up the characters, I mentioned I couldn't talk about them because I don't think they have any arch's, at least they have no visible growth. I think this reflects the nonexistent story because it adds to absolutely nothing going on. When I say that, I think it's an exaggeration, because there's a lot that happens, but it's almost impossible to follow. Now I do know people are saying it's hard to follow(which is true), but I feel like people think they can't follow it because they aren't big on Harry Potter, which I disagree with. The plot is just that messy.
Wrapping this up, I like the characters(some of them anyway), music, and directing. However, the plot(or lack of one) is so bad that I can't bring myself to recommend this movie to anyone. I was honestly kind of sad that I gave this movie a 3/10, and you could say ""just move it up"", but I don't feel like I can. In my objective opinion(if that makes sense), I think this movie is bad, and I don't know if I can watch it again.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
428,nguyenbakhanhbicondova,The worst installment of The Wizarding World (so far),4,17 November 2018,"The Harry Potter books and films, like many people, are something very special to me. They were a big part of my childhood and their brilliance doesn't show any sign of being forgotten, if anything, the franchise is more popular than ever. Every single one of us has something, maybe a book, a film, a song that we know is not without flaws but we still enjoy it anyway despite that, we choose to ignore the downsides and focus only on the positives. Most notably for me is a small show called How I met your mother, chances are you've heard of it. I know it's not perfect, I can see why people dislike the last few seasons, but I choose to give it a pass for all the joy I get from watching the show. And it was the same case with The Wizarding World, I found enjoyment in every single film, you can say I loved them blindly. However, there's still a line, there's still a limit of how far you can take that.And this movie crossed that line.I'll keep this short since I think everyone should see the film to have their own opinion.Credit where credit is due, this is a beautiful looking film, David Yates nailed the cinematography as always, the creatures were entertaining to watch and the acting of everyone was solid too. Those are basically the only things I liked about this movie. My biggest problem with The Crimes of Grindelwald is its story: this was 2 hours of nothingness, scene after scene with exposition but no real story, characters just moved around places without really doing anything. On a structural level, this film was a freaking disaster, no one had any arc, the film was convoluted with small plot points and twists, also the pacing was incoherent. This film undermined the ending of the first Fantastic Beasts and messed with the mythology of Harry Potter as a whole. In addition, there were some really bad editing choices which just made everything even more confusing. Plus, for a movie called Fantastic Beasts, the beasts played a very small part, and it's not like they were that important in the first movie. It's like Age of Ultron with the ''Age'' lasted a couple of days. I also didn't care for any character, not a single one, and that's saying something because I loved the main cast from the first film ( except for Tina), it didn't help that the romance was so damn terrible. The most useless character has to be Nagini though, you can cut her and plenty of other things out and everything will be exactly the same.This movie reminds me of Doctor Strange: a film about magic without the magical feeling. It was slow, boring, pointless and only served as a set up for future movies, and it did a terrible job at that. Me and my Potterhead friend walked out of this movie feeling nothing ( well, that was just me actually, she was pissed ), and in some ways that's worse than feeling betrayed or insulted or whatever a bad movie does to you.It hurts me to say that this is the first film of The Wizarding World that deserves a below average score, and I don't look forward to the future movie one bit.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

There was no story to this film at all, it was all for the sake of making more money really.No character background given to any great extent, so I really didn't feel the emotions that were expected when certain characters died and why bring back the main characters from the first Fantastic Beasts film when they literally did nothing??? It was just for the sake of keeping them involved.There was also no focus on these fantastic beasts. The whole movie just focused on being linked to the Harry Potter movies as much as possible by adding (not so) subtle links like with the philosophers stone. Also, there should have been more of a back story to the love story of Dumbledore and Grindelwald as this basically painted them out to be really good friends l.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

442,VVMini,"Falls into the same traps as the first movie, but solidly entertaining nonetheless",7,29 November 2018,"""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" suffers from many of the same problems as its predecessor. Those problems mainly stem from an identity crisis, in that it does not really know what it wants to be, and the tone of the movie is therefore all over the place. It wants to be a more kid-friendly movie about cute magical beasts that cause all kinds of mischief, while at the same time being a dark and gritty tale that works as a prequel to the Harry Potter series. What it does better than the first movie, is that those two different worlds gel better in ""Crimes of Grindelwald"", and feel less like two completely separated storylines awkwardly mashed together. The actions of Newt Scamander are much more closely related to the Grindelwald storyline than it did before.However, the movie still struggles to balance all the different storylines it presents, and those storylines still awkwardly converge to the same story point. Their main purpose is to get the characters in the same place at the same time, and the plot stumbles forward at a snail's pace. If you look at the ""main"" storyline, that of Grindelwald's rise to power, there really is barely anything that happens in the 2+ hour runtime. It starts with Grindelwald escaping, and ends with him summoning potential followers and having a showdown with our protagonists. Those two events could easily be much closer to each other in a more focused and less bloated movie, but it feels like Rowling had to cram in a lot of somewhat irrelevant things in order to fill the runtime and make room for the other three movies that are still planned in this series. Also, for a movie sub-titled ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" there really is very little to no focus on those crimes.All of those things being said, I still found myself very much enjoying this movie. It was a bit meandering at times, and somewhat light on action, but what action there was, once again looked stunning. It did a great job of expanding on this beautiful magical world, and visually it was quite spectacular. There were enough little nods to the Harry Potter stories we know and love to satisfy me without it feeling solely as fan service.The individual storylines, while together lacking focus, on their own were engaging enough to keep me interested all throughout the movie. I enjoyed all the interactions between the main characters, and all the actors did a great job. Special props to Johnny Depp, who has gotten a lot of flack for his casting, but in my opinion gave a terrific performance; part sympathetic and part terrifying, which was exactly the point. I wish we had gotten a little more of the Dumbledore-Grindelwald backstory, but I guess the world as a whole is not entirely ready for a central homosexual lovestory in a major blockbuster. For now, we gotta do with some handlocking, and honestly, I'll take what I can get at this point. They handled it delicately and with subtlety, while not ignoring it entirely, and I can't have too many complaints about that.Overall, I went in with somewhat lower expectations due to some of the negativity surrounding the movie, which has worked beneficially to my enjoyment of it. I hope the next movies can learn from the mistakes of its predeccesors and present a more unified story. This is going to be a tricky thing to accomplish since it would need to stray further away from the titular fantastic beasts, but hopefully my faith in Rowling will be rewarded in the end.Falls into the same traps as the first movie, but solidly entertaining nonetheless",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The Crimes of Gridelwald on the other hand is mostly dark and full of dark themes - child abuse, brainwashing, infanticide - make no mistake, while there are a few scenes that happen in Hogwarts it's not the fun filled school you see in any of the Potter movies.

448,hptmbedra,"Ehmm, could we have something interesting happening please?",2,18 November 2018,"I am disappointed even more than after watching the first installment. I hoped the movie makers learned from their mistakes. I expected an interesting plot about Dumbledore and Grindewald, and yes, I wanted to follow an actual plot! But boy, did I want too much? In recent years it certainly seems so.It is hard to see what is the main plot from the movie's point of view. Sure it is named The Crimes of Grindelwald but there is actually very little happening around him. I saw at least 6 story lines which includes the two lovestories, the saving of the animals, Dumbledore's struggle against ministry, Grindewald and his kinda plan to enlist this Credence guy and Credence's struggle to learn about his past together with Nagini (?). All in all we are presented many characters with many twisted interconnections which are very hard to follow and totally distract from the main and cool stuff, which at least for me was supposed to be the interactions between Dumbledore and Grindelwald and their ability to do great magic. I don't care about any awkward love stories or shallow backstories of nobodies goddamnit!And although there are so many characters, there is hardly anything substantial happening on the screen. It is all just sidequests combined with jokes kinda leading to an awkward finale (oh yes, Nazis again). Basically nothing happens between Dumbledore and Grindelwald and Grindelwald hardly does any crimes except for pretending to be Hitler. And at the end you are presented with a bait to watch the next installment - very soap opera like isn't it?The jokes are much more forced than in the first movie. I had the feeling the movie makers desperately wanted to sell this movie both to children and adults, but there are way too many ""story""lines and characters for children and the tone is not serious enough for adults. They try to make the tone darker but every now and then interrupt it with outta place silly jokes. Not good.Also the references felt like being thrown at us without a thought. Yes they show Hogwarts, but they totally lack the atmosphere known from HP. They show Dumbledore teaching, but it is a total rip off of Lupin's lecture. Why they even try to include McGonagall? Or Nagini?Summed up, this movie is a money grab and unfortunately not an exception in today's movie making full of plotless movies. I read somewhere that there will be 5 Fantastic Beasts films in total. If that is true doesn't matter. A movie this long needs to be good by itself, not just a particle which doesn't make sense on its own.

I liked the twist ending of credence being a Dumbledore, and Queenie joining forces with Grindelwald so her and Jacob could be together.

451,obiegimmie,"""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindlewald"": A Slighly Mis-Paced, But Adequately Entertaining Adventure",7,26 November 2018,"I actually think this film is superior to the first one. It doesn't waste much time introducing characters, and the few new characters (namely, Callum Turner as Theseus Scamander, Zoe Kravitz as Leta Lestrange, and, of course, Johnny Depp as Gellert Grindelwald) are introduced cleanly and neatly.One of my biggest issues with the film is its many plot threads. It tries nobly, and partly succeeds, in taking numerous elements and incorporating them into a big plot twist. The problem is that the film struggles in how much time is relegated to these elements. It spends almost half an hour on the romance between Eddie Redmayne's Newt Scamander and Katherine Waterson's Tina Goldstein, a pretty much inconsequential aspect of the film. In fact, that serves as Newt's primary motivation for around half of the film.Newt, I feel, is an exceptionally built protagonist that lacks a comparitively built motivation or reason. Jude Law's Albus Dumbledore is perfectly compelling, due mostly to his character in the books and Law's depiction. Grindlewald is one note, but hopefully they'll expand his character in future installments. And the primary driving point, Crendence Barebone, is expertly managed, if a bit underdeveloped, by Ezra Miller.The visuals are spectacular and the story, though boring in some parts, picks up beautifully at the end.7/1070% (Mostly Fresh)C+",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The problem of this movie is that it has interesting moments but can't focus on what could have made it a potentially great prequel to the franchise by filling it with too many characters and trying to set up the next movie. I'm not saying you shouldn't go see this movie, it's fine but very boring.It's basically just your typical blockbuster sequel. Lack of interesting characters (except for an excellent version of Dumbledore played by Jude Law), a plot so thin but bloated and a script that jolts the viewer from scene to scene without any sort of transition.There's nothing that I could get into in the movie. I tried, I really did. It's a shame that it's very well done on a technical level because it's very well acted, directed and shot. There's some great acting in here and character moments but the actual story seems so pointless and disjointed that I just couldn't care about it.Something like this should like should have been a story between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, put the ministry in there, maybe have Newt help him a bit but because of all the characters from the last movie, the movie goes nowhere.

I am a sucker for all Harry Potter films (and toys)... but to say this movie was terrible is a serious understatement. I felt asleep twice in the movie which is proven to be a cure for my insomnia. The book to movie adaptation is too far stretched. As far as I recalled the book is like an encyclopedia of magical creatures but the movie adaptation is so complex as to involving Grindewald and Dumbledore's ""it's complicated"" relations and freaky Credence constantly (and angrily) looking for his true identity. It's like adapting Hansel and Gretel and linking them to the chain of events that resulted in World War I.Jude Law is the only good thing in the movie. Depp is like recycling his previous roles as Sweeney Todd/ the vampire in the bomb movie or any other roles where he wore a make-up (ok pretty much all of his movies).

BUT! Most importantly, you need to make the decision for yourself.Whilst there are flaws within the film that disrupt HP lore itself, as well as form a slightly weaker narrative, the film is a sign of things to come.
The narrative is interesting, keeps a pace and has some brilliantly placed twists throughout. The film promptly picks up a few months after the events of the first film and doesn't stop. The narrative has a direction from the beginning, the involvement of Grindelwald and Credence getting swept up in the mix as both Newt and Grindelwald pursue him.Visually, the film is brilliant! CGI, cinematography and editing are wonderful and really pick up on the elements of a Wizarding World universe film.Character-wise, whilst some characters feel a little thin, other find their feet and some select few have clear development set up for the entire story arc of the films. Johnny Depp as Grindelwald is astounding, resonating as a villain that can both have a heart and be heartless.Altogether, the film is incredibly enjoyable and stuff the critics! This si a film you have to make your own decision on but most importantly, this film never sets out to be the 'Film of the Year!' it is quite simply a 'fast-food film', something to sit down, watch and take the experience a way with you and , if you happen to enjoy it, return to it without it feeling too samey.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The moments that should have been captivating are close to boring, not having the impact the writer meant for them to have on the audience. It is the slow writing that creates the boredom in a movie that could have been half an hour and a couple of characters shorter to be more impressive. Less is more.Grindelwald's crimes are not as horrific as the title lets the audience imagine. Yet. A glimpse of his crimes isn't enough to justify them being mentioned in the title. That being said ""The rise of Grindelwald"" or simply ""Blood pact"" would have been more appropriate titles.Johnny Depp owns Grindelwald. His Grindelwald is as twisted, smart and manipulative as a dark wizard should be at a time of gathering followers.Jude Law becomes Albus Dumbledore scene after scene and in the end he is as calm, afraid and driven as old Dumbledore was in Harry Potter. It's a pitty he didn't have more screentime, which he's going to get in the next installment, I have to believe.Eddie Redmayne isn't given enough material to shine. Newt is helpless most of the time, bound to his feelings. I thought he was the star of the franchise, but in this movie he is not. He needs to do more than just tending his beasts and be awkward. Luna Lovegood was awkward, but she owned the place with her awkwardness. Newt needs more ""owning"" lines for Eddie Redmayne to deliver as he is able to.There isn't enough room to talk about every important character in this movie as there isn't enough space for each one of them to flourish as they should. Neither for the main nor for the supportive. There are so many subplots in two hours time that it's easy to get lost in the translation. The paradox is that you don't get lost. Fact is, I remember all the subplots and all the characters. I just didn't have time to invest in all of them.

473,gerick_goldwyn,"Visually stunning, but the first disappointing Harry Potter film...",5,21 November 2018,"I was very disappointed with the Crimes of Grindelwald. I thought all the writers tried to do was dazzle us with lots special effects, which were amazing (10+ stars!!), but forgot about the central storyline; i.e., there were plenty of subplots, but where was the central plot? The movie is also called: ""The Crimes of Grindelwald,"" but it's not even made clear what Grindelwald's ""crimes"" are. The poster also includes the sign of the 'Deathly Hallows' on it, but they're not even mentioned in the entire film either. Furthermore, Newt, Tina, Jacob and Quennie don't really do anything this film, except couple-fight really and chase their own tails. We also explore Newt's childhood love, which (again) doesn't really add anything to the film... I mean, did anyone even care about Leta's backstory after Fantasy Beasts 1? I didn't, and I doubt it will have any significance in the next 3 films to come... But, what I found most frustrating was Credence's identity story... I liked Credence in the first film, but in this one, he seemed like such a useless character with a pointless storyline... I mean, does anyone even care who Credence really is? I don't... I would have liked to learn more about Dumbledore's and Grindelwald's past or even more on the Deathly Hallows... There is no way he is a ""Dumbledore,"" so the film ended with another useless twist... If Dumbledore really had a second brother, it would have been mentioned in 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' or the 'The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore' by Rita Skeeter. So, it makes the whole thing just silly... Anyone who knows anything about Harry Potter knows it's just nonsense... It would have made more sense if the writers said he was a ""Gaunt,"" or a direct descendant of Salazar Slytherin or Tom Riddle. That, at least, could have been possible and/or carried some weight among the fans, but this twist is just silly...My biggest criticism, however, is with Albus Dumbledore. Before 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,' Dumbledore was an absolute legend!! I couldn't fault him. However, in the following books, he makes some very questionable decisions, i.e., in 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' for example, he knows Draco Malfoy is trying to kill him, yet he does nothing to stop him... It was only by pure luck that Katie Bell survived his first assassination attempt, Ron Weasley, his second, and that every man, woman and child at Hogwarts survived at the end of the book... The Dark Lord (or Greyback) could have just as easily brought through an army and purged the whole school of life... Not very bright... Dumbledore is supposed to be the most powerful wizard in the world, yet his completely crippled by EMPATHY for all his enemies. It's exactly the same in this film as well... We all know from reading 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' that Dumbledore doesn't PERSONALLY make a move against Grindelwald until he becomes too powerful to stop / unstoppable... If he had only made this decision sooner, like 3 movies earlier, how many lives could he have saved? Instead, he passes the job to lesser wizards and watches them all dwindle away. As a result, I thought Dumbledore was betrayed as a coward in this film which hide behind his charisma. He was repeatedly was asked to do something and he forever says ""no.""***Just so your aware, I know everything there is to know about the Harry Potter universe, i.e., why Dumbledore couldn't face Grindelwald (because he believed Grindelwald knew the final fate of his sister Ariana, i.e., who shot the curse that finally ended her life. Dumbledore believed it might have been him, which could have destroyed him (emotionally) if that came to light)... We also see in Fantasy Beasts 2, Dumbledore looking through the Mirror of Erised, so we also see Dumbledore's deepest, most desperate desire is not to fight Grindelwald... But, seriously Dumbledore, people are dying here... We also see at the end of this film that Dumbledore made some kind of ""blood-pact"" with Grindelwald not to fight him, which is also silly, given in 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,' Dumbledore says: ""He knew in his hearts of hearts what Grindelwald really was (or something close to),"" and still he makes an agreement like this... All this makes Dumbledore look like a dump character to me or a victim of bad writing... I'm going with bad writing...For the record, I always thought Severus Snape was the real hero in Harry Potter... :)",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Then I watched it on the first day it released, and still my head not ready, so much to discuss, so much speculation, in really a good way! So much question marks.
We all know, Grindelwald lose the battle with Dumbledore, but the event before that...really can't wait what happen in the next movie!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
476,chrisebull,Confusing and boring,1,25 November 2018,Did all the people with reviews above 5 go to the same movie that I did? We seem to be thrown into a plot which never seems to explain itself. There is by far too much needless dialogue. Even the D-Box seat I was in did little to jolt me awake.,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
477,luannastarster,It looks like Harry Potter but it's not,4,30 January 2019,"If the first movie I found quite tedious, this second is much worse. There are several plots that lead to nothing, and you clearly realize that they were bred to fill in minutes. Jude Law did well as Dumbledore. And the rest of the cast did not convince me. Me and my sister kept asking about what the plot was? The title of the movie has nothing to do with the main plot. It was wiser to call it ""In Search of Credence,"" because everyone was after him. There were so many unnecessary scenes, and there were some that brought that feeling of nostalgia. In this franchise he had no magic or friendship seen in Harry Potter. You see only a fully CGI scenario and a thirst for money.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
478,thesupertomster,Only exists to set up the next film,4,12 January 2019,"The biggest problem with this movie is that, to put it bluntly, almost nothing happens. For the first three-quarters of the film, very little action is taken by the characters to advance the plot. As the film went on, it almost felt like it was running out of time to actually tell a story. That being said, the ending was surprisingly good and held some emotional impact - perhaps because it was the only part of the film where something actually happened that affected the main characters.Newt returns as a likeable-enough protagonist, and it's of course great to have Jacob back, who has been the best part of both movies so far (although his relationship with Queenie did hit some painfully familiar beats). Grindelwald is intimidating and mysterious - up until the point he first speaks, at which he becomes Johnny Depp. There were far too many characters as a whole, which was likely the main reason the narrative was so bloated and winding.The visual presentation seemed, for the most part, to be more unique and creative than the previous film. Shots were more carefully crafted and interesting, but there were problems with this complexity. The first of the two (yes, just two) action scenes was quite disorienting to watch and rather unengaging, but the second used a much more inventive location and was one of the highlights of the film.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was a fun, inventive blockbuster with a good sense of humor and many entertaining setpieces. The Crimes of Grindelwald seems to think of itself more as a nuanced character study, but for the most part lacks the coherence and momentum to make it worthwhile.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
479,xuanbacht,LAME,1,24 January 2019,"I was expecting more of the next part of fantastic beast just to get disappointed.

481,ryanh-00630,Fate of one. Future of all,5,6 September 2019,"Being a huge fan of the Harry Potter movies and books, I honestly quite enjoyed the first Fantastic Beasts movie. The different setting and new characters overall made it entertaining and I was looking forward to seeing the sequel and where the story goes. Alas, it's a mess.The Crimes of Grindelwald continues after the first movie, which I think was a good foundation and starting off point for this franchise, but at the same time, it feels like it's the first movie again trying to set it all up yet again for future sequels, alongside acting like a sequel in some chunks. That made for too many plot threads occurring at any one time with rowling adding even more into the mix, which in turn made it hard for the movie to juggle all those threads, resulting in a story that felt needlessly convoluted and just plain messy.It also doesn't help that some of the decisions made here, story-wise, by J.K Rowling herself, the writer, are either stupid/dumb or just baffling. There's also too much reliance on twists. I mean there are twists that have twists, with exposition dumps tied into them, making for slow and sometimes boring scenes, definitely feeling not earned. And what all of this does is either ruin or lower the entertainment value of pretty much every plot thread when you look at it overall, so the movie suffers.Also, I liked the new characters like Newt and Tina and Jacob etc in the first movie, so seeing them getting sidelined here in stupid tropes or story decisions was annoying.On the flip side, I pretty much enjoyed both Johnny Depp's and Jude Law's performance as Grindelwald and young Dumbledore respectively. Jude Law definitely could have used more screentime but it was still entertaining to see him in this role. And Depp as Grindelwald, his tactics and reasoning, it wasn't bad. I was intrigued and wanted to know more, and I'm glad that he feels different from Voldemort as he was different.And sure there are parts of enjoyment to be had in the movie. Still being directed by David Yates, so the action, the visual effects (for the most part) and such usually looked good. You get to see more new locations and creatures in this world, which was cool. And there are definitely scenes or moments that were good or even great.All in all, I was disappointed. I can go on and on about the issues in the movie but at the same time, I didn't outright hate the movie. BUT I don't get it why J.K Rowling felt the need to cram in so much in the sequel considering there are supposed to be 5 Fantastic Beasts movies. The writing was just weak, give her a partner who can clean things up writing-wise. I mean had the movie made its focus Grindelwald and his Crimes (you know, the NAME of the movie) and the characters from the first movie, while only introducing some new things, it could have been a fine sequel I think, but adding so many people and plot threads and references etc in this sequel made it a mess. An entertaining mess at times, but a mess nonetheless.If you're a fan and haven't seen it yet, give it a go with lowered expectations and you might enjoy it. But there's also a chance you might go Super Saiyan at the movie for some of the decisions.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
482,jmforsyth-33291,"Not as Bad As I Remember, Still Not As Good As I Would Like",6,20 July 2020,"I left the theatre two years ago severely disappointed. I hadn't seen the film since then so I thought that maybe I should give it another shot. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't as bad as I remembered but there was still enough issues that, if the world the story exists in wasn't so interesting, Fantastic Beasts 2 would be completely forgettable.The first half has a fantastic set up. Grindelwald is portrayed as evil and calculating, Jude Law is convincing as a young Dumbledore, and Newt is immediately more interesting in this second volume than the first.And then something odd happens with about 30 minutes to go in the movie. Without getting into spoilers: We get nonsensical character decisions, soap-opera level plot twists that make no sense and are wedged in for shock value, and suddenly it feels like there are too many characters without enough story to justify them being there.For a film that, let's be honest, exists to set up the third volume it overcomplicates itself when it doesn't need to. There is an interesting set of core characters that need room to breathe in this film and they are suffocated by over-exposition and convoluted intertwining plots that don't make sense.It's too bad, really. Crimes of Grindelwald isn't a complete and utter failure but it is frustrating when a film has the ingredients to be successful and it falls short.Initial reaction was a 4/10. Two years later I give it a 6/10.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

484,kathrinmaass,"10 stars for the nifflers, but...",7,20 November 2018,"I am a great fan of all HP Movies and have watched them several times. I liked Phantastic beasts and where to find them, but didn´t find the plot quite catching. But the beasts where so stunnind, that I fell in love with all of them.That´s why I had high hopes for Grindelwalds crimes and with concern to the beasts these where not dissapointed. The beasts where cretively craftetd and you just had to love them. I am a big niffler fan and the babies where just the cutest. And the fact that papa niffler saved the day at the end (I thing the importance of his loot will show in the next movie) just made me cheer. The only downside with the creatures was that they were all pure CGI. Sometimes I miss the work of a great puppeteer like Hanson in modern movies. I always find that the interaction of an actor with a greatly craftet puppet is so much more natural than the acting with a dummy. And I am pretty sure that today it would be possible to craft great puppets and maybe enhance them with CGI.But a movie cannot live of cute creatures alone. And that´s the big downturn with Grindelwalds Crimes. First of all: What are Grindelwald's crimes? The only crime he commits in this movie is to escape from prison...the reason he is there is becuase he got caught in the first movie while trying to manipulate Credence. But what is his actual crime? It seems obvious that he is planning grim deeds, but what are the crimes he has already commited? Having an evil view on the world is no crime by itself and during the movie it gets quite clear that Grindelwald actually might have pretty good reasons for his actions. I have always had the urge to understand the villains in stories (even as a child I likes Maleficient and felt really understood when they made the movie about her). And I do understand Grindelwald....Again the connection between Grindelwald and the Scamander is quite coincidental. It seems that somebody thought it would be cute to make a movie about magical creatures and was desperately looking for a plot as dark as the Voldemort plot, but couldn´t quite make the connection between the two ideas.The acting is solid, but not brilliant at all. Redmayne does what it can do best: looking kind of shy and dreamy,Dan Fogler perfects the art of looking puzzeled in various nuances, and so on. Johnny Depp does a pretty good performance and after playing the lovable drunkard Captain Jack Sparrow for ages it is kind of refreshing to see him in such a different role.The big downturn is the lack of a plot. it is more a compilation of breathtaking CGI Scenes that a loosely connected by something you couldn´t even call a plot.But since there are nifflers in this movies, I give it an overall of 7 stars and wait for the next movie to meet those cuties again....P.S. Hell yes, it is a big merchandise machinerie, but if you can buy your own Niffler purse - go for it!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Rowling seemed to write the character in an ambiguos way: he's supposed to be bad like Voldemort, but in the movie we don't see him murder anybody. At the graveyard meeting he's just defendind himself from the aurors with the blue fire.
Besides that, in his speach he vows to fight the muggle governments in order to prevent future world wars.On the other hand, I enjoyed Jude law's performance as Dumbledore and the Howarts flashback scenes, since it helps the audience to understand the relationship between Scamander and Lestrange.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

It stays true to the Potter World in terms of places, beasts and magic, but unfortunately lost some of it's audience with the plot and characters.
I think they have tried to grasp at too much without any underlying information like we had in Harry Potter from the books. And the fact that the plot is straight to a movie without a book, has made it hard for them to figure out what works and to convey the story.
Aside from that, it has a wonderful production value and great acting. I was happy Zoë Kravitz own her role as usual and have never enjoyed Jude Law more than this role. I also believe Ezra Miller is going to become one of the greatest actors of our time.
If you were a Harry Potter fan I would recommend seeing it even with the plot holes, if you haven't enjoyed the Potter-verse then I would give this movie a miss.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

I went to see this with my boyfriend - he hasn't read the books, and when things have to much of a story, he becomes bored.
Mind that he says abrakadrabra whenever a curse is used.
He wasn't bored throughout the movie!
There was a lot of magical fighting, goofy scenes and beautiful scenes!But.. what was the plot? Where is the storyline? The story didn't raise new questions, and it didn't unravell some big hidden secret fans didn't already know or speculate.
Sooooo many crowd pleasing moments - Nicolas flames with a completely unimportant character - we see the philosophers stone, and the Mirror of Erised.
Yes yes, we know about the wand, stone and all that - that was the Harry Potter story!
Maybe this introduction will play an important role in the next movie, however in this one it didn't.
Oh - and some suicidal characters, that sacrifice themselves for no apparent reason.
Bellatrix Lestrange and Voldemort story all over again.

500,UnculturedGeek,Best Harry Potter Movie so far!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,8,23 November 2018,"Fantastic Beasts: The crimes of Grindelwald is a movie about Newt Schmander and how he is trying to capture/kill Grindlewald. Newt is a bit of a sensitive type, so he is not sure if he is up to it. But after some time, he does go after Grindlewald, and the exciting stuff comes in. Unlike the other Harry Potter movies (not including fantastic beasts 1), the script is not written based on a book. And this is also the second movie the fantastic beasts series and it will most likely get a sequel. Sadly though, there are some sad parts like Rita Lestrange's death and Queenie going to the dark side(although she'll probably become good again). And although this does not decrease the amount of how much I like this movie, I want to warn all the parents with sensitive children out there that there are sad scenes and death. But all in all, it was a grrrreeeeaattttt movie!!!!!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
501,aucoinandrew,Just a filler movie,3,18 April 2020,"I'm a huge potter fan. The originals weren't great but they were enjoyable and did their job. Honestly I don't think the Fantastic beasts series should even exist. There's far better content in the wizard world and this is just a waste.
Now, about the film. Here's the good: Jude law is a great young dumbeldore and is pretty much the only thing I look forward to in the rest of the series. He doesn't get much screen time but does great with what he has. The action sequences are solid, score is great, and overall acting fairly strong.
The bad: the writing is atrocious. The characters from the previous movie are not even carried over to this one. In the last one, they all had nice wrap ups to their characters that were completely discarded in the first ten minutes of this one. Newt, based in his character, shouldn't even be in this movie but they force him in. Nice little queenie goes psycho and forces Jacob into marrying her. She then joins Grindelwald thinking he's doing the right thing. SHE CAN READ MINDS but she can't tell he's a bad guy. Ok. They try so hard to make Lita Lestarange a good character. They spend so much time fleshing out her backstory with newt but then fail to do anything with that and kill her off like we're supposed to care about her character. Credence, my least fav character, somehow survives internal combustion and, oh my gosh!, turns out to be dumbledores lost brother!??...absolutely terrible smh. They have other fan service plot twists that are dumb like leta being related to the top hat guy and nagini being a human. Cant wait for these to be over. I wish they'd just make a marauders tv series or focus on Dumbledore instead of this garbage. 4/10. Jude law and Johnny depp were good.

No tension was built, no excitement was cultivated.Because of that constant strain to figure out what was going on and why we should care, comic relief and other grace notes fell flat or got overlooked.There was no character building or transformation to make us care about the players. It was hard to tell what the problem was. Johnny Depp did not have a role to inhabit, so he played his standby fantasy hierophant. Animated beasts were the most enjoyable characters in the show.Edited to maximize sound volume with little in the way of environment-building sound texture or nuance.There were so many missed opportunities to enrich the visual environment, not only through slick production, but through more thoughtful connection to the specific time and place.Camera jogging even in serene moments was a constant distraction.The previous movie was basically a buddy comedy with a frisson of romance.

This is one of those films where I acknowledge all the problems people are having with it but personally either completely disagree or don't feel the same way... for instance, yes I do think this is convoluted as hell and suffers from far too many sub plots and inconsistencies but at the same time I really don't think it's anywhere near as confusing as it's being made out to be - or maybe that's just the extreme Harry Potter nerd in me talking? Moving onto the good though, I think David Yates once again does a fantastic job directing, the performances across the board, Depp & Redmayne especially are great (despite most of the characters being very thinly written), Newton-Howard's score is euphoric, and the visual effects are without a doubt Oscar worthy. Look, I understand where most of you are coming from and I sympathise with some of it but I also think the criticisms are very harsh just because it's not quite living up to the expectations Harry Potter has set (the McGonagall blunder in this is absolutely atrocious though) So here's to hoping Rowling matures in time for Part 3 of this journey because I, myself, really love the direction this is heading.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

511,bradaviel,This one is for the fans,7,20 November 2018,"I've discussed with a lot of friends that didn't like the movie as much as they would have loved to because to them, there was no plot to enjoy. Just small snippets of subplots here and there, and too many to keep up or understand.
I have to say I quite enjoyed the way the movie tell its story, because there is one, but only if you can grasp the winks and universe building this one has to offer. I guess you can't really enjoy this as a one shot, just going to the theater and expect an amazing experience if you don't keep in mind that what happens here are the many causes of what we already know watching the Potter movies (and even more, reading the books). Some people say Rowling gets her facts mixed up, I'd say she's incredibly accurate, as much as you give he the credit she deserve, which is she knows what she's doing. If you believe that to be true, you can grasp the many clues that will tie this saga the the next and, oh boy, that's so much to get in one sitting !
Also, don't miss the chance to see it in theaters. Yates is again a master at his craft and gives us so many incredible shots and sequences. Yes, There ARE action sequences even if they aren't as numerous as one would think. I have to confess, the first one looked a bit messy but it describes a messy situation, so I guess it fits. But it's more a character movie than it is a stand alone. I'd say it compares to the Empire strikes back, in that it doesn't tell as much as it builds drama and gravitas.

512,psykosean,A Worthy Sequel,8,11 January 2019,"I've seen so many negative reviews here and online that I didn't go watch it until today in the theater.I was pleasantly surprised. It picks up right after the first film, jumping right into the story assuming everyone present watched the first (and why wouldn't you have? Who goes to a sequel without seeing the precursor?) and doesn't waste time reintroducing characters.Some complain it's hard to follow and there is too much going on; I disagree. Every supposed sub-plot has the exact same mission and ending: get to Creedence. It all ties nicely together, with a nice little twist at the end.The visuals, again, are amazing, and the addition of Jude Law as a young Albus Dumbledore was a brilliant choice in casting.I recommend this, and will be watching again and again.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

514,philipfalzer,Good differences whether or not you're a Potterhead.,9,14 November 2018,"If you are a Potterhead, you will leave the cinema dazzled by both the revelations and references of Wizarding World. Something nice to see.The film is a good continuation of the first, but with some medium defects of franchise. Too much open, no closed arcs, and an information bomb.So if you're not a Potterhead, expect to be confused during the movie.The cast is spectacular, especially Jude Law, Eddie Redmayne, Dan Fogler, and my future husband Callum Turner. Of course, I wanted to say the same thing about Ezra Miller, who had incredible potential but almost disappears in what the script proposes.The animals keep showing up for a future Newt book, and that makes me happy to see that the name of the franchise remains consistent with the story, even if it's in the background.The CGI and 3D are impeccable, it pays to spend a little more and go in an IMAX 3D session.Thinking of Fantastic Animals as a franchise in small episodes, it's great. Like a continuation movie, it has its flaws and does not close any arches that open in the beginning.By the proposal, we know that the film does better than the first and opens a range of possibilities for the future of the franchise.

521,auritone,Too many ingredients can spoil the meal as well...,7,18 November 2018,"Let me first say that I loved the first movie. It is one of my favorite feel good movies in recent memory. The quirky characters, the world building, and the charm of it was immensely captivating to me.
Crimes of Grindelwald is not that.
It is a quite different kettle of fish that unfortunately spreads its focus on too many characters who all have to have their background explained in order to set up their relations or impact on each others lives. This sadly removes a lot of focus from our main characters (Newt and Tina especially) and makes what is fundamentally a rather simple story overly complicated and a bit convoluted.
It also has quite a significant tonal shift from the first movie, which was a charming romp with some dark moments. Grindelwald, however, is a very dark movie with charming, lighthearted moments. Imagine watching the first Potter movie and then jumping straight to movie 6 and you get the idea.
This is by no means a bad thing as the movie is very consistent and there really are no awkward tonal shifts (as for example in Last Jedi), and since I brought up Star Wars... In terms of tone, I would call this the Empire Strikes Back of Fantastic Beasts.
Speaking of beasts, they have sadly taken a back seat in this movie as well, so if you, like me, enjoyed them and Newt's interaction with them (wonderfully devoid of most of the magical approach to problem solving, which understandably seems to be standard in the Potter universe, but handled through Newt's understanding and communication with said beasts) there is very little of that, but the few interactions we do see are immensely enjoyable.
This may sound overly critical, but despite these things I still very much enjoyed the movie, and I have to give a special mention to Grindelwald himself who is a genuinely interesting villain. Unlike the pure evil of Voldemort (and excessive temper tantrums and evil laughs), Grindelwald is a soft spoken, intelligent, unemotional, extremely manipulative spider, pulling the strings from the center of his web. This is extremely well portrayed by Depp who plays him very straight. Yes, there is no ""Depping it up"" in this Depp performance, and it works very well indeed, something that can be said about all the performances. They are just really good!
I would rate this movie higher if it had been more focused, rather than spreading its story out on so many different characters, but it at least manages to tie it all up in a reasonably satisfying way, that managed to peak my interest for the next one.
It's basically like eating at a restaurant and getting a satisfying meal, that was marred by having too many ingredients in it, which is why I end up on a low 7.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
522,chrisieridis,Very chaotic movie with zero character development.,5,14 November 2018,It was the first movie that I quit listening to the dialogues between the actors. People that were not properly introduced in the movie seemed to have a pretty important role in this plot hole movie. The only thing that I enjoyed is the performance of Eddie Redmayne. Other than that a completely passive and at some points boring movie. In the positives is the very good first 20 minutes of the film.,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
523,nleon-96835,Way too many negative reviews,7,25 November 2018,Movie setup a great dialog for the upcoming movies. And the movie gives more of a history of Dumbledore and his lineage.

524,Richarduck4077,Very very messy,2,27 November 2018,Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is a messy movie with way to many plot points and storylines and a twist that feels out of place and forced. The only highlight is Eddie Redmayne's colorful performance other then that this movie is a disappointment to me and a lot of other Harry Potter fans,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
525,felicsetiawan,The story is flat,6,18 November 2018,Well...... It's flat... almost fell asleep. The story is more focused in building the franchise rather than giving it a good story line.,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

527,reeltimeflicks-81729,"Slow film, but should be called ""Where's Grindelwald""?",7,20 January 2019,"Fans of Rowling should be able to enjoy the film. It has a fair bit of tie-ins with the larger Harry Potter universe, but it has an overall slow pace that will definitely leave your feeling wanting for more and having the dilemma of waiting another few years for the next installment. There are several fast-paced sequences in the film, but they do little to alleviate the growing impatience of being denied a satisfying story. The film works best as a set-up for future films since plot doesn't really move to far, but there are plenty of moments where we see other people reacting to the threat of the dark wizard in a different location than the first film.There is also a healthy amount of character development for the other characters and Dumbledore makes an appearance, but the titular character is almost no where to be found. This was a little disappointing since I wanted to see him interacting more with society, perhaps to highlight his relationship with them or provide clues into his psyche, but other than only one very prominent scene nothing like that happens.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
528,Sigmazyal,I don't know what happened.,5,11 July 2020,"I love Harry Potter movies, but I don't know what happened to this one. The first Fantastic Beasts movie was amazing, I love it, however, this one seems like an endless intermission between big events of the past and big upcoming events. The moments and facts we want to see either didn't happen yet or are just mentioned in the past, in a quick flashback or mention. Some references are really out of place and...the characters seem to go nowhere, walking in circles. When watching, I got confused about where the characters were and who was talking about who, and I'm a Harry Potter fan. In my opinion, someone who didn't read the books or who isn't a very observant Harry Potter fan will get very lost watching this movie. Also, the movie starts skipping some events I think that would have been interesting to be seen on screen, like, a lot of things happened between the first movie and this one, but we only get mentions loose along the movie. The characters are very interesting, the acting is great and so is the CGI, the creatures are perfect and all the magic is very realistic, but in general, I found the movie too dark. I understand the importance of light and colors to build different environments, however, there were parts all the darkness made the movie experience poorer for me, in my opinion. Most Harry Potter fans will like it because of the magic world, the creatures, the spells, however, I found this movie really slow and they seem to try to bring up many separate storylines at the same time and...they don't connect very well, I felt like I was watching bits of different stories put together into a movie. As an intermission between great events, as the part of a big sequence of episodes, it's an okay movie, but I think it had so much potential to be greater. I love this franchise but just mentioning important references and characters won't make people like it, there are so many great characters there that could be invested in, have their background stories explored for real, with the proper development, but all we get are fragments and references. Okay, I understand that this movie is just a part of a sequence of episodes and it's not a ""climax part"" of main story, however, it doesn't work well on it's own.
I really want this franchise to get all the love, quality and respect it deserves.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

too many unnecessary characters (For example, Queenie was useless all the movie - i still don't understand why Grindelwald wanted her to join him; Leta wasn't a new character - just a mix of the old ones: Albus&his brother, Severus&Lily), less fantastic beasts, less Dumbledore (Jude Law was great), more mess with Lestrange and Dumbledore family trees, more strange twists (Titanic, Hitler. Yes, i remember that Grindelwalde was actually a metaphoric character, but the screenwriters decided to show the real II World War too), and the secondary idea of 'The boy who lived"" (but in a dark manner).

536,dmbelafan,"A fun ride, lacking direction",6,16 November 2018,"I'm a huge HP fan. Own every book, movie, tons of merch, re-watch and re-read regularly. I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment of Fantastic Beasts. I can only partially put my finger on why, but the second didn't do much for me.Don't misunderstand - the performances were fabulous. Redmayne continues to polish his already masterful portrayal of Newt, and Jude Law delivers what I felt a very true, nuanced performance as Albus Dumbledore that wonderfully captures his charm and empathy. The primary supporting cast (those who returned from the first film) are played well, and some are given a bit of room for development.The film stumbles in its excessive use of monologues and flashbacks as exposition, rather than letting more natural dialogue and events tell the story. It spoon-feeds the audience heaping portions of backstory, often without much actual plot value (more on that later). I'm all for world-building, but here it feels lazy and heavy-handed. While on the topic of writing, the actions of several characters in the second and third acts simply don't make sense, given their personalities as established by this film and its predecessor. Sure, they make for dramatic moments and add some twists and turns, but they're so out of left field that they really shatter suspension of disbelief.This installment also fails to have a real sense of where it's going, where the first succeeded. There are simply too many plates to keep spinning, and the writing was not up to the task. Several side characters had little reason to exist within the scope of this film. I'm sure they'll be relevant later on, but better writing would have given them purpose immediately. The final confrontation, while visually stunning, felt unimaginative and repetitive - those who fell merited little emotional response, given their characters' trivial importance to the story.There is still much to love in this film! Creature design continues to be brilliant, truly living up to the film's name. Dan Fogler continues to bring the laughs as the oft-cartoonish Kowalski. Long-time fans are sure to be thrilled with the return to the Hogwarts school grounds, and enjoy meeting characters from the books previously not seen on the big screen (or the younger versions of beloved characters). Magic abounds, from the sinister to the silly.I think it's safe to say that every HP fan will be adding this to their collection - but I can't say it stands on its own. I hope newly introduced characters are allowed room to grow in the next installment, and perhaps all these loose ends will find a satisfying conclusion. In the meantime, there's not much reason to re-watch this one, at least until the next one is released. A fun ride, but felt like a place holder.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

While I will give a ""tip-top A rating"" for the special effects, the story line was no where to be found. No matter how hard we tried to find the plot, we failed.To top it off, understanding much, if not most, of the dialogue was impossible.

It's an adult Wizarding World with more adult situations and problems. I've heard this be the main complaint from moviegoers and critics, but that's what I loved about both movies. They're more methodical, darker and definitely not for everyone - unlike the Potter movies. These are stand alone films about the mythology and history of wizards and magic many decades proceeding the Potter years. Don't go in expecting teenage sorcerers and Hogwarts and you'll be rewarded. I expect the next few films will garner more acclaim, so go in with an open mind and a clear head and you'll find a lot to love in what Newt and his world bring to the franchise.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

543,mdilday94,This movie was a mixed bag,6,25 November 2018,"First off, the first Fantastic Beasts movie was good, this movie is a mixture of good and bad. I'll start with the good parts of the movie, the visual effects are stunning and magical, the acting was great for the most part and the wizard duels were also good, it added more interesting magical creatures and it was also great to see Hogwarts again.The bad parts of the movie, well let's start off by saying that the story/plot is a bit muddled and the writers crammed in too many plot lines in the film, part of the time I didn't know what was going on. There was also a bit too many characters, also why make Nagini into a former witch and would years later become a snake permanently, I thought that she was some species of snake that was only found in the Wizarding World, not to mention, she should've had more screen time to have more personality. It was shown that Dumbledore taught Defense Against The Dark Arts Class, what's up with that? He's supposed to teach transfiguration, unless he was substituting, I don't know, it isn't explained why he was teaching that subject. Some of the new characters are meh, while Grindlewald was an interesting character, I don't agree with Johnny Depp playing as him, why not someone else like Tom Hiddleston? I don't see Depp as an evil wizard, it's almost like having Jim Carrey playing as Voldemort. Oh and in a flashback during Newt's days as a Hogwarts student, it shows Mccgonagol as a Hogwarts teacher! Mccgonagal wasn't even alive during that time, she was born in the 1930s, this is a big plot hole!Another plot hole is that Credence is a Dumbledore, how is that possible, Dumbledore's dad was in Azkaban for the rest of his days after attacking the muggle kids who bullied his daughter, so this is illogical for Credence to be a Dumbledore, does this movie take place in an alternative universe?!

Was skeptial about Johnny Depp at first but I think he actually portrayed is role very well and I was intrigued by his character.This film however does not feel like it fits into the Potter universe. The writing cramped so many plots and subplots into a short amount of time that it became unenjoybale.The love interest of Tina and newt is forced and not convincing.The 2 lestrange characters were irrelevant and their entire story could have been cut outThe best parts were the references to original Potter films. Seeing the philosophers/sorcerer's stone was fun, the scenes at hogwarts were great (bogart scene). I enjoyed nagini as a character and will hope to see more of her in future films.Overall I will still look forward to future films, but I will be reluctant to watch this one again. It definitely felt like a filler movie where the plots are complex and end up being pointless with almost no continuation to any story.

549,kubapawlowski,Great Visuals but Loooooong.,5,2 December 2018,"First off a disclaimer, if you have not seen the first Fantastic Beasts film or any Harry Potter film then I do not advise you seeing this.Where Fantastic Beasts lacks is in story, and by story I mean mostly side plots stuffed with references that eventually come together. The problem with telling a story like this is that it feels very unfocused and more like a set up to a sequel (which we all know there is going to be) rather than giving us a satisfying chapter that ties into something bigger.On the positive side. Newt. The lovably awkward Newt and his fantastic beasts are the most intriguing things about this franchise. Along with his mindset of resolving situations without violence is fresh for a protagonist, however I would've liked to see him getting more development and building stronger bonds throughout this film.Visually though the film is stunning, there's always something interesting to look at, especially as we are exploring the grander world of magic.Overall I think if you're big on the Harry Potter franchise and Fantastic Beasts this film will hold some entertainment value for you.

555,martinterr,"Sorry, even as normal Potterfan! This Movie is a totally Failure!",1,9 February 2019,"Deep Advice to Rowling:
Stop writing Scripts, back to books!
That Rowling is a great Writer, She had more then enough shown ( Potter books and adds to Potter world direct ) .
But now for 3. Time in a row, she had shown, das she CANT write scripts.To the Movie! Even for Potter Fans, reduced to really good Interesting Story. You could compress the whole 2Hours 50 Movie into 30 Minutes! About.
That thing is all way, kind of lost.. .
Title: Crimes of Grindewald... hm nice... Take first 20 Minutes max ( escape ) and the Final End for "" follow him or die "" Part. Thats it. All other has 0 to do with the title.
Then one thing is clear! Newt Scaramanga was as small Boy extreme Traumatized, OR he is simple Menthal Handicapped. All other way you cant explain his whole behavior.
Hm Johny Depp as Grindewald... after about 5 Minutes Dialog of him... only Hope that Synchro Speaker could rescue something. All else... with closed Eyes you whould had thought, it is NOT Rowlings "" Magical World "" it is the xxx Disney Pirates of the Carrebean. Captain Jack Sparrow speaking. Only a little bit his "" Gayish "" away ( only extreme light ) rest was identical.
Good Positive Surprise... Jude Law as Dumbledore!
The whole Movie has too 2 Big Story Mistakes.
1. Grindewald CANT be Dumbledores 2. Brother. This is already denied in the Potter Series ( Hermine whould had deffinetly knew it ! )
2. WHAT the heck does Mc Gonnagall in that Movie?
She is in core much younger then Dumbledore was. But in this Movie she must be around his Age.
And that where only the Screaming mistakes.Whole complete Fackt. Colours and So on is not Potter Way, its much more Hollywood way. ( All shining... no dust has to be seen, eczept its CGI ) .
Story... Forget it! Including the way. that its deffinetly maded for max. 12 Years Children at all cost!
Complete... against a good Story, Fantastic Beasts Series is a Pushed thing, to keep the Franshise about Potter ... alive . Still there is money go squeze out, so its going on. Licenses and Theme Park Attraktions have to be payed and get people, what only goes over "" alive "" productions.Rowling is in such way on BEST way to Ruin her own Work and scare her Book fans first, then Movies away.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

It was honestly difficult to watch, and I almost felt like I was simply SITTING THROUGH IT rather than enjoying it. It's a huge shame, because I always love J.K. Rowland's work.

BUT the story is semi-simple but is all explained at the end. The ending also sets up the next lot of films in the franchise that are promised to be better. In some ways this film felt like Deathly Hallows part 1. It was setting up/filling in for the Ultimate finale. The VFX were exceptional and the soundtrack was impecable.

562,dtcwee,"Entertaining and fast-paced, if a little uneven",8,15 September 2019,"I don't think The Crimes of Grindelwald deserves some of the hate it's getting.
Some of the vitriol probably comes from the film being tonally different to its predecessor.
Instead of another slapstick romp where zany characters stumble onto and avert a conspiracy, this movie starts off serious, with lovable Newt Scamander essentially being told that he needs to become James Bond if he wants his passport back.
A lot did not make sense, and to be honest, still doesn't.
There are a lot of characters up in the air. A few, especially the side characters, have great arcs, especially given their roles in the preceding film.
I do like films where characters turn for unanticipated but good reasons, where superficially simple motives are actually complex, and tropes are subverted.
The beautiful sets and nimble sequences kept me watching until the film delivered, deliciously revealing misdirections in the third act.

I thought the first ""fantastic beasts"" film was fairly good but this one. Well after an hour I just couldn't stick it any longer; feeling utterly irritated with the lack of any tangible and discernable storyline. How are you supposed to understand anything when all you get presented with are a bunch of random scenes, events, cgi and characters that don't seem to mesh together. After an hour the only things I understand are that some people are looking for a guy named Credence, but i don't know why. Grindelwald seems to be present for some reason, but he doesn't seem to do anything except appear somewhere and look strange. Newt does stuff with cgi creatures and seems to have been accosted by an Irish accented Dumbledore into looking for Grindelwald(??) In Paris for some reason. I don't know why. Everything is so random. I am fed up of trying to figure out a storyline in this mess and can't bear another hour. I am only glad I didn't pay to see this at the cinema. I would have been so angry!!

569,mamunraju55,It is a plot for another movie,6,27 February 2019,Probably the most boring movie of Harry potter franchise. This movie promised a lot but just did not deliver it. Hope next movie may feed our thirst.,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
570,forchennfederation,It's A Crime That This Wasn't Very Good,4,7 December 2018,"Even though I've never read the Harry Potter books, I can certainly say, with conviction, that I'm a fan of the movies; all 8 of the main HP movies range from very good to amazing. I even liked Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them quite a bit, and I came out of that film pretty satisfied with it. So, when I heard that it would be the start of a saga of prequels in the now-dubbed 'Wizarding Worlds', I was certainly anticipating to see where it would go. So, now, we go into Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. When I heard that it was getting mixed reviews, something that seemed unprecedented in the HP movie franchise because all the other movies including the 1st FB film got at least generally positive buzz, I went into this film with some caution but still optimistic; after all I have liked movies with worse reception than this. Sadly, however, that was not to be in the case of The Crimes of Grindelwald, which is not only the weakest entry in the overall Wizarding World series by a landslide but is even kinda bad. So, let's go further into this tale of woe and wasted potential that is Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.I do want to get into a number of positives first, because this movie isn't without merit. First of all, the movie looks great; David Yates, who's been directing the movies in this franchise since Order of the Phoenix, still manages to direct the movie very well visually. From the luscious look of 1920s Paris to the fog-covered streets of London, the movie looks really nice. The magical parts of the movie, like one scene where Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne) rides on a water creature, still give me a sense of wonder even if I'm more used to that wonder at this point. The creatures (the ""Fantastic Beasts"" which don't seem to play as big a role this time around as they did the 1st movie) range from cute, like the little jewel thief critter that Newt carries around, to majestic, like the Chinese dragon-looking creature. The action scenes, when they do happen, are grand and visually interesting for sure, including the opening scene where Gellert Grindelwald (played by Johnny Depp) breaks out of his bonds in a flying carriage. The special effects for the magic as well as other things are really good, I might add; there are scenes where what looks to be big, black drapes come down on downtown Paris and it looks unnerving yet gorgeous. Also, the acting in the movie all-around is great; the whole cast has at least a moment to shine, from Redmayne as Newt to Dan Fogler returning as Jacob to, especially even, Jude Law as Albus Dumbledore and Depp as Grindelwald.The movie also touches onto some pretty interesting things, like how Grindelwald is able to gather followers by making cases about the barriers that all the Ministries of Magic and all the MACUSAs create that prevents wizards/witches from courting with non-magical individuals (i.e. Queenie & Jacob) as well as about how the non-magical society (i.e. ""muggles"") will destroy themselves and affect the Wizarding World in a negative way by showing visions of WWII, as he does in the 3rd act of the film; it brings in an interesting context on how someone like Voldemort, the Dark Lord who would come after Grindelwald, could gain a following that pushes for witch & wizard supremacy, and that adds something meaningful to the lore & world-building in the greater Wizarding World universe without needing to rely on Easter eggs and tie-ins to the main HP movies. The movie also touches a little bit on Dumbledore and Grindelwald's relationship, which gives us just enough history between them that we do feel for the emotional struggle within Dumbledore in one scene.So, now, even though I've said a decent amount of positive things to say about The Crimes of Grindelwald, they don't really amount to enough to save it.
First off, let's discuss the plot for a bit here: There isn't much of one; sure, one can say that the plot is that Grindelwald is looking for Credence (played by Ezra Miller) and the heroes (Newt & company) are trying to stop him and find Credence before he does, but there are so many plotlines and arcs going on in this movie that it makes even Batman v Superman blush, and yet they don't culminate to much by the end. This is pretty much a 2-hour-&-15-minute collection of spells, Easter eggs, and set-up for the next (hopefully, more interesting) film.While some Easter eggs are neat, like when we go back to Hogwarts at one point in the film as well as the inclusion of Dumbledore and even Nicolas Flamel in the film, there are other Easter eggs that not only felt unnecessary but even somewhat detrimental to the rest of the series. We have Nagini who, in this film, is a young woman who befriends Credence (played by Ezra Miller) and has a curse where one day she'll turn into a snake but can't turn back; she didn't add anything to the story, she was just a minor side character who just happens to be the future snake servant/Horcrux of Voldemort, and by making Nagini a being that was previously human takes away from how loyal to Voldemort she was (From the main HP movies, you get an understanding that Voldemort trusted Nagini, an animal, more than any human follower in his regiment because no human would have the same amount of loyalty to someone as an animal), and even though we still have three more movies to go before we see what could supposedly turn Nagini to the dark side (because she's still on the good guys' side by the end of this movie) one cannot help but find it a bit unsatisfying knowing that the context of a character in movie that take place later in this series' continuity has been changed and needlessly so.Jacob, Dan Fogler's character, also seems pointless; his arc already felt wrapped-up and conclusive in the 1st Fantastic Beasts, so by bringing him back by having him say that the Obliviation that he received didn't work not only feels like a contrived excuse to bring a character back just so the actor's contract could continue (supposedly) but also seems to undermine how effective the magic in the Wizarding World is; Hermione, in Deathly Hallows - Pt. 1, Obliviated her own parents in order to protect them and all traces of memory of her were wiped completely away from not just their minds but even in photographs, and this movie is saying that even magic can have faults even if it's used correctly. Wow.Now, let's discuss Credence for a bit here: There is a mystery revolving around his lineage, his bloodline; Leta Lestrange, the love interest of both Newt and his brother (weird, I know) (played by Zoe Kravitz) and another guy, who is also tied into the Lestrange bloodline, are also involved in this mystery; the guy mentions how Credence is the lost son in the Lestrange family tree and should be destroyed, but then Leta says that the lost son was already dead because she left him to die on a sinking ship when he was a baby, thus rendering Credence having anything to do with the Lestrange bloodline null & void. It's like there was one reveal that came in to explain what's going on, only for it to be completely revised as something else; now, I'm all for red herrings, but this is too much. Then, it gets crazier: At the tail end of the film, where we have the obligatory teasing for the Fantastic Beasts 3, Credence, now on the side of Grindelwald (along with Queenie), is revealed to have had a baby bird with him throughout the film which turns out to be a phoenix (the family bird of the Dumbledores), so it turns out that Credence is the lost brother of Albus Dumbledore; not only was it obviously a twist thrown in at the last minute just to try to get people excited about the next film, but it also makes the timeline and relationships among characters in the Wizarding World all the more convoluted, like, how come Dumbledore never mentioned that he had a long-lost brother in the Harry Potter movies? Just saying.When it's all said and done, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald isn't the worst movie of 2018 (like, not even close), it's certainly the most disappointing movie of 2018. Despite great direction by David Yates, great visuals & solid spectacle, and even some great performances among the cast, the plot is so convoluted and all over the place that it's even honestly kind of hard to follow (and I don't usually have that problem with most movies, even bad ones) and the movie, written by J.K. Rowling, seemed like it was a filler movie trying to get by on Easter eggs and magic to be entertaining enough for people to want to see the next film; unfortunately, this movie's ""spell"" didn't exactly work on me as well as I'm sure the people behind it were hoping it would. Honestly, I'm mildly curious to see if the next film could be more interesting and could hopefully improve on the mistakes made here based on where this film leaves off, but at this point I'm not too excited for what's to come in this prequel series. Oh well, at least we still have the main Harry Potter movies, and no lackluster prequel can take them away from us.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

578,lenavisekruna,JKP sold her soul - review for HP fans,5,15 February 2019,"Is this movie about Grindelwald and Dumbledore or Newt and beasts or Credence or American aurors? You can't mix that all up and expect from real HP fans to connect with the characters. I don't know why this is called Fantastic beasts as there are roughly 5 beasts shown, 2 of which we already seen. The description says the adventures of Newt... This movie has nothing to do with Newt and it could easily be only Tina running around... The thing is that Jacob, the Muggle was the best character and that is just sad for movie about magic. Johnny Depp looks more drunk that scary. I truly think that he was actually drunk in few scenes. This was the first ""Voldemort"", the man that craved power, fear and wanted Muggles to be practically slaves. There is nothing! that makes me feel that. It' like he's random mafia boss.
The main/end twist got me sooo angry. I mean you can't deliver that twist to HP fans which know everything about Dubledore and hope we care that much about destiny of Credence. If this is the case than Credence was badly written from the start as we do not connect with him or care if he's gonna join Gridelwald or Dumbledore.
I truly believe that 70% of people who will go to see the movie are HP fans. Then JKR and team had to understand and listen to the fans and create something believable. It's not that we are just fans of HP, we love the magic, the idea, the world. And for other 30% that haven't watched or cared about HP I just don't see how this movie will transform them into fans.
There is a book about beasts for God sake... The adventure of Newt would be exploring the beasts, fighting bad wizards to free the beasts, introducing to us the magic of the beasts, making us understand Newt the awkward boy...
If this movie isn't about the fans of HP than there should be no Grindelwald as he is a book character. There are 3 or 4 unimportant mentions of him in HP movies so they must have assumed that we already know who he is. Then make a movie about him and Dumbledore, how they met,how they went separate ways, how Dumbledore changed, the story about Ariana, the history of main characters..
If it's about Credence and America, then make him a new HP, explain to us his strength, give him his adventures with American aurors, show us different way of magical life in USA...
These could easily be separate movies or franchises...
This is a movie about making money on previous admiration and love. I'm sorry but my main feeling is that JKR sold her soul.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

580,alexisbessonmackain,somewhat lacking but nowhere near as bad as critics have said,6,16 December 2018,"Firstly, i would like to make it clear that i am a huge fan of the harry potter movies which were funny,entertaining, well acted, visually beautiful and both surprisingly emotional and though provoking at times. but this is not the main subject of the review. as we all know making prequels to an original series of highly acclaimed series as good as the originals has never been completely successful, look no further than the hobbit or the star wars prequels to see my point.so first things first we talk about the predecessor to this film, fantastic beasts and where to find them which while flawed still introduced an intriguing new story to the harry potter film universe with likable characters such as newt scamander and his friends as well as two interesting and sympathetic villains in the form of grindewald and credence.now onto this film, i watched it yesterday in the cinemas and frankly i had a pretty good time entertainment wise but the film i felt suffered from being more of a franchise starter rather than a film of its own which is a common problem you find in most movie franchises today aka the dc extended universe. this results in a film that tries to do too much in a short amount of time resulting in an unnecessarily convoluted plot which introduces too many new characters, resulting in very little plot progression for the franchise although the film has many redeeming qualities which include:good acting, surprise performance is johnny Depp who has potential as the main villain,beautiful visuals as usual, a passable musical score which is not memorable as the rest in the franchise, and most of the old characters get some fairly good character development although it still leads to too much subplots to process in one film.overall linking back to my starting comment on prequels, i wuld say that fantastic beasts has potential but needs to try to avoid the mistakes that other prequels and new movie franchises have committed to make themselves known to a wider audience",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Then its jude law who is also a class apart. He executed dumbledore perfectly. The only thing i wanted him to was have more screentime.

586,GlarkCable,Disappointingly unimpressive,6,7 December 2018,"The plot of this film makes absolutely no sense. What do fantastic beasts have to do with Grindelwald and his crimes? Grindelwald literally never encounters a single fantastic beast. They could and perhaps should have just focused more on the aurors, and called the movie ""The Crimes of Grindelwald."" But I guess, seeing as the Fantastic Beasts film did well in the box office, they didn't want to get rid of Newt just yet. But truth is, his character feels lost here, like he doesn't belong in this film. This should have been a battle between the aurors and Dumbledore versus Grindelwald and his followers.Speaking of Grindelwalds crimes... yawn. So, he has a couple of is followers kill two adults and a child. Okay. That's boring. Not at all the exciting, legendary villain we were hoping for.The movie is chock-full of characters we barely get to know but are still supposed to care about and feel sad about when bad things happen to them. You can't just throw a bunch of characters in there, give them famous Harry Potter names like Lestrange and expect us to feel for them. That's not how that works.Jude Law delivers a fine performance but I wish they'd done more with him.If you'd ask me to explain the plot to you, I'd be done in like two minutes. Almost nothing happens the entire film. It's just people wandering around Paris and talking to each other.

593,leobbiagi,This was from the genius behind Harry Potter?,6,22 November 2018,"What made Harry Potter such an amazing series it's layered and relatable characters. Fantastic beasts however has one dimensional characters. Each actor try's to bring a quirky characteristic to make their character more interesting, however it makes the character hard to watch and difficult to relate with. The time that should be used for in-depth character development is put to the side to advance a plot that drags on and is obviously just fan service.
The scenes with Migonical are obviously fan service because in the book she born in 1945, eight years later. Nicholas Flemel is jambed into the plot for clear fan service as well. In Harry Potter, you never meet Flemel, what make that work so well is JK Rowling that leaves that to your imagination. The end reveal that Credence was a Dumbledore was an interesting twist, however it messes up the time line great because, Albus's father died in Askaban in 1890 which would have to make Credence 37 which isn't true because the actor is 25 and he is a teenager in the first film. Even though this was a surprise twist. You can easily tell that it was just fan service and no one fact checked it to make sure that it holds up in the time line.
The movie overall is enjoyable, even though it can drag on sometimes it still is fun to see more of the wizarding world.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

(likable yes but...) he is just a major distraction and ruins the style of the movie. he does absolutely nothing to progress the storyline. i think this movie is an insult to fans that grew up with the original ""Wizarding world""...... since CGI became cheap it doesn't mean we want cheap CGI movies.very big applause for the actors, editors and setbuilders btw. no remarks on that every scene looks great 👌",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

609,nsharath009,An Overstuffed Sequel Loses Some of Its Magic,7,11 November 2018,"The second sequel in the fledgling spinoff follows a familiar pattern, but too many characters and too many storylines rob it of its most enduring charmsEven magic takes a little bit of planning, and in David Yates' ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"" both are in short supply. In it second outing, the cracks are starting to show in J.K. Rowling's much-hyped followup series to ""Harry Potter,"" a franchise that is at the mercy of slapdash planning (these films are cobbled together from various pieces of ""Wizarding World"" material, not single novels) and the kind of higher-up decree that promised five films (five!) before the first one hit theaters. It's a lot of time to fill, and while the second film in the franchise nudges its narrative forward, it's at the expense of a bloated, unfocused screenplay.Mostly, ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" is hampered by the unwieldy meshing together of disparate plots that could service their own films (some of them surely better than others). At the center (when he's not been shunted aside by all those competing narratives), there's ostensible franchise star Eddie Redmayne as nervous magizoologist Newt Scamander. Newt's ditzy charm grounded the first film; and when he's allowed to lead this second story, it's as whimsical and good-hearted as any in the franchise.It's all the other subplots that damage that notion, from a charisma-free Johnny Depp taking over the role of evil Wizard Gellert Grindelwald to a convoluted section all about the family tree of Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller). Portions involving a young Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) can't reach their full potential; they're consistently cut short to zing back to yet another plotline (and that's without diving into all the subplots about Newt's brother, his ex-girlfriend, his beloved New York friends, and Credence's companion Nagini). All this convolution promises to converge during Grindelwald's coming-out party, a fear-filled rally that is as timely as it is unsettling. Before that, Yates and Rowling must bring together a motley crew of wizards and muggles both good and bad.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
610,yoshi-whitby,COnfusing and boring,1,31 March 2019,"Not really sure how I can elaborate more on what other people have said, but yeah, very boring, long winded and confusing. If I hadn't watched the movie with someone who already saw it, I would have been lost. I had to keep pausing it and having them explain the plot to me. I was worried I was being a moron, but looking at other reviews, it seems I'm not the only one who was completely lost. Characters seemed to turn up out of completely nowhere, and some of the time, they're characters who have already been in previous scenes but since they weren't very well introduced or explained, I just kind of forgot they'd been in the film before. It's called ""crimes of grindalwald"", but he doesn't really do much of anything except walk around, all the film does is establish lore for the next movie.The reason I hated the first Fantastic Beasts was because it felt like one long trailer for the next movie. This movie just felt like a world building info dump for the third movie in what I presume will be a trilogy. I'm still waiting for the movie I went to watch 2 years ago and they keep holding it off. The characters aren't nice or lovable, or memorable, so when they turn evil or die, I simply don't care about it.The main character, whatever his name was, (just had to google it, Newt Scaramadger) is entirely unlikable and didn't really need to be in the film. Like, leave him as just a character for exclusively the first movie, and put all the content of the third movie into this one. all the grindlewald world building would only take like 15 minutes with him gone. And have grindlewald actually commit a ton of evil acts. His henchman does one or two bad things, but the man himself is legend for being a dark wizard and general menace, in this he just seems to be an extreme politician. I get the social commentary and all, but for a film called ""crimes of grindalwald"", i wanted to see him commit some. This film should have covered the period it skipped over. Why was grindalwald in jail? lets see him be friends with dumbledore. how did he become a dark wizard? all the stuff I'm actually interested in is skipped over, in favor of having some weird kid who turns into a floating black cloud who I don't care about be tracked down by everyone and treated like he has some important destiny that we aren't privvy to.But yeah, the plot was very messy and didn't make much sense. You shouldn't need a 300 IQ to piece together the plot of a Harry Potter film. I also felt myself questioning holes in logic in the wizarding world I never even had before, because this film didn't portray the universe very well. none of the charm of harry potter, just a bunch of special effects and a drab, predictable fantasy world that didn't make me excited one bit. Overall, will only watch the next one out of obligation, and will definitely wait until a friend or family member gets a DVD so I don't have to pay to see it.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
611,ramonapopa2000,A complete atrocity,1,2 March 2019,"When I heard that Rowling is going to write more stories in Hogwarts' universe, at beginning I was skeptical, but I bit it. I guess I somehow hoped that she had some some mojo in her.(note: so far I am talking about 1st part of this movie)The title with ""Fantastic Beasts"" already made me raise an eyebrow, because I instantly associated it with complete garbage (I mean, Fantastic Beasts ? Really ?Gimme a break, lass). But I still hoped it will be at least viewable.Then that dude Scamander entered the scene, and I instantly took a /facepalm posture since I couldn't understand how idiotic could someone be to actually develop such a crappy character as the main protagonist. And for the next 10 minutes or so I really hoped Scamander will die a horrible death, hit by an icecream truck, burn at the stake, anything would've worked, really...But I was unlucky and Scamander not only lived, but he appeared in the second movie, this Grindelwald thingie. Which again, I hoped that it will be at least a bit better, afterall, it will sport Johnny bloody Depp in it, so how it could be a bad movie ?Lads. Ohh, dear lads, how wrong I was ! Not only it wasn't better, but actually it got even worse than the first part. That dude Scamander went from stupid to semi-disabled, and all the movie basically is a complete atrocity that should be deleted from history, along with the writer, scenarist, director and producer.And obviously the ones who are fans of it.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
612,hasnarb,Mesmerizing movie with no definite plot,5,20 November 2018,"No matter how bad you guys think the movie was, you can't help but to feel mesmerized with each of the visual presented. Being a Harry Potter fan I am, I was happy to see the wizardry universe once again. Many of the fantastic beasts were shown along the background places full of magic such as the legendary Hogwarts, it is just simply out of this world, it is beautiful from every angle. Many characters and many references from the original Harry Potter series are also introduced with some unexpected twists and turns which will be revealed along, it was fun to connect all the dots. Any Harry Potter fan should be able to enjoy it to say the least.But on the downside, I do feel like the movie was trying to fit all ""easter eggs"" from the previous franchise in those tight two hours, in which they failed on doing so. The movie ended up being nothing more than a feast for the eyes since the definite plot was nowhere, focusing more on the revelation of old secrets, which ended up making the whole movie basically stagnant. There was just this constant feeling of amusement especially from the CGI, but the feeling surely didn't build up because the plot was so flat. I ended up asking to myself the entire movie about when will I get to see the climax, in which it never showed up.Perhaps the producers are trying to give a sort of introduction of the next movies, in which I believe will lead to Dumbledore and Grindelwald's great battle, so that I suppose the next movies' pace should be faster. But I was disappointed with how this movie was delivered, because it just made me not interested. I hope the next movies will be better.In conclusion, go for this movie if you guys miss seeing the stunning visuals from the wizardry world. If you go for a great story that will blow your mind, this might not be your cup of tea.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

616,TrackArtist8,"'Fantastic Beasts' saga improves, but it won't reach Harry Potter level",7,19 November 2018,"This one is far better than the first installment. Basically, the direction of this movie is clearly defined and all the subplots are pointing to the same target. The tone is darker in general and the story is deeper involved in Harry Potter's world. Magical creatures are better controled in this movie, not absorbing much relevance in the plot, what, in my opinion, was a lack of the first film.The cast is great. Apart from great and highly announced additions of Jude Law and Johnny Depp, who are as good as always, there are surprising great newcomers as Zoe Kravitz and Callum Turner, between others. Honorable mention to the last one, not only for performing a very interesting new character, but also with very good acting (specially in the polyjuice potion moment).But not everything is perfect. I find the principal con of this film in the commercial perception of it. This film transmits a bussiness sensation that doesn't fit very well, because it seems to be made thinking more in the box office than in the story that is telling. To do this, it contains some topics of nowadays film just because it is the latest in entertainment filming. A huge quantity of references for excited fans, plot twists that seem forced, unnatural return of characters, etc.I think the secret to enjoy this film, and some others of today, is to assume that it won't reach the level of its precedents. I expected the highest level for 'FB and where to find them' and I felt quite dissapointed. When I found what this not-so-needed re-opening of Harry Potter saga could go, I understood to watch these films simply to enjoy.However, I was waiting with hype to see this movie, to check if I was right. After watching it, I consider that I did well with my decission of leaving the evaluation of 'Fantastic Beasts' saga to the moment after watching the sequel, because I found the entertainment I wanted, despite I have assumed that it won't reach the level of Harry Potter books. All that said, it is a good movie, I enjoyed it, and I will go to see the third one, which I hope to enjoy without having that commercial sensation.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
617,Chronosus,"Finally, a bit of magic!",8,14 November 2018,"As someone who isn't that impressed with Potter movies in general, Azkaban being one exception, I went in with no expectation. I find Yates output really safe and lacking real magic in directorial sense. First Fantastic Beasts was more of the same, and when first reviews started dripping in it seemed that on top of that this movie has that modern ""let's cram everything we come up with"" blockbuster syndrome.Well, color me surprised! I had real fun and was really in awe with some moments. The film just looks beautiful, and adding to that is 3D. Yes, 3D is great in this one, all the way through. It adds noticeable depth to even most static scenes. Story is solid and it doesn't feel over busy as reviews suggested and it's easy enough to follow even if you're not that into Potter lore.Solid performances all around, but the real standout is Zoe Kravitz. She's really compelling sand actually stole the show for me. Hope to see her soon in lead role. Also, Depp in a role that doesn't suck. It's been a while.If I have one serious gripe with it, it's why call the whole serial Fantastic Beasts if the actual beasts take a back seat for most of the movie. They're fun and everything, but serve almost no real purpose at all in the story. Almost as if they put them in just because the title demands it.

As my personal review, since the first time I watched the Fantastic Beast and where to find them in 2016, I expected the storyline of the sequel can be more interesting comparing to the first one, however, all my feeling when I walked out of the theater is that I didn't find anything improved except for the far more complicated storyline that totally confused me. First, the scene switches too fast when Gridelwald escaped in opening scenes and some parts I can not understand, for example,what is the relationship between the unknown creature and Gellert Gridelwald? And why Gridelwald escaped? How he escaped ? What is his plan ? The films shows absolutely no sense when Gridelwald escaped because I could not understand how suddenly the Grindelwald turns into someone else? Except for the confusing beginning, the whole film is a mess, the director shifts the scenes and made the storyline progress too fast when in several minutes the spot changes from Uk to France then suddenly Jacob and Queenie was playing something inside the room together, it is too confusing because I remembered at the end of the first film I saw them broke up and there is no way that Jacob Kowalski could be with Queenie in France since he already lost the memory at the end of the previous film. Why so suddenly these two know each other again and this time they played even higher.

Me, I can't wait to see what's going to happen next after the twists the end of the film takes! It's going to be a long two years.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The story line was very lacking and all over the place in continuity. Eddie Redmayne is however still great as the foppish awkward Newt, just love him! If you are a HP fan you have to see it. However to me as a fan it was dissapointing.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The nagini part is cool. But the Credence and Leta Lestrange parts are a bit forced. A proud pure blood wizard had romantic feelings to a black woman? Sounds a bit too PC. And what's with the changing babies story? And Aurelius Dumbledore..really? Why we never heard about that one before in the Potter books? All and all it's a visual feast with confusing and not so interesting story. Depp, Law and Redmayne gave a good performance. And the hogwarts bit is nice. Hopefully it will get better next time..",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
641,gulzk,Apart from a few plot holes being a die hard Potterfan i enoyed this till the very end!,8,18 November 2018,"Since i'm writing my first review on here after being an active member for years i'll come straight to the point. I walked into the cinema for this movie with a burden since i knew that critics have been pretty much slamming this movie since it arrived. Well the truth to be told it does'nt deserve this much hatred and criticism. Being a convinced Potter head and a huge fan of the potter universe for years i'd say that this film plays its spot intelligently by introducing us to just the tip of the iceberg of the story and specially the story of credence and Dumbledore. Though i must say i was extremely shocked at the cliff hanger ending at the end and am still quite confused at this new plot hole they introduced but i hope its cleared much efficiently in the future movies to come in the series.Over all the CGI and action sequences have been near to perfect in this film and have greatly improved compared to the previous one. The beasts introduced are more lively, vivid and powerful . I also loved the emotional aspect of this movie since if you're looking into the movie carefully you can sense the theme of ""Love "" going all around the movie which is a main part of JK Rowling's universe.Still an overall joyful and thrilling experience till the end apart from a few hairy plot holes and some characters which should have been introduced better.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
642,imiramesa,What the heck was this?,4,23 November 2018,"Seriously, what was this? I was really excited after the first movie, the trailer looked very promising, however the story of the actual movie was nothing what I imagined after watching the trailer and reading loads of news on pottermore. It felt like they used plot twists instead of building a good story, the characters that were so lovely and relatable in the first movie got horrible bad, almost parodic. lJacob and Queenie, their love was very nice and deep before, it got ridiculous and cheap now, where Jacob is running around Paris to find her and every second word of his is sweetie, and Queenie not only putting a spell on him, but also in the end joining Grindelwald? Also Creedence joins Grindelwald too??? WTH??? Not to mention his identity, which from being a random orphan, to be a Lestrange suddenly switched to a Dumbledore. This is almost as bad as learning that Voldemort had a daughter whose identity was so well hidden that even those living with her mother under didn't know about it. Also would have loved to learn more about Nagini, who barely had any role, even though they made sure to put a huge prehype on her character.This is a huge disappointment, and I wonder if Rowling really wrote the story or not. Only good point was that Dumbledore and Grindelwald, the creatures and Newts were likeable characters.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
643,Kingofthehill000,Good movie could have been much better.,6,16 November 2018,"Well let me start by saying do not compare this to Harry Potter as that saga is a masterpiece based on books written with alot of time and effort.This movie starts of well with the prison escape scene which was quite entertaining but what it lacked is any sort of feeling of fear or dread for the main villain Grindelwald,the movie later picks up very slowly with scenes which were quite boring,introducing characters after characters and bringing other under developed characters from the previous movie expecting us to care about them.The previous movie had something nice which they should have concentrated more on in this movie,was newts relationship with his many creatures,they had quite a bit of that in this movie too but they introduced so many new characters thats they overshadowed the creatures.The plot was a bit odd,it felt kind of empty,like only Credence plotline was the only thing you cared about,which is weird because the name of the movie is crimes of Grindelwald yet Grindelwald motives ,the acts he does was hardly explained.Now the good parts they do bring up nicely is well the visuals,how even in the wizarding world people can be cruel,racist etc and people just want freedom from all this so they resort to even following a person like Grindelwald ,The sacrifices/choices you make for those you love.These parts were beautifully done,I am also greatful they didn't ruin any of the settled lore of Harry Potter like star wars did ,infact they expanded on it which was nice.i would recommend watching this movie as a complete saga as this one feels like an incomplete story,but other then the slow start the movie is fun to watch.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The slickly dressed characters, and atruistic backgrounds cant hold the weight of the paper thin characters and cgi which wouldnt impress anyone at any point in history.I dont understand how this movie was put together.
Too many ideas, and losing any love for any relationships or characters.Only way i see to revitilize the franchize is to put it in someone elses hands who can do whatever they want with it. Whithout being birddogged by j.k.She had to ok this. I guess all good things must come to an end.

649,Carolyn_Channing,Entirely capitivating and leaves us begging for more,9,11 November 2018,"The second installment of Fantastic Beasts, titled Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald picks up shortly after the first where Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) has been captured and is being taken transferred back to the British Ministry of Magic when he manages to escape and take over the carriage in which he is being transported. As the opening scene, this sets the visual standards for the film extremely high. As they are hurdling in the sky on a carriage in a thunderstorm, the tension and excitement build setting the stage for a fantastic film.Newt (Eddie Redmayne) is back at his home, tending to his collection of beasts when he is approached by Dumbledore (Jude Law) to help track down Credence (Ezra Miller). Credence, after the first film, has spent time searching for his mother and who his real family is. He is lost, and alongside Nagini (Claudia Kim), he's searching for a place to belong. With Grindelwald on the loose, Credence is surely his next target for recruitment into his following which seeks to take the superior status over no mags/ muggles and restore pure blood to the wizarding world. Racing against Grindelwald to find Credence, auror, Tina (Katherine Waterston) manages to track down a lead. As Grindelwald works his magic and charisma to convince the wizarding world of his beliefs and goals, friend turns against friend, lines are drawn, and sides are chosen, changing the wizarding world forever.Tackling the infamous wizarding world is no small challenge, but the visuals in this film are nothing short of magical. They work so well to create the perfect atmosphere for our story. From the opening scene to the very end, the visuals bring about an enchanting experience for the audience. I can't get into details without spoiling the ending, but man is it intense. Newt continues to his love and protection of magical creatures in this film, and each one is so spectacularly crafted. The scenes where he is home and taking care of the various creatures is incredible.In this installment, we get a bit more of the backstory of a lot of characters including Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Newt, Leta, and Newt's brother, Theseus Scamander (Callum Turner). The way in which it is handled is exciting; as the film unfolds, we learn more secrets of the families of the wizarding world and gives us more perspective on the origins of our beloved characters of the Harry Potter series.The performances in the film are pitch perfect. Eddie Redmayne continues to stun as Newt Scamander. His gentle, awkward, kind, and loyal nature continue to shine through his character, making you fall in love with his character more each minute. Katherine Waterston, while a decent performance, tends to fall a little flat for me. Jude Law as Dumbledore sounded like a strange casting choice, but after seeing the film, it works so well. Ezra Miller gets better and better every time I see him on screen. No matter what he is doing, he wholly dedicates to a role to bring us the best possible version. As Credence, you feel both empathy and fear for him as he tries to navigate what his life has become at no fault of his own. Zoë Kravitz as Leta is pretty fantastic, and I love where they go with her character in the film.The big question on everyone's mind is how is Johnny Depp? Despite anyone's personal feelings towards him as an actor, it can't be denied that he dives into and disappears in every role he tackles. Grindelwald is no different. He becomes a terrifying, intoxicating, and charismatic leader, hell-bent on manipulating the world to his liking. There are scenes where he will enchant you into almost believing him and the next, he will terrify and appall you.Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald takes the first installment and improves upon it tenfold. In the film, we see a strict division in the wizarding world that is sure to shape the characters in a new way come the next installment. This film is darker, more magical, and more thrilling than the first. It starts big and ends with a bang, sure to delight Harry Potter fans the world over. It is all that we loved about Harry Potter and more, bringing the excitement back to the wizarding world once again. There are tons of little nods to the fans of the original Harry Potter that are hidden in the film, solidifying that this story is indeed what will shape the world we know and love. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is entirely captivating and leaves us begging for more.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Despite its more darker story, the Crimes of Grindelwald is a welcome delivery of childlike wonder for a planet of ever- increasing ugliness.

Harry Potter will end up being the highest rated film universe in the world if this quality is kept end to end. An iron hand in a velvet glove.

It does have some comedic moments here and there and here it is darker and a little more depressing. I liked Flamel and Depp did a good job playing someone who was persuasive and creepy at the same time like he usually is. It was however a little confusing and convoluted. There was a plot but not as detailed as the first one. It was all trying to get Credence and each had their own reasons for wanting to get to him which I found interesting but it's not that bad guys.I can tell the plot here isn't going to be as big as the first because this movie is really supposed to be filler for the next movie they are going to make a trilogy. Jacob was still good but he wasn't as useful as he was in the first one and was just kind of there for the ride. Overall, it wan't too bad.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

656,sandiegocat,Another Amazing Magical Journey,10,14 November 2018,"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is another amazing magical journey through the wizarding world of J. K. Rowling's beautiful mind. Eddie Redmayne's Newt Scamander is still as self-effacing and awkwardly adorable as ever as he makes his way through the wizarding world of Europe. Jude Law is probably the best Dumbledore yet, at least on par with the first and way better than the second of the Harry Potter series. Favorites from the first movie are back in this second installment that will just leave you hungry for the next one.On a deeper level, The Crimes of Grindelwald of course brings to mind the rise of a certain real-life evil ruler, and we see how good people can be enticed to join the movement. On the surface, the message is perfect and appealing with all the ugliness hidden deep underneath.

657,herrzeba,Boring and too long.,1,18 November 2018,"I felt like I was binge watching 10 episodes of TV show, but couldn't fast forward boring story plots, fillers and flashbacks. There is no drive. Nothing really happens and when it does, it's underwhelming. For a movie about magic the script is very unimaginative.This script has the same block buster problems that are money focused rather than than wanting to tell a good and exciting story. People talking about things I don't care about in scenes directed very lazily to fill the run time and setup franchise. For what it has to offer, 1hr and 25min would suffice. There is no flow, pacing is terrible. Same like SW last ep.Newt is fun, opening scene is great visually but dumb logically. Kovalsky side kick does nothing to me in this one, humour forced. The most thrilling parts are HP nostalgia moments.When franchise is that popular, people will go and see it no matter what. When it makes money back, it's not because it is a good movie, it's because it's s popular and you liked that HP movies and books. I hope they end up with 3rd one, as making such a boring lazy script is an insult to us, viewers. However if they can milk it beyond that, avarage viewer is to blame.

660,senderik,Overstuffed with ideas but badly executed,5,6 September 2020,"The Crimes of Grindlewald had me thoroughly confused in more than one way. First there's the threat of Grindlewald, who seems a much bigger villain than Voldemort ever was but somehow didn't make it as the arch nemesis of Dumbledore and the crew. By himself, he could have turned this movie in a kind of magical James Bond story. But no they had to throw in at least 5 other plotlines, some of which magically disappear before the end of the story. The amount of loose ends you're, left with are enough to start a Game of Thrones like tv series. Speaking of GoT, the end of CoG is just as rushed. Instead of an epic fight between Grindlewald and his former beau, Dumbledore there is a lot of blue fire and.. a Chinese dragon? What is this, Pokémon? What happened with the great revolution? Did it fizzle out like all those blue flames? Also, apparently Grindlewald gave up and died in 1995 in Austria. So nothing happened? They didn't go after him? He didn't try anything again? The intricate politics behind the escape of Grindlewald and the struggle between pure blood (read Aryan) extremists and the moderates isn't explained further.

The plot is paper thin, the characters' motives are inconsistent, and the directing clashes with the tone of the movie.JK Rowling has also retconned a ton of canon plots, as if she doesn't know her own books/story. For instance, McGonagall is there, even though she wasn't even born yet. There's also character actions that don't make sense...TLDR; Everything is exposition, there's a lot of plot holes, there's no overarching story, and the characters act out of character.

In a series of three movies, the second one is more irritating and confusing than the first and not close to as good as the third. But you can't do without it, because it provides necessary background for what happens in the next movie. But ""Crimes"" really pushes the limits of viewers' patience, tolerance, and interest. So many new characters, and it's hard to tell who's important and who's not. Very murky plot, focused Credence's birth family, but that often gets lost amidst all the other things going on. Any HP fan will be concentrating on the younger versions of characters we've only met in their old age, and on seeing characters that we've only heard mentioned. Figuring out what's going on is like trying to unscramble eggs! However, a third movie is obviously planned, maybe even in production already, and it will probably bring everything together. I fully expect it to be excellent. But, blimey! Could J.K. Rowling not have written books for this series, so we could go back and re-read them to figure out what's going on?

671,findmyself27,I stopped watching after 5 minutes.,1,3 January 2020,"This movie is vastly different from the Harry Potter series, and from the previous ""fantastic beasts and where to find them"". This movie deliberately goes out of its way to frighten viewers, completely takes away from the entire Harry Potter series, and is pointless and violent. It seems that the people who produced this film felt the only way it would be successful would be to have a high gore and scare quotient, and to run amok with a storyline that is generally family friendly and make it the reverse.
The feeling of the film is palpably terrifying, and made me feel afraid from the second the opening sequence began. I don't know what JK Rowling was thinking, allowing this film to become a soft core horror film; but apparently she thought that seeking high ratings and high box office money was better than making a worth while story for the whole family to enjoy. Fantastic Beasts and where to find them was brilliant. It still remained within the family category, and didn't go over the top with the violence.

It seems that they learned from the feedback -or should I say backlash- from the first one, and improved all aspects in the second one. They mainly did that by numerous references to the HP world we already know, drawing from stories and characters from that world. N. Flammel, Nagini, Dumbledoor, a Lestrange, even a younger version of Prof. McGonagall, all nostalgic aspects that seem, at least so far, to be integral parts for what's to come in the FB series.

677,jessicadcarl,I used to feel joy from these movies...now it's more like anger,5,5 December 2018,"I am honestly angry they would do this to the Harry Potter world. My boyfriend and I named off at least 30 characters, scenes, plot twists etc. that had no business being in this movie. I love Harry Potter but I didn't know I'd need to memorize the entire Harry Potter world family tree and history to enjoy this movie. The plot was poor, the writing was poor. The only thing that made this movie worth watching was the magical world it took place in...but even some of that was nonsensical. Sigh.

678,ashleynkateri,Was There Even A Plot??,2,26 November 2018,"I'll be the first to say I LOVED the first movie and was super excited to see this movie. I never expected to not like this but was a literal filler movie. The only way I can think to describe this movie is if you've ever watched a long-running series that has 'filler episodes' where nothing really happens but it's setting up for something big-that's what this movie is.
I don't know how anyone could spoil this movie because literally nothing happened that isn't shown in the previews or in a tagline! This movie dragged and the second I started to perk up in my seat because it was starting to get exciting, the credits rolled. Also, this movie is called ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" and he's in there for maybe 5 minutes total.
A fantastic cast and fantastic special effects all wasted on a non-plot.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

681,claudineharper,Too dark in every way,4,18 November 2018,"Not an expert on HP, but really liked FBaWTFT (1st film), as it was sweet, light, fun and with great characters. This however is the opposite. It was way too dark, even asthetically, the sets, the clothes, the lighting: way too dark. Paris looked miserable, which it's not and barely any beasts! Newt, Queeny, Tina and Jacob are the characters we love, but they were barely in it and Queeny and the relationship melodrama ruined the Jacob and Queeny sweetness from the first film. The sub plots about three other characters' childhood identities were boring and had to use too much time with miserable and dark-themed narrative. Johnny Depp is overrated, arrogant and too much of a face to make his evil character interesting; I wished for a different actor. Of course it had to have a twist (eye roll), but it didn't need one. It was too long and miserable and missing all the fun and sweetness of the first film. What a shame.

And what is actually happening? And why so many should-be-removed scenes?The movie is a complete dissappointment, you wouldn't care for the characters involved, the protagonist needed someone to put him out of his misery, and the villian had a very weak motive and not even explained unless by few words.The movie had good cinematography and sound effects, the director made simple frames which was nice, so you can watch magicians, animals, and monsters messing around instead of going to the circus.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

691,Q-Panda,Beautiful action sequences separated by boring exposition,5,10 December 2018,"I love the Harry Potter universe. I'm not an ultra-fanatic-I enjoy too many different fandoms to devote a lot of energy to any single one-but I do love the world Rowling has created. This movie was not one of the more lovable moments.The whole movie felt like it was trying to be two different movies. One was Newt Scamander having entertaining adventures with magical creatures. The other was the bringing together of Gellert Grindelwald and Creedence Barebone. The only reason for these two to intersect seems to be that Newt was instrumental in capturing Grindelwald and neutralizing Creedence in the previous film.When Newt is interacting with the creatures, the movie shines. Eddie Redmayne excels at portraying quirky characters, and his portrayal of Newt is wonderful. But when Newt has to work with people, not only does the character become awkward (which is correct for the character), but the story bogs down in trying to force him to do things with people. Many of these circumstances feel beyond contrived. (Seriously, why would Queenie bring Jacob all the way to London just to see Newt? I'm sure this made sense in Rowling's head, but that sense didn't make it into the finished film.)For every enjoyable sequence with Newt and his creatures, there's a boring scene trying to shoehorn more information into the viewer's brain. Rowling seems to want to include all the details she put into the Harry Potter books, but she doesn't appear to realize that most of that detail was glossed over or left out of those movies. She's trying to write a novel in the form of a screenplay, and it doesn't really work.With all this effort to fill the movie with exposition, too many important explanations seem to be left out. Why does this movie involve all these characters Newt happened to meet coincidentally in the previous film? Because Rowling says it does. Why does Grindelwald want to take over the world? Because Rowling says he does. Why did we spend a large amount of time early in the movie with Newt and a creature who was never seen again in the entire film? Because Rowling wanted to. Why did we need to provide a backstory for a secondary character from the original series, and then do nothing of any significance with this character for the entire rest of the movie? Because Rowling wanted to.This entire movie spent two hours going from point A to point A.1. Half of the exposition in this film could have gone into the previous movie. The ""big reveal"" twist at the end is a midpoint twist, not a film-ending twist. I get that it's a middle movie, the second of five, but if you're making a two-hour feature film, it needs to have a story of its own, not just be a stepping stone between other parts of the story.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
692,alexfarah-01150,It's definitely not just me,1,11 August 2019,"My mom even hated it. I'm not just being an a-hole, this movie was AWFUL!Besides being boring, confusing and a mess to look at, it completely betrays the already tenuous rules of the universe. Example: pretty much the only constraint of Acio is that you can't use it on living things. If Newt can summon his pet using Acio, why can't he find Tina by saying ""Acio Tina""?",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

I still reread the books several times a week. I kinda liked the previous one in the Fantastic Beasts series. But this one... where to begin? The plot, if there is one to speak of, certainly does not match the title. Although imagery is beautiful, there is not much to the story. It's just one special effect after the other.

Crimes of Grindelwald was more connected with the original storyline and even more interesting (despite a puzzling ending). The plots are clear when you're familiar with the entire story. Good plots, good acting, terrific CGI.I like both of the Newt Scamander films a lot; Redmayne does an excellent job as a shy person more comfortable with animals than with people. Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol, and Dan Fogler are all great.I hope they make more of these films to fill in the Potter backstory; there are so many segments of the originals that can be fleshed out.

This movie is clearly an episode in the saga meant to differentiate who is on whose side, what those sides are, and the morality of choosing one or the other.

I thoroughly enjoyed the score and how well it fitted in at certain points in the movie. What the first half lacked, the second half picked up. I compare this film being the second in the series with the second and third Harry Potter films. These films set the ground for what was an outstanding finish to the Harry Potter story and I can see Rowling doing exactly the same here. The first half may leave you a little disappointed, I was thinking about a 5-7/10 at the time but the rest of the movie definitely didn't disappoint and I love the fact there is still three movies to go in this wonderful series. I hope they do more, it would seem a waste if they didn't because there are so many storyline's to play out. This film isn't directly comparable with the first but it takes it to the next level which I am pretty sure is what we expect from a series like this.

I'm a full blown Potterhead, yearly re-read the books, watch the movies, visited the studios more than 6 times.. you get it.When The end credits rolled my best friend and I looked at each other and we said 'I don't understand the negativism about this movie'. We were really awed about many different things:1) the visuals/colors/action scenes: this movie is one of the most colourful movies ever. So alive, so thrilling. The actions scenes both with beasts and with spells, are amazing!!
2) the music: breathtaking in combo with the scenes.
3) plot: there are a lot of characters introduced and they do not talk about every character as deeply. but remember that there are 3 more movies and that J.K.Rowling knows what the has to do, give the woman some credit. There is one particular person that is mentioned. People say it isn't right storywise, but, I'm not saying a name, the do not mention her first name...
4) that ending: I do have some thoughts about what is said can be right.

705,andrijj,Such an underrated and under-appreciated movie,10,25 April 2020,"I got a chance to rewatch this again recently and remembered why I loved it so much the first time I saw it. Such a beautiful, nuanced, and timely movie, in so many ways. Given everything going on the world right now and the rise of demagogue leaders and proto-fascism, the subtlety of the portrayal of the rise of a sociopathic cult leader is so well done. I think showing how people fall in with these cults of personality is just well done and so prescient.Grindelwald is such a great character. I want to see the next chapter of this, and I hope the American audience's seeming intolerance for subtlety and nuance doesn't mean we don't get to see the end of this story.Plus, just having an adult story in an adult version of this world is such a gift. The world building itself is amazing as always and the production design is absolutely gorgeous.I'm a little sad more people don't seem to appreciate this.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
706,jmariano99,"Frees itself from the ""Fantastic"" genre to a very good movie in all",10,15 November 2018,"I am a big Harry Potter fan and therefore I like the movies in general. But I have always liked them partly because of the own nature of the movies, because they were in the HP world. This one is the first one I can say it completely freed itself from that category: it is a GREAT movie, in almost every aspect.
Starting with the actors: Eddie Redmayne continues not disappointing and has his acting just on point with his character: the naivety, the ""being apart from the trouble"", all of it; Dan Fogler was a great satisfaction: if in the first movie, although he was amazing, his role was a bit easier because of the repetition of the amazement towards everything that met his eyes, in this movie this was not so much the case: he was already ""included"" in the magic world but he didn't truly belong there also, and he was amazing; now, Johnny Depp: there was a lot of talk around this choice and I do think he responded very well: he captures incredibly well the essence of Grindelwald, the evilness, the lies, the power of persuasion, the subtlety of the character. Plus, his last scene, when he casts his spell after the speech, that maestro-type movement of his: that´s excellent acting, and if anyone gets there still with doubts about him, that scene will for sure end them; lastly, Jude Law: I don't have much to say about him per say: he did as he was told, and he did it very well, although he didn't really have a great part in the movie. What is worth mentioning tho, is the merit of JK Rowling in writing his lines and movements: there was a lot of expectation to see how this ""young"" Dumbledore was going to fit in with our well known Dumbledore (moreover, with us being aware of his relationship with Grindelwald), and she dealt with it very well: you can see the old Dumbledore in Jude Law.
Secondly, the script: a lot of merit there: I have already talked about Jude Law, but the whole script in general, without having any big fight (the first movie had more of a big fight than this one) manages to combine very well the action (and the type of action) with the pure story telling, with the absurd talks between Newt and Jacob: it's very entertaining, and it's writing at its best.
As a consequence of the script, comes the directing, which managed to deal very well with all those constant changes of types of scene that the script provides and it managed to create amazement in the spectator when it was due (presenting Hogwarts, showing the place where Newt and Jacob take the portkey, etc etc etc), as well as tenderness (the boggart classes with Newt and Leta), and even gave a pretty decent portrait of Paris' life style and art.
Last but not least, the special effects: simply phenomenal. The last scene, of the counterspells against Grindelwald spells is one of the best scenes I have ever scene, if not the best, in what comes to special effects: you can really see those effects as just right, and that's very rare.
10/10 out of 10 for me, and I find it very difficult for me to understand this 7.9 (and it will go further down for sure) in Imdb right now. It is a ""serious"" movie, and it is an excellent movie.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Casting of Grindelwald and Dumbledore is just perfect! I thought that nobody can beat Ralph's performance as Voldemort because he was so great but the way Johnny portrays Grindelwald is something out of this world! Grindelwald is a terrifying character but at the same time I absolutely love and admire him. I understand him, get his point of view, when Voldemort wanted to kill everyone, just because he wanted. Johnny is very persuasive as Grindelwald and that's why people follow him. Scene with his speech really got, shocked me, I wasn't moving during his speech, not even blinking I think. I just froze. It even scared me in a way! I wasn't scared of Voldemort, but I'm terrified of Grindelwald. The speech scene I think will become iconic and Grindelwald himself will become an iconic character, villain. I watched it twice and still can't get over it. The only movie and character that had this affect on me in a very long time. Before it was The Greatest Showman and Freddie Highmore in The good doctor. Thank you J.K.

Because of Eddie Redmaynes performance I went in for the second time. I loved it, everything fell into place. I spent 2 years patiently waiting for ""The Crimes of Gridelwald"" and literally spent the last 20 min of the movie with my jaw on the floor. The movie is everything I had hoped for. Although, throughout the movie I found myself wanting to pause and rewind, afterwards I found myself plotting all the outcomes that could happen in the next movie and that is everything that the wizarding world franchise is about. In my opinion this is a movie to be watched twice, this a thrilling ride through the wizarding world, this is a definition of a ""bridge movie"", the 3D effects are amazing.

It had so many good, fun moments, but also was not afraid to pick up the intensity. There were definitely some darker scenes that will set the tone for the next movies in the franchise. All the characters had great personality and were well cast. Unfortunately, this movie did fall into the trap of being filled with way too many subplots, which did sort of make the movie feel over crowded at times. Sometimes something would happen that was confusing or that you didn't pick up on, but that wasn't to say it was a bad movie. The usual magic of the Harry Potter franchise was there, and it had a good plot with a few interesting twists, it just might be good to plan to see this one twice at some point so that you can pick up on all the extra details that you might have misheard the first time.

713,paligladayan,Genius & Nostalgy,10,5 December 2018,"I am surprised to see that the rating of this movie is less than 7. And what I find even more surprising is to read reviews saying the plot is missing.
Honestly, let me start by saying that I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. Born in 1991, I litterally grew up with these people! So consider me bias if you want, but I'm truly impressed by this movie, since I loved it as much as the Harry Potter ones.. I left the theater impressed and more than satisfied.
Let me start by the cinematography and the production. I don't think I've ever seen something more sophisticated yet realistic. While I was watching the movie, at some points it reminded me of the Harry Potter ride at the universal studios in LA, where you're basically unable to tell the difference between what's 3D projected and what is real. Truly amazing, it left me speechless at the end..
Second, yes, this is where bias has a huge role, and anyone who is not a Harry Potter fan would probably not share this feeling with me. But when the Harry Potter themed start to play, seeing Hogwarts, and Dumbledore so young.. I mean, I was having goosebumps for more than a few minutes at a time.. Hogwarts is my home too..
Actors? Or genius? Bundles of talents walking around in that movie.. Newt!! I still can't believe that actor played Stephen Hawking, a role so real tackling so many different aspects of the most human capabilities and feelings. And now this?! I mean I wanted to stand up and clap when the movie was over. Young Dumbledore? Yes I'm a girl, and he melted my heart, but! Seriously, I couldn't imagine young Dumbledore any different than the way he was presented in that movie. And Grindelwald was such a perfect dark character for this movie. His minimalist acting was truly mesmerizing.
Finally, as a truly loyal Harry Potter fan, I would like to say that I will for sure watch this movie again on big screen, because the plot had so many details related to the original 7 books, that I'm sure I missed them while I was too busy contemplating the beautiful sceneries and magnificent creatures. Also, I will impatiently wait for the third part which I expect to be even more captivating as I feel that these three movies are coming in crescendo on the level of production, acting, nostalgy and plot.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
714,yushhkh,just like watching fantastic beasts tv show,7,2 January 2019,"This movie is like a movie that is not a movie and its a preparation for something big for next episodes just like some episodes of breakingbad or most other series. It's just telling a story that you can summarize it in 10 minutes and movie shows it with 2 houres time it seems that screenplay is based on telling & telling to make people ready. honestly I think JKR with all respect I give to her had write this after reading x-men books because I think this is really close to them spicially to x-man first class which I like it more than this movie.
In Harry Potter, we saw a full story with their own happenings which together they were like a puzzle key answer to end of the series and thats the miracle of this series, but this one is very average and not a fantastic one.
movie has good aspects too like actings, spiecial effects, music and unexpected ending.
but as Conclusion this is an average movie.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
715,cocalvert,Rowling has lost touch with her creation,3,21 November 2018,This movie was an utter disappointment. My thought process is that fans of the Harry Potter will blame the director for the film being poor and choppy when really the issue was the writing in general. While the film has a plethora of good to great actors the characters they are portraying don't show much depth and even less sense to some of their decision making. Plus Harry Potter lore was tossed out the window by Rowling when she was writing this script so don't bother with trying to understand that. The very worst part of this film was the big twist she threw in to make the audience :gasp: except if you know anything about the lore and have watched alot of movies in your life you will just roll your eyes at how unoriginal and cliche it is. People may claim this was a movie to bridge the entire franchise for things to come in future films but it failed spectacularly.

716,Millbags09,An enjoyable watch but lacking in emotional depth,7,25 November 2018,"I write this from the viewpoint of someone who isn't a big Harry Patter fan, but I liked (not loved) the HP films, so perhaps I haven't the emotional connection with the characters and storyline that some have.I enjoyed this film, but it was lacking a bit in pace and parts of the story did drag a little. I also found it hard to connect/care about the characters in the story. This wasn't by any means due to how they were portrayed by the actors. There was indeed some fine performances by a cast of heavyweights. Plus the CGI was first class and the 'beasts' were truly fantastic.I guess my slight disappointment was the story, which is strange considering who wrote it. It does feel like a link between the first film and a final part, yet to be penned.So, all in all, a decent effort and enjoyable watch but I can't imagine it will appear on anyone's, even the most diehard HP fan's, 'film of the year' list.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

720,danieledwards-87201,"Nothing like the first one... This movie is politics and not magic. Rather it is the Inversion of magic, it's an ideology devoid of any concept of magic...",3,17 June 2019,"The movie jumps around far too much without thread or tandem.
It maybe one of those movies you only truly understand and fully comprehend after watching it many times, in tandem with what's to follow.
Meaning, this is a cash cow filler, riding the back of the previous movie and without the next movie, I see no real need nor desire to watch this movie again.It's very nostalgic and romantic with period details especially the fashion where not a piece of clothing is out of place and rarely is it untidy.It's so far not out of place and overly too tidy, as to appear a certain artistic merit, eye and purpose that is devoid of any realism even if it is artistic and appealing to the eye and nostalgia. It does to the eye what the movie does to the rewriting of history and political driven storyline into a game of two half's.It's ""just a movie"" and all that but what really lets it down is this need to make the movie about some other context other than that which belongs within the world of magic.It's attempts to breach paths of the normal/muggle/No-maj ""No Magic world"" with that of this other magic world, where their main problems are too normal, political and that of a human nature devoid of magic.
It's in a sense, these issues the magic world have that they shouldn't and wouldn't have these normal problems, if they're to be magical at all.Yet, here we are watching a magical spin on very normal problems.
This lets it down.
(Although, indeed if this was done correctly is also what could have made it a masterpiece. Yet this is far from such in my opinion.)Also the mentality of this us versus them, their is no fence for anyone and you just pick a side and stick to it a very George Bush mentality.
(If you think George Bush is magical then you will of course have no issue with this.)The movie overall has far to much Politics to be enjoyable for many.It has too many institutions, just like in our real world ""devoid of magic"" due to politics, desiring the enslavement of it's peoples into the worship and surrendering of its peoples and our individual authority, our blind obedience, by a people whom claim to act within our interests but seldom do.
Just like in our real world they're self serving institutions whom demand our authority or they'll tie our hands just as happened to Dumbledoors.While this is a nice touch, what isn't, is that this should be looked upon as ok.
As though this is acceptable behaviour from someone other than a tyrant, control freak or a Big Brother Orwellian State.As though ""if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to worry about"".
This mentalities justified and just stood back and accepted within this movie, when they're some of the most dangerous and acts of tyrants.
It's the like of what the true dark side would be behind, not the actions of ""Good Guys"" whom have made themselves the protectors of those whom have been forced to surrender such institutions their authority, like it or not...
That's tyranny and it of course remains unexplored and justified?Yet, we're to accept the romantic notion that everything will be alright in the end as good will triumph, in an old Good Versus Evil Game which must be taken seriously as the game itself is imposed to be serious and for you to accept like it or not. This is the game of tyrants whichever side or role you choose to take on. It always justified the unthinkable for a cause which believes itself to be righteous while they're played off side against side, while the true tyrants sit back and watch the world being torn into two halves so they can eventually intervene, divide and conquer.As you can see, many people whom would even disagree with my analysis here, there's far too much political spin within this movie that just shouldn't be here and their should be no need whatsoever for it to be here.
We shouldn't have to think in such a manner to enjoy this movie or base our opinions. It shouldn't be about ""if you don't do politics, you don't really do anything"". That's propaganda.The only reason it is, is so us normal people watching it will pick our very own and ""real"" sides and is the artificial grooming of a largely younger audience, into the worship of some form or another authority whom claims to work within their interests. All too often, such being the use of tyrants to usurp the power of an indoctrinated masses. Via the likes of such a concept within this movie..It's not a choice nor a question. It's simply a fact we have to surrender our power too institutions whom wouldn't have any authority if we didn't surrender that power to them.It's a strange double bind we all should be informed about via the play of such movies and it shouldn't be ignored if it's not driven for the sake of blind acceptance of such political notions of corruption of the hearts and minds of the masses.Such isn't questioned in this movie and overall, I'm sure it's predominately an argument over something which shouldn't be here in the first instance and the only reason it appears to be is to polarise issues as only politics can do and it's this which makes such a world lacking of magic, as they haven't banished politics to the basement of Hell so no such wars via polarisation could ever be possible.Instead, the movie polarises?
Do you see my point?If you can see past this or such propaganda has been lost upon you, as you've just accepted this movie as a movie, what you have left is a movie which jumps around from here and there to give the illusion of magic - Ironic or not so much?As magic and wonder certainly isn't the centrepiece of this movie but rather politics under a cloak of darkness, as being magic when it couldn't be any further away from wonder and magic, while it's this all too traditional polarisation. You could be confused as though this is dark magic by the conductors of politics. It's not magic at all but the banishment of any concept of magic or spiritual finesse.I'm sure many people would have picked up on this subconsciously if not consciously that something is very different in this respect to that of the previous movie. At least for the most part...This shows within the context of the movie itself by it being so clumsy and lacking of focus upon an otherwise incomprehensible script.
If it would have lost the politics and focused upon the magic I'm sure many of us would have been happier as the reason many people would indulge in such a movie, is as a form of escapism from such mundane day to day political BS.Instead, people who make this movie certainly must know this fact and have reframed to many of us a political concept of divide, rule and conquer by this repackaging.
It's purely and the greatest reason I don't like or enjoy the experience of watching this movie and find it very deceptive and a let down of what could have otherwise been an enjoyable experience, especially for the eyes.
Yet a direction within script is lost without the politics I've mentioned as the politics is what the script is centred around entirely.This movie is politics and not magic.Rather it is the Inversion of magic, it's an ideology devoid of any concept of magic, seeking to use a magic driven storyline for political ends, the banishment of any real magic for that of a political universe.
If you don't mind this deception or see it and can agree with the message you may otherwise enjoy this movie anyway.

729,sambath-kumaar,A novel in a movie,8,21 November 2018,"I felt the movie was like reading a book. Rowling has penned the screenplay and it definitely does not feel like a typical Hollywood movie. Every scene is like a chapter in a novel. The plot moves from London to Paris and Austria seamlessly and that maybe difficult for an unsuspecting audience to understand.If you are a fan of Rowling's words in the books, you may end up enjoying the movie. I enjoyed the fact that the movie had much more magic in it than the Harry Potter movies. The Harry Potter saga had a great story line focused on the pivotal character of Harry Potter but this is different. The Fantastic Beasts story revolves around Newt and Fantastic Beasts and the adventure that ensues as a result. Being the second movie in what is expected to be a five part series, my expectations are sky high for the finale duel between Albus and Gellert. Rowling continues her magic by creating such thrilling expectations with her writing.The movie is interspersed with comedy where I can recall I giggled/chuckled multiple times throughout the film. The muggle friend (Jacob) of Newt excels in comedy and that is definitely a bonus for the movie.What I loved about the movie and the writing was the fact that villains were not portrayed as inherently bad people. They were all given a history. A history of innocence and pain. A history that leads them on to do bad things while they themselves are not inherently bad. Queenie is a fantastic example for that. . Grindelwald on the other hand is a contradictory figure. Claiming dominance over muggles, he also vows to stand by love. Unlike Voldemort who clearly is against or doesn't even feel love, Gellert does. It is with love he declares a war on the muggles for the Greater Good! So contradictory and paradoxical but absolutely real although fictitious.Albus Dumbledore's portrayal by Jude Law was really good. I could see the reflections of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore in Jude Law's expressions at times. The invisible glove inserting the card in Newt's jacket was to be honest a little over the line but considering the fact that Dumbledore was younger and more playful, that makes sense too. Anyone else writing these movies would not be able to do an honest job if not for Rowling.A lot of other nuances in the movie can be understood for those who understand Rowling's writing and those who connect with it. The movie is clearly not for the larger audience. I hope Rowling learns more quirks about writing for a large movie with a bigger audience but that will not stop me from experiencing all the 5 movies in IMAX.I typically do not write reviews but upon reading several negative comments about the movie before watching it myself, I went in the theater with low expectations. I was absolutely satisfied with what I experienced. I had to register that satisfaction for others to see. I wanted to share the experience of a Potter head watching this movie written by Rowling!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
730,James-Yellowley,"Not bad, but not great either",5,25 November 2018,"We were excited to see this film. For us 'Where To Find Them' quelled all doubt that the new franchise had nothing new to offer. It gave us a fresh look at the Wizarding world and did it with some heart too. It wasn't perfect but it was a very promising start.
Then there's 'Crimes of Grindelward'... A very pretty film about... Tearing down the stuff we liked about the first one? Or the now 10 movie world as a whole? We all left saying ""hmm"". Lots of good stuff, just too much nonsense too, enough thatit takes you out of the moment.Spoilers:
Half elves are a thing. Think about that.
Hagrid was the first (and only that we knew of) to domesticate thestrals. Granted he can't read so... maybe he thinks he's the first to do anything unless he's told otherwise?

To clarify that; after the rotten tomatoes review I thought it wasn't going to be great but I was hoping it would be great. I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and after watching those movies through the years, the way they use magic looks almost natural. Yes they use special effects but it wasn't overdone. In the fantastic beasts movie the magic is wayyy overdone. It doesn't look as natural as the potter films made it look. The potter films made it look more aeuthentic, more realistic. Another thing, ""they"" said (the actors) that a lot was going to be revealed but I'm honestly left with more questions than anything.

Where that balance point lies is context specific. As an example, Star Wars TFA skewed towards the familiar, probably rightfully due to the gap in time and the reception to the prequels. The HP universe ...There is so much to explore in this world that JK Rowling built. I enjoyed FB1 as a good world building follow-up, but am less enthralled by this second installment because of this balance issue. Without revealing any plot details, FB2 seems to go out of its way to collapse this world onto itself. Guys, it's okay if Rey isn't a Skywalker. It's okay that Aliens exist without having to explain where they came from. Not everything has to tie into everything.Otherwise, I agree with many of the helpful reviews. Plot was a little weak, more a filler than anything. The talent was strong in bringing these characters to life.

This movie doesn't even have an ending, it just rolls credits when they meet their time requirement, or at least that's what it feels like.People like me paid full price to see only half of a movie with a bunch of filler to make it feature length. Stop charging us full price for half movies. Just make the whole movie from the beginning. If your going to make sequels that's fine, but each film should be a complete story in and of itself. This movie is not a complete story.All that said the first half of this story was alright. The visual effects were good and the world being built is a refreshingly dark turn on the lighter world built up in the Harry Potter movies (at least the earlier ones).I feel that adding Dumbledore to this story is unnecessary. I get what they're trying to do but whenever you put a character like that into a prequel, you remove the significance of any peril that character might find themself in. Since you know they couldn't possibly die. But Jude Law is great, so I'm not too put out about that.If this movie had at least some semblance of resolution st the end of the film it would have scored higher.

There were too many plots that leave you disappointed at the end. Johny Depp was a pretty good actor. Overall, good acting, good effects all around. Interesting enough, I found that I disliked the movie before it. I didn't mind Fantastic Beasts before watching this film. However, I feel the lore and plots of the film leave fans kind of stranded with important questions.
I recommend watching the film, because there are a lot of questions that one personally has about the wizarding world and how it works. I feel like for example there is a similarity between Voldemorts parents and an important character's in the film. But it doesn't quite work and I'm afraid you might have to wait until the end of the film to really understand what I mean.
I feel a lot of fans share the same idea as I do, but the plot in the film leads to nothing. Don't get me wrong... its a twist. However, I feel like the plot would have been more interesting than the actual fact that we witness at the end of the film. Its like ""AHA"" and everyone in the theater is like.... really? Interesting... but not really.
I expected more for sure. And I guess maybe 6 stars is generous. I would say that it finally goes deeper into the history of the wizarding world which is why I said I felt I disliked Fantastic Beasts after watching this film. I felt this film lacked, and was disappointed that the distribution of information in this film wasn't evenly distributed with its predecessors.
One can tell that there is way too much information being thrown to the audience. Perhaps the directors realized it it didn't matter considering what I mentioned about the ending. However... still. Its a couple hours of a lot of information being thrown at one.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
755,vannah_rose,Decent follow up,8,16 November 2018,"Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald was in all...fantastic!
Pun intended.
Mind you, the majority of the movie is a slow unraveling of each characters back story, as well as current story. But when all magic breaks loose, it's full of twists and turns I didn't see coming!

Who is Credence? Is he a Dumbledore like Grindelwald said, or his he someone else? Why would Queenie betray her sister and boyfriend by joining Grindelwald? Is Queenie's switch permanent?

Now, after watching the film, I can justify my skepticism. The plot starts out fine but the writing can come out as messy or even rushed at times and sounds like it was made by a robot who didn't know what emotion was. It tries to make up for this by showing off the big- buffet effects it has to offer but ends up feeling like a bit of a disappointment.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

764,nbpegasus,A Fantastic Movie!!!,10,17 November 2018,"When I saw the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes I'll admit I was thinking about not going to watch it. I'm an avid fan of the Harry Potter franchise and loved the first one, so I was concerned Crimes of Grindelwald would perhaps change my view. It did, but for the better! This film is absolutely amazing! Before watching the movie, remember there's three more films after this one. Similar to a prologue in a story, there is character development and introductions. The critics say it's too hard to follow and that there isn't a plot. That's BS. It is important during this movie to pay attention to the motives of every character, and it's important to pay attention to whatever character is talking. Everything is important.The beasts are more charming than ever, and I absolutely LOVED Newt's home. It was stunning visually, the acting was absolutely charming, and everything about this movie was amazing. There's several ties to our world when it comes to Grindelwald, who uses his power to control people. It reminded me of the Russian Regime or Nazi Germany. The plot twist at the end is crazy, still not sure how to feel about it, but I'm sure how I feel about the movie!My favorite characters have to be Leta, Nagini (disappointed she wasn't a major character but excited for her role in the franchise), and *****SPOILER****** Nicolas Flamel.Please watch the movie before entertaining the critics. It is delightful and amazing and it is magical, to say the least.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

I really enjoyed this movie, just as much as the first installment. Of course, it is a bit different, and it gets down to serious business, so the tone is a bit darker. Which of course makes sense. There was still enough humor though, and I love the characters. The storyline is great, the villain is interesting, the special effects were amazing, and the history and lore for the Harry Potter series is rich and enjoyable. Although this movie is pretty amazing, it did suffer from trying to feed us a lot of information and history. Yeah, there is a lot to take in, and a lot you find out. Perhaps this movie could've been a bit longer too as some extra scenes between some characters would've been appreciated. But with all of the information and history that was given, I found it all to be pretty exciting.

At least much better than this one. I have to say that i am really sad from this film. It was so boring and unthrilling. If I would not drink that 2 colas and energy drink, I would propably fall asleep.
Only thing that I like was the ending... more precisely, last 20-25 minutes. And also the total end was really good, but whole film together was s***. There were so many informations and connections, what isn't bad but it was too much.

You can shatter the Obscurus temporarily, but the person hasn't died.""Now that that mystery surrounding Credence has been resolved, we can focus on the newest head-scratcher about him: how the heck is he supposed to be related to Albus Dumbledore?Well. the good news is that actor Ezra Miller says that will also be explained.

JK clearly has a plan and she's not about to show all her cards in one go.The acting is good, the effects are great with some really clever set pieces. The plot is heavy and they don't even attempt to explain it... which I think after 9 films and 7 books... I'm glad for. I feel that long time fans are rewarded well.There's some issues with characters being in the film who shouldn't be and messing up the timeline but hopefully this will be explained... personally I was just happy to be back in this world!Some reviews I've read want it all revealed and they don't like the waiting but if you're patient and are willing to take it for what it is... it's a faithful, Harry Potter worthy addition that looks to enhance not cash in",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
784,looncraz,"Some action, a touch of mystery, and a major twist.",9,19 February 2019,"This was a solid movie, the only disappointment, I'd say, is that it wasn't truly self contained - it should be seen more of a part of a much larger story.. an incomplete story.As such, I review it in kind - as a fraction of the story whose value comes as a result of the whole... because, on its own, it's a little hollow. Devoid of high stakes action, alluding to the mystery without getting us fully involved, and the major twist being the only saving grace.We reunite the cast from the first movie - all expert actors - and bring in Johnny Depp, who did fantastically well in the role - showing his wonderful flexibility. The beauty of the magic is still there, but the magic is done so constantly through the movie that it loses its mystique and we are left without the wonderment of the Harry Potter series or the first Fantastic Beast movie... but these are wizards spending time in their own world - they aren't students just learning magic or Harry Potter, who spent his young life devoid of magic. These are adults who spent their life in this world, this is just the way it is for them and I think the movie intentionally wanted us to experience it in such a fashion.I rate this movie as high as I do simply because, as part of the whole, it's a wonderful addition. It's not a cliffhanger ending, but it leaves you wanting the rest of the story. It has some conflict, but when you think it's about to come to a head, the story becomes a single event of magic and that's it... the battle lines are drawn in an eerily uneventful manner. Sides are chosen, a disaster seconds in the making took only seconds to prevent... no build up, no suspense, and no real threat since we already know the future.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

790,hermans-nathan,Fantastic mess,4,20 November 2018,"Fantastic beasts and please give us money because we all know you love them wizard films ...I had doubts when it was revealed that JK was going to write these films. The first one was ok,she convinced me and a lot of people that she was very capable to write her own films.
That was until she wrote this hot mess of a film. These were the fears I had for the first one, she tricked us by writing a good one first.There are so many problems with this one that I don't know where to start. So the good stuf firs. Acting was decent, even Johnny Depp did an amazing job. The sets and costumes are amazing as always. Music was ok. And that's about it I guess.While the acting was good, I actually mean amazing, because you have to be when you get to work with dialogue like this. A big part of your lines are mainly exposition to explain the overcomplicated storylines.
JK throws the one character after the other at your face that at a point I was couldn't really follow what was going one or which one I should care about. There were so many plotlines going at once, I totally lost my attention to follow the good ones.A big problem is that no character actually feels like they belong there and are thrown in with a silly excuse. Also why was Nicolas Flamel in this thing? Such an important character and he's only used in two scenes? Same for Dumbledore who fellt underused.Actually it's all boiled down to a very bad plot. It just feels forced and unnecessary. It's told in such a convoluted way that only the most hardcore potterhead finds enjoyment in this. Sorry guys, it's a no for me.I'm so disappointed that I didn't like this. But how could I when you're given such a mess. Should have went through some serious rewrites.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
791,wfjohnston14,"Too Much Setup, Not Enough Development",6,17 November 2018,"Even though I am very 50/50 with my thoughts on this film, I still thoroughly enjoy diving into the Wizard World. The magic is breathtaking (whether I understand it or not) and it's a fantastic world to escape to. That being said, this film feels like a 2 hour setup for the next three films while having poor development with its plots and character development for this entry.I do wish I had rewatched the first entry before going into this one. While I remember the major points, I didn't necessarily remember where things were left off with where certain characters were and their emotions. This film dives right into the action which wouldn't have bothered me except more time could have been used to setup character motivations and created deeper story lines. From then on, it is one event after another thrown at us with jump cuts from location to location getting right to the nitty gritty. The pacing was off with a lot of scenes not creating enough emotion and understanding of what was going on. Halfway through the film, I was still processing the first 30 minutes. By the time the ending came, I felt things had been so underdeveloped and thrown in there that I couldn't react the proper way to important events. Rowling should've instead chosen maybe half of the material in the film and gone over it more in depth diving into the characters more instead of setting up the big climax we all know will come eventually.With all that being said, I did enjoy most of the acting: especially Depp and Fowler. Kowalski is a fun loving muggle who we can connect to as he experiences more in depth the Wizarding World. I can relate even more when he just goes with the flow of the magic. I still don't understand everything and may never will, but I accept it for what it is and go along for the ride, like Kowalski. As for Depp, his portrayal of Grindelwald is subtle. We know he's bad and while his beliefs are not completely wrong, they're misguided and he's using the wrong course of action. Depp has fun being the bad guy and we enjoy watching his character unfold. Redmayne and Law deserve honorable mentions too. Law has some big shoes to fill being Albus Dumbledore but he does it very well thanks to his character being well written and loving. Redmayne has a nerdy sense we can't help but adore. His connection with the creatures is fascinating, see them as beings, not monsters. The only character I was unsure about was Quenie. Sudol goes fine with what she's given but her character feels too silly and love driven. I understand her reasoning for her action, but it was underdeveloped and could've had more depth to it to make it more meaningful.As always, the effects are extraordinary with each creature being fantastic. The film does a few things similar to its predecessor in seeing the different types of creatures but doesn't dwell on it as long. But even with fantastic effects, the climax is rather weak with a quick and uninteresting fight scene. The events prior to the scene are meaningful but not so much the action. It did not take away from my overall enjoyment of the magic.By the time the 134 minute run time had come to a close, I didn't know what to feel. I was given so much information that I couldn't completely process. The first entry in the prequel saga was not necessarily a great story but it was fun going back to the Wizarding World and had solid pacing. With this film piggy backing off the first, it feels like the first was meant to bring us back to the world, and this one to be the first Act of the bigger picture now that we are back into magic. I still find Rowling a very talented writer, but I don't know if her novel skills transition over well to the big screen. If she were to have a partner with writing the screenplays, she could mold her stories better to be dense without missing something or over complicating things. But all in all, I'm exciting for more stories to come and if the final twist is true, we are in for one hell of a surprise.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The Crimes of Grindelwald is weird as it feels like episode 1 and 2 of your new favourite tvseries. However whilst you normally only have to wait until next week (or bingewatch the whole thing on Netflix), for this one you have to wait more than 2 years.It's a beautiful looking film, with enough lore to keep fans thrilled for days and is worth the watch.

Great writing, directing, music and the performances were amazing! Rowling outdid herself with this screenplay.
I had gotten used to Johnny Depp as Capitan Jack Sparrow, to where I'd forgotten how much of a diverse actor he was. His performance as Gellert Grindelwald was both mesmerizing and charismatic, and Jude Law brought a new light into Albus Dumbledore.

796,jake-wilson-876-933806,Treat as a bridging movie,6,19 May 2019,If you think of this film purely as a 'scene setter' or 'bridging' film to further build the Fantastic Beasts world then it's absolutely fine. As a stand alone movie though it's a little drawn out and boring with not a huge amount really happening over the course of it. Further movies in the series may prove this one to be very important in the canon though depending on where they go from here. Overall a bit of a slog but time will tell on its place.,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
797,minhchau-dolphin,It could have been better.,5,13 January 2019,"Let just say, I am not a die hard fan of Harry Potter, and I went to see the movie because I love J.K.Rowling's wizarding world and Newt Scamander's Fantastic Beasts. I dragged my friend with me, who is not a fan (or Muggle, as you can tell), and now I felt really guilty for doing that.
I saw the whole ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"", I forgot about it, but it was brought back in my mind in a conversation with a friend of mine so I came here to leave a short review. Nothing new, since everyone else in here has said it clearly.
I felt like J.K.Rowling has lost her sparkles in this second film of the franchise. It was supposed to be just three films in the first place, so we would get to see the great battle between Grindelwald and Dumbledore - the two most powerful wizards that made the name of Albus Dumbledore go to the history of the wizarding world. But they broke it into five, and this second one was already a huge disappoinment to many Potterhead fans, including myself.
The real crime here is that Rowling tried to stuff too much, while it had too little time. 2,5 hours, with plot holes, too many unnecessary characters, and cliffhangers at the end of the film. Eddie Raymane is till awesome being Newt Scamander in his journey, but his spotlight was taken by other characters when he was supposed to be the one that shined. Tina Goldstein went from the strong willed Auror who wasnt afraid to fight to a sidekick and love interest. Her role has been deemed so much that I was upset, because she is one of my favourite characters. Queenie took a huge turn as she left Jacob to join Grindelwald's army, and Jacob himself tried to be optimistic, which lightened up the film a little bit, along with beautiful magical creatures (including Nagini in snake form). I love Credence, and I was glad Ezra Miller got a chance to take his spotlight, which he did pretty well. The Leta's family history made no sense in this movie, and Leta Lestrange herself. Zoe is stunning, but not her character.
The main point I guess, was supposed to introduce Gellert Grindelwald - the first most powerful dark wizard who was smart, charismatic and ruthless. I expected him to appear terrifying us even more than Voldemort the Dark Lord, but well, I was left upset. I can not tell whether or not Johnny Depp was a right choice for this role, since he is very talented, brilliant and devoted in every roles he ever played. Was him being the menacing Grindelwald, or just him being Johnny Depp with a ton of make-up and ridiculous hair style? I really wanted to see more than that, and his crimes, I mean actual crimes, in the next movie.
I was delighted tho, too see Jude Law as young Albus Dumbledore. He fit the role, played it out very well, but nothing else. Since this movie was just a filter for the next ones, I hope we will see more of him and Grindelwald.
After all, the movie was a waste of excellent cast. No story told at all, which made me wonder if it was really beloved J.K.Rowling wrote this one? Because it was such a mess.
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (with no crimes being told at all) is a journey of stunning CGI. It left us with more questions and expected us to wait at least 2 years to get the answers. Personally, I think I lost my interest and even my respect for J.K.Rowling after seeing this one.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
798,sushantmondal-107-897066,Where are the crimes?,4,26 November 2018,"It's so slow that frankly I slept for around 20 minutes in the film. Instead of showing us magical moments, the movie stretches everyday things that wizards do.. And came for crimes, there is barely 1 crime shown by grindelwald. The movie can be condensed into 40 mins action packed sequence, doesn't deserve 2 hrs as it doesn't have enough content. The Warner Brothers are just trying to milk the franchise and fatten their checkbooks by converting a single movie into two pathetic movies. Worst Harry Potter franchise movie till date!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
799,nikita1923666,So much better than a first one!,10,6 December 2018,"Honestly I was really disappointed in the first part of fantastic breasts, and decided that Harry Potter universe is dead. The second part gave me hope, so much better plot and actually interesting characters that got open. I like it and can't wait for third movie!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
800,oyesusanne,Confusing slog with no payoff,4,14 November 2018,"I really liked the first Fantastic Beasts movie. It introduced a new point of view from the Harry Potter universe, away from school and towards the wider, fascinating world.
Unfortunately, this movie here doesn't continue where the last one left off and stumbles over itself more than it manages to fascinate.
The main plot point is the boy Creedence from the first movie. We know he is bearing some kind of powerful magic energy, unfortunately he ran off to Paris, nowhere to be found. Now obviously, many different factions want to find this boy to use him for their own purposes, protect him, or just kill him, including our hero Newt Scarmander.
I'm not going to spoil anything about the plot, but the big problem with this movie is that basically everyone gets their own underdeveloped little subplot which just meanders through the movie and for most of the movie you feel like nothing is actually happening (because in fact, nothing is happening). You're watching characters that are not interesting doing things you don't care about and finding out things that are not important and you're constantly wondering what this all has to do with anything. Young Dumbledore shows up and you learn how he is connected to this whole thing - but that's it. He doesn't do anything and his presence has no consequence, he might as well not be in the movie. Of course, what he says will be important for the next movie I guess, but that's the problem. The whole movie is basically a giant buildup...but for what? The next one? There is no real payoff at the end.
Overall this movie is boring and irritating and it even fails at what Harry Potter is best - worldbuilding. You don't really learn or see much about the magical life in Paris at all. Oh - and there aren't all that many fantastic beasts either, despite what the title promises.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
801,ruben_helmersen,Darker doesn't automatically mean better,5,13 November 2018,"I love the Harry Potter franchise, but unfortunately this particular branch is not to my liking. Although we get to see Dan Fogler play Jacob Kowalski yet again, it is not enough to hide the many weak points of this movie. First of all, you feel that JK. Rowling has already embellished in her memoirs a little too often concerning her beloved characters, but this movie basically steps on several aspects that we have come to know as canon from the Harry Potter universe. Second, this movie creates a hostility towards the viewer by being dark and dramatic - much like the emo Harry Potter from the fifth movie who hated everyone around him. Now, I don't mind a little darkness, but I feel as if the director wanted to really introduce the dark side of Grindelwald in this movie. And I did not like it.
On a positive note, I think Jude Law made a convincing role as a young Albus Dumbledore, although I do not believe for a second that the Mirror of Erised would show that particular desire of Dumbledore, when a much more obvious one comes to mind.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

803,david-2011,"Dazzling special effects, no plot",2,23 November 2018,"This movie made no sense. Characters run from one special effects display to another, and say nonsensical lines which do nothing to shape or advance a plot line. There is no structure or continuity on what the characters do. Most characters exist to explain some piece of action or back story, but none of what they say has been supported by anything that precedes it. Effectively, every thread spun by dialog is a red herring, because it is never woven into a coherent story.The special effects look cool. Newt has a way with creatures.

I would have preferred someone Telling me the ending then to have watched the film.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
807,enectere,Not the worst but disappointing.,5,20 November 2018,"Perhaps I was expecting too much or got the wrong idea from the trailer, but I went into the cinema thinking I was seeing a film primarily about Credence, the Dumbledore/Grindelwald relationship plus some Nagini, with the main four (Newt, Tina, Queenie, Jacob) being somehow intertwined in the events that take place. Instead, I got a history lesson about the Lestrange family.Not saying that the Lestranges are uninteresting, but the film builds it up so much and, in the end, reveals that Credence is not part of the Lestrange family at all. And it goes even further with a plot twist that Credence is actually a Dumbledore, so you're left wondering why you even had to learn about the Lestranges in the first place (and how on earth Grindelwald knew about Credence). Some people reckon that Grindelwald lied to Credence about his origin, but if that's the case, it would make the whole film, or at least the ending, seem like a false cliffhanger to lure people into the next instalment. (I mean, imagine in the future after seeing the third film and you're watching the ending of Crimes of Grindelwald on DVD, thinking 'oh, but Grindelwald is just lying'. The ending would feel dead).I think one big problem was that there were too many characters. Being only the 2nd film in the series, it is crucial that the main four are continuously developed well. However, this movie struggles to do so, especially with Tina, who appears to be reduced to a minor role. Instead, it focuses on other characters like Leta Lestrange and Dumbledore, which is great but it means you've almost lost the foundations of the series. It also introduces Yusuf Kama, who you couldn't really care less about but is unfortunately important.The pacing is also a tad off, which I think is linked with the too-many-characters issue. In a film like Avengers: Infinity War, you have a lot of characters but most of them are grouped together in a scene (so you really only have about 3 plot lines to follow). In Crimes of Grindelwald, you have many characters but they all seem to have their own scenes and are doing their own thing (so you have to follow what each character is doing). And many of the scenes are slow paced, so by the time you return to a certain character, you almost forget where they were before.The positive aspects of the film included Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Newt. He is still able to capture that clever albeit shy personality. Johnny Depp is also convincing as Grindelwald. After reading/watching the Harry Potter series, you get the idea that Voldemort is more dangerous than Grindelwald, but Depp brings such a powerful, seductive and manipulative presence which makes you question whether Grindelwald is actually more dangerous.Seeing Hogwarts again (plus the Hedwig's theme) was definitely a highlight. I also particularly enjoyed the film music. I'm glad James Newton Howard brought back all the themes from the first film, and added new themes like the haunting Grindelwald theme.Overall, however, nothing much really happens, which is disappointing. Simply put, Grindelwald gathers up his followers and Newt finally picks a side. It feels like Crimes of Grindelwald suffers from the ""middle movie syndrome"", where it is just setting the scene for the real, juicy part of the story to come in the next film. I can see why many critics have given negative reviews.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

811,lahejarishabh,Highly disappointed,5,16 November 2018,"The second installment in the Wizarding world saga is the worst amongst both fantastic beasts films and all harry potter films. The film is slow and boring. Some silly, unnecessary scenes magnanimate your boredom. Good visuals and yet very less action. It starts with a good thestral chase scene and from there on everything goes down the hill. There is no thrill, no excitement, no good suspense created at any point. The film focuses more on locations, attires, soundtracks and visuals rather than a good plot or action sequence. The end battle scene was dull and disappointing, in fact the end battle is usually where you expect thrill and bombastic action for a good amount of duration. The title as well is entirely irrelevant to the films content. Which crime exactly? There was no such crime in the film. Also hardly any new beasts introduced, and hardly any existing beasts brought into action. The film felt like the director wanted to provide Harry Potter nostalgia and in order to do so he simply threw in some Harry Potter references into his magical cauldron and vola made the film!!!

I thought it lacked some of the action on the 1st fantastic beasts film. It felt rather slow and I agree with people that have talked about too many convoluted subplots. As others have said it feels like a filler aimed at explaining the plot ready for the next movies in the series. Bit too much CGI for my liking too and not enough character development. It was OK but not great. My daughter enjoyed it more I think but even she wasn't raving about it having been going on about wanting to see it for months!,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

(Spoiler free).They did a good job on the movie, but I must caution parents. This is not a movie for kids. It is titled ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" appropriately so. It does not contain the ""goodness"" that is captured in its predecessor, but rather puts its sole focus on evil actions being accomplished with the accompanying deception to pull it off. And its not as if ""what happened"" is new, but it was how it was framed and shown. You get to look at the darkness with limited rebuttle, and see a lot of killing without contest. So be cautious for family viewing, and I again advise sparing the little ones not of a mature understanding to process this one.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
814,jft-14584,A complete mess,3,7 December 2018,"What a mess! Useless scenes, convoluted and confusing plots, useless characters... It felt like they were trying to fill up the movie with whatever they could. I wonder why it is still called Fantastic Beasts, as the beasts are a mere accessory to the story, even more than in the first movie.
It started off great with all the new creatures (although yet another useless character takes up screen time for absolutely no reason), but soon they fall in the background and we have to hang on tight to follow the multiple artificial plots.
Where the hell does Creedance come from? He freaking died at the end of the first movie, and we have to accept ""the boy has survived"" as an explanation. Because we will not get more than that.The ""blood feud"" plot is ridiculous, completely manufactured to add scenes to a movie that apparently couldn't stand on its own based only on Grindelwald.
Among other problems of useless scenes that make us feel like the movie is going nowhere for way too long, the ending is simply outrageous. The D-bomb dropped at the very end is an insult to the viewers: a contract exists between a storyteller and its audience, and the rule of thumb is ""forecoming and delivering"". Why on earth is Creedance supposed to be related to Dumbledore? There isn't a single word on the matter in any of the two movies. Outrageous. I left the cinema feeling cheated and taken for an idiot.
As a Youtuber already pointed out, the wands became with Fantastic Beasts not a tool for casting spells, but just the boring derivative of a gun.On the plus side: Jude Law is an amazing young Dumbledore who deserves his own spin-off (but better please!) and the young actors were amazing! They did a really good job casting actors that were both talented and alike with their adult version. Great visual effects too.

820,magicstone2018,Could be more fun,7,17 November 2018,"It's hard to see some details since my friends and I were sitting on the first row, sometimes even hard to see what's happening. But the beasts are still as fantastic as they were in the first one and their personalities are more interesting. If there were more stories and scenes for these wonderful creatures would be better.Basically the story is about Newt goes to Paris to find Credence. It's great to see legendary people's stories that happened in their young age, the brotherhood between Newt and Theseus, the relationship Dumbledore and Grindelward, and how they treated each other after what happened in this movie. It would be better if they could show more stories of Tina and Queenie, some of the parts where Queenie needed Tina's help but Tina was with Newt or at somewhere else, they didn't show Tina's reaction which makes Tina looks like too ruthless. Also, there were not so many connections between the first movie and this one.The soundtrack is much more impressive. It actually makes the movie more entertaining to watch.I think the only problem is that there were no transitions between different plot, only sudden changes of camera shots from Newt and Jacob to Tina, or Newt and Dumbledore to Grindelward, or any other characters. Just like they did since the Order of the Phoenix. There should be more wonderful and funnier things they could do based on the excellent story they got, and the beautiful places they went.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
821,Mani_Mehraei,A super fun movie with a screenplay far from being flawless!!!,7,17 November 2018,"Everything seemed perfect except for the screenplay itself!!!
Actors and the director did a marvelous job. They could make me watch the silver screen for even more additional hours with no complain about the long duration of the movie. However, the screenplay was far away from being flawless!!!J. K. Rowling is the creator of this magical world and for sure she deserves to be the producer and the true leader of this project. However, I wish she could get more help from other screen writers to make this part a flawless task too.It's not all about transforming from a novelist to a screen writer. Her Harry Potter book series were full of logical mistakes as well. Therefore, I am not surprise to see twisted parts in the movie as well. For example, in the first movie of Fantastic Beast series, Newt is going through passport checking of muggles (No-mags). How silly is that when you can vanish and appear in any place you want in the entire movie?!?! I mean, such things keep happening in all her writings, and it wouldn't happen if she could use more help in writing!!! Could someone else do a better job than her by himself/herself? Probably not! She is great. However, even at her level, she can use help. Even Spider-man needs help sometimes, why not her? ;)I don't want to go through all the details. There are cool videos on youtube about it. However, there are things worth mentioning:1- What's the deal with the title of movie? It doesn't reflect the story at all!!! We expected to see the series of Grindelwald crimes, and instead we just observed him trying to gather followers!!!2- Many of the audience were confused by so many characters in the story. Personally, I loved this!!! It makes you watch all the previous series and read theories related to this magical world before watching the future movies. However, there is no doubt that in a screenplay you should clarify things carefully so that everyone without even knowledge of previous series could get the idea of what's going on. Even for those who are the fan of her writings, they were confused about many things. For example, the appearance of professor mcgonagall in Hogwarts during that period of time!!! Even if she was only a relative to the professor mcgonagall in Harry Potter, such things should be explained in the movie. We have enough mysterious about magic, we don't need to play with identity of characters like this.3- Many reviewers believe that Grindelwald character was not well-defined in this movie. I totally disagree. He is a complicated character and he is not all bad. Tom Riddle had the same character when he was a teenager in Hogwarts, but suddenly he became a monster whom you couldn't understand the reason. Oh... speaking of the reason... In J. K. Rowling's writings you can trace back even why a specific name was chosen for a character, but you can't find the reason why exactly the character behaves like the way he/she does.4- I loved the dark side of the movie. It was getting away from the childish start of the first episode.To sum up, I should say I'm looking forward to watch the rest of series and I even hope it won't be the last series of this wonderful magical world. However, I hope J. K. let other screen players to help her more through all this. That's the only way she can make it all perfect.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

828,Falcon_of_Light,When the Magic finally runs out,5,17 November 2018,"'The Crimes of Grindelwald' is the second movie in the Harry Potter franchise dedicated to the events that took place long before Harry was born - and portrays the rise of Gellert Grindelwald.
After having been a long-time Harry Potter fan, growing up with the books and movies, I welcomed every extension of the Wizarding World I could get. I remember well how fascinated I was when I first read the very first book and how magical and special it all felt to me, all the while being able to completely relate with those characters, with them being kids themselves. It opened up a whole new world to me and it was (and is) only rivaled by my passion for Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. I have so many great memories and so many beautiful moments I associate with these books. Like, when I chose to read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, while everyone else was celebrating New Year's Eve and I could dive into this other world that I had all to myself. Harry Potter is a large part of my childhood and very, very dear to me. It is also why I respected J. K. Rowling for her amazing work, for her gift to children and adults alike, to escape from the real world for a short while and join this other, magical piece of life.I was hyped when 'The Cursed Child' was published. Although, not for long. I was shocked how little these characters had in common with who I thought they were, with those three teenagers fighting for justice and peace. I was disappointed by the highly hectic and jumpy plot that read like a badly written piece of fanfiction. And so, I held little hope for 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'. But to my immense joy, I was positively surprised. They introduced a different kind of 'magic', a different way of this Wizarding World I grew up to love. A new setting, new characters, new events. It wasn't exactly Harry Potter, and yet it was, because you could still feel the magic in it. This special sprinkle of mystery and the characteristic odd sense of humor, that only J.K.R. can make work. So yes, when I went to the cinema to watch 'The Crimes of Grindelwald', I dared to hope once more. I was excited, I was curious.I have to say, before I get to the actual movie, that I know almost everything there is to know about Harry Potter from reading the books. I truly loved piecing it all together, remembering details about the characters, making assumptions about their past and imagining what it might have looked like all those years ago at Hogwarts. I have always wished for a backstory. Be it of the rise of the Dark Lord or from the days when the Marauders were students at Hogwarts, or even before that, when Grindelwald was terrorizing Europe. So, this movie, finally shedding light on these aforementioned crimes of Grindelwald, was a huge fan service to me - and not in a negative way. I expected to see a dark, haunting, political thriller with Grindelwald in this magical world I had come to love so much. I expected it to strike a nerve, to make me feel the fear those Wizards and Muggles must have experienced. But, alas, it did not.The movie was a huge let-down in many ways. But the one way I cannot forgive, the one aspect that still pains me the most, is that it has finally lost its magic. It did not feel like any of the books or movies before, magic wasn't special anymore, I didn't feel this tingle I associate with childhood memories and the wonders of the Wizarding World, no - it felt like a sci-fi movie entirely relying on special effects and ignoring character development and plot progress. Spells were mostly performed without wand or incantation, shiny and grand without real meaning, never before introduced but suddenly everyday knowledge. The movie was overdone and boring at the same time, both visually and plot wise. Newt Scamander was reduced to a loverboy and not given the chance to truly shine in his role as the endearing creature fanatic he is. Johnny Depp's performance was lacking everything Grindelwald was supposed to be: charismatic, convincing, witty, influential. Nagini's introduction was inexistent. She was just there... that's it. And Credence, well, without spoiling anything, let's just say they couldn't agree on what to make of him so they just threw in any idea they had. But there are also little things, things that annoy me as a Potter fanatic, things that are inconsistent, not congruent with what we know of the Potter universe. Like Dumbledore, being a DADA teacher instead of the Transfiguration teacher we know he was. Or Prof. McGonagall, teaching at Hogwarts before she was even supposed to have graduated....Especially, since it explicitly states in the books that she has been teaching since 1956, while 'The Crimes of Grindelwald' takes place in 1926/27. This is just a huge slap in the face for any Potter fact nerd (aside from other inconsistencies).
But I could have forgiven that, I could have overlooked the small mistakes (even though they did feel huge), if not for the underwhelming portrayal of Hogwarts. Why did they have to drag Hogwarts back into it? Why did they have to ruin the magic it held, the mystery it bore, just for a few, unnecessary shots? It didn't feel the same, it didn't feel special anymore, it had gotten ordinary. It was, to put it simply, ruined.I left the cinema with a feeling of dread, but not the one I had been hoping to get from the haunting performance or terrifyingly amazing plot. It was dread, because I knew, this was it. I did not care about the characters in the movie, I wasn't captured by any of the intended emotional moments. I don't think I could handle another punch in the stomach, not another let-down. I am entirely uncertain whether I'll even continue to watch the supposed next three movies, even though they are bound to cover (at least partially) my most favorite part: Lord Voldemort's rise to power. Maybe, just maybe, we ought to have let our imagination take the lead and speak for itself. Some things should remain in our heads and hearts without having to be plastered to a cinematic screen. I felt this way when watching 'The Hobbit' and I felt it today once more when watching 'The Crimes of Grindelwald'. This is not to say that the movie as a standalone film was awful - for it was not. But it doesn't deserve to be associated with anything that relates to Harry Potter.

830,swisstis,Fantastic logic errors and where to find them,5,15 November 2018,"Yes, it's an entertaining movie and I'm very surprised about the performance of Johnny Depp but the first ""Harry Potter""-Spin-Off was better. There are so many new characters like Nagini and it's nice to see so many ""easter eggs"".
BUT: You don't need Nagini, Leeta Lestrange, the assistant of Newt and every auror you see more than one minute. The biggest mistake of the movie is: Why is Credence from the Dumbledore-family? There are so many mighty wizard-families like the Riddles so why did J. K. Rowling wrote Dumbledore? The whole story of ""Fantastic Beasts and where to find them"" is irrelevant. Jacob forgot everything...no, Queenie is a nice woman...no, there are many fantastic beasts because it's called ""Fantastic Beasts""...no, and so on.

853,Nadine1301,"No plot, no meaningfulness, disappointing :(",3,17 November 2018,"First of all, I absolutely love the Harry Potter universe and liked the first Fantastic Beasts film. I love Newt, being such a unique and refreshing male lead and I was super excited about going to see the film. I was absolutely ready to be thrown back into this world and learn some new things about favourite characters. Saw it yesterday and left the cinema confused, disappointed and frustrated.
I will try not to repeat what a lot of other people have said. There is no real plot, it's difficult to follow and even more difficult to care about any of the many characters which are being introduced and where each of their sub plots lead. The whole thing feel completely unrealistic (i know, it's a film about wizards, but it worked in Harry Potter didn't it?) and like someone has pushed a beautiful, moving story through the Hollywood action machine that caters for people with a non existing attention span and throws in an explosion every few minutes to keep them awake.
More than being excited or shocked about a few reveals I felt like they are now meddling with the Harry Potter storyline just for the sake of it. The film had about 9 meaningful minutes, maybe less, and the rest was filled up with a bombardment of loud, messy and unnecessary action scenes that just didn't feel right. The subtlety that I love so much in the Harry Potter films, the feeling that this world could really exist and makes you feel all warm and home is completely extinct here.
I give 1 Star to Eddie Redmayne and his amazing portrayal of a truly unique, non-stereotypical male lead character. 1 Star to Johnny Depp whose portrayal of Grindelwald (whenever he did get a little bit of screen time) was brilliant and his ""speech"" towards the end of the film was one of the only moments that really held my attention. And 1 star shared between a nicely acted young Albus Dumbledore and the Niffler! Who doesn't love the Niffler?I wish the film had consisted of many more calmer, reflective moments. I could have listened to young Dumbledore for ages, I also would have enjoyed more tender moments of Grindelwald, showing his world and what really motivates him. If this had been 80% substantial character development and 20% action scenes it could have been a wonderful, moving film. Instead it's the other way round and felt like watching Godzilla who ended up in the Harry Potter world.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
854,filmophile90,It's very good and kind of goes darker than most,7,17 November 2018,"There's a lot of confusion going on about Crimes of Grindelwald and I can see why. It's almost non-confrontational in its approach. This is mostly the mindgames and politics before the actual war starts. A cold war of sorts. This is meant to make you think, focus and feel. It's not an action movie and uses a more subtle approach. One of the best things about this is that they really, Really knew who to cast for each role. For instance Jude Law as Dumbledore seems almost nothing short of Gannon's Dumbledore in looks and ways. The child/teenage actors made to act their adult counterparts actually looked like them. The fantastic beasts play their part, though are not exactly focused on, unlike in the very first Fantastic Beasts film. Johnny Depp was good as Grindelwald, and had and will have more to work with than Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, which is both great and sad. Great because they invented a complex villain here, and sad because Fiennes' just got the definition of psychopath to work with. The final twists towards the end are great, though the movie could've been more interesting. In what way exactly, I do not know. That's the trouble with it, I believe. It may be one of those films that become more appreciated after a couple of more views7/10 for now.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Overall I was delighted, the action was fanstatic, the story progressed at a good pace and the actors did an amazing job. The sound and visuals/special effects are as good as can be expected and the transitions between scenes are stunning!A minor critique is that some of the characters/objects have no impact on the overall story. As a fan of the HP and FB series myself I was thrilled with these inclusions as they offered a nice connection to the other films in the wizarding world. Another minor criticism is the story has essentially been simplified to the point where in this film we see the main antagonist starting to build his support that our protagonists Newt et al is trying to stop, while saving the odd fantastic beast along the way.Overall entertaining, with a huge revelation at the end which is worth the wait.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The characters are agonisingly boring and one-dimensional, the plot consists of multiple stories that could have been resolved in one conversation in one room, and the tone was wise-cracking one moment, and dead-baby-focused the next.I understand that this is JK's second script, but please stop having her at the helm, until she's had some experience.

There was a big emphasis on Dumbledore being in this one but he was also barely in it. There were 4 very disconnected stories happening and they didn't really tie together in the end. So many Easter eggs in this movie that you have to be knowledgeable about the HP world to get it and they are such a big part of the movie that if you aren't knowledgeable you may be missing even more in this movie.

You're never quite sure who all the people are, nor what they're doing, nor how it matters. Some of them look so alike that you lose track of who they are.I only realised after I'd left that the jailer who was 'swapped ' in the breakout sequence wasn't either Credence, or somehow related to Credence. The 'Luke, I'm your father'-like revelation about Credence's family was utterly underwhelming. The climax was anti climactic.The whole film has a DC Extended Universe 'dark' filter, so even scenes in full daylight are hard to make out.Everyone who had anything to do with this film wasted their talent and our time.

Even the cgi animals act him off the screen.. and they are ridiculously absent for the vast majority of this movie. He's about as emotive as a brain-dead sea anemone & can't decide on an accent - which he mumbles whenever he lands on one in the moment. 2. His Look/Costume...It's shocking - I can almost understand the logic that dictated his look being stark and blonde - almost, but he can't pull it off. There's nothing malevolent about him. I could go on about the bland but let's talk about everyone else. The two romance sub plots have huge holes in them and are barely given a nod within the movie. The search for a mother sub plot is also very thin, and I have to really question as to why 'Fantastic Beasts' was even included in the title, because the beasts rarely were included in the movie.I am an avid admirer of J k Rowlings work, and I am very happy to re-watch the first in this series many many times, but this one needed way more of her magic to justify my ever bothering with it again.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

867,Slobberman,A forgettable entry in the Wizarding World franchise,4,19 November 2018,"This movie is a mess right from the beginning. The first scene involves Grindelwalds escape, and I had no idea what the hell was happening during it. It was dark and raining, there were annoying flashes of thunder and above all the editing was headache inducing. There were so many quick cuts that it was near impossible to keep track of what was going on. Not the greatest of starts...By far the biggest flaw of this film is its script. The story is unnecessarily complicated. Its so complicated that we are required to watch minutes and minutes and minutes of boring exposition. And the weird part is that the exposition didn't even feel important to the overall story. There are twists in this movie that don't make any sense and are only there to shock the audience. The dialogue is atrocious at times. Characters are talking out loud when they're alone, just so the audience or other characters eavesdropping can hear them. And another weird thing is that apparently everybody in this franchise is related to one another. Seriously, there's so many 'they are actually family!'-twists. But wait, there's more!Newly introduced characters are unnecessary and forgettable (Nicolas Flamel shows up and does absolutely nothing. He's just there to be a reference to the original movies, especially with them showing the Philosopher's Stone for no reason. Same thing with Nagini). I already had some problems with the non-existent chemistry between Newt and Tina in the first film, and there's still zero chemistry between them in this movie. Other characters make weird choices just so that there's some conflict going on that we're supposed to care about. I did like the comedic relief in Jacob. He's genuinely funny at times. Jude Law did a convincing job as Dumbledore. Not a fan of Depp as Grindelwald though. He's just... Depp in disguise.There is a lot more to say about this movie, but that would require me to go into spoilers. Unfortunately I can not recommend this movie. Its just a complicated, uninteresting mess.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
868,sherwood188,"Enjoyable film, needs more energy",8,25 November 2018,"I enjoyed watching this film but it lacked the energy of the first film.

869,BatMatticamus,Inadequate Beasts: The Off-Screen Misdemeanors of Grindelwald,2,16 November 2018,"What's it about?Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is the second entry in the Fantastic Beasts Harry Potter spinoff franchise. Directed by David Yates, director of every movie in the Harry Potter universe since Order of the Phoenix, the story is set a year after the previous Fantastic Beasts movie and continues the story of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) as he attempts to track down the Obscurial Credence (Ezra Miller) before one of several other factions either finds or kills him (if that description doesn't make much sense, don't worry-it doesn't make sense in the movie either). Bringing back Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Ezra Miller, and Katherine Waterson from the previous entry, as well as Johnny Depp as Grindelwald, the cast is filled out (or bloated) by the addition of several new faces, including Zoe Kravitz as Leta Lestrange, Callum Turner as Theseus Lestrange, Claudia Kim as Nagini (for some reason), and Jude Law in his highly-anticipated turn as a young Albus Dumbledore, among many others.What works?Almost nothing. I was not expecting this to be a great movie, given the middling quality of the first Fantastic Beasts, but this was a disaster from start to finish. I'll try to be fair and give credit where credit's due, but there's very few positives to be found.Like the first Fantastic Beasts, there is some good acting in among the muddled story and underdeveloped characters. Eddie Redmayne is excellent, if completely wasted in his own movie, while Dan Fogler remains an on-screen delight, and even those two performances only rise to the level of notability because we had a nominal degree of emotional investment in their characters from the first movie. Johnny Depp is also surprisingly solid, toning down his usual antics and actually delivering one really compelling moment (probably the only one in the movie) in a speech/rally scene near the end.The visual effects are mostly solid, if taken on their own, one fiery climactic setpiece almost rising to the level of ""impressive,"" if one discounts the direction, the characters, and the narrative direction involved in creating it.James Newton Howard again wrote the score, and while it certainly doesn't live up to John Williams' legacy, or even that of Alexandre Desplat, who scored both Deathly Hallows parts, it's more than solid, offering several good moments and barely any poor ones.What doesn't work?Where to begin? At the beginning, perhaps. The opening scene is atrociously amateurish. Within half a dozen stationary shots, essentially setting the scene, the audience is already disoriented, and once the action setpiece actually explodes into being, it does so in such a badly-constructed, chaotic manner that I actually had to shut my eyes for a moment. It's possible to construct an action scene in such a way that it feels disorienting while actually being entirely coherent (the original Bourne trilogy offers several such examples). This movie does not achieve that.The disorientation and unclear filmmaking is a trend throughout. The action is consistently poor, usually leaving the viewer totally unclear on the moving parts, while even the slow scenes are filmed either in uninspired medium/wide shots or repetitive closeups, camouflaging where the actors are in relation to each other.There's also plenty of narrative disorientation to go around. Pretty much the entire first two-thirds of the movie is spent introducing new characters at an absurd rate, many of whom we are supposed to care about, but almost none of whom are even remotely developed. The consequence is that even when we are supposed to care about a character, and when that character does actually get a little development, there's too little time and energy for their particular story to carry any weight, so when it comes to a climax the audience is left unfeeling and kind of bemused.Structurally the movie feels sort of like an isolated second act-we are dropped in with a supposed sense of the stakes, the heroes and villains, and the ending is relatively second-act-ish-but functionally it feels like a first act, introducing characters and plot threads at an unsustainable rate.The glut of new characters also has the unfortunate but obvious side effect of crowding out valuable screentime and development for the established characters. Newt Scamander has all the characteristics of an interesting and fairly unique main character, but he's basically ignored the whole movie. There aren't even many beasts, fantastic or otherwise, and those that do appear are mostly unconvincing and unoriginal.Even the Crimes of Grindelwald part of the title is inaccurate. In the original Harry Potter story, Voldemort is built up as a villain from the very beginning. Because he killed Harry's parents and Harry is our clear main character, there's already some emotional stakes involved in seeing him defeated, basically from the beginning. By fleshing out Harry's backstory across the first four books/movies, and by building up the threat that a returned Voldemort truly would represent, we are given a clear sense of how terrifying he truly is. Then, once he returns, we immediately get a sense of his power, of the threat he represents. Grindelwald, by contrast, has no such strong backstory, no such narrative emotional weight associated with his defeat. We got to see him have an anticlimactic final battle at the end of the first Fantastic Beasts movie, we get to see him escape from prison at the start of the second, but we have no sense of how dangerous he really is, nor any particular reason to care about his supposed crimes. Even with his lone good scene, he's not a good villain.There's not even much here for the hardcore Potterheads. Dumbledore in his prime is good. There's a cameo by another fan favorite character which is immensely satisfying. But beyond that, there's nothing actually any good. There is an absurd amount of artificial fan service (did we really need a gratuitous shot of the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone?), almost none of it serving any narrative purpose beyond the superficial, ""Look, I recognize that thing! I'm part of the in-group this movie is shamelessly pandering to!"" There are even several explicit errors or contradictions to the existing mythos, several of them substantial. One of the final twists is patently absurd after even a moment's thought, while several other details are just wrong. One suspects that JK Rowling will be able to find a way to contrive the retcons into making sense, but that doesn't make them any less unsatisfying in-movie.Even the new aspects of the Wizarding World introduced in this movie feel like little one-off ideas Rowling didn't think merited inclusion in the original Harry Potter story. None of the new material is interesting, logical, necessary, or in any way good or exciting.But is it any good?No. There's maybe ten minutes total that range from mediocre to good. The rest is horrific. This is legitimately one of my least favorite movies I've ever seen (a slightly less hyperbolic statement than it seems-I usually only watch a movie if I think I'm going to like it, and I know my preferences well). It's disorganized, disorienting, lacks anything resembling a coherent plot or interesting character work, is an insult to its own mythology, and serves no purpose whatsoever as a self-contained movie. Don't watch this movie, and if you do, out of either morbid curiosity or misplaced loyalty to a fast-fading franchise, wait for it to come to DVD or streaming.What's next?Unfortunately, we're in for three more of these things (assuming this one doesn't tank and kill the franchise, which it almost certainly won't). David Yates is attached to direct all three, the next of which is slated to release on November 20th, 2020. The subsequent entries will continue in two-year intervals. On the bright side, there doesn't seem to be anything else coming down the pipeline from the Harry Potter universe, so there's only a finite amount of damage currently set to be done to the franchise's legacy.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

On the positive side the special effects are quite spectacular and I still love Eddie Redmayne's character Newt. On the negative side I did find it quite confusing, especially given that they attempted to explain what was going on part way through. However, the thing that has really put me off of going back to see the next film was the complete lack of a decent ending. It left me feeling really ripped off and surely it cant be that hard to give a film a decent ending even though it is part of an ongoing story - The Potter movies managed it !

At points, he's the least evil person on screen. The ministry hires a magical hitman to kill an Amish kid, Lita LeStrange swaps her brother out because he's crying and Queenie trafficks an enchanted muggle into Paris. Whilst Big G just wants to prevent WW2.Fantastic Beasts - nopeDumbledore - completely irrelevant, only there for the twist ending. Comes across as a coward and an idiot.Characters who may as well have been removed from the film: Jacob, Queenie, Big Gs henchmen, the guy with the feather, the old guy, Newts brother, Dumbledore...Tina disarms Grindelwald at the end of the first film, so should be in control of the elder wand... nope.Cba anymore (just like Rowling).If you removed every character and every subplot bar Grindelwald and Credence, we would have still reached the same point, therefore this movie is a terrible, money-grabbing waste of your time.

The movie elaborates so many details which even don't contribute to the main story.
However, when we reach to the points that main characters choose to stay with or against Gellert, all of this story telling for main characters seem to be useless, as we can't even understand the reason why some of them join the villain character.

877,sniggendeswiffer,Feels off and odd,3,2 April 2019,"I wasnt having to big expectations to this movie after the first.
The first movie felt like a fan made Harry potter film, which managed to get some of charm from the original univers, with a good but confusing story.This one performs even worse.
Now let it be said, that i personally is sick of Johnny depp. Lone ranger was the last drop that filled the cup.
But he actually performs nice in a serious role, compared to his, often ridiculous and gimmicky Tim Burton roles, so i was positively surpriced here.
Jude Law makes a decent Dumbledor as well.But the plot is a mess, switching between London and Paris, scenes and characters.
And the film introduces all kinds of characters, so i personally lost both track and interest anyways.It is beautifully made, and Magic in particular is back with style. Its nice to see adults who actually are masters of the different aspects of Magic, when compared to Harry and his friends constantly use of ""Expeliarmus"" or ""Accio"".Its a nice ""see it once and never visit again"" film.

886,bryan_williams-2,What crimes?,1,22 July 2019,"What a shame that a superbly scripted and filmed series like the Wizarding World franchise that what we have here is such a limp rag of a film that relies on CGI rather than a clever script. The characters aren't developed in any depth and relationships are over dramatised and over schmaltzy. The initially welcome and subtle Americanisation of the series seen in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is completing itself in this film in an unsavoury way with the hugging sequences and concentration on concepts like ""home"", ""family"" and themes like the importance of having ""family history"" (re the character Credence and his antecedents) and, whilst I'm on this tack, what on earth is the character ""Jacob"" doing in this series? He's just another character like Otis from Superman 2. In fact this episode in the Wizarding World franchise is more like a thrown out script from the fantastic Avengers series of films with the wizards and witches transformed into Superheroes.
There are silly, amateurish, touches as well such as all the vehicles and people in the street scenes moving at the same speed (with the exception of the protagonists) and the usually superbly atmospheric Hogwarts seems to be lacking a dimension and has hardly any students.
If this was a standalone movie it might just win a few more stars but as it is dragging a once great movie franchise out of the golden glow that it has achieved into the cheap and emotional gutters of the usual lacklustre Hollywood sequel it gets one star from me.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

889,jacobfeltner,"Not Perfect, But Certainly Deserving of a Better Score",8,27 November 2018,"I will start off by saying I don't think this film is worthy of 10 stars. Im only giving it 10 for this review because of all the people who are giving it super low scores for what I believe to be the wrong reasons. I've read a lot of complaints about the film being confusing, making no sense, and containing no plot when it's actually rather straightforward in its plot.This film mainly follows MCUSA, Newt and Grindelwald in their pursuit of Creedence in order to get him on their side of the division in the wizardinf world over current laws. During this Creedence also searches for his true lineage throughout the film. Dumbledore also has a very important sub plot in the mix of things as well.First, what I liked about this movie is that it's very interesting and compelling. It adds a lot to the wizarding world lore. Sure some of the decisions may not make sense right now based on what we thought we knew about certain things in the wizarding world already from Harry Potter, but let's not forget there's 3 more movies. Any issues like this can easily be resolved next film. I also liked the conflict Dumbledore faces in this movie and what it means in terms of stopping Grindelwald. This film is also very well directed by David Yates and looks fantastic from start to finish.The only real negative in this film is what kind of Harry Potter fan is watching it. I'm a huge fan and am well versed in the lore. Characters such as Nicholas Flamel popping up, and easter eggs like the sorcerers stone in the background are really cool things to see in my opinion. Things that are talked about such as the Lestrange family tree may also be more intriguing to hardcore Potter fans than to just your avid moviegoer. The pacing is also a little quick. Many things are set up in the first 2 acts of the movie, so they feel a little too brief and underbaked at times, but overall nothing too big for me.Ultimately I'd say this movie is a really good time, especially for big Harry Potter fans. It does have its minor flaws, but it's definitely got my attention, and I'll be there for the third movie to see what happens next!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
890,mattkeyes-18609,Lack of detail ruins what would have been a good movie,5,19 November 2018,"I have admittedly not read the books. That said, the title ""auror"" is quite important in the movie bit never explained. What does Dumbledore's relative (brother?) care about who he is? Why was he in the circus? And so on...I think for those who have read the book these were not questions. Even still, this is just another rehash of the Potter mythos. There is no too much substance here although I did quite like the Chinese dragon once it got through the clichéd ""here is my obligatory roar when I first get on the scene"". Hollywood really needs to cut that out, it's quite an eye-roller.Not a horrible movie but far from great. Just below average in my book.

892,herman_umans,Harry potter universe: one movie to many,4,23 February 2019,"I always enjoyed the movies from the Harry Potter universe, and yes, they also had their flaws. But should not be called ""fantastic beasts"", as the beasts are rushed in to make the movie a bit more funnier, but they are not the main topic of the movie. the topic is Grindelwald, and his rise to power. But the movie never finds it real purpose, is it a dark movie about a bad wizard or more a funny fantasy movie like the first Fantastic beast. It goes back and forth between all these things, without really finding its pace. A second flaw Is the use of back flash, which are at some times flash backs after flash backs, so you almost forget what triggered the real flash back. At the end of the movie, it is clear that they have left many things open, so they have many subplots to explore in the next Fantastic beasts, but I left the cinema with one thought ""do I really want to see the next movie?""",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

898,julienpinault,'Fantastic Beasts and the Crimes of Grindewald',6,18 December 2018,"'Crimes is Grindewald' is the sequel to the enjoyable 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,' and is the 10th film in the Harry Potter Franchise. Unfortunately, It is by far the worst. The screenplay is constructed in such a way that it feels like material from three different films mashed together. Irrelevant and unecessary characters are introduced to no end, seemingly to increase ticket sales rather than the strength of the story. The one major flaw in the previous installment was the weakness of Credence's character, whose presence became fatiguing, which makes the fact that he is central to the 'Crimes of Grindewald' so frustrating. He is given more screen time than 'Grindewald' himself, who is far more compelling. The film would have suffered much less if 'Grindewald,' whose motivations are clear and fascinating, was central and focused on rather than the bore that is Credence and the confusing Lestrange family. There is an incredible sequence involving Grindewald in which Depp is at the top of his game, and so is the story. However, like most scenes in this film, it descends into a CGI heavy, deafening explosion-fest. Speaking of deafening, every single scene of simple dialogue is distracted with loud score, which is well composed but overused. It is as if we need to be constantly reminded we are watching a Harry Potter film, which leads to several extremely forced scenes at Hogwarts. These scenes lack the magic of the previous instalments due to the CGI appearance of the castle and it's interior, and the bombardment of elements supposed to induce nostalgia, such as quidditch soaring overhead and pointless references to characters from previous films. Jude Lawe as Dumbledore should have been central to the story with Grindewald, not a forced side character. The performance is Jude Lawe being himself. There is nothing Dumbledore-Esque. Even the costume does not suggest Dumbledore. The editing, frame by frame, is often terrible and jarring right from the headache inducing opening. Extreme close ups are wasted in needless dialogue, meaning when they could be used to create tension, nothing is felt.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

-Johnny Depp is such a wrong casting for Grindelwald. Makes it for a boring villain
-Too much CGI and over the top effects. Why can't they see this just ruins the magic. A couple of scenes were particularly pathetic, like the black veil over Paris and the awful climax fire. This is a fault of Yates in my opinion and I hated the HP movies he directed. They try too hard to bring magic and -surprise- this ruins the magic
-Too many characters and not enough development of anyone.
-lazy screenwriting such as Grindelwald's speech and a nonsensical character death
On the other hand:
-Good acting and Newt is a charming character
-The plot is not very usual and has good surprises. Some people complain there are too many subplots but we never know exactly where they are leading us, makes it interesting.

The story is... dull, leading to nowhere, the chronology of events is put together badly, the interaction between characters is pointless and unless you're an expert in all the characters (and there are many characters) you will be at a loss of their purpose in the story. What's the point of Creedence's female sidekick for example?

I truly LOVED this movie. I think the complaints are mostly just people going in with too many expectations. Or just a strange need to express only bad things in a world already riddled with that.
I've been a long-time fan of the Harry Potter series and I am loving Fantastic Beasts as well. Perhaps I'm easy to please? Simple-minded? Too blown away by fantastic effects, beautiful scenery, and great actors? These new stories will not ALWAYS match up neatly with HP, there will be small holes. Yes, there were parts where the film moved quickly past something that should have been given more consideration, yes there were a lot of new introductions; lots of information. Why is that such a big deal? And speaking strictly to Potterheads, why can't we just be grateful that we get to continue to delve into this most amazing world?My advice? If you have an issue with the writing, and you are convinced you can do better, then you write your own best-selling series and then you'll surely show JK! Whatever happened to just taking something, (in this case, a film), and enjoying it for what it is? Just sitting in a theater, gazing up at that big screen, and ENJOYING a movie...just because. Why is that so hard? Why have we taken it upon ourselves to pass judgment on every. single. stupid. thing.Friends, there ARE bad movies out there. This is not one of them.
It was full of magic, new creatures; the laughter and the action that always comes with the Wizarding World. My heart just soared when we were shown the exterior view of Hogwarts, and John William's original composition played.

It's just become another money grabbing blockbuster and less of the world we knew in the original Harry Potter films. The makeup artists for goblins and creatures and practical effects along with true love and care into each film is what made it seem so real. CGI is great when used properly. However, over-saturating a movie with ""flashy"" CGI takes so much away from the true magic in the movie. It just feels fake. It's like they're trying to mask the poor story with a bunch of CGI nonsense. Try masking real living actors. Star Wars may still have their problems but at least they don't CGI every single one of their creatures. ESPECIALLY when their creatures weren't CGI to begin with (The Goblins in the original HP films). Makeup and animatronics go a long way and help make a movie magical. Nothing beats the real thing.

This film almost loses all of the warmth for the main characters, that the first film engendered. It's a Di- Sars- ta darling, and the writing and wooly plot are to blame. C'mon, you've got a great cast and and all of the special effects that money can buy, this film should be SO much better, but it's a yawn fest.Everything else, the costumes, the acting, the sets are all bang on, but it's an empty gesture without a solid script.I'm beginning to think that you can have too much of a good thing and that really the world doesn't need to hear anymore from this franchise.

923,yebo-rob,"A Muggle Who Doesn't Understand This ""Magic""...",5,17 December 2018,"This film makes absolutely no sense. I cannot believe that so much money was spent on a movie that completely destroys the true magic that was built up in the HP books (the films at least tried their best to do it justice). There are plot holes without end and throughout the movie, I kept wondering who is who and what is happening...and WHY!?Questioning something during a film can be good - but all the questions I had just distracted me from enjoying the story...that - again - did not make sense in the end. Certainly not in the greater context of what we know and learn from HP series. A lot of people have drawn attention to the timeline issue.But my problem is with the characters and what they bring across the screen. Grindelwald is not scary in the slightest. Even the first HP movie with the first appearance of Voldemort was more scary than this. And no, it's not about certain feelings. However, one would expect one of the worst magicians of all time to make us shake in our boots. (And yes, you can make something scary and still have it be kid-friendly...it's how you build it up).My beef is also with Johnny Depp (as a huge letdown). Colin Farrell was far more convincing in his dark demeanour.Having said all that, I agree with many of the other reviews addressing the lack of beasts and the ludicrous plot line. It is shoddy storytelling with many fantastic effects.

Maybe not to those who saw it first but i was lucky enough to get a little heads up about this movie from the people who saw it first. They were mostly disappointed because they were expecting a lot, which i did too.The movie starts with a spectacular bang but then follows it up with some slow paced dialogue scenes that break up the pace in a bad way. These kinda empty scenes keep coming throughout the movie and when we got to the ""aha"" part of the movie i was a bit disappointed. So as many have argued the plot is indeed not the greatest but i still really enjoyed the movie. When you focus on the acting and the effects (i saw this movie in imax 3D) you are bound to have a great time.See this movie as a filler but not only in a bad way. But surely go see it, i thought it was good enough to have spend my money on. Compare this movie with the new SW movies. Sure they don't come close to the original series and they might be mainly created for money making but is that so bad? I don't think so and it is not as bad as some try to make it. Sure there were some moments in the movie that didn't feel smooth and the main story is kinda vague or absent but if you have read this review you can keep this in mind and enjoy the movie for its best parts, being the effects and being back in to the wizzarding world we all love!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

929,hiramktaylor,Harry Potter Where Are You?,2,2 April 2019,"Now we know what happens when a successful author with too much money tries to write something just to become more relevant. Gone are the charm, gone is the subtlety, gone is any thing that makes us care about the characters. It is fascinating to me that after watching this movie, the only character I have any interest in is the non-witch.Instead of a story filled with innovative and interesting situations and characters, we get Godzilla style special effects, which are great to look at but don't mean much, and rewrites of characters like Dumbledore (whose role in the movie seems to be to make a gay rights statement instead of moving the plot forward) and Grindelwald who's extreme character makes him reminiscent of Beetlejuice not the person we read about in the Harry Potter Series.This will most likely be my last J.K. Rowling venture. I long for the days when she wrote as if she were still hungry to have people read her books instead of the obvious pandering and contempt she displays toward her fans, whom she assumes will buy whatever she puts her name to, regardless of how good it really is.While this has happened in the short term, I predict that viewers will begin to wake up and realize that this really was not a very good movie.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
930,gennaro-g,Something's wrong,6,19 November 2018,"The Crimes of Grindelwald takes place around the the late 1920s, which means that McGonagallhasn't been born yet.The Mirror of Erised and a Boggart. Both are used to show us the feelings about certain characters, but their original meaning and purpose are changed just for that.The first one is the Mirror of Erised, which should show the deepest desire of those who look at it. However, for Dumbledore it shows a memory (happy or unhappy, we cannot know yet), but it is used in the film to depict the moment Dumbledore and Grindelwald made their blood pact. If Dumbledore's deepest desire was to change that moment, he would have seen that: himself avoiding the blood pact, but not the exact memory of that moment. The Mirror of Erised doesn't show happy memories (Harry doesn't see himself as a baby with his parents, but a grown-up version with all this family, including grandparents). If the purpose was to show the moment of the blood pact through Albus' eyes, a Pensieve would have worked better.Something similar happens with the Boggart. The physical form that this creature takes should inspire terror in the person who is looking at it, not just remind them of a fear. Neville sees Snape, Harry sees a Dementor, Molly Weasley sees Ron's corpse. It has to give you physical fear. Newt seeing an office desk is just silly - a better form for the boggart would have been a letter offering a desk job for Newt, maybe, but not just a desktop. It doesn't make any sense (Newt hasn't a phobia for desks). Something similar happens for Leta. If her worst fear is being discovered for what she did to her brother, seeing something falling in the water won't make her scared. A smarter boggart would have been an Auror accusing her of killing her brother, or a Ministry employee with an arrest order - but just the corpse of her brother floating in deep water is useless as a fear.So at the end, we are left with the feeling that both devices, the Mirror of Erised and the boggarts, changed their concept to be used to explain certain aspects of these characters by betraying their original meaning from the Harry Potter books.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

933,jaytheguvna,Great movie,8,18 November 2018,"I went into the cinema expecting it to be mediocre. The reason being, critics had been quite harsh when reviewing it. I have since come to the conclusion that they didn't have a clue what they were talking about.If I remember correctly, the setting is 1927. We start of with the somewhat darker atmosphere, kind of akin to the later Harry Potter movies. It was subtle but definitely dark. The main characters were introduced early on, which worked really well. Our main characters were shown in there current situations with some slight twists of fate playing its part.The middle of the movie wasn't stagnant as some become. We were kept guessing as to where we were going next. New characters were brought in to thicken the plot and intrigue the audience. There were a few sad moments that brought home the real and imminent dangers out protagonist faced.Now to the end. There were a fair few revelations that I'm not going to spoil. I'll just say, they were huge and explosive. The movie really turned on it's head with the final 10 minutes disclosing information that you probably were never going to imagine happening. I really liked the twists.In conclusion, I really enjoyed the movie. It was full of thrills, spills and action. The special effects were awesome but didn't overshadow the actors or storyline. If you're a J K Rowling fan, you need to stop what you're doing right now and go see it right away. Joking aside, after seeing the first Fantastic Beasts film, I was entertained.

936,brent-alban-605-695999,Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of J.K. Rowling,5,18 November 2018,"Ok, first off, let me say I enjoyed all of the Harry Potter films AND the first Fantastic Beasts entry. Those movies were filled with likeable characters doing interesting things. The HP films were like a who's who of British cinema, from Ralph Fiennes and Gary Oldman to Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith...I could go on and on. All of those actors were given great material and allowed to shine.
The problem with the FB movies starts with the nebbishy role of Newt Scamander and the casting of Eddie Redmayne, one of the most overrated actors of his generation. All he does in each of his performances is identify some quirky gestures and voices and just runs with it (see also: Jupiter Ascending and The Theory of Everything). Aside from the cute and fascinating beasts he curates, he's really a nothing character played by a mediocre actor. Big words, I know, but prove me wrong.
Katherine Waterston can be good, but she's been given nothing to do in 2 movies now. Dan Fogler makes a decent sidekick, but this 2nd movie turns his subplot with Alison Sudol's Queenie into a boring romantic subplot from a television sitcom.
Jude Law steals the show as Albus Dumledore whenever he's onscreen, which isn't enough. Johnny Depp's Grindelwald seems like such a confused character, killing innocent characters for completely asinine reasons while sparing those who could potentially do him harm. Stupid. The rest of the actors are so forgettable, it's like they blew their budget on special effects rather than spending it on actors and script doctoring. Seriously, you could cut this movie down to 30 minutes and it wouldn't make a difference, which is a shame because it is beautifully shot. The landscapes are breathtaking at times. It all boils down to all style, no substance. Like The Two Towers, it's a long journey that goes nowhere and essentially sets up what is, hopefully, a better future film.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
937,hamiltonfan3,Not as good as the first one,5,8 April 2019,"What drew me to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was the magizology aspect and the magic community during the Roaring Twenties.

The setting is dampened drastically, and there are little to no scenes with the magical animals.

Coming to controversial nagini which received a lot of backlash. In India it's an age old folklore, nagini is a snake who can take female form and back.

945,peterman5021,"Not Harry Potter, but Harry isn't even born yet",7,21 November 2018,"Too many people are focusing on the fact that that this movie isn't Harry Potter. Well, since Harry won't be born for years to come, then it's probably for the best that it isn't. If Harry all of a sudden shows up due to fiddling with a time tuner, then I would have given up completely. This is a movie that according to the title should be about the ""fantastic beasts"" and the ""crimes of Gridelwald."" Personally, I was quite pleased with the fantastic beasts side of the things; from the kelpie to the zouwu. Especially the zouwu. However, the crimes of Grindelwald side, not so much. Most of the scenes involving Grindelwald didn't actually have him committing all that many crimes. Basically, it was just portraying him as a charismatic revolutionary leader. Sadly, Grindelwald falls short as a villain; Voldemort he's not. However, that is far from the most vexing point. There are plot holes and continuity errors everywhere. Such as Professor McGonagall being a fully grown adult and teacher in this film, which is supposed to take place before World War 2. Yet Professor McGonagall is said to have been born in 1935. She shouldn't even be born yet! Despite this, the movie isn't so bad as a connecting point. This movie fails as a stand-alone story, but that's not the purpose of this film. It's connecting the first film to the planned next three films. That's going to take quite a bit of setup. Which is the purpose of this sequel. The detracting points for me are that the comedic Jacob Kowalski ends up simply a pathetic tagalong; the charming Queenie is deceitful and too serious; and there isn't enough Eddy Redmayne dancing to attract wandering erumpents.P.S.-Nagini is a pointless addition and wasn't worth all the controversy over the character's inclusion and expanding upon her history.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Loved every minute of it.Many other reviews rate it low for lack of plot, and seemingly failing to take into account this is like another chapter of a story. You never tell the whole picture in one chapter, unless it's a short story, and therefore you need not worry about the overall plot. Focus on what you know from the first film, and move on to the next.J. K. Rowling is known for keeping plots hidden for good reason, and don't expect anything different. If you question why you don't have all the answers, and why you should wait for the end before passing judgment, look no farther than the entire plot behind Snape in the Potter saga. When you first read the books/watch the movies, it seems straight forward (ie. Snape hates Harry), but when you reach the final book/movie the rug is pulled out from under your feet, and you are left in awe.I only ask trust your own judgment, and see this film with an open mind.

The movie is not.,5,18 November 2018,"I don't usually write reviews, but this film left me so disappointed, frustrated, and confused, that I felt like I simply had to share my thoughts.The main problem with the film is that put aside everything that actually matters in a movie (plot, character development, et cetera), and instead tried very hard to set the precedent for what upcoming ""Fantastic Beasts"" movies will be. In other words (and as many people in reviews I've read have already mentioned), it tries to build a franchise but leaves good storytelling aside.One of the movie's major problems is the script, which is a complete mess; exposition is aplenty (seriously. There is A LOT of artificial exposition). Many things previously established by the Harry Potter movies and books are completely ignored, from small details to huge parts. Characters are underdeveloped, and mostly feel like disposable plot devices. Some pieces of dialogue are cringe-worthy. And mostly, the story's main twist is absurd, desperate, and negates an immense part of what we know about the Harry Potter universe. It's pretty unbelievable that this was written by J.K Rowling herself. And it's not like this is the best she can do, because the script of the first ""Fantastic Beasts"", while flawed, was enjoyable and made for a nice, fun film.The tone of the film was totally different from that of the first movie; the music was forgettable; the directing was inconsistent and lazy; the cinematography was terrible, using lots of very distracting close-ups, as well as shaky cam in action scenes (with choppy editing to go with it).One of the few things that is actually pretty good about this movie is the acting. There are too many characters in the movie, which doesn't give most actors enough time to shine in their roles, but they make for a nice ensemble. The two performers who stand out the most are Jude Law and Johny Depp, who make for an amazing Dumbledore and Grindelward, respectively. Also, some funny scenes actually made me smile, or even laugh. The visual tone of the film was very enjoyable, too.Overall, ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" is a pretty bad movie with very few redeeming qualities. I walked out of the theater sad, disappointed, and even a little angry. If you're a Harry Potter fan, you may find some elements in this film that you might enjoy. If you're not, you might want to spend your time on something better.

Easily the worst film in the ""Wizarding World"". The film is poorly structured, hard to follow, literally just a massive information dump. The scene I always use to criticise this movie is the scene which goes: Here's my backstory, and then here's my backstory which counteracts your backstory, and here's my backstory, WATCH OUT DRAGON! And its just so weirdly structured and boring and I still don't care about Tina. Jacob is a worse character than in the first one, their excuse for him coming back is stupid.

A better group for the rest of the cast simply could not be found. They are all just absolutely perfect at being who they are! I never had a single doubt that I was firmly in the middle of the wizarding world. I loved the effects, the story dashes past delightfully, but the real reason to see this movie is the cast.

965,llandwehr-95367,Spectacle shooting blanks,6,25 November 2018,"Yet again, a recognized quality franchise known for good story lines is in disarray. What went wrong? My guess is poor editing for continuity, but could also be problems with directing, script. While visually stunning, not in anyway interesting. Feels to me like in story meetings the creative team had a big hat full of characters, took turns drawing from said hat and throwing at story board to build story line, while very, very high.
And in another lesson in film biz reality from Mel Brooks Spaceballs, we have Grindelwald the video, Grindewald the hair gel, Grindewald the makeup remover, and Grindewald the AR app. Might be fun to see the post-vewing questionnaire the test audience received to see what our knucklehead overloads want to feed our cinematic senses.
On another note, are there any gifted across the pond thespians capable of portraying Grindewald's smoldering psychopath, 'cause Johnny Depp really needs a break and so do I. Perhaps, another way this franchise is teetering on the edge of sacrificing craft for the purity of pulp profit.

Many things were executed with great detail such as the acting of Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law and Ezra Miller as well as the visual effects which I am sure will withstand the test of time. However, I can understand the critics reasoning for not agreeing with the public in terms of the overall popularity, SO FAR. This is due to my main problem, which is the over jamming of information, creating multiple sub-plots which had little relation to the main plot. However, as a Harry Potter fan, I believe that this is a welcoming addition, and leaving other Potterheads with that little extra to think about, to devise a new theory or spark an argument between mates, hence my rating not being affected.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The unexplained knowledge that some characters seem to have about things they couldnt possibly know.
His crimes? Seriously what did this guy do wrong actually?
It was like watching an old Dragonball Z episode, 75% snoozefest with 10% what?? and 20% ""hey thats cool"".

Even Newt Scamander was kind of borning. Also I don't like new characters that are important to the Harry Potter's world but we have never heard of them in 7 books and 8 movies.

974,armanairlighting,"Simple, a let down, enjoyable.",6,4 January 2019,"Fantastic Beasts: The crimes of Grindlewald ReviewThe movie starts with Grindlewald escaping, both visionary and plans were good in there but the score didn't really fit, let's just say the score in this movie wasn't that good.
Fantastic Beasts intro was shown smartly, same with Warner Brothers and Wizarding World logo. To be fair, the first intro (showing Wizarding World logo and WB logo) had a good score.
Prologue rating: 8.5/10Now the main story begins, with Newt waiting on the ministry, the visionary here was cheap and lighting didn't really fit.
The story was just about Grindlewald's plans to get to credence, and how he collected followers such as Queenie; it also had a love-sub-plot.
The plot was really simple, and not smartly or badassly written at all, I expected better from J.K. Rowling; it felt empty, Dumbledore gave Newt a mission and Newt accepted it just because of how he was in love with Tina, in Paris it's just Newt and Jacob searching for Tina and then they find themselves in the mystery of Credence's backstory. Everything connected simply, and I expected the last scene of this part be more emotional and have more action.
It was said that they would show more of the past, but what they showed of Newt and Leta in Hogwarts wasn't that necessary at all.
Body rating: 5/10And now time for epilogue, now here was written smartly.
I loved to see Dumbledore and Newt's team meeting up, and I really hope Dumbledore and Newt team up in the sequel just like how I thought they are gonna team up in this movie which unfortunately they didn't.
Also Newt giving Dumbledore the swearing spell they made was a bit meaningful.
But that wasn't the smartly written part,
The 2nd part of the epilogue was about the bad guys, Grindlewald finally took over Credence, nobody believed that Grindlewald knows about his past, but he revealed that Credence is Aurelius Dumbledore and a Phoenix appeared to Credence because of the legends Dumbledores had, whenever they need a Phoenix, The Phoenix will appear.
Grindlewald gave Credence (Or Aurelius Dumbledore) a wand, and Credence tried it which showed how powerful he was and how he really could stand up against Dumbledore, since Grindlewald couldn't because of the swear they made that they would never fight each other.
even though epilogue could've been better, it was still good.
Prologue: 7.5/10Overall it was too simple and ruined a lot of potential; visionary, work with lighting, score, working with actors and creating an atmosphere wasn't that good either.So thus I give it a 6.3/10",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Newt and his friends are very inconsiquential and feel shoehored in along with a couple other side plots.

978,prikopappins,"Not perfect, Better than people give it credit for",8,22 November 2018,"First of all, I am a huge Harry Potter fan. Some people will roll their eyes and say ""Yeah, yeah, sure"", but believe me when I say that I really am. There is such depth in Rowling's work that it utterly enchants her readers and viewers. I never thought much of the movies, mainly because they felt more like action movies with magic than I would have liked. But the books were one of the most wonderful books I've ever read, and I'll return to them all my life.
That's out of the way. Now here's what I think of The Crimes of Grindelwald.
The critics are wrong.
Why?
Well, no one is seeing these Fantastic Beasts movies in the right light. Everyone is expecting another Harry Potter... but it's not. The first wasn't, and it's not going to be. The story of Harry Potter was the story of a boy's maturity, a story about a boy growing into a man. The goal of the entire story, the end of the character arc, was to get him to a place where he could stand against one of the most wicked men alive - to learn that love, the strongest magic of all, truly is more powerful than death.
Fantastic Beasts is not about kids. It's about adults. It would be a lie to say that adults can't learn these lessons, but Harry Potter is so centered around the magic of childhood. Of course, the prequels don't have that!
People want these movies to be something they're not: another Harry Potter. But Harry Potter was a coming-of-age story. This is not.
How should we view these movies? We need to look at them as setting the stage for Lord Voldemort's rise. Setting the stage for Harry to begin his journey. Expanding our knowledge of the characters (like Dumbledore). Understanding the magic (and the beasts) more. Seeing more of the Wizarding World. It's not ""destroying everything we love about Harry Potter"". It's building on it. It's preparing the world for the greatest wizarding story yet.
Now, I do want to give a bit more on the second movie itself than the whole Fantastic Beasts series. The movie's plot was a good one. It didn't feel too heavy laden and confusing - just the right amount of plot, I think. I loved the cinematography, the music, and the acting (Johnny Depp's Grindelwald!). But I will say that this was a bleaker, darker movie than what I would have liked. It lacked some of the magic that the first had. But...honestly...how do people criticize this yet give ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""The Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" such praise? Those were bleaker than any of the Harry Potter movies, and pretty much failed the books.
In conclusion, remember to view this movie with the fact in mind that it's building on the Wizarding World, preparing the world for Harry Potter - it isn't ""Harry Potter"". Watch how Rowling expands our view of the characters (and how nearly perfect she makes young Dumbledore and McGonagall, and others). And with that plot twist at the end, we now know the end cannot simply be a final battle between Dumbledore and Grindelwald - it's going to be so much more. Get ready, Wizards...Grindelwald's gruesome rampage of grotesque crimes is only beginning.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
979,nisawesome,Horrible but we've seen worse prequels,4,19 November 2018,The writers seemed to not care about the timelines of the Harry Potter universe at all. This movie also adds so much nonsense to hp that it feels more like fan fiction. I'd rather like to see more than 2 fantastic beasts or maybe center the movie on the actual crimes of grindalwald. In the end it's obvious that these movies are much worse than hp and this movie is just a cash grab to stretch out a series and keep theme parks relevant.,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
980,sbithell-65441,Very good but the plot needed work,7,17 November 2018,"The acting across the board was brilliant! Johnny depp plays Grindelwald fantastically and having Grindelwald as the main villain is a great choice as he is different to Voldemort, he doesn't go round mindlessly killing everyone, his greatest power is his persuasion. Eddie Redmayne reprised his role of newt scammander well as did many of the other actors and the introduction of Jude law as a younger dumbledore was a good choice however I thought he needed more screen time.
Although the film was very well executed I thought that certain parts in the film needed filling in. For example having Nagini and Nicolas Flamel in the film had no affect on the plot at all. As for the explanation of why Jacob Kowalski didn't get obliviated at the end of the last film was just plain stupid. I also feel that having credence somehow turn into dumbledores brother was a mistake as it is never mentioned in any of the books. I love JK Rowling and all of her writing but some of these creases needed to be ironed out completely for it to be as good as the other Potter movies.
Overall an amazing watch and after all we need to look at this as a film in a series and not just a standalone feature as many of the holes may be filled in during later films.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

I think it is a start for the third film that I hope is going to be the best, something like Deathly Hallow Part 1 (I thing all this movie is a necessary filler for the next one).I think the errors of this film were in the script and part of the story of J.K Rowling.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

987,dane-18946,"Judge for yourself! Many false claims, much false information in reviews... So glad I decided to see it for myself! Love this movie, LOVE the FB Franchise so far!",9,28 November 2018,"Just left the theater and almost at a loss for words but feel urgency to review this due to the general loud crowd of reviews out there that imo couldn't be more wrong! So here goes...
Fantastic Beasts improves upon the HP franchise! We want more beasts!
Truly fantastic! Characters are absolutely delicious! Scenes are stunning, story is magical, artfully laid out and I just can't get enough! Love the beasts!
Cinematic ecstasy!
Can hardly wait for more!
And did I mention fantastic fabulous beasts?!?!
Now this is the magical world the way it should be! Rowling's and Yates continue to astonish with new ideas, seemingly no end to the creativity!
Newt is my favorite character in all of the vast Wizarding universe... Love the Grindelwald villain in contrast to Voldemort... I find all the characters to be fresh and delicious!
I don't want to waste time addressing all the unfounded claims in negative reviews or misleading/false information currently circulating about this film except to say that it is simply rediculous to add in opinion as fact ( though I have no real preference in the matter, in truth the hype about Dumbledore and Grindelwald is contrary to the actual meaning of that scene, wonder if not just sensationalism for the sake of sensationalism! ) and also that it seems that so many get caught up in the herd mentality and jump on the bandwagon of negative reviews?
This is truly a masterpiece! No it isn't HP, nor should it be, IMO it's so much better!
What I will say is that it certainly would be a shame to miss out on this (3D for us) experience at the theater!
Missing the first FB movie at the theater (not willing to fight the crowds for just another Harry Potter after the last few in that franchise) is something I have thoroughly regretted and we have been eagerly awaiting this since the first Fantastic Beasts came out on Blu-ray...
Needless to say we were all full of expectations for this one and then read some of the reviews to decide whether or not to take my 10 year old son...they were so horrible, ugh, despairingly ordered some tickets (let my 14 year old daughter go to practice instead of bringing her along, NO!!! Finished at theaters in 2 days, yikes!) and went in to the theater hoping for best and expecting some disappointment... I was so delighted to be wrong!
This is truly a masterpiece! No it isn't HP, nor should it be, IMO it's so much better! I enjoy the HP books and films, I LOVE FANTASTIC BEASTS! It is just more, more relatable, more magical, more captivating, more ethereal... more... everything!
It was just the right length, acting is masterful, brilliantly written, great characters new and old, perfect pace... only thing that could be better? More beasts!
This film was a bit light on the beasts and the roles they played. I certainly hope this is not a trend that will continue... the beasts are truly their own characters in this story. I find myself already missing Dougal and the erumpet.
New beasts in this film played less of a character role than the beasts in the first film. Since this is a largely defining feature of Fantastic Beasts I would hope that there is more beast-character interaction in store in future films?!
I was also a little disappointed by the new look of the habitats inside of Newt's case but that is genuinely a personal preference and I can see how the habitats would need to change often with the new inhabitants, just seemed to lose the lush magical feel and bbecame more like cages or pens than individually tailored environments crafted with care for each of these beloved creatures!
I would definitely recommend seeing this and judging for yourself!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
988,jasonpachar-74665,A Continuation...,10,21 November 2018,"2 years ago, or should I say in 1924, we met a young wizard by the name of Newt Scamander. Like I said in the previous review, these reviews are going to be linked together for one final purpose, which will be revealed in due time. But for now, let's move on.
In the last review, we also met someone that posed a huge threat to both the wizarding community and the muggle community, Gellert Grindelwald. Gellert, or should I say, the greatest actor of our generation (Johnny Depp), yes folks, you heard me right. But this review is not for the faint of heart nor is it for the weak-hearted either.
A lot of ""Potter-Eggs"" are hidden and in plain sight in this movie, so I am not going to sit here and spoil it, so I am just going to plainly say, that you are going to need a lot of ""jaw pick-ups"" because this movie and the next 3, yes again folks, you heard it here, there will be 5 and all of these prequels will lead up to the main Harry Potter series.
So, I give props to where props are due @JKRowling and @DavidYates are the best in the business. So, I will see you on November 20, 2020, so until then.....TO BE CONTINUED!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
989,jloughreyy,"A thoroughly enjoyable film, however ...",6,17 November 2018,"I am a very very big fan of JK's Wizarding World, I have loved all of the films ever since each of their releases and have read and loved all of the books. I also really enjoyed ""Fantsastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"". This film, however, felt different to all of the rest. It lacked one very vital aspect. Plot.I must open with the fact that I can not stress to you enough how cinematically good this film is. Yates' directing is once again stunning, the visual effects and CGI were very high class, the acting is wonderful and the new roles' casting has been done excellently (especially Jude Law) and not to mention, the score for this film is absolutely incredible.My favourite part of the entire film has got to be the shot where, slowly rising over the Scottish Highlands, Hogwarts is revealed to us again for the first time in 7 years. This, along with John Williams' original famous tune truly gave me chills. Nostalgia like I have never felt before.My only issue with this film is there just is not really a plot. Critics are accusing the film of being ""confusing"", and I can see where they are coming from but that's not the word I would use. It is definitely ""busy"" and it is filled to the brim with sub-plots and backstories but I believe it easy to follow if you are a fan, such as myself. The only issue with the ""busy-ness"" is there was just no real story developing throughout. There was no clear beginning, middle or end... just things happening all the way through the film. I view this film as more of a ""filler"". It is the second instalment out of five and there needs to be backstories for the 5 films, so I kind of just feel like they've all been thrown into one film. Nothing much important really happened in the present day if you think about it. Grindelwald's escape sequence was great but after that, nothing major was really achieved by either side, Team Grindelwald or Team Newt/Ministry/Dumbledore.As a whole, I still really did enjoy this film, I thought it was very good. As well as all the things I previously said above, I have got to mention that I enjoyed the Credence/Dumbledore plot twist and the references to the original series and I think it just sets up the future of the prequel franchise well... I just hope we don't have to wait another two years for it!!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The finale battle is not satisfying in the slightest and the ending will leave you clueless of what happened, it's clear these films are being dragged out to make more of them which is sad really when the original Harry Potter films did the opposite and could of been longer with more content from the books but instead made shorter.Wait for this on DVD, a causal movie goer or Harry Potter fan is going to be disappointed here.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

If you are a Potter fan then you are bound to enjoy this film, otherwise if not, you may leave confused
The film also introduces many characters but not to the extent that they are very memorable.
The movie is still worth the ticket price just because of visuals alone! I recommend getting background a little on the Wizarding World if you haven't already.

995,jayanta-96423,Overall good..story could have been more concrete,8,16 November 2018,"Well i managed to see it in my overburdened schedule. Firstly dont listen to the critics much. Go nd watch it. If u are a potterbuff u r in for a great adventure. Johnny literally standsout throughout the whole movie. The CGI are great. I wish the movie could have emphasized more on the title which says ""crimes of grindelwald"". The movie is more of a bridging one..like setting up a platform for the next movies..like infinity war(though its not as good as that) or deathly hallows part 1. Overall watchable if u r not into potter movies. But great if u are a potterbuff. My rating is mainly for the visuals..the acting. For the story i would give a 6.8/10. Loads of main characters but then again as in the potter movies also there were many characters nd all of them had a purpose..here some had a major purpose..some had little..may be the next sequels will explain them. Eagerly waiting for the sequel nd the famous duel between grindelwald nd dumbledore which i believe will be shown in the later movies.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

997,parmarvandana-08013,Lack of proper Plot,3,17 November 2018,Well there is no comparison between Harry Potter series and Fantastic Beast. And when it comes to movie Fantastic Beast The Crimes of Grindelwald I found there was lack of plot and storyline. It should be more thriller in action and power in dialogues. Johnny Depp's acting is wonderful but it should be more negative in evil manner. And his role is little less than other negative characters.,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Characters were added, and given no background or information. I'm angry that they introduced Nicholas Flamel for literally no reason at all, he didn't add anything to the film besides the maker's ability to say hey this has Nicholas Flamel in it. Who was he even talking to? Leta LeStrange's background was horrid and confusing. The actual fantastic beasts were in the film for maybe 10 minutes and added nothing to the plot.

1018,fineartstar,beautiful visuals and heartfelt interpersonal personal interactions,8,15 July 2019,"I had to write in defense of this film, after reading so many outraged and dismissive negative reviews.
Particularly:
1) It ""wasn't like Harry Potter."" Well, yes. It's set in Harry Potters' universe, and some of the characters cross over, but THE FILM IS NOT ABOUT HARRY POTTER, so, it should not be like the Harry Potter movies!
2) ""It had no plot, or character development."" Hmmm - we were watching the awkward ""learning-to-trust-each- other"" moments between Newt and Tina, Jacob and Queenie continuing to work out their love, and the introduction and explanation of another enigmatic LeStrange family member (just to name a few) that were happening within: a believable continuation of where the timeline of these characters left off, solidly grounded in back stories, while doing suitable actions within their universe. So, um, how is that not character development and plot continuation?
3) ""Lots of ""tell instead of show"" moments. Hmmm. What would audiences prefer: 5 movies watching the things that brought us up to the ""present moment"" in these stories, or 1 that manages to skillfully jam in a lot of complexity and plausible ""while-we-weren't watching-this-is-what-happened"" info in, that makes their stories, the world, and what we DO see richer, interesting, and more developed? This was very much like a typical 2nd book in the world of reading. And as
it is hard to get that amount of info expressed interestingly in the format of film, I felt it was very nicely done. (If you want simplicity and a formula, watch a Marvel Movie!)I personally could watch a million movies of Newt and his adventures, if they continue to contain the brilliant acting, creative costuming, and excitingly fresh visual concepts they keep exploring (ooooh, I so loved the Zouwu!) But an in-between story is never going to pack the same emotional punch as major story elements hitting and unfolding (hence my less than 10 star rating), so why trash the whole film, and all the good crafting that went into it, simply because of qualities that are inherent to longer storytelling?I say to all the cast and crew and producers (etc): keep it up you guys!!! Some of us get it and are right along with you for the ride!!!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

They wanted scratch the surface of just how bad Grindelwald could be.This movie did all of that. In Deathly Hallows 2, Aberforth comments that Albus sacrificed everything for power. Albus' comments to Leta about his love for Ariana pulled at our heartstrings. We long to hear more on that relationship, and I'm sure there will be more to come.Albus' comments regarding Newt's disdain for power, and his desire to run towards what is right, regardless of the consequences...Then we see poor Credence. After all he's been through with the Barebones, he finally has a chance at love, and to learn of his family background; only to be sucked in by Grindelwald.And speaking of Grindelwald, all along he has been a puppet master. While Voldemort led by exploiting the fears of his followers, Grindelwald manipulated the emotions of those who had experienced pain, loss, and love; so much that he was able to draw Queenie in.I can't wait to see how all of this resolves, but I'm thrilled to know I have three more movies to look forward to.P.S. - How amazing was it to see Hogwarts again???",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

I actually like the FB series better than HP. As someone who loves a well written back story, I thoroughly enjoy every character. Autistic and socially awkward Newt, in love with his brothers fiancé, his assistant that orgasms at a splash of the water, the self-loathing and emotionally manipulative Queenie, Jacob the typical NYC money-hungry fool, Tina the unattractive headstrong career-driven woman. It's honestly laughable that Johnny was fired amongst this ""family friendly"" disney plot line.Johnny Depp as Grindelwald is the Jonestown of 2018 - you just LIKE HIM. Rowling sewed so many seeds, and bless that woman's imagination.

Too long, 50 pages of the script could have been cut, this has no plot. They are all wrong!This is a movie that stands on its own. It is different from the Harry Potter series (which is the universe it which lives) but set much earlier. New York in the 1940's to be precise where a secret agent has gone to hunt down a magical terrorist hell bent on changing the status quo.The interesting thing about this movie is that the baddies are the goodies and the goodies are of various degrees of acceptability in polite society. The climax of the movie ends with the various parties deciding their fate either backing the forces of evil (or progress depending on your standpoint) or towing the corporate line and putting their heads back into the sand.A super weapon in the upcoming war is the prize that this movie decides the fate of.The special effects are beyond reproach, the characters are well rounded and the script is well timed, amusing and leaves you wanting more.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1036,davidhchick,From a non-HP fan,1,28 November 2018,"Disclaimer: I never read any of Rowling's works, nor did I watch any of the HP movies. But I did see the last FB movie and have a passing knowledge of the world by dint of it being a cultural meme of today. With that in mind, here are my thoughts on this FB sequel.Newt Scamander is a pretty lousy protagonist. He's meek, socially handicapped, and very wishy-washy in his allegiances for most of the film, and only develops as a character in the last 10-15 minutes. He seems to care about his computer-generated animals more than his friends and family, and generally just moves from place to place without much direction or explanation. Why does he have to take a bucket to teleport to Europe when he can simply use his wand? Why does he spew gold dust around a busy Parisian street and no one walking around tries to confront him? Why does it take until the climax of the film for him to realize Grindelwald is a bad guy and choose a side? It boggles the mind, given how much he features in the film, for there to be so little to grab onto and identify with.Then you have Grindelwald. He goes from menacing to boring pretty quickly. He gets his underlings to do his dirty work, while he... does what exactly? I swear, were it not for his David Bowie-like eyes and stone-faced expression, you would think he was yet another character tacked on to waste the audience's time, like Leta or Queenie and the American fatso.Speaking of characters, there are way too many in this movie. Nest, Newt's brother, the emo kid with hidden powers (who cares?), Leta, Queenie, fatso, middle-aged Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Grindelwald's sidekick, snake girl, Tina, random Parisian guy with an eye parasite, the magic MI6 squad, MI6 hitman who's after emo kid... give me a break, movie. None of these people are interesting or very relatable.And oh man, the CGI. Prepare to get your year's fill of CGI animals, backdrops, teleporting, wands, water; it's too much and it's in every single scene. It's like Sky Captain or Star Wars prequels. It gets to be so boring and run-of-the-mill that you fall asleep, which I did. Neither the comedy nor the action is enough to keep me awake.I came out of this movie utterly floored by how awful it was. I was so anxious for it to be over that when Grindelwald said ""I hate Paris"" at the end of his final scene, I heard a woman laugh in the theater, and I couldn't help joining her. I wanted so badly for there to be something to latch onto and enjoy, but there was nothing.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1037,luckyhollymae,Go nowhere on this sad-GGI ride!,5,28 March 2019,"I agree with most other reviewers- The Crimes of Grindelwald was disappointing and not what I hoped for or expected to follow the first film. At first I rated it six stars, but really felt that was generous and gave it five. Because this movie was all of us waiting for something to happen, a rescue, an answer to our plot questions, a single happy moment... that never happens.

1043,henry-wilkinson,"Multi layered, sumptuous and rich story telling",9,31 December 2018,"I'm rather puzzled by some of the reviews here. I must admit, I was sceptical. Fantastic Beasts 1 was a let down and seemed more like a Phantom Menace style reboot (lack of vision and plot, offset by heavy CGI and cutesy but shallow characters and hackneyed villains). But The Crimes of Grindewald redeems the franchise. There is strong story telling here, and characters that have real depth emerging. It tackles some challenging life themes and decsions (that helped make the Harry Potter stories remarkablly appealing across all ages). And it's fully immersive into the wizarding universe. Reviewer grumbling of a lack of plot should perhaps view again; there are many interweaving threads it can be hard to keep up but they are compelling and drive the tale forward. The sets and costumes are fabulous. And to complain about too much CGI in what is basically a Harry Potter film is a bit like going to a fish'n'chips restaurant and complaining it's smells a bit vinegary. Let's not be churlish about it, this is great entertainment and escapism. I suspect in years to come this will be viewed more positively when insanely high expections are no longer relevant.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1044,archis004,Fan cash grab,4,30 November 2018,"The whole point of this film is to bring nostalgia to harry potter fans. The movie contantly tries to relate to the original books by throwing characters and names in the most awkward and unnecessary way. Some of the characters have no motives and some have no reason to be in the film whatsoever! Apart from the beasts there is no character development, not to mention the mind boggling inconsistencies within the movie itself. A wizarding world where people wear vests and suits instead of robes, use their wands like guns, barely cast any spells and where magic is only used for killing and repairing is not a wizarding world I want to see.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Nameless characters dying and evaporating in seconds, main characters never felt like being in danger at all. The actors did great. The screen writers did awful.

1047,tkoutsoukou,Overall pleased,6,19 November 2018,"I am sort of in the middle with this movie. I love the fact that we start getting the backstory of wizarding families and therefore learn more about the characters. Also the special effects were phenomenal and the performances by Johnny Depp and Jude Law were truly outstanding. Johnny Depp portrays a powerful and charismatic leader and you can immediately see why he has so many followers to his cause. Jude Law was outstanding and seems to have done his homework - the way he moved and talked really reflected the performance of Michael Gambon in the Harry Potter series, making it easy to connect the two and believe that he is that man at a younger age. However I must say that this movie felt like a Filler. I did not feel satisfied that he movie is over at the end - it felt like I had just watched a movie that ended right in the middle of the plot. The movie left so many questions and I do not feel that any of the stories of the characters ended properly. Leta Lestrage's character felt completely irrelevant to the story and did not really offer anything other than sacrificing herself in the end, which again, could have been one of the Aurors and the rest of the plot would remain the same. I just do not see any value in her character unless her story somehow affects the next movies. If that is the case, I feel we should have been given some indication about it in this movie just to make her a bit more relevant to the overall story. Also Nagini, the character I was most excited to see, did not offer any real value to the story and left too many questions about her origins unanswered. Finally I feel that we were introduced to so many new characters and stories that the movie had a hard time keeping all of them relevant and interesting. My main worry is that this movie opened up so many storylines that the next movies will have a hard time keeping up with them and that their stories will be rushed. Overall the movie was executed wonderfully but the plot was on the weaker side.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1051,dorna_joooooon,Big Disappointment,3,25 November 2018,Are they making children movies now ? It was Awful. I'm a Harry Potter fan but this movie was even worse than other Harry Potter movies(where the actor did not know how to play). Nothing made sense in it. The story line was really bad and I think Rowling tried to include her political view into the movie which made the story even worse.

Visually stunning, great casting, and overall a good film... But ultimately, its plot is entirely dependant on the movies that surround it. Still, if you're a fan of the original Fantastic Beasts, or enjoy the lore of the Wizarding World, then this is right up your alley. My biggest complaint is just a casting change, giving Grindelwald to Mads Mikkelsen or Daniel Brühl, but Johnny Depp's performance was surprisingly decent.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1053,skburns-559-668777,Confusing Plot & Overuse of CGI,3,29 November 2018,"I was very disappointed with this film. CGI action on the big screen was much to fast and complicated with multiple images, making me wonder where to look on the big screen.
The plot was even more confusing, at one stage I was completely lost as to what the characters were talking about, even though I have read all the Harry Potter books, and seen the movies.
I am reluctant to spend money on a future movie instalment.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1054,Jordan-ward2211,Pitiful,2,24 November 2018,"I am a massive potter fan, I grew up with the books, loved the original films and liked the previous instalment, this film however was the worst. The plot is beyond weak, it feels as though it is a collection of different things put together attempting to be a cohesive story and failing. The film is undoubtedly well filmed, the scenery is stunning and there are some sublime effects, the lastrange boggart in peticular was amazing. However there is simply no followable over arching plot, there are multiple story threads running in parallel and they are confusingly pointless, it is very much, let's go here, now here, why? No one knows. Nothing is explained and what little subtlety they try to have is as subtle as a led brick. There is one redeeming facter in this film, and that is Johnny dep.Dep is the best part of this movie, the scene in the necropolis is the best part of the movie, dep is hipnotic and felt threatening, cunning and even had me sat there empathising with him. The use of the real world history to ground his arguments was excellent. The fight scene was genuinely excellent and the decisions characters made felt real and had genuin weight.The worst part of this movie however was the blatant shoe horned plot points, and disrespect of the source material. The inclusion of Dumbledore, flamel and that last plot point which I will get to in a moment felt out of place and wrong, for example Dumbledore was a transfiguration teacher, not a DADA teacher, mcgonigle was not even born in 1927 and when she used the spell to remove that girls mouth, she would never have done that, ""we never use transfiguration as a punishment"" to quote the true source material. I appreciate that the writers are trying to add in charecters we know and love or that perhaps have always wanted to see however not at the expense of the story's integrity surely. Another example was the mirror of Errised. That was brought in to the school only to protect the philosophers stone, it was not there in 1927. And nermongard was a prison, not a bloody castle, it even says in the books specificly that grindlewald built it to house his enemy's, not to be his personal lair of evil.
The biggest one though, the one that made me lose all hope for the movie was the final big twist at the end.
Spoilers ahead....There is no bloody third dumbledore brother. No no no no no!!!!

Sorry Jo, you're not Gillian Flynn...I really wanted to like this movie. I really do. But what I eventually got is such a mess from a creative mind who tried to tell so much in one movie. I was vastly disappointed. And this is coming from a huge Potter fan...I would not even call this a movie. It was a concatenation of random events that are somehow linked to each other. Every scene was too short, when things got exciting they cut away to the next one. This movie was stuffed with so much plot lines and characters that I had trouble following the story. I can't even explain what the plot is, except for the fact that everybody is after Credence for their own reasons. The plot revolves around him. And he doesn't do much besided looking for his mommy.I heard from most people that the opening was the best part and that it went downhill from there on out. I have to disagree, for me it was from the opening scene where everything went downhill. Sure, there's a lot of action and magic going down. But it was difficult to see what was going on. It was a mix of fast pacing, dark imagery and an abundance of CGI.After that opening scene, JK Rowling lost me completely. What immediately follows is a scene where people are explaining what was about to happen in the movie. But honestly, it's a giant, boring mess.Everybody had a stupid reason for being there. And some of the characters are just walking around, doing random stuff. Also, there's not one, but three different attempts for setting up a romance. Those are plot lines that I do not care about. I also believe the movie has some 'mistakes' regarding the Potter movies. Some inaccuracies.Eventually we got to the third act. An act in which we are given a huge amount of information about a certain character. The backstory is revealed. But they went to far with that. It's not that I couldn't follow. It's just incredibly cliche and stupid. There's also a big twist at the end. I rolled my eyes and let out a big sigh and wished we go the credits instead.Someone must have thought that this was a bad idea. The biggest crime here is the script. Yates made a beautifully looking mess. The script should have gone through some four or five rewrites. Or someone should have said NO to Rowling and her stupid ideas for this story. The first one had a cohesive story line. This one didn't. It's all over the place.But on the side note. The performances are all great. Depp sold it as Grindelwald and Redmayne was once again amazing as Scamander. Even Jude Law, who had limited screen time, was great. Ow, and the younger version of Newt was perfectly cast.I hope they fix things in the next one. Because this was just bad. Rowling is responsible for the first Potter movie I did not like. Let someone else write the script, please. Or Rowling should see that scripts aren't novels...",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1073,rafeynoor101,Pleasantly surprised,8,18 November 2018,I wasn't that interested in the movie since I felt (and I am alone in this I'm told) that the first Fantastic Beasts was disappointing. However I was bored so before watching this I read some reviews and they were all so bad.And then I watched the movie anyway and I thought it was good. I just think the way it dove into the lore of the universe was great and add to that the whole Grindelwald/Dumbledore relationship and I was engrossed. It did get me confused sometimes with how all the plot lines were tied up. I had to rewind and check things a couple of times to make sure I was getting it right. However that was the bad part of it and it certainly didn't earn such negative reviews. But it is understandable that non Harry Potter fans would be left bemused by all the information thrown at them because it throws in all these families and connections that they weren't familiar with unlike Harry Potter fans such as myself.Ii would not recommend this movie to anyone who is not invested in the HP universe.,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Is this movie too long?Well, that was my feeling towards half of the movie. Even though I enjoyed a couple of CGI scenes, I soon found a lack of action scenes and character development, driven by the intention of telling a twisted, too long story of new characters, which leads us to a frustraing but desired ending.Is not the direction, the photography nor the scenery, but the J.K Rowling script. Therefore, this movie tries to compensate the lack of novelty with too much of an unresolved, empty plot, failing in it's main intention: entertaining Harry Potter fans while revealing some of the desired background information.I stopped watching Harry Potter movies at the cinema when they started to divide movies in parts, just to make more budget.

Instead, we get a two hour and fifteen minute movie on two different groups of people trying to reach one character before the other group does, which is the most boring thing I've ever witnessed. This movie had a big task of explaining a lot of things of little-known characters and it did so very poorly. My brother and I both had no idea what was going on at multiple points in the movie and we payed attention the whole time. The finale is very underwhelming. This whole film could be condensed to one half of a film because it feels like nothing happened after you've watched it and you just want to see something else.

It was only after the movie that i was informed that the Fantastic Beasts ""franchise"" is going to be a 5 movie one . After I learned that , this movie's purpose became so clear to me .
I just watched a 2-hour movie in which the main characters had NOTHING to do with the plot AT ALL . This movie was all about Grindelwald finding Credence and convincing him to join his army so Credence would kill Dumbledore in the future .
Newt , Tina , Jacob and Quennie did nothing in this movie but couple-fighting and catching maybe 1 or 2 magical creatures.
We got to follow a story about Newt's childhood love , which led to absolutely nothing . The main characters just made it to the right place at the right time to spectate the end of the movie in which Grindelwald finds Credence , convinces him to join his army and boom , that is the movie . The only thing that Newt did is stealing the ""blood-bond"" between Grindelwald and Dumbledore by using the Niffler.
All in all , it was a really poor movie , the plot was shallow and it was totally a filler . It just gave us a little bit of magic but that's it . I give it a 4 only because i am a huge Harry Potter fan . This movie made me really unhappy by seeing my favorite magical world being milked for money .

1099,xenia-davidoff,Harry Potter charm lost due to too much CGI and missing depth,4,18 November 2018,"I'm a huge Harry Potter and also found the first Fantastic Beasts movie very entertaining.That's why I was really looking forward to the movie ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"". Unfortunately, I was more than disappointed and even angry.
No magic but CGI: Due to the many ""too much wanted"" special effects, all the charm of the Harry Potter world has been lost. Harry Potter always gave the feeling that the parallel world could actually exist. The wizards were able to perform magic, but they were not all-powerful. The magic and its possibilities and limitations were in the foreground and not the special effects, as with this film, which has become an exchangeable fantasy film for me. The world of Fantastic Beasts looks much more modern and has many more possibilities than Harry Potter's, which is paradoxical. Of course this also has to do with the advanced movie technology, but does it have to be maxed out? Would not it make more sense to focus more on the characters and psychology than on CGI in the end?
Story without depth: I had my other problem with the story. While at first I found it very charming that Harry Potter characters are present in the movie, I was ultimately disappointed with the depth. Too many characters are introduced but without profundity. Unfortunately, also the sympathetic characters from the first film seemed ""dulled"" due to the lack of profundity. I find the acting skills of the cast members Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law (perfect cast for the young Dumbledore), Zoë Kravitz and the others very good, which is why I still give the film 4 stars. Unfortunately, they could not fully demonstrate their skills in the movie because of the above points.
This is of course only my opinion and therefore to be considered subjective. I just hope that the filmmakers not only hope for the ""big money"" in the next films, but actually produce a worthy film with depth.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

It just doesn't give the next level of the story, not in a way that would actually count.It has many new characters but most of them aren't really important or worthwhile. Some of them are quite worthless to the story (as much as we know for now).This movie is named Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald but the thing is that talkes about neither, really. There are not many beasts that are noticeable and important to the plot. Two of the ones who appear in the previous film come back but it's hard to say they actually matter or change any thing, and when they do, it's unclear how they did what they or how they knew what to do.
The parts of ""Crimes"" and ""Grindelwald"" in the name I don't really get. Yes, Grindelwald gets a much bigger part and we do understand a few things about him and the things he do, but other than that? No actual crimes, committed by himself anyway. Almost no killing, almost no power showing, almost nothing one would expect from a big bad scary murdreus",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1101,dcerisano-27495,This movie is suffering from affluenza.,4,27 December 2018,"I have tried several times to watch this movie from front to back, but could only handle it in half hour sessions.It is simply too busy. Too many leading actors, too much CG, too many plot devices, too many scenes.The scenes are short and rapid fire. Your senses are attacked from very angle. The director is obviously of the opinion that audiences have ADD and cannot focus on a single scene for more than a few seconds.It was obviously very expensive to make this movie. It drips with glistening commercialism. Almost as though it was produced by an ad company rather than a film studio. There is an underlying cynicism to its format: just cram as much pretty acting and special effects as possible in there, and the audience will buy it.I honestly could not follow the plot, nor do I think it had one. The stroboscopic scene changes and over-saturated audio tracks seem to be deliberately designed to distract from the lack of story.We seem to have entered an algorithmic age of film making. Directors have become financial analysts looking to maximise profits by aggregating previously successful movie elements into denser and denser content.This movie seems to prove there is a limit, and that more has finally become less. Every franchise has an end, and I hope this is it.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Are you aware that there are still sequels coming up? The amount of reveals is enough to keep me begging for more.The special effects were amazing and so was the cast selection. Young Scamander couldn't be casted any better.Loved the Nagini reveal, but would loved it even more if the trailers didn't spoil 70% of the story.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1103,roestcorne,Fantastic Beasts and Fantastic Animations,7,13 December 2018,"I have been a Harry Potter fan since I was young. I have watched all these movies countless times and I loved it. So when they finally released Fantastic Beasts 1, I picked it up and it was okay. I liked it, because it has the same environment as the HP movies and Newt is just awesome. The second movie came out and the title really spoke to me. So ofcourse I went to this movie aswell.I enjoyed this movie. I went see it in 3D in a cinema. I was amazed by the special effects and animations. Especially in 3D, that was a really awesome experience. The storyline however, it wasn't great. I mean, I enjoyed it, but it was no way near the storyline of HP.The amount of money that they threw at this movie is insane. In my opinion they could've distributed it better maybe? Focus a little bit more on the storyline instead of the effects.Overall, I had an enjoyable experience in the cinema. The 3D made this movie come alive. I don't know how this experience will be when i'm watching this movie at home. Overall, a 7 for the experience. Maybe, I will lower my rating when I experience it at home, but for now, a 7.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1104,changguoen,Embodiment of franchise milking,5,21 November 2018,"Even before I entered the cinema, I knew what was in store for me. Sure, you could say I asked for it, but hey, it's Harry Potter and I quite liked the first FB movie.As expected, the movie was merely a milking machine. I can't underatand why they had to pretend to use the ""Fantastic Beasts"" title when clearly the movie just doesn't care about the beasts? The beasts made obligatory appearances just to serve the title. But other than that, the beasts do not serve key plot points. The studios might as well have just created a whole new spin off itself, rather than ride on Fantastic Beasts.The other negative reviews properly sum up the main issue with this move - way too complex with too many characters I don't care about. And it glossed over too many plot points. How did Nagini and Credence get to know each other? How did the Obliviate charm actually work selectively on bad memories? Too many convenient plot points.I actually did like the scene where Grindelward was speaking to his followers to explain why they should oppose the non-magic race, juxtaposed with WWII imagery. I think this at least tries to bring your franchise closer to ""reality"" and maybe even provide a compelling reason for Grindelward's actions - akin to the villains in Black Panther and Infinity War.Still, the movie embarks on too much ""setting up"" - which is the consequence of franchise milking. 5 movies just sounds way too much of a drag. A trilogy would have been cleaner. Unlike the HP series where the books came first and people understood the direction of the movies so that the artistic value of the movies could be appreciated, FB does not follow books, so the viewer is left in the dark. 5 movies simply are too Long and far down the road before we can get any sense of the true plot.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

However, it fails to deliver the 'Harry Potter feeling' to me. These movies just don't add up to the Harry Potter movies. All the 'beasts' look like they came walking down from Sesame Street. In the Harry Potter movies all the creatures were so mythical. The characters lack background stories and the general story line is all over the place.Maybe I'm comparing these movies too much to the Harry Potter movies. But if you make something in the same universe, I think the least you should do is that it fits with the previous movies. See it for yourself, I hope you do enjoy it more than I did!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1107,beckrussell,An Absolute Mess,5,24 September 2019,"You could tell this screenplay was written by an author and not a screenwriter. J. K. Rowling attempts at adding so many characters and their backgrounds and little twists and turns, that in the end there really isn't any progression for characters at all.
The villains motives make zero sense, and it seems that Rowling wants him to be both a indiscriminately evil character (like Voldemort) as well as one with reasonable motivations that get out of hand. We're supposed to believe this man who kills babies and creatures for no reason is able to convince rational wizards that his cause is a good cause?
None of the characters previously established in the previous movie seem to act like themselves anymore, other than possibly Newt. What I found so refreshing in the first film was almost completely absent from this one: the sense of wonder and discovery of new facets of the wizarding world. New creatures and new places and new people. J. K. Rowling seems to have forgotten that the first film takes place in America and mentions some vague details about the American wizardimg school and wizard culture there. This is completely abandoned in this movie as all plot is shifted back to Europe and we go back to Hogwarts and old characters once again, in a way that just feels cheap. In my opinion she tried to do too much with this film, and the end result is the accomplishment of a shallow and empty story and characters we used to love",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

I went to see the movie with an open mind and not having any idea of what to expect: good or bad. I came out really-really happy. Movie was great. Direction was spot on, cinematography and camera work was terrific and I was taken to a wonderful ride all though the film. Watching Johnny Depp act like only he does, was great. there was not much to do for Jude Law but Eddie was terrific as Newt once again. There were less beasts but that was more than compensated by the harry potter nostalgia: Nagini, Hogwarts, Proff McGonagall etc.

As someone who grew up with Harry Potter, seeing something new set in that universe was fun!This movie was 2 hours of pure boredom. All of the character the first one had's been flushed down the toilet to just grab a quick buck from the people who love hearing Names We Know From Harry Potter and gobble this garbage up because references to the source material must mean the movie was well-written. I feel bad for Eddie Redmayne for being stuck with this stilted script, he could've carried the film like he did the first one but even his work couldn't save this trash fire.Don't waste your time, this was duller than Jude Law's heather grey Dumbledore suit.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Everything strives to be bombastic, but is pointless. Characters are not developed at all, the narrative is jumbled, from some point on you do not care anymore.All Potter movies were carefully crafted, had a line of thought that was interwoven and perfect. There were bombastic moments, there were twists and turns, but not all within 10 minutes. Dozens of characters were introduced, some the audience did not have a chance to get familiar with at all. I will not go into plotholes at all. But the story is horrible. I do not really care if there is a third movie from this mess. I will rewatch the HP movies and hope that there will be another HP movie with the kids from Harry, Hermione and Ron. Hopefully not based on that ghastly musical.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

No coherence with the non-magician world. A real problem in the balance of power...

1123,arvinjanasis,"Fantastic Beasts and ""We need answers!""",9,19 November 2018,"The sequel of this franchise has finally come and fans alike couldn't be more excited for this. The opening scene really connects to the conclusion of its predecessor ""Where to Find Them"" and gives the audiences chills, thrills and action. Throughout the film, we were introduced to many character origins like Leta Lestrange, Scamander Brothers, Albus and Gellert's relationship, Credence and more. Also it answers the question as to why Jacob still have those memories of creatures even after being obliviated. Without further ado, here are some questions I know fans would ask after watching this
-is Credence really what Grindelwald say who he is?
-how to destroy a blood bond?
-is Queenie under a spell or was she aware of her decision?
-will Jacob become a wizard soon?
-what happened to Rosier?
-Oh was that the Philosopher's Stone?
-what could become of Tina's and Newt's relationship?
-why Albus holding the elder wand in the mirror or erised?
-was that a real phoenix?
-what will happen to nagini now?
-and so much more!well indeed it's a great sequel to the first one but don't expect too much from it. one of the few problems I have noticed though was the cinematography specifically on the scene of Leta visiting her old classroom in Hogwarts

1124,nlouis-37099,Remember - This is NOT Harry Potter and it becomes slightly watchable,5,27 November 2018,"Was it bad or was it good? I don't know because I felt like I was watching a show that is streaming but my internet went out and I can't finish the series. The film just ended...boom...2 hours of telling 300 stories and ignoring the central plot, which I think had to do with Credence. Not sure...was busy counting the number of new people forced in combined with cameos of people that weren't even alive based on canon literature, combined with trying to work out why any of what was happening actually mattered. Then, when it's time to talk serious please wait a year and we will get back to you and try to explain this mess laid before you.Where to begin? First, if you go to this film expecting to see a Harry Potter film...don't...it is not. What you get is some twisted combination of fan fiction, money grabs, story arcs, a massive push to cram as many HP universe characters into a single film, plots, subplots, and lost plots, and an unnecessary destruction of characters that had potential (the main 4 from the first film especially). Second, the overall story is confusing and forced with no reference to the actual title of the film. There were fantastic beasts but most of them were in Newts basement. Unless I missed something substantial...the ""Crimes"" were lacking in detail and substance. Lastly, the biggest issue is the obvious money grab at the cost of established known story canon that is going to require some epic writing to correct in the upcoming films and likely some form of super magic to make it all fit together without just changing the canon to however the writers see fit.The film did have some good points. Jude Law was excellent and did a really good job setting up a younger Dumbledore. Jonny Depp was actually ok...I had half expected a Sweeney Todd/Jack Sparrow but Depp did well. The CGI was also really good with some nice scenes, especially at the end.I would have given the film a 2 star rating but the Niffler earns it 3 extra!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The story was not as bad as everyone was making it out to be. Everyone did a decent job acting, and the story wasn't as convoluted and confusing as everyone had made it out to seem.

Apparently it's the first film to be written by J.K Rowling. Dear, why you might be a good author, you cannot be a worse screenwriter. The biggest problem is that is so god damn boring, 90% of this movie is either Fan-service, pointless subplots and long monologues that are so prevalent there is literally a point in the film, where they just throw 2 long monologues back to back. There are so many characters and subplots that do absolutely nothing but confuse the film, and not being able to follow it just adds to the boredom. The only parts that aren't boring, are the parts that are so amuture, that it makes the movie look like a bad TV movie.The CGI was everywhere, and it looked BAD. I could not stop laughing at the scene with the blue fire dragons, because the CGI was so horrible. The camera work is terrible, the color pallet is so overly dark that you can't see anything, which makes the film even more boring. The most laughable part of presentation, is that in some scenes, they forget to add sound effects. One of them being a major characters death (way to go movie). When the movie wanted me to cry, I just laughed so hard.The acting was alright, nothing special, everybody didn't really give a damn. Especially Johnny Deep (Who they probably wasted the entire budget on).This film is garbage, don't watch it.

The thing is the (main)characters from the first movie don't get the spotlight in this sequel it's more about Credence,Nagini or even the Lestrange family . This movie isnt even really anything to do with a Grindlewald the main man(well he is ment to be). This movie doesn't fit into the fantastic beasts trilogy that well. It shouldn't have the Fantastic beasts at the start of the title or even the crimes of grindlewald at the end. The movie should be called ""The Credence chronicles:Are you my mummy"". Overall the movie is good I can see what it's trying to do but it failed. Sometimes the movie does work only if you think of it as a stand alone film.

1151,carterdstewart,Fun but too big,7,15 December 2018,"I really enjoyed this movie. I did not care much about the first movie, but I like the way this one builds off of it. On the whole, this movie is fun to watch. The action is interesting. Most of the main characters are likeable. Grindelwald is a good bad guy, and the movie gives his followers some good reasons to follow him. They are not bad simply to be bad. And the movie looks great.The biggest problems in the movie come from the overly complex plot. The movie attempts to tell four interrelated stories, and it nearly succeeds. But in order to work, we must care about all of the characters, and the movie does not give all of them enough screen time. It also glosses over some important points, and gives some dumb explanations for important plot points that are clearly supposed to shock us. We need to see more about Newt's relationship with his brother, and we need more time with members of the Corvus family. Most of the problems could have been addressed if the movie were a little longer, but it probably would have been better to stretch the plot of this one movie into two movies. I also found the attempts to connect this series with references to Harry Potter to be excessive. There are a few dialogue issues, as well.This is not a great movie, but it is a very good movie. I enjoyed watching it, and I am looking forward to the rest of the series. I just hope they slow their plots down a little and take the time to actually build the relationships they expect us to recognize.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

It will take us back in the world before Voldemort and everything feels mesmerizing! After watching trailers I felt story is little messy but i trust J K Rowling and her wriitng skills! I am sure in the next movies of this series we will get to know what's it all about? The most interesting part of the movie will be Albus Dumbledore Vs Grindelwald ! I am dying to watch that part of the movie because after reading last book of harry potter series i have many doubts regarding Albus Dumbledore's character! I am sure it will be most interesting to watch!,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1153,jimmy_a-71398,"Worth to watch, but expect to be confused",8,15 November 2018,"The first 60 minutes you'll probably ask yourself ""what's going on"" more than once each minute, because you get all the answers from minute 61 and onwards. The plot builds up all these questions to be answered one after one in a very intense development of the characters after an hour. I was clueless sometimes, but give it time and you'll have your answers. If you haven't seen the first movie, I feel safe to say you can't watch this until you've done so. If you have only seen the prior movie and then watch this, you'll be a bit clueless as well. I'd recommend to watch all the Harry Potter-films, and the Fantastic Beast prior to watching this for the best possible experience, it sure helps.Totally worth it though for a Potterhead!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1154,michaelendyatwc,Few Beasts and No Joy,3,18 November 2018,"Easily the worst film of a fantastic franchise. Like too many other sequels, it advances the story very little through a series of circumstances that don't add up and at the price of the best parts of its predecessor. The beasts are largely window dressing in another story about a wizard who wants to take over the world. In this case, the wizard seems to be manifesting a current and controversial world leader. That would be fine if there were any joy or hope to offset the fear and despair. There isn't. Every character is in pain from the start with little relief or hope. Sympathetic characters are introduced only to be mangled or forgotten. There aren't even the touching moments of connection or instances of comic relief to carry ine on. It's like a bad Tennesse Williams play with special effects.If you haven't seen the film and have a sensitive stomach, be warned. The cinemetography in the first half of the film is torturous, relying almost exclusively on tracking shots that change plains. This film plays like an amusement park ride shot for a 3D version.The actors did the best they could with a bad script and self-indulgent directing. Lets hope the next installment makes it worth it for them. If this were the first book or film in the series, nobody would have looked for the second.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1156,zahraam-18624,An extra star for the CGI,9,16 November 2018,"Many familiar faces return to the big screen for the sequel of Fantastic Beasts (And Where to Find Them). However, there is the addition of newer characters to offset the comfortability of it being tied into the HP franchise.I stand by JK Rowling's decision to cast Depp as Grindelwald- he played the part as good as one could've hoped and Jude Law as a young Dumbledore, well damn!With that being said, it was as if I was watching a series on Netflix and this was a mere filler episode. Something there to confirm what had happened before, and to prepare you for the actual drama, intrigue and action that comes next.The plot lacked substance to make it an epic standalone film, and the hazy timelines of separate characters lazily came together at the end. I think it is an essential watch to make sense of the films to follow, but there was nothing terribly riveting about it.There are necessary set-ups for the following movies, such as Queenie's decision and the Niffler's procurement of the silver blood beaker. So there is a need to watch it. Also, the introduction of an ""Olivander-like"" Nicholas Flamel, a wickedly wonderful Leta LeStrange and a host of others, will leave a smile playing on your lips if you're a HP fan.What the film lacks in plot, it makes up for in sheer cinematic experience. I watched the movie in 4DX, and I swear some of the jumpscares actually made my heart miss a beat. The CGI was amazing, props to the team and it was that which saved the movie in my opinion. I would go and see it again just for a particular circus animal that took my fancy! Although, what the hell was up with that black curtain thing?If you're a die-hard HP fan, obviously this is a must see. It'll keep you entertained but it won't really capture your attention if you're looking to watch a really engaging movie. I'm guessing the next one is the actual one to watch, but nonetheless I do recommend watching it. For Newt's ""Harry-like Lake Scene"" with Kelpie, if not anything else.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1157,brightisly,JK Rowling surely destroyed the story she created,3,19 November 2018,"As a huge fan of Harry Potter since the beginning and for over a decade, I was vastly excited to see this movie since the first trailer because the first movie is pretty well-done to be by bringing back the good memories about childhood. But this movie is a huge disappointment, I walked out in the middle of the movie because the plot is too unconnected and rambling all over the place, I came back after that still to finish what I have left off. It was like all of the characters just act because it's their scene to act and this is not acceptable. I don't have any comment about the acting of the cast because I guess with the weak script, there is not much thing they can do about it.
The picturesque and music is nice I'd say.
There is literally no character development at all, there is even out of characters that she already built in the first movie, which I can't figure out how it's coming from, especially Queenie and Tina.
There are way too many characters which did not even play a role here, Nagini to be exact, if she felt that there is a need to introduce Nagini because Nagini will play an important role in the 3rd movie, I think it's better to introduce Nagini in the 3rd movie instead, not trying to squeeze her in this mess. Because I found Nagini just plain boring, which I have to say that before seeing the movie, I was very looking forward to Nagini's story.
And there is even somebody not even supposed to be there according to what JK Rowling actually wrote about their biography before in Harry Potter!! And many more details that I did not wish I have to point out. I supposed we would meet Harry Potter as well if she wanted to hack the timeline like that?
The plot twist is just impossible, I'm still waiting for JK Rowling's explanation regarding all the illogical things in her script, because I do hope she has a good reasoning for that.
Overall, see it if you brought up together with this world, but don't bring any expectation with you.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1158,brightisly,Rowling surely destroyed the story she's created,3,20 November 2018,"As a huge Potterhead, I was vastly excited to see the movie since its first trailer, but this movie is a huge disappointment, from the weak, unconnected and rambling all-over-the-place plot to a non-development character, I can't imagine I just watched something that represents my childhood.I don't have any comment on the acting of the cast because with the weak plot, I'm doubting that there is so much they can do.
And the non-development character, some characters are even out of characters, they are not even themselves anymore, especially Queenie and Tina! And some characters not even supposed to be there, I'm still waiting for Rowling to explain why Prof McGonagall is there while she was not even born yet.
And Nagini, she is just standing there and doing nothing. If the writer feels the need to introduce this Nagini because she will play a role in the 3rd movie, then introduce her in 3rd movie, why does she have to include Nagini in this mess?!?
And many other points that I wish not to point out because I can't resist my disappointment anymore.Leta and her brother's story is just not convincing to me at all, and other things that not even linked and connected. It's just like the actors/actresses just act because it's their scene, all the things are just weird.The picturesque and music are nice I'd say, I really like the beast. The rest, human factor and their stories are just like a joke to me and against what I have been believed since young.

The first movie was pleasantly different, nevertheless due to the fact that fans obviously weren't as thrilled as in HP movies (that ain't gonna happen EvEr) JK possibly decided to put stuff in it from the original movies to make it more harrypotterisious
2. That leads to the second movie, where in one hand we have Newton , the beasts and the rest of the previous cast left aside and totally unrelated with the (non-existing) plot and the storyline of Grindelwald (character mentioned in the original books) and Young Dumbledore (Jude Law -> okey). Those two are so unrelated and complicated wanna be connected-If she kept on going with the fantastic beasts scenario it
would be more interesting and something totally new
-Weird needless connections, for instance Albus has a new
brother who was born after his mother was accidentally killed
by Arianna while his father was imprisoned in Azkaban ?
-Probably the woman cobra is going to be in the near future Voldemort's lovely snake but I couldn't understand her whole role in the movie or was just to state that ? Credence ?

1166,faridabdallah-27910,Dark and magical,9,27 November 2018,"Crimes of grindelwald a complex story, that breaks boundaries when it comes to the elegant cinematography and special effects. JK Rowling proves that her creativity is as fertile as ever: the story is as appealing as the Harry Potter series, if not more. There Is a feel that the movie is a bit stuffed with plot and subplots: the movie juggled well between characters and was able to provide us with a coherent story given the amount of characters developed in this movie. At her 10 movies related to the wizarding world, JK surely knows how to keep us hooked and wanting more. Jhonny Depp is on point in the portrayal of grindelwald, and gives him a dark, evil, manipulative and cunning aspect that is totally different and more mature than the evil of Voldemort. I like Newt as this unconventional, cliché breaking hero, but I love Eddy Redmain who delivers the character with a professional that is rare these days in Hollywood. I love where the Queenie and Jacob relationship went and I love the fact that Queenie joined the dark side. Jude law as Dumbledore was okay. The fan service characters although not necessary, provided the breather for this dense and dark movie. I enjoyed the Leta Lestrange character very much and wished she was introduced better in the first movie, so her death in the second movie would have a bigger impact on the spectator, Altough it did provide the wanted emotion. There is a feel that the Fantastic beasts element is a bit forced in this movie but the nifflers are a delight. The opening sequence is phenomenal and the finale is even more spectacular. David Yates gloomy, dark, elegantly portrayed scenes are contrasted with the beautifully coloured magical effects, and costumes.
Some attention seeking critics need to tone it down and understand that the Harry Potter days are over and that JK is done introducing us to the wizarding world: if they were confused during the movie, they need to go back and watch the introductory 9 movie course before they can judge this one.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1167,faridabdallah-27910,Elegantly portayed and visually stunning,9,8 December 2018,"Elegantly portrayed, the Crimes Of Grindelwald is for sure the most visually beautiful movie among the Harry Potter series.
David Yates dim/low light cinematography combined with JK magical overall story are the strong features of this movie along with the over the top acting.
Jhonny Depp is wonderful and was successful in portraying a grindelwald that is darker, more sophisticated, cleverer, wiser and more likeable than Voldemort.
I'm okay with Jud Law as Dumbeldor but I love Eddy Redmain as Newt.
Sure there are too many characters to follow. Sure the movie is overstuffed but still very enjoyable. The fan service characters were very well welcomed and provided a breather in the strong complicated serious sequel. This movies ranks high in the Harry Potter series. Also one should note that this is the 10th wizarding world movie, which mean that we are very deep in the Harry Potter universe and this movie would not appeal and might seem confusing for the random audience that have little to do with the Harry Potter universe.

In my opinion, the people writing negative reviews/claim to be bored or seem confused lack the depth and understanding of J.K. Rowling's genius. There is absolutely a plot. There is absolutely a reason for this movie. The only thing I didn't see was an important part of the film was Nagini's role, which I'm sure is set up for future films. Also. Why didn't the aurors attempt to catch Grindelwald at his gathering, especially since he just escaped from Macusa and was arrested in FB1 for crimes against the wizarding world. If you paid attention with Queenie and Jacob's arrival, it makes sense why she switched sides. There is an importance of Creedence and his bloodline, and there is no plot hole there. You just have to realllly understand the wizarding world in depth. Outstanding visuals, action right off the bat and continues throughout the movie. I liked this movie way more than the first FB, and I think as the series progresses, there will be a lot of other twists that will come to light and a lot of ""aha"" moments will follow.

As someone who grew up with Harry Potter and loving the entire series, I wanted so, so much to love this movie, but left the theater feeling disappointed by the direction of this film. There was too much exposition but so little plot that much of the movie felt like it rode off sentimental value (which for some parts, wasn't even accurate to the original series.) That said, sentimental value works for diehard fans; there were still magical moments that I enjoyed, and I'm still glad I watched it because of the nostalgia factor and references made to the original series.

The film's special effects and CGI were also exceptional, and the cast was perfect. However, what seems like what would be an incredible film thus far fell very flat in plot.Besides providing background information for many of the characters, there was very little plot structure to this film. The hunt for Credence the obscurist continues, and the small romantic elements between characters underlie and influence some decisions made in the film, but besides that, there is little to be said about the story line. This film also indulged in pet peeve of mine in film, specifically the Harry Potter universe, that being the fact that almost every character is a long lost brother, cousin, friend or unbreakable-oath member to another character in the story. Is everyone related in some way? Why are no characters just strangers to each other? By using these ""I'm actually your (fill in the blank with a relative title),"" multiple times, the realism of the story suffered quite a lot.This film is a good go-to-the-theater-with-your-friends movie, but if you're actually after a compelling and well explained plot, you will most likely be disappointed.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1186,ahbellejesty,Fantastic beasts crimes of Grindelwald review / theories,6,2 February 2019,"Ok first what was with the first 10 mins why were the shots so close that was really awful and I think it was to hide the set that they didn't have because that was CLEARLY a re shoot. The plot was not great I think they were trying to fit too much into one story there was just was too much going on and nagini was unnecessary like why was she there she did nothing. Ok so Grindelwald (gw), I don't like Johnny Depp for obvious reasons but his performance felt really weird they should have just kept Colin firth ( or whatever that guys name is) but that's besides the point. When we are first introduced to gw and the other guy I'll call him uwm ( unidentified wizard man). But I think uwn has like a special power like being a metamorphosis or maladictus but instead switching bodies , because gw seems to get wizards that are above average to join him like Queenie being a telepath, but also the cinematography wasn't great there either they really only cared about money shots in this film. I'm getting all over the place ahh. Ok so gw want credence because he is an obscurial he is above average so he's either lying about credence being related to dumbledore's brother orrr this is where my other theory ties in, that credence or his obscurial rather is what's related to Dumbledore, Dumbledore has 2 siblings, ( Aberforth and Ariana) Aberforth is still alive in hp as we see him first in order of the phoenix. But his sister Ariana died at a young age, ( we also she her but she has already passed, she is the girl in the painting) the theory is that ariana had an obscurial and died from it therefore passing it on I guess, maybe reincarnating. Whatever but it goes to credence making him or his obscurial related to Dumbledore making Dumbledore his brother. I think obscurials can travel between bodies like a symbode type thing and like we see in the first FB need had one in a bubble so it obscurial could have been ariana's. If gw is lying about creance how did the Phoenix appear? because a Phoenix appeared and they will only do that for a Dumbledore similar to a raven's significance for the blacks. But it doesn't make sense for him to be a Dumbledore. It is possible that gw is just projecting the phoenix to trick credence. Anyway moving on from that... There was a moment in newts basement, when I thought Grundy (newts intern I guess) might be an anigmus because that giant bird ( not sure what it is) the one that was behind Jacob just as he reached the bottom steps. Just the way the shots were lined up made it look like the bird was looking at the notes newt had left for grundy, and at one point it was nuzzling another beast and it just looked like it was caring for it. Now about Queenie I already knew Queenie was going to turn to gw side because If you look at the posters all the villains are facing one way and the hero's are facing the other. Except Queenie she was facing the same way as all the villains. The tension that they tried to recreate between newt and Tina was unnecessary and it felt like they were stunting their character development. Anyway the movie was alright but I think for now it's more of a middle man movie to build up to the next three movies. Overall the movie was good, but more of a placeholder type to establish gw characteristics but in doing so they strayed from the other characters.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The fact that this movie has scored so high is like a big middlefinger to all movies that scored lower than Crimes of Grindelwald.

1194,macydawnrea,Left to wait for more of Newt's adventure,10,4 April 2019,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them left off with Grinderwald being taken into the custody of the American Ministry of Magic. It is unknown at the end of the first movie whether Credence Barebone has survived the massive blowback from his obscurial. Newt and Tina were simply left in limbo as to whether or not they would finally be together.
J.K. Rowling does not let us down in the next chapter of ""Fantastic Beasts"". She is able to captivate the audience yet again with her amazing storylines that constantly snake and turn leaving the audience to wonder if the story line they are following is indeed the correct storyline. Not only did J.K. Rowling write the book she also was one of the producers for this two hour and fourteen-minute PG13 film, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.
Rowling starts us a tad on the slow side by explaining how Grindelwald, played by Johnny Dep, has been nowhere near the ideal prisoner in America. Grindelwald is being transferred to answer to his crimes elsewhere. He is very persuasive and an extremely powerful dark wizard. He manages an escape with the help of his trusty minion, Abernathy, whom helps him throughout the entire course of the movie in seemingly little turns of events. Grindelwald plans a rally of the pure-blood wizards to rise up and revolt against both the Ministry and the non-magical community so that they can be the superior race.
Albus Dumbledor, played by Jude Law, has enlisted Newt to find and help Credence on his quest to find out who he really is. It is unsure as to what has happened between Dumbledore and Grindelwald. However, it doesn't take long to figure out that Albus does indeed know what Grindelwald plans to do and why.
The British Ministry of Magic also attempts to enlist Newt. They have banned his permission to travel and are attempting to force him into joining the Ministry under his brother's division. Theseus Scamander is the head of the Auror Office. By the trailers one can tell they want Newt to kill someone but to find out who they must watch this movie.
We find Credence has fallen in with a misfits and oddities circus. He has fallen for a very beautiful maledictus (someone with a blood curse who is destined to turn into a horrible beast forever) named Nagini whose beast is an incredible snake. At this circus Credence is able to help Nagini escape in return releasing this magnificent Chinese cat type creature.
The audience is captivated by the changes of events and the ample amounts of battle scenes. The special effects do a superb job of making it feel as if we are actually there. The viewer is immersed in the drama and turmoil that is the ""Wizarding World"". The ending of the movie is a cliff hanger so large that viewers are drawn to watch the credits in hopes of just a little sneak peak into what the next movie may bring.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1195,mrizal-19987,I hate the ending of this film11,7,15 May 2019,"That is a great film. I was very impressed with the actors who were very good at playing their roles, amazing. Especially Newt Scamander, argh somehow I really like that character. Back to the story I think the story this time is different from the previous Fantastic Beast series, in this series it seems to tell more about the origin of Credance. From the plot of the story also every round is like giving clues that make me ""Oh, it turns out like this, oh it turns out like that"".When I saw the previous series, I thought the next series would show more magical more awesome animals. And it turns out that in this series new roles appear that increasingly make this film more exciting like Nagin. Why do I call Nagin because it comes from the mythical story of my country, for some reason I am proud ahahaha. Then the animation, arghhhhhh is amazing. I really like Grindelwald's blue fire dragon magic animation, I don't know what the magic name is but I really like it.But it's very unfortunate for the ending of the story. Although the duration of the film is quite long, but come on why you have to finish. The ending was like a climax that was suddenly finished. I was also confused while watching, when I thought ""Wow this is starting to get excited"" and suddenly finished. But over all is good, why isn't it very good? Oh I hate the ending sorry.

1200,davidssonalva,The demise of a franchise,1,12 February 2020,"As a very passionate fan of the Harry Potter movies and books, I was thrilled when I heard the news about a chance to revisit the magic world again. But after seeing the first fantastic beasts movie, I was not satisfied. Sure, it was cute and all, but it felt disconnected. Although it was fun being introduced to a variety of Scamender's creatures, it was far from the movie I'd expected.Then came this movie. I regret ever stepping in to the theatre to watch it. The whole movie is a complete mess, with too many loose strings, plotless reveals and desperate attempts to draw in the OG Potter-fans. Destroying roots of the Potter-story just to shove characters like McGonagall in our faces (who wasn't even born when she supposedly taught Newt), making Nagini into a person (which totally throws of Voldemort's traits, implying that they at some point meet?) , and botching Dumbledore's complicated relationship with Grinderwald. Not even mentioning the completely derailed characters, weird plot twists and ridiculous cameos from otherwise respected characters (Nicholas Flamel). The story is not even about Newt and his creatures anymore, and Newt is really just a bystander in this story.I could go on for ages about how bad this movie is, but to summarize; Even though this movie came out 2 years ago, I am still mad. If you are a Harry Potter fan, do not watch this movie. It risks the magic of the entire Harry Potter universe.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1201,catclone-73537,A plot breaking setup,5,29 February 2020,"So for me at least I really enjoyed the original Fantastic Beasts, so when I watched the sequel I was really excited. It started off kinda off weird but enjoyable, then you saw Newts animal, uhm... Collection? So then the biggest problem is introduced. Dan Folger's character Jacob Kowalski. For no other reason then plot he magically remembers everything, now I understand this is the wizarding world but it was such a distraction the whole time. Again for no other reason then plot he got entranced with a spell in order to marry Queenie. The actors did good but the writing ruined it. So he gets unentranced and they argue or something. The fact he remembers everything goes against the ending of the last movie, and raises more unanswered questions. Then it kinda forgets about magic and focuses on too much stupid love stuff, it felt like a movie of misunderstandings with no real resolve. All it did was setup the third movie.
My favorite parts would be the parts with Jude Law's Dumbledore, he just stole each scene he was in. Although his relation with grindlewald is a questionable choice. Some of the creatures had cool designs too.I have to give it only 5/10 because the last movie is a good place to end and skip out on this movie all together. The fact all it did was setup the third movie makes it just mediocre. Depending on how good the next movie is will change my mind a bit. But as someone who tried to find everything to like this movie, I just couldn't.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1205,niktj-01165,Fantastic Bombs - The Crimes of Marketing,1,4 November 2020,"What a disappointment.The movie seems to be 2 hours of shorts for other movies - a bit of vaudeville, two dollops of soap-opera - multiple random acts of CGI - a previously killed character brought inexplicably back from the dead - and a number of characters whose names seem familiar, but who are otherwise completely disconnected from the original owners of those names.A number of the actors are excellent - Eddie Redmayne, and of course Johhny Depp.
But they have both acted in lots of other movies that are far more entertaining, that you could see.This movie has no plot - no flow - no character development - no reason for existing - completely random acts of blue-fire martyrdom - and then ultimately degenerates to pure soap-opera.All followed by a final ""twist"" that makes even less sense than the rest of the movie - and seems only intended to get you hooked for the next instalment.So Sad.JK - have you really blown all the proceeds from the HP books and movies to the extent that you are now forced to stoop this low?If you are a HP die-hard, and find yourself with little else to do one evening - then you will probably find this movie a good top-up on magical CGI.There are indeed lots of Fantastic Beats that wander in and out of the scene for no apparent reason, in much the same way as the actors do.I have read, re-read, and loved all the HP books, and seen and re-seen all the HP movies.
I found the last HP movie to be quite disappointing because they messed with the ending too much.Then along came Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and I was hooked again!I was even getting my Muggle Wife to agree to watch HP #1 in order to understand and enjoy the first Fantastic Beasts movie.

1208,ajeandowning,Can't stop watching,10,8 February 2021,"I am very disturbed by all the negative reviews on this movie. These users think they know the story better than the creator of the entire franchise. They fail to understand that this movie is part of a series and shouldn't be expected to live up to their standard of a standalone movie. It's obviously building up to something greater.It takes a very ignorant person to not understand the plot. It's a conventional plot with multiple stories that all come together in the end. I was left very satisfied with the story and amused with all the connections made to the Harry Potter franchise.I do agree that character development wasn't focused on much, and it was more based on the development of the story and what is to come. I expect the 3rd to be much better in that aspect.The performances were phenomenal. Eddie Redmayne especially... who gets constantly attacked for playing a mumbly and fidgety character, which is ""not a strong lead."" It seems that the industry just can't accept when there's an unconventional main character, and it just proves how close minded and ignorant they all are. I think his character makes so much sense, and if he were to become a traditional male lead like everyone expects... it may just destroy the franchise. Johnny Depp played Grindelwald perfectly as well, and it's such a shame he won't appear in the 3rd movie.For me, this movie is more than entertaining.

1209,Elma_15,What was that?,2,26 November 2018,"This just made me angry. There were characters squeezed in here that weren't even born yet if you follow the proper timeline (which it should!) there was no real plot to this at all. No need for some of the things they did to show how awful Grindelwald was, i think anyone reading this who has watched the film will know what i am referencing without me having to give away any spoilers. Credence's back story provided by Grindelwald was ridiculous and (hopefully) a lie to reel him in because otherwise its impossible and makes no sense whatsoever! There were just too many cons to this film to list them all. Over all it was just one hell of a disappointment and i hope this movie was a blip or JK has some actual magic up her sleeve for the rest of this franchise.

1210,blue_cube-1,The Crimes of Grindy. The Crimes of JK?,8,22 April 2019,"Walking into FB2, I was purposefully keeping expectations low. I've been burned so many times and know now that expecting nothing is the best way to enjoy everything. But I was still so excited that I was shaking in my plushy IMAX seat, and as the lights went down and someone yelled ""NOX!"" with perfect timing, the laughter gave way to excited whispers all around. EVERYONE in this cinema was abuzz with expectation, whether willingly so or not. That tarnished WB Logo appeared through the fog, and I actually got shivers as the gorgeously haunting Hedwig's Theme melded into a whispy choral buildup which promised big, epic, dramatic, tragic, and magic-fuelled mayhem. This buildup was not simple hype. Every one of those things exists in this film - with extra gravy on top.*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***We're dropped into New York almost where we left off, and are privvy to MACUSA's political flutterings behind-the-scenes as they deal with Grindy - still in their custody. An incredibly neat action sequence follows, which I don't accurately know how to describe because I'm still upside-down with water in my ears. Suffice to say, Grindy escapes and there's a twist. Already. In the first five minutes of the film. We're certainly off on another Wizarding World adventure.Now, before I go any further, let's drop pretences like a wizard drops polyjuice potion, I'm going to come out and just say it; I loved this film. I loved it. And before the inevitable army of Pottermore nerds reaches my front door with their magical pitchforks, let me explain why, and let's start with what people hate. Yep. Hate. People got so riled up about this film that the word HATE is bandied about. (This may or may not have something to do with the fact that it's cool to hate things right now and every human is angry at the moment and this movie and its author were easy targets...). People HATE this film for a few simple reasons, which have been discussed ad-nauseum and which I'll list now.1) Professor McGonagall shows up in Hogwarts eight years before she was born. This, to me, is the biggest glitch in the writing, but was explained very simply by a harassed, edge-of-her seat Rowling around the film release. She wanted a familiar face for fans to enjoy. That's it. Now, we could get hung up and scream and roll about on the floor frothing at the mouth because IT'S JUST NOT CANNONNNN!! ... or, we can pass over that, think ""huh, cute, I forgive the woman who gave us this magical universe for doing something she thought we'd enjoy"", and look at the film's actual merits. Like it's insane, typically Rowling-esque characters, it's gorgeous, imaginative scenes OF PURE WONDER, the humorous, delightful beasts, or the dark, thematically ironic and apt subtext of a divided world going nuts and drifting towards extreme solutions to their problems...2) The movie was just setup. Yep. If you expected the franchise to end here, you were disappointed. This movie is setup. It's setup like a young clueless messenger taking a box of dead roses to a mob-boss. But ... WHAT DID YOU EXPECT!? It's a series! It's the SECOND PART IN A SERIES! You were told this before you went in! Looking past this, the film is still a richly ornamented treasure trove of fascination, tangled character arcs and world-deepening. Though Newt curiously undergoes the least development of all, the others around him take bold steps. Tina has gained a new resolve and courage in her re-instated role as an Auror. Credence is getting over his battered, shivering victimhood and learning to learn and face his demons. Nagini is a little flat, but has a lot of potential, and we know she eventually ends up turning dark-side, so that will be fascinating to watch unfold. The entire film is, despite what people say, a standalone film, and a great build to even darker, more epic things to come.One thing people constantly whine about is the Queenie / Jacob arc. I have no problem with this. Actually, I think it's brilliant. Yes, Jacob's recovery from obliviation could have been handled with a little more care, but honestly, it doesn't matter, Queenie is the one we're watching here. Through this movie, we get glimpses which deepen what we might have suspected in the first film. Queenie is desperate for love. We could assume her legilimency has thus far scared away any potential suitor, but now she believes she's found one in a muggle. Jacob adores her, and doesn't mind her pawing through his thoughts. Creepy, but I wouldn't mind my partner doing it - I trust him implicitly, so, go nuts, I get it. Yet Queenie is so insecure about herself, and so damaged by losing him already to that obliviation rain, that she likely believes that Jacob, like all the other men, is going to change his mind and leave her. Her perfect catch, betraying her, leaving her alone. Again. What's the solution? Well, she is a witch. So she hexes him. Puts him deep into a love spell and takes him to europe to seal the deal, the place where marrying mag's and no-mag's is no problem. It's crazy, but love is crazy, and she, despite saying otherwise, is certainly also a little crazy.Now, this whole hexing deal is really important, because it shows us a glimpse of the levels Queenie is willing to go to go to for this 'love' thing. The lengths she'll go to to keep this relationship. People cry out and say ""WHY WOULD SHE TURN TO GRINDY! THAT MAKES NO SENSE!?"" but actually, it's perfectly logical. As we've seen, Queenie is a little ... erm, drifty. She's not the most logical girl, and is easily swayed by a good line or two. Well, Grindy has the perfect line for her. He promises she'll have her way, her man, her love, if she helps him. That means she gets Jacob without any more love potions or tricks. Her motivations are crystal clear. When Jacob tells her she's being 'crazy' again, after she's made her decision, she can't believe it. She's doing this for him! She's trying to make this work, and he effectively tells her he doesn't want that (at least that's what she hears). Her drive to prove that she knows what she's doing, that she's in control, her anger at Jacob for dismissing her efforts leads her to Grindelwald. Yes, we all loved her in the first film, she was a beacon of light, and her naivety was almost refreshing, but now we can see that desperation drives people to do silly things, and she's given up on trying to work a solution into the unworkable laws of the times. Here's the thing. People really like Queenie, myself included, but she isn't evil. She hasn't become evil, and she hasn't done anything evil. Yet. All she's done is naively, foolishly, brought herself to support someone offering her a solution. People make mistakes. Deal. With. It.Ok. So, now...3) DUMBLEDORE IS GAY!? SINCE WHEN!?! WAAAAAHH!! Since like, 2007, when Rowling herself said ""I think of Dumbledore as homosexual"". She went on to say that he fell in love with Grindelwald, ""which was his great tragedy"". This is not a revelation people, IT IS NOTHING NEW. It's literally been known since 2007 (and earlier if you read HP and made some connections). If you were actual fans, you'd have picked up on this long ago. So stop making it a thing. It's not a thing. He's gay. Cool. That's kind of one of the cruxes of this whole series. Move on.Of all these 'problems', the first one is the only one that gets me, and because of Rowling's casual oversight there, this film lost a LOT of fans. (Again, I feel it's mostly because everyone wants a punching bag right now. Seriously. Everyone is so angry right now. Chill out, people. Enjoy a fantasy film for what it is. It's not the next installment of the Bible, for Pete's sake. It's not a political debate). For me, honestly, it was one of the most fun movies of the year. It was thrilling to see the world again with a new perspective. Thrilling to see europe this time, and in the grip of a magical/political thundercloud (we all know where it's heading). Aggravatingly, while some big things seemed oversights on the part of the writers, there are SO MANY TINY, LOVING DETAILS in this movie that people won't see, simply because they're angry at McGonagall showing up and Queenie making a decision. I laughed when I recognised Abernathy's disguise in the french ministry of magic as the old woman who tried to take Tina's memories in the first film, for example. The animals in Newt's bestiary are brilliant, and Jacob's casual dismissal of one and another potential plotline: ""I got my own problems,"" was awesome.I could go into Credence's arc, (and another potential problem: he's another Dumbledore. But while odd, this isn't that big a deal. It could be explained a number of ways. Perhaps it's a lie, for one ...) or I could go into Grindlewald's, but this review is already too long.I'm not going to rate this 10, of course, because there are problems. It's not a perfect film, but it was fun, it had heart, and the flavour was 97% where it should be, for the rise of the next big villain in the Wizarding World. For it's epic proportions, its heart-tugging ironies and its pure imagination, I give it an 8. You go, JK! Looking forward to the next installment.

I think Johnny Depp would have made an incredible Grindewald, if they had just given him a good script and some character development. He is boring, not wicked ,awe inspiring or charismatic. Jude Law even disappointed as a young Dumbledore-- he just didn't feel like 'Dumbledore', and seems out of place. They were too worried about working a 'sexuality' hint into it. (I freakin knew they were going to go there) it is not relevant- shouldn't even have been a part of this story unless they want to turn it into a regular boring adult theme movie instead of the magical place of wonder it has been.

1218,blackdragoness,Good Movie but not so for Harry Potter fans,4,25 November 2018,"I went to see the movie in 2D a little while ago and needed some time to let it sink in.The story is easy to follow and the characters are well done. Some of the actors are truly spectacular (Jude Law, Eddie Redmayne) and others are not as good (Johnny Depp), as is always the case with these kind of movies. The creature animation blew my mind, as always in the Harry Potter films. The animation team is incredible. They deserve an Oscar!
I also liked many elements of the story. How Queenie joins Grindelwald despite being in love with a muggle simple because he promises her to help with her infliction of being able to read minds uncontrollably. The depiction of how she looses control over her ability when she hits rock bottom in Paris ... amazing.
Leta being conflicted about her love for Newt and his brother on the one hand and her family legacy on the other hand ... very nicely done and believable.
The circus of curiosities and the depiction of how people/creatures who do not conform to the human ideal are treated ... ingenious and truly terrifying.
How Grindelwald just makes others do his dirty work and doesn't even shy away from having a toddler murdered simply to gain a nice apartment ... wonderful and again terrifying beyond belief.
I loved the way Jude Law portraits Dumbledore. It's the Dumbledore of HP 1 and 2 again, the Richard Harris version and not the horrible Michael Gambon one. Seeing him interact with Newt and his students ... you can see why Harry likes him and why he cannot get his head around all the bad facts he hears about Dumbledore after his death.HOWEVER, what really bugs me about this film is the approach the production team seems to have taken toward long-time Harry Potter fans. They seem to have wanted to include little easter eggs and references toward obscurer knowledge of fans. THIS DID NOT WORK! I am a long time fan, I started loving the books way before the first movie came out, I read and/or listen to them practically non-stop in an endless loop. BUT I left the cinema with mixed feelings which I could not really place. I was not excited about the film, I was rather let down and felt confused. Only a few days later did I realise why: all the factual errors and elements that disagree with the established Potter Universe.
I was so excited when I saw that J.K.Rowling had written the screenplay. I immediately thought this could only be a brilliant film. Man, was I to be disappointed!
The story is nice enough, especially if you are not a potterhead. If you are, it is a bit of a slap in the face. So here's what bugs me:
McGonagall: she wasn't even born at the time the movie is set! How can they just change the core story like that? By looking at the actors, she looked about the same age as Dumbledore! My only reaction was ""what the ***?!""
Dumbledore teaching Defence against the Dark Arts: Again, what the ***?! When Tom Riddle was a student at Hogwarts, a Prof. Merrythought was teacher for that subject. Plus, she had had the job for over 35 years, which would make her the teacher at the time the film is set, not Dumbledore! Dumbledore taught Transfiguration and even taught McGonagall as a student! How can the two of them be teachers at the same time?!
Credence: I love the character and also love how Ezra Miller portraits him. Nevertheless, I do not understand how anyone could call im Aurelius Dumbledore! And yes, Grindelwald could just have made that name up to get Credence on his side, but then you have the phoenix, which appears to Credence and which is probably supposed to be Fawkes. Now, taking into account that the story about the Dumbledores and phoenixes is correct, and it does indeed seem very probable, this story and the appearance of the phoenix would make Credence a blood relative of Albus Dumbledore. Why have we never heard of him? Especially if he is a BROTHER of Albus's??? Doesn't make sense to me.
Grindelwald himself: I do sometimes like Johnny Depp as an actor, sometimes he's just a bit obnoxious for my liking. But as a Grindelwald?! What a miscast! He looks nothing like Jamie Campbell Bower, who was introduced as the young Grindelwald in the HP movies and he also looks nothing like the old Grindelwald, played by Michael Byrne, we can see in a vision Harry has of how Voldemort interrogates Grindelwald in Nurmengard. Continuity, my friends! And speaking of his looks, these boots! And the eyes! I could not take the character seriously as I was only looking at the white eye. Oh and what was with the peroxide blonde hair?! Don't get me wrong, I did like the way Grindelwald acted and his charisma and so on most of the times. My biggest issue is casting and looks.
Nurmengard Prison: at the very end of the film we get a glimpse of what Nurmengard looks like. It's a palace in Austria. What the ***?! Again, in the Deathly Hollows we actually see Nurmengard when Voldemort flies there to confront Grindelwald about the Elder Wand. It is depicted as a place much like Azkaban. Straight lines, functional look, dark and dank cells. Oh and the books also tell us that Grindelwald specially built it for his opponents! How does that fit to the light and beautiful castle in Austria? It plainly doesn't! When reading the books and taking that description into account, I always imagined a place like Alcatraz and somewhere in Siberia. So not, what we get to see in this film!I could go on, like this but I think you get my point. All in all, the movie is well done in that you can easily follow the story and don't really need any background knowledge to understand what is going on and who is on whose side. BUT there are so many mistakes and discrepancies with the original films and books, that the film is only frustrating for true fans. I can only hope that the next film will finally show how Dumbledore and Grindelwald got to know each other and thus resolve a few plot holes.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

It took off from where the last movie left you hanging, rewarded its fans for their paitence and then left them anticipating and with abaited breath again. Rowling always delivers.As a movie too the feature doesnt fall short. All the actors have done justice to their characters and have made their portrayls extremely convincing. The script keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout and when you think there is about to be a cliched revelation you are greeted with another unexpected plot twist.

Mostly CGI and not many beasts.Avoid paying for to watch this movie if you can - and watch it for free on a flight somewhere!,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1226,sasa-856-961810,Worst wizzarding world movie of all 10 so far,6,22 November 2018,"Let's start off with the things I liked about the movie. Grindelwald and Dumbledore casting is perfect. Especially Grindelwald. I like how he was portrayed like an artist with the wand. While all the other witches and wizards are using wands like a tool, he uses it like a conductor baton, or a paint brush. And that's about all that I liked.Big problem with the move is the way that Jacob was brought back to the wizarding world - obliviation didn't work? Just like that? Did it work for hundreds of others of the muggles that were in that rain? If so, why not for Jacob? I personally think that they could have been more creative with this. And direct consequence of this poor introduction is the fact that Jacob and Queenie were the most boring part of the movie (complete opposite compared to the part 1).Second - Queenie is to easily convinced by the Grindelwald, at least for an occlumency master and muggle lover.Last big thing that I will add here are Grindelwald's powers. We all know that he suppose to be one of the most powerful wizards of all time, topped only by Voldemort, and maybe Dumbledore. But what he does in this movie is above anything that we've seen Voldemort doing. After watching the movie I have a feeling that this Grindelwald would easily beat Voldemort from the Battle of Hogwarts, even without a wand. I know that Grindelwald is master of the Elder Wand, which Voldemort was not, but still. I must admit though that we never saw Voldemort fighting anyone but Dumbledore (and Harry, but in this duels Harry always had some circumstances working in his advantage), so this could be an explanation.And there are two minor things that I would like to add, and both are concerning timeline. First is Minerva McGonagall appearance, although, she shouldn't have been born yet. One possible explanation is that this is not Minerva, but her mother or some other cousin. But credits say Minerva. And the other thing is revelation that Credence is Dumbledore's brother. Based on all that we know about Credence's age, he was born long after Dumbledore's father died. There is hope that sequels will address this inconsistencies, but if they remain unexplained, I will just consider them honest mistakes, this doesn't bother me much.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

But this movie was a complete disgrace to the wizarding world. I tried so hard to enjoy it but it was boring, pointless and made completely no sense. There were so many mistakes that people ignore , i don't understand how can they ignore them!1. Dumbledore have never thaught Defense Against the Dark Arts. He was professor of Configuration how can Rowling forget it i cant believe!2. When Newt gave the baby raven to Leta, he said ""it is your house's animal isn't it"" while SHE WAS WEARING A SLYTHERIN EMBLEM. I can't even say anything to this..3. McGonagall doesn't make any sense since she was working at Hogwarts for 39 years when Umbridge asked her in 5th book.4. How the HELL Dumbledore have another brother? How come Aberfort have never mentioned about him or Rita Skeeter at his book. That makes completely no sense. It's just a filler and Rowling's pathetic tries to make the story even more interesting. But she fails big time! Credence was interesting enough even though we didn't know he was a Dumbledore.5. Every time that muggle man comes to screen i die a little. It is the most boring thing i've ever seen. And the dialogs between Tina and Newt, i couldn't stand to it.Saying all those things hurt me so bad because i LOVE Harry Potter universe. But i consider this as a betrayal to the fans. You can't just add some random people to the most important characters families. Like they did in The Cursed Child which i pretend like i've never read it and act like it doesn't exist.Trying this hard on HP universe, i started to feel like Rowling is just trying to squeeze it and make more money of it and it ruins my childhood. I was never so disappointed in my life.The only good thing in this movie was to see Hogwarts. 5 points for that. Not more.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1236,dontworryboutitbaby,I've never known an entire movie to just 'phone it in' until now,3,19 November 2018,"I don't know what the hell just happened. I thought I was in the theatre for a solid 3 hours or more but it was only 2, and that's because this film is chocked so full of filler you end up in a time vortex as you desperately wait for something to happen.The first Fantastic Beasts was fine. Good fun comedy, endearing characters, etc. Except for shoehorning in that whole Grindelwald/Credence storyline that detracts from the point but somehow resolves itself. Great, finished, that was a fun stand alone movie... or was it?Now, I've taken a leaf out of this movie's playbook by spending half of your time catching up on the events of the first movie as if you didn't see it. It's almost like this movie has such low self esteem that it assures itself you didn't see the first one and is shocked that you decided to spend any time on the sequel.The characterisation in the first film has been done with. Now we have the same actors playing COMPLETELY different people, so it seems.But wait, there's more. How about a whole host of new characters you care about even less? Sure, why not.The opening action sequence fails at the fundamental right of a chase scene, which is to give the audience a sense of geography. I lost my bearings almost immediately and thus the action was hard to follow.The use of CGI is excessive and needless - that is to say, when you decide to CGI a button (A BUTTON!) rolling across the floor... you're wasting my time.The storyline here is super confusing: they set up this unrequited love thing between Newt and his brother's fiance (too many new characters) which goes absolutely nowhere, but not without sending us down this winding pathway of a flashback to their childhood where they try to set up this unrequited love thing AGAIN, that does nothing to further the storyline or bring depth to the characters. Cut it out and you still have the same movie.Speaking of this fiance, she later aggressively steals our attention with yet another flashback where she essentially tells the audience she's a b---- and we should hate her, but this is the movies and there are no consequences for anything. In fact, she's rewarded by the characters loving her.That whole bit there was deep, thick, dirty exposition where two new characters that we don't care about TRY desperately to string their stories about why we're even sitting through this nonsense together in an attempt to match it all up in the end. They fail, and I was left screaming ""what the hell just happened?!""Johnny Depp, through no fault of his own, is phoning in his performance entirely.For one thing, he only really gets a total of about 10 minutes of screen time in this lifelong laborious ordeal of a film.For another, I believe that Depp may be one of the greatest character actors of our generation... so I'm entirely unsure why the part of ""generic bad guy with English accent"" was given to him at all. There was nothing for him to work with, so why bother?Apparently something happened between Dumbledoor and Grindelwald. One of those convenient things that happened to be set up years prior (in ANOTHER flashback) for the exact purpose of not flipping the off switch on the events of this movie really easily. I dunno, good luck trying to follow this nonsense.It's a recurring theme in this film: Conveniently this happened, which was convenient because it meant this could conveniently happen, so this conveniently happened next, where these different characters conveniently came together at this convenient location, etc. etc. etc.As is traditional in movies, the final battle should be about 30 minutes long, I find.But not this film, where 5 minutes of painfully tension-free CGI nothingness took place, before a bunch of no-name characters gasped a bit and then made it all go away.The aftermath was a slow pan of devastated faces as we reflect on the loss of loved ones in some form or another... except that these are characters who we only just met and who barely had any lines - so... are we supposed to care or something?And then there's Credence. I mean, I didn't care about him in the first film, but now that he's a 28 year old man wandering around whining about his mummy issues, I REALLY don't care.He screeches about how he doesn't know who he is or whatever. Well, kid, why don't you grow a pair and decide what you want to do with your time instead of moaning about how nobody loved you, hmm?And lastly... what is the title all about? 'The Crimes Of Grindelwald'. There were approximately zero crimes committed, and at one point, the wizard police LITERALLY said ""He's not committing a crime by just talking to people"" and OH MY GOD all he does is TALK! So...?With that title, a much better thing to do with this film would have been to make a prequel, giving Depp a chance to be on screen and do some real acting, show Grindelwald commit some actual crimes and do that whole off-switch thing with Dumbledoor. Then cram this film and whatever happens next into one much more bearable film later.My key takeaway from this, as it was written by JKR herself, is that she is NOT a screenwriter, but a catacomb of jumbled exposition awaiting an excuse to blast it out into the open.And I ask again: what the hell just happened?",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1241,nicky77722,A Misguided Attempt At Stretching A Franchise Beyond Its Means,4,14 July 2020,"The second installation in the Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them saga is here, with the regal title of ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" showing immediately the change in direction this film series is taking.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADWhere to start with this one. I was incredibly excited going into this, being a massive fan of the Harry Potter universe, and left feeling baffled in many ways. So many ideas blast their way towards you from the screen, with few hitting their mark and leaving a lasting impression. In a good way, at least.
While I did enjoy it, one of the main issues that I had with the first film was that it dived straight into the subplot of Grindelwald being on the scene (albeit in disguise), and didn't really give much time for Newt and the titular fantastic beasts to really shine and take on wild adventures of discovery of their own. We pick up from where Newt has already finished his book, and therefore none of the four confirmed films to follow in this series could really focus on the subject matter we were originally sold... The search and discovery of fantastic beasts.Sadly, this left the beasts themselves to feel like a sideline in the film, and this has been amplified by quite large amount in this latest offering from J.K. Rowling herself, and director David Yates. Notice how small ""Fantastic Beasts"" has become in the film's logo itself.All of the creatures in the film serve minor purposes at best, and at worst feel completely forced into the mix as though while developing the story, the series title kept reappearing as an annoying reminder that the beasts had to still play some part in all of this.Then we come to the characters themselves; one of the very strong points of the first film. Eddie Redmayne brought something very unique and distinctive to his role as Newt Scamander; the developing relationship between him and Tina (played wonderfully by Katherine Waterston) was heartwarming, as was the way they departed at the end, with the promise of good things to come for the two. Alison Sudol stole her scenes as Queenie, with her old-school charm and refreshing honesty, and Dan Fogler as Jacob brought some well-timed comic relief and sincerity to the table.Enter Fantastic Beasts 2. It's rare to come across a film that treats its characters with this much disrespect. As we're re-introduced to Queenie and Jacob, fresh off the beautiful ending of the first film where love and amazing memories trumped the power of a memory erased, we learn that Queenie has placed Jacob under a spell to convince him to marry her, against his will and consent, all because he refused to do so due to the risk of the dangers involved with marrying him, a No-Maj. Once this spell is removed by Newt, Jacob literally doesn't know what country he is in. Queenie's character immediately went from being a genuine, loving and honest one, to one who wasn't content with the strong and passionate relationship she had, and threw it all away because of not being able to sign some legal documents. Their relationship and bond was tarnished in one swift move, right from the outset of this film. Certain aspects of her character also seem to have been emphasized in the worst ways, such as her loveable ditziness changing from endearing to condescending, such as in the instance where she talks down to the French Ministry of Magic worker when trying to find out where Tina is.
Then we have the bond that was established between Newt and Tina. Surely this would be the foundation that we could cling onto? Alas, we learn in the very same scene that due to a magazine misprint which reported Newt being engaged to Leta Lestrange instead of to Newt's brother Theseus, Tina has given up on him and is now romantically involved with someone else. There are few cinematic things as unsatisfying as a film undoing everything that was set up in the previous one, right from the outset. Alien 3, anyone?
On the other side of the coin, I can't say that this film has no merits or strong points. The main character's performances are still great, Jude Law is fantastic as Dumbledore, and the CGI and soundtrack astounding. When the beasts are on screen, they burst with personality and add some much-needed levity to it all. Regardless of all of the issues with the story, there will always be joy in returning to the wizarding world.On that note, the wizarding world and its well-established rules is something that this film starts to blur. Certain liberties are taken with the scope of magic which ultimately raise more questions than anything. For instance, the majority of this film is set in Paris, where the characters walk through a Platform 9¾-esque barrier into a hidden wizarding location or version of Paris. Here's the problem; this wizarding location is shown to be so vast in size that it essentially looks like the entirety of Paris, but in a different dimension only accessible to witches and wizards. If this is possible, why is there ever any contact or conflict with the non-magical world? Would wizard-kind not just live in their own dimension, with the whole world as their oyster, completely unencumbered by any need to hide their magic?Towards the end of the film, when things reach a climax and Grindelwald delivers a speech to a huge congregation of witches and wizards, a topic is brought up that feels incredibly out of place and far too insensitive to really make sense in the context of this franchise. In explaining why the magical community needs to do away with their secrecy and take their ""rightful place"" as rulers over non-magical people (or ""Can't-Spells"" as he mentions at one cringeworthy moment), he conjures a vision of World War II, complete with tanks, concentration camps, and nuclear explosions to prove his point. Here are the problems with this: firstly, should we all not then be rooting for Grindelwald at this point? No one wants war, right? Secondly, in highlighting this point (with World War II being something that we know does ultimately happen in the future), does it not throw into sharp focus the fact that the magical community as a whole simply let these wars happen and did nothing to intervene, when they could very well have stepped in to do something about the atrocities that happened in them?Further confusion is also thrown into the mix with the introduction of the blood pact which exists between Dumbledore and Grindelwald; a previously unmentioned MacGuffin tossed in to state very plainly that the two cannot fight one another. Perhaps the aspect of the two being former lovers was deemed not to be a strong or plausible enough reason for Dumbledore's reluctance to make a move against Grindelwald. This seemingly cheap storytelling tactic also brings another question to mind... When on earth did the two make this blood pact? If it was before Ariana's death, it wouldn't make sense as they still fought. It can't have been afterwards either, as Grindelwald fled after the fight. What's the difference between a blood pact and an Unbreakable Vow? Maybe these are answers we'll be receiving in the films to come, but for now, they're very unsatisfying grey areas in the overarching canon.It's concerning that there is this much uncertainty at this point in a franchise that still has another three films to come, and the apathy already setting in for this storyline doesn't bode very well for its longevity. As for the answers to the questions that The Crimes of Grindelwald has left us with, it's yet to be seen what the next film will bring to the table and how it copes with its own struggle to keep the lead characters as relevant as they were in the first film, as the story leans more and more heavily into the history of Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Let's hope that there'll be enough fans still on board to see this story through to the end.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

When Grindenwald takes the house over in England or France and shows a mist of Credence, that there my friends is where the plot is laid. He says it right then. From there you have to put some of the pieces together and figure it out. It's pulling from several angles to come in to a major event. And there are PLENTY of beasts btw. And there are friendships there. Idk what some of you are talking about. No neither of these movies are like the Potters, but they weren't meant to be people.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1248,Syberiyxx,A jumbled mess,1,14 November 2018,This is an unfortunate film.The acting done for Newt continues to be praisable but the package it's wrapped in is as warped and confused as an Obscurus. Characters behave out of character. The character count is doubled and even fewer of them feel alive. It's great to see Newt and Tina again but just about everyone and everything else was garbled by aimless writing. Was this really written by the same JK Rowling who built Harry Potter? You wouldn't know it unless her name was at the top of the credits.I will not be going to theaters again to see what more of a mess the Potter writers cook up.,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1249,jomatt98,A great installment in the series,9,16 November 2018,"So I totally understand where some people are coming from in terms of the plot. How i am choosing to approach this movie is to view it as the second act of a play. I am trying to write this without any spoilers, so I will say this: the overall story thickened and left me hungry for more. If this movie were a standalone with no promise of future installments in the series, I would be sorely disappointed from a plot perspective. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and it left me feeling more excited for the future movies than I was prior to seeing it. The visual effects were absolutely stunning, and the cast all put forth amazing performances. I can honestly say i left the theater just as happy as I was after seeing the first Fantastic Beasts movie. I highly recommend this to everyone.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1250,da-but,A Harry Potter movie for fans,8,16 November 2018,"I loved the original Newt Scamander instalment for its stand-alone nature, you could enjoy it even if you were a casual HP fan. There was nothing in this for non HP fans but that's why I loved it.The movie was visually stunning and the actors have done amazingly well; but what I loved were the inside jokes and the throwbacks to the HP universe we know and the foreshadowing of what we know is coming. The reveals in this movie make it an 8/10 alone.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1251,metallikat75,"Boring, unless you're a diehard HP fan",4,16 November 2018,"It seems I only ever review films if I loved them or thought they were particularly poor, and I'm afraid this film for me falls into the latter camp.I'm not a Harry Potter fan, which is to say that I stopped reading the books halfway through book 5, and have only seen the first 4 films, so am not up to speed on what happens next in the Harry Potterverse. Having lost interest in HP (largely because of the increasingly waffly backstories), I gave the first Fantastic Beasts film a miss when it first came out. However, I caught it on a rainy afternoon on Sky and thought it was wonderful - very different to the HP films, charming, beautiful to look at and with an interesting plot, and it made me want to see more. Which brings me (and brought me to) Fantastic Beasts: the Crimes of Grindelwald.I suppose the first thing to say is: what crimes? I can only wonder if someone misheard the ""rise"" of Grindelwald, because that is what this film is largely about - beyond that, very little happens plotwise in its 2+ hr runtime. We seem to be back into HP film territory, with very little of the charm of the first film. From the gasps and claps of the fans in Hogwarts uniforms in the cinema around me, I can only assume the big reveals about various character's backstories are very exciting for HP fans, but this non-fan really struggled to find a story in this to follow.In the film 'Ed Wood', back when Johnny Depp made mostly good films, Ed eagerly seeks out reviews of his play and seizes on one positive comment that ""the costumes were very realistic"". Most of the 4/10 stars I've given this are for the costume design and cinematography, because it's beautiful to behold, but Johnny's cracking haircut and greatcoat are not enough to save this from being terrifically dull. The Niffler also wins this an extra star - he's possibly the only character from the first film who's given anything to do to advance the plot.Overall I'd have to say HP fans may well love it, but there's not much here for the rest of us.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1252,RijulGarg,Barely Watchable,4,16 February 2019,"I'm not a very avid fan of the Fantastic Beasts world, but I enjoyed the first installment of the movie, although initially I found Eddie Redmayne's (Newt Scamander's) evasive mannerisms mildly cringy. This edition is almost criminally lackluster. It feels like they removed a few scenes from the trailer and called it the film. Jude Law appears in around five scenes. They borrowed the original Harry Potter Hogwarts music, which was mildly enjoyable. The story is shallow as a puddle, precariously cobbled together. Hastily shoved in a couple new ""fantastic beasts"" here and there with any small excuse. Terrible acting/accent by whats-his-name Johnny Depp, the others were alright. The core story itself is indefensibly weak. Humor... I'm trying very hard to remember any. They have not only made a terrible story, but also tried to milk it by cutting it in half and leaving it for another movie. If I were a fan of the book, I'd be furious.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1253,rencouture,Boring and confusing,2,21 November 2018,"I have seldom been so disappointed in a movie. The plot roamed around randomly and did not hold my interest in any way. There were endless scenes of people saying boring things as slowly as possible with the minimum of emotion. The acting was absolutely wooden, although in Johnny Depp's case it was just plain awful. Worst of all, there was not a single character that made me care about them. I am a huge HP fan, and cannot believe this claptrap is from the same writer. I did like some of the costumes, at least......but not enough to forgive this movie for being utterly tedious!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Gross.,1,4 June 2019,"Not only is this movie plot impossibly complicated as well as incredibly vexing to attempt to follow....With all of their big budget they couldn't afford bras, thick material or apparently heat for any of the female cast. In addition to the top less statues and sterotypical blonde, brunette, light skinned biracial, red head and unnaturally bisty Asian harem the film presents in a conspicuous manner... (even in a plunging spandex costume and THIN satin and white cotton shirts and shirts with slots down to the nipples) every woman seems devoid of any kind of support. You will intimately know the shape, hang, nipple position and every point and bump contained therein for at least 4 female characters. It may as well be shot entirely in a strip club.

I love it when a film draws you in so much you forget where you are and to be honest that was all down to the acting the cast are superb but the performances of Depp and Law as Grindelwald and Dumbledore are top echelon even they have to take a back seat to Eddie Redmayne his subtle impassioned performance of the magizoologist is the thing that left me most breathless truly Oscar worthy .

1260,summer-gilgallon,"For the hardcore Potter fan, this movie is a marvel",9,18 November 2018,"If you haven't READ the entire Harry Potter Series more than once you won't appreciate the nuance of this movie, but to the die hard Harry Potter fan or Potterhead, if you will, this movie gives birth to the politics, rhetoric, hate, trauma, and regret that spurn the Hitler-esque confrontations between Voldemort's Death Eaters and Dumbledore's Army that ultimately result in the tragic albeit satisfying conclusion of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.Eddie Redmayne and Johnny Depp take on their characters with absolute conviction and enough quirkiness to invoke real wizards living in a world where they cannot reveal themselves.The beasts in this movie are an afterthought but bring enough whimsy to create a fantastical setting that once again drew me into this world where I have always wished I could have grown up. I loved meeting Nicholas Flamel and I loved being wrong about Lita and Queenie even though I was heartbroken for both.My one complaint is that even though I have read the entire series multiple times, I am still confused about who Credence really is. Gryndewald tells Credence that he is a Dumbledore and Dumbledore himself references losing a sister while talking to Lita Lestrange but the babies that were swapped on the boat were both boys, so the baby lost to the ocean when the boat sank wasn't Dumbledore's sister. So who was it?To be honest I don't care yet because JK Rowling is a master and would never leave us hanging. She will explain it all in the next installment and I will wait with bated breath.

The identity of Credence changes several times through this movie. He's seriously Dumbledore's brother! The way that Grindelwald can pull people in to his cause by using their deepest insecurities....like Queenie. The subtle connections to the Harry Potter series...like Diggory who comes to take Grindelwald back to Europe. The complicated twists of Leta's past and how everything comes to light in the cemetery. The connection between Dumbledore and Grindelwald is an interesting aspect. It makes you wonder, especially after finding out everything about Dumbledore's past in the Harry Potter series. Those that watched this movie and claimed it had no plot must have expected it all to be blatantly obvious. You really needed to pay attention to every detail. I thought it was a great movie.

The biggest fault of this movie was how easily characters die and eventually at the end when one of the main characters whom was introduced close to the start of the film dies, i'm pretty sure everyone was just feeling like 'eh...' Hogwarts seemed so deserted with only 2 teachers and a small number of students shown in a couple of scenes, not to mention the ministries of magic which had an absence of completely any aurors in the climactic parts of the film, eg. Cat with crazy, glowing eyes. It could just be me, but the part where the black guy was talking about his past was so hard to understand too, which makes it tough to get how the character's lineage all connects with one another. I was also unclear about who the first villain at the start was too ( the guy who was able to hide within the walls).

1278,barna-rabai,Character building at its finest.,8,20 November 2018,"Are you going to watch this film for the plot? Not in a traditional sense.Now, I am no Harry Potter fan. Far from it. I semi-hated the first movie. The first film was all over the place Winnie the Pooh meets Film Noire. Well we got over that, which is a bliss.Fight scenes are like watching transformers shape shift, but that is hip nowadays so whatever.Camerawork and setup is strange at times. In a coffee scene an extra seems to be talking to herself, and some hand shake was added to another scene, which was really unnecessary (you WILL notice).
But these are few and far between.Regarding characters, oh my god the characters! You get it all. The evil guy is evil, but if you did not know he was evil, you would be behind him shouting freedom in a heartbeat! The good guys are not unbearable, the shades of grey characters are beautiful. Dress design is marvelous! Jonny Depp is no longer Jack Sparrow in my eyes.Dumbledoor is the same as Grindelwald, use people as tools, but he is good... Right? It is a better political drama than House of Cards, beaten by the Expanse only in my eyes. You get behind every single one of the characters, you feel for them, you are torn when to people disagree, and hear and see proof of them drifting apart both certain in their conviction of them doing the right thing.Beautiful character development, if this was a ""story piece"" it would have ruined it for me. Stories are about the people, and this was about the people! How much did the HP plot advance each year! Harry goes to school defeats Voldemort henchman x+1 end of year. (Loved the books, but if you are looking for plot twists lets face it, they are not exactly Agatha Christie)Basically this was empire strikes back, but Darth Vader is everyone's father and Han is also remotely related to Leia. Also Chewbacca is no longer on amicable terms with Han =D, but the good guys may have the plans for the next death star. But you do not care, because Yoda is a sith now.I love how right Grindelwald is! He is obviously evil, but never once lies! He is the perfect dictator building power on fear funded in reality. It does not make him right, but he is not wrong either. Love this film, gona watch again.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1281,johnodel-801-654328,Way too clever for Americans....?,8,20 February 2019,"I'm a big Harry Potter fan and it's good to see the franchise growing up along side of its fans. The crimes of Grindelwald is more a dramatic piece rather than a simple sci-fi fantasy. Warning spoilers ahead or at least a plot explanation for those who find themselves confused.
Newt finds him self covertly back in New York at the behest of Dumbledore where he meets up with his old flame Tina and searches for credence. In the meantime Grindelwald is cleverly escapes his imprisonment in America with the use of poly juice potion and seeks out credence himself (currently living with a circus in Paris). We are introduced to Nagiri who pairs up with credence as they escape the circus and search for his family (and the reason for his abandonment as a child). Madam La'strange divulges her terrible secret involving the death of her brother who was swapped as a child before a tragic accident.
Grindlewald manipulates an ever increasing number of wizards to follow him blindly during an era of muggle/magic prohibition, marking the beginning of the new century. He is protected from persuit by Albus Dunbledore, the only wizard strong enough to defeat him (and his former partner) through the use of a blood bank, forming an unbreakable vow to never harm each other. Queenie is seduced by Grindelwald into leaving Jacob and following him in his bid to overthrow the rulers of the magic world.
Grindelwald draws together his followers in the Paris cemetery and promises a new and better world and whilst his followers spread the good news he murders everybody opposed to him including madam La'strange, the fiance of newts brother.
Creedence now seems fully under the control of Grindelwald appears ready to do battle with Dumbledore who we are told is his brother.
The film definitely appeals to a young adult rather than a child audience. I find its plot twists intriguing and engaging and the special effects simply stellar. In my mind this is a great extension to the Harry Potter story albeit one for a slightly older audience.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The story revolves around Credence's search for his true identity, and how does Grindelwald benefits from it (perhaps that's one of his crimes).
Plus we really see, why he gets so many followers, all over the world. And I prefer him over Voldemort. He's a real mass seducer, with a more ""sensible"" designing goal.Johnny Depp and Jude Law were incredible!!! I only wish we had more Dumbledore in the movie, (not however that it was only for a couple of minutes, like Depp, in the first movie, but WE WANT MORE...).
The original cast was as good as in the 1st movie.

It's was going to be a filler movie... then halfway through it I just feelt kinda the same as I did in the first movie. I didn't think the movie was doing anything new or different compared to the first one. And the plot just kinda feels forced throughout the entire movie. Like the characters just happen to stumble upon main plot points.And the security in these movies. It feels like its so easy to break in anywhere or go somewhere or corrupt that, why is it that it never improves in any of the movies??? Why is it that it feels like anyone just breaks in anywhere? Why isnt there spells to counter that? Why isn't there like a anti polyjuice forcefield in the ministry of magic or any other place that needs to be secure? Anyway the movie isn't bad, just meh... If you don't like Harry Potter you might like this, probs not because its convoluted with alot of different characters.

I saw many reviews that said that they hated because it didn't expand the wizarding world and that there were not too many new characters but I think that's all BS basically. Finally, one franchise that did not make the mistake of becoming a Hollywood BS movie. I was afraid that we might see a movie with overly cute creatures and with half-funny jokes. (Aka the new Star Wars).
This movie was dark and an obvious preparation for the following movies where we actually learnt quite a lot about existing characters.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1296,danielbeutel-db,Wow!!!,10,18 November 2018,"As a biiig HP-Fan I was a little bit dissapointed from the first part from 2016. There was too less Harry Potter and too many gags. Crimes of Grindelwald finds this balance much better. The movie is more serious and more adult-like, just like the later Harry Potter movies.I can not understand, how others can give this movie only 4 stars out of 10, with the reason, that there is too much plot and too complicated characters! Dear people: that makes a good movie!!! Go and watch Transformers or Fast and Furious Part 23.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The black sheep in the family NEVER MENTIONED in any Harry Potter media. Oh, and he's gonna be Grindelwald's right hand man? I'm guessing Rowling just didn't have time to fit his character in to any of the books or movies. Just the studio creating a different plotline to make money instead of using the established cannon. Not to mention Newt Scamander was completely arbitrary, there was no need for him or the ""Fantastic Beasts"" titling.

1298,maiajay13,More focused on franchise building than telling a good story!,4,15 November 2018,"As both a lover of the Harry Potter Universe and a lover of movie going, I was thoroughly disappointed, even angry with this movie. While the visuals are as magical as ever, it's clear that the filmmakers are so distracted by trying to build a franchise that they're forgetting to actually tell a good story! The chemistry between our main four heroes was diluted by so many new characters being introduced. With so many new people and also so many questions for our old heroes, there wasn't enough time for any kind of (explainable) character development or for the viewers to connect with anyone on the screen. The only ""character development"" with one of our main heroes felt random and out of character and we aren't given much reason or warning for this change. I was also very disappointed with the writing behind Tina's character as her role was demoted from a strong willed Auror and woman to merely a side kick and love interest. Huge and important elements of the story were left for us only to assume what had happened when discussing the one year time jump between the two films (like the Jacob/Queenie relationship, Jacobs memory, etc.). As a whole, the film screamed ""money hungry"" and ""franchise building"" rather than letting us really connect with the characters. It also seemed as if they were only adding in twists that would surely get a reaction from viewers despite the fact that they not only discredited the original Harry Potter films, but just felt like unrealistic and a little too convenient! In short, as a huge fan of the Harry Potter Universe, I was disappointed, upset and felt really let down, and as a film goer, I was confused with the plot and frustrated with the lack of character connection and development! The only reason I have given a 4/10 instead of a 1 is for Eddie Redmayne's perfect execution of the shy, socially awkward but loveable and charming Newt Scamander and for the alluring performance from Jude Law's Dumbledore who leaves us wanting to know more of his history! But in the end, it was a huge disappointment as a stand-alone movie.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

All of the actors did an incredible job especially Mr. Law. I never got the Johnny Depp casting decision until the final moments of the film and let me tell you they are intense! He plays that role perfectly. Definitely geared towards an older audience as the tone of the film is a bit more serious. I guess people are still wanting to see 10 yr Harry running around.

The whole premise of this the movie confused me and I thought it was going to be about Grindelwalds crimes but I can honestly say I don't think they even touched that. The movie feels like a random sequence of events slapped together with a confused and lost story line. Characters randomly pop up and then are gone without a trace and others appear for no reason and are somehow attached to the ""main"" story line. It really felt like this movie was made to pander to Harry Potter fans with the references to Hogwarts, Nicholas Flemel, Minerva and other pieces here and there.

1315,Tom0610,"Stunning movie, but where was the plot..?",6,14 November 2018,"Let me start off by saying that I am a big Harry Potter fan; I loved all 8 HP movies, and really liked the 1st installment of Newt's adventures as well.
This movie just didn't really do the trick for me. There was absolutely nothing to complain about visually; the movie was even more stunning than the first one, with even more beautifully designed 'Beasts'. And as many other people have mentioned, as a Harry Potter fan, you just can't hate this movie. Where Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them only contained a handful amount of references to the Harry Potter series, The Crimes of Grindelwald has tonnes. Enough to hype up any Harry Potter fan.The problem this movie had for me was its plot, or rather, its almost nonexisting plot. This movie just seemed to serve as background information or something for the upcoming movies in this series (for which we'll undoubtedly have to wait another 2 years or more..), more of like a setup for things to come. It introduced many new characters and revealed certain things about already known characters. But yet, some of these things just felt unnatural, as if JK Rowling just kept writing more and more to squeeze into 1 movie. This basically leads to a movie where the biggest plot is to find Credence's 'true identity' - not really much of a plot at all. Some of the reveals about characters also seemed a bit strange, but that could be just me. All in all, all this dialogue about characters made it extra confusing to know what the movie was about, in addition to it lacking much of a plot to begin with.This movie is definitely not a waste of money or anything, you could just buy a ticket for the stunning scenes and you'd be satisfied. It's just that this movie was quite a disappointment compared to many people's expectations I think, seeing as it basically is just a setup for the upcoming movies, which lacks a good plot.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The acting did a good job although the script doesn't allow for anyone to standout apart from Johnny Depp, who seems to make audiences aware of the fact that he's Johnny Depp every once in a while.
Overall, I feel this movie will be better received when its sequels come out, but mediocre as it stands.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1319,amyeastwood,Great installment to the series *spoiler heavy review*,10,17 November 2018,"Lots of spoilers ahead!!!
Fantastic beasts was a brilliant film. I loved the Harry Potter series both books and films but I felt the films left out lots of plot lines bc the directors didn't want to waste time with development. Fantastic beasts doesn't do this. Some people don't like the film for this reason but for a second installment in a 5 part film series I think you have to expect a lot of ground work being laid and the beginning development of the series overall plot. This film was just as magically as the first with interesting new animals, favourites from the last mixed in with new information and references to the Harry Potter movies. We also start to get more tidbits of dumbledores life which is great and lots of things to look forward to in the third film particularly with Queenie and Credence. I would've liked there to be more references to dumbledores and Grindelwalds past relationship but at least there were two subtle ones even if they were tiny. Better than none at all. I would've liked to see more of Nagini but I suspect we will in the third as she's mainly only introduced here and I suppose that would've been too much time dedicated to minor characters. Eddie Redmayne was brilliant and I want more interactions between dumbledore and newt. I LOVED the short snippets in hogwarts and I loved that the uniforms were different went dumbledore was only a teacher rather than head master, only a small thing but made it more realistic (well for a fantasy film). This film was just as magical as the last with new animals as well as old favourites and really impressive spells. The opening was unbelievable and how dark and evil grindleward is really comes across. Drowning people in a carriage in the first 15 minutes?!?!? Also how he brainwashes people and convinces vulnerable people to join him is really interesting J.K. Rowling really doesn't shy away from deep topics. Watching this film with the fact that this series was much inspired by WW2 makes the storyline even more impressive.
Brilliant sequel to the last film and installment to the series. It answered a lot of questions while also bringing up new ones. Can't wait for the next one.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The only thing which might have been an issue to some is the fact that there were too many storylines at the same time. I remember at one point I was literally like ""Wait, wait....wait a minute"". Although for me this was not an issue at all I can see why it was difficult for some people to follow.
Now about the movie as a whole, it's not only for hardcore Harry Potter fans, you could easily understand what's going on and in the end the viewers make the connection and are left absolutely speechless, wanting for more.

I loved the books (movies were okay), and I loved the first Fantastic Beasts movie too because it was such a refreshing take on the Wizarding World. I was really looking forward to Crimes of Grindelwald when I heard that Dumbledore will be involved, and he is a character I've come to admire over time. So I got a ticket for advanced screening and my first impression of the movie was it's busy. There were many new characters and they were all doing their own thing onscreen; I think it helped that I read up on some interviews and knew who most of the new characters are. People going in cold will probably be caught a little off guard, especially since we don't have novels to fall back onto and fill the gaps in, like we did with Harry Potter. And of course, there was that big twist at the end that raised a lot of ire with fans because loyal Potterheads like their canon in tact. The Cursed Child proved that Rowling was willing to sanction a universe where all sorts of characterizations and rules as established in canon can be broken. Why won't she try it again here? Another problem with this movie was that it's so heavily edited. I definitely thought the pacing too hectic, and quite a few scenes that should have emotional impact felt a bit empty because we as audiences had no time to sit on it. Even the second time when I watched CoG again, I was on the verge of feeling something for Leta's character, but it got disrupted too soon.Despite all the flaws in the CoG, I did like many things about it too: the acting (most of the cast was superb, I especially enjoyed Redmayne's Newt and Law's Dumbledore), the visual spectacle, the soundtrack, and the sheer magic of being back in the Wizarding World again. While CoG suffers from being too much of a set up movie for the next installment, I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and see the franchise to the end before I pass judgment. Rowling has proved she could be a supreme architect before; let's see if we can witness that magic again.By the way, the movie does improve with repeat viewings. I noticed many details that I missed when I saw it the first time, and because I knew what was coming this time, it was just a much more enjoyable experience the second time.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

It became very clear to me that J. K. Rowling has sold out in order to keep making money, so she will just write whatever slop will attempt to keep the story going. I laughed out loud during some parts of the movie because of their ridiculousness. There is also a weird political undertone that does not work at all. All in all, The Fantastic Beasts franchise will get no more of my money, and I am deeply saddened by the turn the franchise has taken due to their money grubbing.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Yes this movie is belongs to the Wizarding World created by JK Rowling, it's linked to Harry Potter series but way far away from being a Harry Potter like movie. It's dark themed, it's a movie about a dark wizard not about a tale of a orphan kid. The previous movie Fantastic Beasts and where to find them is the beginning but this one is making the plot for upcoming movies. So it is very important for the upcoming movies.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

But, entertaining and a good add to the series.",6,22 November 2018,"This movie threw me for a loop as i found myself becoming bored and really confused through most of the movie until the end. If you're a huge potter fan and have read the books this movie is much easier to follow. However, if you are more of a light hearted fan and just watch the series for the entertainment you'll find yourself in a very confused frustrated state. This movie IS NOT the big reveal to the series you might be hoping for. It is however pretty much a set up for the next ones. So if you can handle a set up that comes after the first movie, which is also a set up, then you'll enjoy this movie. Other than that i say go ahead and watch this, because the next movies are going to rely heavily on this movie and he people that are introduced. The reviews that trash this movie are not completely accurate, but instead are frustrated people like i was because of the expectation of a big action packed movie.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1351,pettersensam,Continuity Errors through out! Spoilers!!,3,16 November 2018,"So I am a Harry Potter fan, I enjoyed all the previous films, the things cut out or changed in those films would annoy me. However, those films were written by other writers based upon the books. This movie was written by JK herself and it breaks many of the historical creations she came of with. For example, giving Dumbledore a made up sibling for the sake of drama. I am fine with adding things to a story that werent mentioned in the past, but the creation of Credence and him being Dumbledore's younger brother, (not Aberforth) is impossible. The timeline does not add up or make sense. The majority of the movie felt more like a cash grab. There were scenes where you can blatantly see the creators wrote in to directly reference the Harry Potter films from the past. There were times where I felt like they were saying, ""DONT FORGET THIS IS HARRY POTTER, OH YEAH REMEMBER THIS IS HARRY POTTER!!""Continuity complaints aside, the main characters from the first one were completely irrelevant and useless in this movie. The beasts were cool, but Newt was not the hero, he didnt fight anyone or stop anything from happening, he was just sort of there. I enjoyed the first movie for what it was, but this movie should have just been a Dumbledore Grindlewald movie. The other stuff wasnt needed at all.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1361,deonphilip-47357,Not as good as the first one!,3,1 December 2018,The movie started well and built off a string reputation with the first one but fell flat. I thought long and hard about why and I've come up with a few things. Firstly there are too many characters with too much assumed knowledge this distracts from the story as it pulled me out of the narrative. Secondly there is the question of why credence would follow grindlewald. He never gives us or credence a solid reason.There is also the issue of superfluous scenes and story lines such as the queenie one which convoluted and diffused the emotion of the movie.Just my 2 cents.,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Grindewald is a great villain , with Jonny Depp perfoming really well - I found him perhaps more compelling than Voldemort.

I surely didn't see them - but then again all the talking in the movie did steal my time... I am very much a fan of all Harry Potter, but FB is not at all as well conceptualized. The film is confusing and boring partly because there are so many small stories in it that has to be explained elaborately to us; who is Credence, the relationship betw Grindelwald and Dumbledore, the relationship btw Leta & Credence/Newt/Kuma, why is Jacob & Queenie involved, what is Grindelwalds purpose/story etc. Too much! Alas, we never hear why Newt is so speciel for the story - he kind of disappears in the large gallery of characters. On the positive side, it is really fantastic to see the fantastic beasts; I just wish they were more involved in stead of just show cased. And the name dropping/involvement of future HP characters is also interesting.

1373,yuliadominic,How magic regressed horribly in 20th century,5,2 December 2018,"The light and truly magical atmosphere of the first movie completely vanished in this sequel. Everything was just not enough, not enough fairytale, not enough keeping up with cannon, not enough drama if they wanted to give us drama....
Johnny Depp truly shines in franchises where the setting can be influenced by and be adapted to his character, but that's definitely not the case. The world of HP is so big, detailed and established everything that was needed was just to fit the part and I think Depp just wasn't a good casting choice for that.
P.S. I can't actually hate a villa that hasn't really done anything horrible throughout the film? Like the name is literally 'Crimes of Grindelvald' and I am yet to notice even one. In the beginning he was getting free from incarceration and possibly tortures, so I don't think that counts as a crime per ce. So what did he do? Essentially from a viewpoint of a wizard he's perfectly right, not unstable or ourspokenly violent, truly wants mostly better future for magical people rather than just a war against muggles like Voldemort did. So what's so horrible about him? Definitely not so much for it to be a title of the movie.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The whole suite of ""main"" characters are forgettable and suffer from being in a film that is literally not about them.The first wizarding war and Grindelwald is an amazing setting for a set of films. I would pay good money to watch a trilogy taking a deep dive into the war and the motives behind it, as well as a deepening and deconstruction of Dumbledore's character. Instead, I have to watch a fairly clueless set of characters getting swept along and seeming confused the whole time.At the same time, I enjoy the beasts aspect, and would love to watch a genuine expedition with Newt.

Recommended for all and must watch for potterheads!,10,18 November 2018,"Crimes of Grindelwald is an amazing movie in which JK bravely introduced new plots and she was spot on. I can't understand why the critics gave bad reviews to this movie. Only possible reason is that they never read the HP books or they didn't understand the movie (though it was all well connected if attention is paid). The CGI was spot on, Johnny Depp was amazing as Grindelwald and we could see a stark difference between Grindelwald and Voldemort. People feared Voldemort and even his name. He forced people to join him or killed them. Grindelwald on the other hand persuades people on how his motive and direction is the right one. Jude Law was a perfect Dumbledore filled with confidence and composure. Newt, Jacob and other characters were great as well and the movie was breathtaking for any HP fan. Few critics said that few sub plots were unnecessary or disconnected but I can assure them that in the next 3 movies all those details would become relevant. I highly recommend Crimes of Grindelwald to everyone and a must watch for potterheads!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

The trailers for this film were fantastic and it made me want to see the film from the outset but...The film in itself lacked in substance and plot and in my opinion ended up being a filler between the already released first instalment and the due to release third instalment. The continuation of the previous plot wasn't a bad choice but the execution was sloppy and it made the new characters so detached from the film and forgettable. By no means was the film terrible but it seems to be more of a necessary timeline filler than a great film.My only hope is that the third instalment brings back what the first film introduced as the scene is now set and I'm personally waiting for the redemption of the series to come and blow everyone away.7/10",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

I liked the misdirection and new characters that makes you keep thinking of what they're doing. I'm going to guess they will keep the theme of jumping ahead a few years with the fifth movie being the final battle of Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Could this movie be cleaned up a bit better? Sure but the graphics were amazing. Keep in mind that if this series goes well, the chances of other movies increases. I would love to see a series of the creation of Hogwarts with the four founders.

The little references to McGonnagal and Dumbledore being a DADA teacher? They are just wrong. McGonnagal wasn't suppose to be alive during that time and it was the same with some other things in the movie. I got really frustrated by those errors and the fact that the main characters were just.. doing nothing. I strongly felt that this movie was all about the subplots and side characters and just too much.And the whole Nagina thing? I didn't get it.

The style of the film was well done, and its nostalgia factor was more than enough to keep one engaged. The score added to its allure, but was hardly anything original. There isn't much of a reason for the beasts to be in the film if you think about it, but it's a good thing they are because the heart of the film would sink without them. The development of the most important characters was good, and Newt Scamander ranks up there with some of the classic Harry Potter characters after this movie. While the style is undeniable, the plot was muddled enough to lull the casual fan to sleep, and canonically distorting enough to infuriate the diehard fan. You'll walk out of this film and try and recant what you just watched, and you'll find yourself lost for words, not out of awe but because, well, nothing really happened. The first film succeeded by adding to the Harry Potter universe without detracting from the magic of the originals; this one went out of its way to taint their good name.

1404,kennzabennz,There is a lot I loved about this movie,9,25 December 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Based on its cinematography, acting, costume design, special effects, and musical score, it is one of my favorites of the Harry Potter franchise. I enjoyed many of the tender/tense moments between characters (eg ""salamander eyes""); I liked the themes of identity having more to do with what we choose to do next rather than where we come from; and I very much enjoyed seeing more of the main villain. Two movies in and we have already had more screen time with Grindelwald than we did with Voldemort after eight movies.I also think this installment made improvements from the first Fantastic Beasts movie. The creatures were integrated more naturally; the story was cohesive; the effects were even more spectacular; Newt was awkward AND likeable; Jude Law was introduced as Dumbledore (ie spot-on casting, when it seemed impossible to find a perfect fit); it dared to be more emotionally poignant with storylines like Leta's; and the music not only matched the tone of the film but accentuated it.I can understand some of the criticisms of the film (eg frustration over the lack of closed story arcs, or wasted efforts to be more inclusive), but others don't make sense to me, such as the complaint that the storyline is confusing, or that it was an ""information bomb."" I was accompanied by my parents and a brother who know very little about the Harry Potter universe, and while they didn't get to enjoy some of the cameos/references as much as I did, they were still able to easily follow along, having seen the first movie.Overall, I think it was a great movie, and most of its shortcomings have more to do with the fact that it is the second of five films, versus any deficit on the part of the filmmakers. When seen more like an episode in a series rather than a standalone film, I can better appreciate it. If that wasn't what you were hoping for, then I can see how it might not have satisfied your expectations. And I don't disagree, it probably could have done more to be a standalone film. But, in the end, its failings were not enough to overshadow what was a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience for me. I look forward to where the story - and characters - will go from here now that the setting has been so firmly established.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Yes, there are plot holes (Mcgonagall, Corvus being Rodolphus's dass name (could've been a different Circus though, there were at least three)) but look at this as a part of a whole. This movie is not meant to stand alone. It is only number two of FIVE. This movie had brilliant characters. Leta was wonderful and helped us tap into the earlier, developmental sides of Newt. Theseus was wonderful, giving us a Percy Weasley vibe that thankfully seems to work out in the end. Nagini was so caring of Credence, it will be incredible to see where the movies go with her. And Newt. Newt is a beautiful portrayal of the autism spectrum. This movie shows his growth to becoming more delevoped in his personal connections through Leta and Dumbledore. You can even tell how much he has developed from the last movie just in his personal connections with Tina and Jacob. This movie is wonderful, and I would recommend to everyone.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

Loved the movie!!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1409,jemryan,"Bad plot, bad characters, bad themes.",4,28 November 2018,"This movie can be summarised as convoluted and eventless. It introduced too many characters who contributed nothing to the story; an example is Bunty. I guess we are supposed to gather that Bunty helps look after Nute's pets, she is introduced, used to emphasise Nute's skills with monsters by comparing it to her own lack thereof and then she is gone. One scene, poof! . It is almost suggested that she is in love with Nute, but then we never see her again. That's not the only hint at romance stuffed into this movie, in fact- there are two others! Is Nute a quirky, beast obsessed nerd or a player?Subplot upon subplot caused the audience to be confused; it wasn't until 3/4 of the way through the movie that the audience could gauge where the story line was actually headed, it was completely lacking in any direction. Movies based on this brilliant Harry Potter world should be kept simple. Producers and writers need to celebrate spells, magical beasts and the excitement of a secret magical world. Do not undermine this with your convoluted storylines and subplots which ultimately detract from the main attraction-magic. Celebrate the magic, not the mysterious identity of 'Credence Barebone'. Not the pointless and random backstory of Leta Estrange, Yusuf Kama and his stupid vow to avenge his family by killing Credence which never actually happens, what was the point? For a Harry Potter fanatic this was unbearably frustrating. Another huge problem with this movie was the constant changing of settings from New York, to London, to Paris. As if the producers were saying, 'hey we have this huge budget! Lets impress the audience by changing the setting every 15 minutes! and having french speaking witches and wizards!' It drew away from the attraction of the movie, and again only served to confuse.The one action scene in the movie was horrendous; it was far fetched and boring. Shame on the producers for giving Nicholas Flannel, Nagini and Minerva McGonaggal such measly and ridiculous features in the movie, it was a total cop out. If you are not going to credit these wonderful characters with the profound characterisation that they deserve, don't bother including them at all, it is insulting. From the title of this movie I was hoping for a dark and obscure story surrounding Grindelwald's crimes. Instead we were offered another mind numbing clique, the main character has to beat the bad guy or the whole world will end. Such a storyline is atrociously inconsistent with the Nute we got to know in the first Fantastic Beasts, he is not a conventional hero, don't try to make him one. People might argue- yes the story is incomplete and the many subplots were necessary for what will unfold as an epic tail in future movies. I reject this notion; do not tease us with a poor movie filled with stupid subplots just so that you can make more movies and exhaust the most possible money out of us. We want stand alone, solid movies which celebrate magic and build on the brilliant ideas first pondered by JK; do not ruin the Harry Potter world the way they ruined Star Wars.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1418,jayceebriscoe,Absolute disaster.,2,18 November 2018,"Very, very disappointed. I'm a huge fan of the world that J.K. created, but this film falls seriously flat. The plot was convoluted, there were times that something occured and I wasn't sure where on Earth it was occurring. At times Jacob would just sort of appear on screen and you're left wondering how or why he got there.
The character building that took place during the first movie was completely ignored in this movie. Queenie was enchanting Jacob, when we all know he's head over heels for her, then goes over to Grindelwald for some reason? I hope she's been enchanted. Tina, after falling for Newt in the last one, reads a misprint in a random magazine that Newt is engaged and, rather than sending a letter like any normal person might, freaks out and starts the movie basically hating Newt.
Nagini could be completely removed and nothing would have to chance. She was complete useless in the movie, and the only person who even acknowledges her presence is Creedence.
Lita Lestrange appears, along with Newt's brother, to... What? They could have been removed and that would have made the plot way more concise, rather than introducing new characters just to sacrifice one. I couldn't figure out if I needed to be sad or relieved that her convoluted character arc was over.
Not to mention the godawful twist at the end that, if true, destroys the already established canon.
Overall, the visuals were lovely, but the plot was such a disaster that it was clear this movie exists simply to get to the next one. 2/10 for being pretty, at times.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

It has beautiful visuals, and plot that, in my opinion, serves as bridge to things that will come and it should be observed in that way.

5. Disregards all of the known information about the wizarding worldAnyone that has read or watched Harry Potter would immediately notice that things do not add up. I enjoyed the first movie in the Fantastic Beast series because it was different. If they are going to bring in characters from Harry Potter at least make it historically correct. If this movie did not have the Harry Potter fans it would have been a complete flop. I am very disappointed in J.K. Rowling, this is well below her standards for writting. I think David Yates should have been canned after the the Half Blood Prince movie was released. He managed to butcher one of the best books in the series, this is a repeat of that debacle.

1439,rcaesar-82359,Bloated beyond repair,3,15 November 2018,"Basically everything wrong with the movie can be summed up with its title. Fantastic Beasts. The Crimes of Grindelwald. These two things have nothing to do with each other.In my opinion the faults of this movie date back to the first film, where we had the compelling story of a young wizard named David Attenborough whose animals escaped in New York and he had to find them. Great. Sold. Unfortunately they had to make the film much worse by adding in unnecessary and convoluted subplots about a repressed boy named Credence who could change into a dangerous obscuris. Or something. The filmmakers obviously didn't learn from their mistakes.Anyway, the second movie stars off pretty decent. Eddie Redmayne and Dan Fogler give two great performances, I really bought into their chemistry even more than in the first one. Jude Law is also great as always, though underused. The comedy scenes are also pretty consistently good, adding some much needed levity to this total mess. The visual effects looked great except for the times they looked awful, especially in the Hogwarts scenes which was where the film took a nose dive, never to recover.The rest of the (far too numerous) supporting cast range from average to terrible. When Johnny Depp was revealed as Grindelwald in the first movie it was clear to me that he was totally miscast, and my suspicions were quickly confirmed. Colin Farrell was way better, you hacks. A lot of characters are introduced and have nothing to do, so just stand around waiting for an arc in future instalments.What is this movie about? I couldn't tell you. It's not really about Newt Scamander. It's kind of about Grindelwald, but not completely. The plot is incomprehensible, and there are numerous exposition dumps so dense and laughable I wanted to burst out laughing, and did several times much to the chagrin of my friends. There's also way too much unnecessary fan service. I won't go in to details, I'll let you be offended by it.There's two or three movies going on, and they all have different tones. One is a Fantastic Beasts movie, and it's funny and emotional, one is a dark fantasy movie about Grindelwald, and it's awful. They're all B plots, and for all the stuff in the screen, very little appears to be really happening. Why is Credence a character?? His story was lacklustre in the first one and is even worse here. Add to that an awful climax, and this movie is easily the worst Wizard movie. I don't know why David Yates is still attached to direct future instalments as in my opinion he peaked in 2007.Overall, if you're invested in the wizarding world go see it, you'll probably get a kick out of it. If not, give it a miss. No idea why it's called the Crimes of Grindelwald, because he doesn't really commit many crimes, nor are there enough fantastic beasts in the movie.

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is another great magical adventure.",9,18 November 2018,"The movie kicks things off with an exhilarating chase sequence when Grindelwald breaks free. The film continues to move at a reasonably brisk pace until the middle. The middle is weighed down by much exposition, but is still engaging and entertaining. The film really picks up in the last 20 minutes and ends on an extremely high note with twist after twist. Once the film ends you're left breathless and wanting the third film right away. Easily the biggest downfall of this movie is that it's essentially a setup for what's to come. It has a bigger payoff than the first film though and takes a couple characters in interesting new directions. While, it is a setup movie and one of the slower paced Wizarding World movies, it's a slight improvement over the first film.

Newt, Jacob, Tina, and Queenie are of course awesome as always, and i quite liked Theseus too.

Also the brother relationship between Newt and Theseus was cool. Grindlewald's story developed as i roughly thought it would and i think it's amazing how Rowling has Credence join Grindlewald, with Grindlewald presumably lying about Credence's true identity as Dumbledore's lost brother. Dumbledore and Grindlewald's blood oath was a cool start of a story.
The main character Newt's story was really amazing too. His initial complications with the relationship with Tina and that being the reason he's in Paris at all is really well thought and great.
The Fantastic Beasts of this movie were also amazingly incorporated. Newt using a small insignificant creature, the Niffler to get the most important object in the movie (the blood oath thing) from Grindlewald just blew my mind. The Zouwu was an amazing new beast that was essential for the story as well as the small but important bowtruckle.
All in all this movie just blew my mind and was one of the better harry potter movies in my mind.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

We have been to the cinema yesterday with our daughter (8 years old), and she loved it as much as we do. I have grown up with Harry Potter, now she will grow up with the Fantastic Beasts. How cool is that!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1455,barnitostinson,A fan-favorite,9,14 November 2018,Action-filled and overshadows the first installment totally. Will definitely delight potterheads and probably baffle all others. And Gellert Grindelwald makes Voldemort look like a joke ;D,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1456,crazqian,Giving 10 cuz im a potterhead but...,10,15 November 2018,"The visual and acting are absolutely brilliant. All the actors did such a wonderful job in portraying the depth and complications in their respective roles. Best cast ever.The biggest problems with this movie are the slowly progressing plot, and the many redundant close up shots of the actors. The pace of this movie would be much more audience friendly if they could speed things up a little. But don't get me wrong cuz the background info of the characters are super delicious, and important for the next few movies.All in all, COG felt like the part one to the story that jkrowling really wants to tell, and I'm excited to see how things progress. No one saw that ending coming though.p.s my muggle friends who are not potterheads LOVED this movie and had no problems with following the sub plots.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1457,cchinatti,Beautiful & Intricate,10,15 November 2018,"Let me start out by saying that if you are not familiar with the plot of the Harry Potter books (not movies) and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, you may not understand this movie or enjoy it very much (hence some negative critic reviews). But if you are, this movie will be the best movie you have seen in a long time. Potterheads will love the new canon (especially a big reveal at the end) and in my opinion, this movie is even better than it's predecessor. The CGI and especially the score got better in this movie and I am excited to see how much better they get in the next. The acting (especially Jude Law) was amazing and gave the characters real depth. The plot centers around the themes of choosing sides and discovering family, but there are still some intense action scenes.
The violent action scenes make this the darkest movie in the franchise (Parents, take note), but there are also moments of levity that make this movie a brilliant watch.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1459,labibadina,It leaves you jaw dropping and wanting more,8,16 November 2018,"I think this is the first stage, the gate that open to the real flow of fantastic beasts franchise story. I felt finally another gate is opening other than harry potter. From the first movie I still found myself wanting and searching the connection between fantastic beasts and harry potter, just by the mention of grinderwald name, it got me thrilled. But still didn't impress or impact me so much cause harry potter world still the number 1 in wizarding world for me.But after I watched the crime of grinderwald, i prefer this world, where I think it leads you to the great finally between dumbledore vs grinderwald where I think hermoine has said the greatest match/duel in wizarding world.For plots, i know it's kinda messy, all over the place. Too much to learn, but because I think, this movie is not about just newt, or tina or queenie or jacob. It's about the whole fantastic beasts world, the wizarding world. The plots was all over the place because it shown the development of the character where in the end of the movie it was all about to pick a side!!that was the whole movie is all about.Yeahh it leaves me so many unaswered questiones and even developing bigger amount of questions and curiousity. But i have faith in J.K. Rowling, i know she could do her best like what she have done in harry potter franchise, the books are so wonderfulOne thing that I found really depressing is, I found not a wise decision to spoiler the world about nagini. Because yesss finally we know she is part of the movie. But after it came out, the movie didn't told us anything about nagini. I think after the spoiler nagini's story would be one of the highlight for the story, but I was wrong. If Nagini's story unfold on their next movie I think it was wiser to makr Nagini appearance as another surprise for the movie. But what has done is already doneBut at least I'm totally hooked with the story!!!!!!!I lovee fantastic beasts franchise!!!!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

But it's barely comprehensible - characters appear randomly, disappear randomly, and make little sense while they're there. Worst of all, there's no beginning, middle or end - the film starts half way through a story and ends half way through another, plainly setting up a sequel that will make no sense either.

1462,benegiocoli,Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald Is The Beginning Of An Epic Climax,9,16 November 2018,"Well, that's it. Yesterday I finally got the chance to watch Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald. I half expected a disappointing movie, as I had liked the first one ever more than the Potter series. Reading reviews on the Internet, I got the feeling that a little injustice is being made towards Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald. First of all, it is the second movie of a series of five. In Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them, the basis for a new story had been set. It is clear that this new film aims to develop many threads that are going to be further explained in the future. I agree that the plot sometimes does not match with what we already know from the Potter books and Pottermore, but there is no mistake that can't be fixed. Even things that seem absurd might have a not-so-absurd explanation. There is so much action and so many threads that I am a bit worried about wether the next movies are going to be able to explain everything properly, without making up stuff that does not match with what we know (also because we actually know quite a lot, especially about some characters). Still, in the Potter books and movies many unexplained things are clarified only in the last ""episode"", eventually. I think (and hope) that everything will become much clearer as the series goes on. Therefore, criticizing the lack of explanations in this movie is definitely unfair. J. K. Rowling so far has always proved to be able to develop and explain things properly. For now, we can do nothing but rely on her once more, confident that she'll not let us down. Visually speaking, the movie is a true masterpiece. Visual effects are just great and Coleen Atwood definitely deserves that Academy Award she won for Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find: the costumes are so beautiful and realistic. The soundtrack is very good as well. The true strength of the movie, still, is the acting. I am not a huge fan of Johnny Depp but I must admit that his performance as Grindelwald is stunning. He is simply perfect for the role: there is a scene which clearly shows how a great actor needs nothing but his voice and gestures to ensnare the audience. Jude Law proved to be the perfect young Dumbledore, as he was capable to play the role with respect and yet to add that inner hidden pain and straight talking that are present but softened in the Potter saga, perhaps as a consequence of ageing. Concerning Newt Scamander, here comes the actor who, in my opinion, is the true flagship of the series: Eddie Redmayne. Once again, this young man has given a masterful and impressive rendition of a character not so easy to portray. Newt, as seen in the first movie, is not the typical hero. He is not the chosen one. He is socially awkward and gentle. He is overly shy and lonely. He just has a huge heart and, as said in this movie, he never met a monster he couldn't love. Eddie Redmayne here portrays a man who has gained a bit of self confidence (he is not as timid and twitchy as in Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them) and yet is overwhelmed by insecurities, mainly regarding his love for Tina. There is a bit of Newt Scamander in each and everyone of us, and this is what makes him a great character, whose evolution is going to be very interesting to witness. For once, we have a hero that is not stereotypically strong, clever and brave, but kind, caring and selfless. This is the only thing that I'm going to criticize: we didn't see much psychological analysis of the main characters in the Potter series. Now, in Fantastic Beasts there are such interesting personalities (not only Newt, but also Tina, Grindelwald, Theseus and Dumbledore himself!) and backstories that it would be a pity if they were not deeply analyzed and developed under this respect. I'm not saying that psychological analysis is absent in this movie, but it is more superficial and less important than in the first one. I really hope that we'll see a bit more of it in the future. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald is, taking everything into account, a great movie that can either evolve into something even greater or begin to fall apart into a pathetic seek for coups de théâtre. As I said, I trust J. K. Rowling and therefore have the feeling that this is only the beginning of an epic climax. For now, we can only watch Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald over and over again, trying to figure out if we missed something that could help us understand where the plot is going. It's going to be a long two-year wait.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1464,ryanwatkins-56300,"Ignore the critics, think for yourself!",8,16 November 2018,"SPOILER SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS!!!!!
This is not a perfect film by any means. There are is a lot to try and follow and therefore some of the character's plot lines feel under used and neglected. Additionally, in my opinion they do not provide justification for some very radical changes that occur with some of the main characters from the first movie. That being said, this film for me was very enjoyable. It was creative, subtle, and more cerebral than i think some people wanted. This post WILL INCLUDE SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS!!!!!! you have been warned! So now that I have my complaints out of the way, let me also say that some of the points I am going to criticize that have been made about this movie come from seasoned critics and I am just a lover of the wizarding world and of film. That being said, I am seeing many points being made over and over and I quite frankly find them to be nonsense.1. Grindelwald was not menacing: Depp's performance was exactly what I wanted it to be. He was not some cackling high pitched theatrical villain. He was quiet, charismatic, and intelligent. This is not Voldemort. He is insanely powerful, but his most dangerous ability is in how he influences people. There is scene where he holds a rally with followers. This scene gave me chills because he is so evil, and so violent, but he packages his beliefs in a way that win people over. He convinces normal witches and wizards that all he wants is to keep them safe and in the end even turns Queenie! Yes I will admit, he did not prance onto the scene declaring in a theatrical voice his plan for world domination. Instead he entered quietly, and made even me question if he was really the bad guy. Fantastic.2. The film had no plot: The film's plot was slow certainly, and I understand that will not be for everyone. However, the plot is clearly defined, and if you are unable to pick up on it, it is probably more of an issue with you. It has become clear now that Credence is the center of this adventure with Newt being the heroic eyes through which we see it. In the beginning of this film. Newt meets with Dumbledore, and their discussion in PLAIN ENGLISH, reveals that Dumbledore in his way manipulated Newt into going to New York where he became part of this story. In this film, Newt is openly tasked by Dumbledore to go and find Credence before someone else gets hurt. Additionally after him, is the ministry of magic both American and British, and Grindelwald himself. The film follows the events around all of these different factions trying to find this immensely powerful young man and win him to their side, as well as his journey to find out where he came from. AGAIN, I am not saying this make the plot good, or bad. I am saying it is clear, and if these critics could not pick up on it, that is on them.3. Dumbledore was not gay enough: HOLY LORD people. Jude Law did a great job. He brought the character's slight mischief as well as cunning, and portrayed his inner demons with subtlety and grace. Jude Law became Albus Dumbledore. And yet, in this modern world where we are so obsessed with labels, and social justice, there seems to be a group out there that find Dumbledore was simply not enough in terms of representation of the homosexuality in this film. Again the key word here, is subtlety.There is a beautiful scene where Dumbledore is standing before the mirror of Erised which for those who do not know shows you your greatest desire. He stands before the mirror and sees himself with Grindelwald, locking hands, and spending time together. There are other scenes before this that also lend themselves to this point. I understand and support the desire for minority representation in film. However I also think that when these groups are represented the character should be a human being.4. The newly introduced story is messing too much with the original story: We can keep this one simple. Nope, sorry. You are wrong. JK Rowling is the creator of this entire world and she wrote the screen play. If she comes out tomorrow and says Harry potter is actually half house-elf, you may not like it, but that's how it is. This is her house, we are invited guests.
All of these are of course my opinions, and everyone is entitled to their own. I encourage any fan of this amazing franchise to go and see this film for yourself. Enjoy!",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

I consider myself a series and movie fantast, I re-watched all the Harry Potters, Lord of the rings countless times. I love action, fantasty, crime and mystery.Warner Brother and JK Rowling have now officially lost their minds.
I do not know what they are thinking, if they think people are so amazed at the Harry Potter success that we will watch just anything.Well No more I tell you JK Rowling and Warner Brothers.This movie had no red thread, no meaning, no story, no substance, It was complete lack of action and meaning.
Nothing happened in this movie more than the Harry Potter legacy has been violated deeply but making this rubbish movie into some kind of weird horror movie with AWFUL special affects.
This feels like someone made a freaking parody of the Harry potter world and JUDE LAW as dumledore. get the f out of there.
It contains deeply gross scenes that will not only make you wanna barf but also maybe have nightmares (I'm not kidding).The casting is awful and non of them are suited for it apart from Newt.

I've read and reread the entire books many times and enjoyed most of the movies hp graced us with in the cinemas
For me fantastic beast part 1 was awesome and I watched it numerous times
Now Crimes of Grindelwald when I saw the trailers I was ecstatic :) after seeing the reviews from the premiere release in Paris I was really upset and frankly confused
But nevertheless I booked VIP tickets on the release date and took my 2 kids to watch it
And OMG from the opening scene right throughout till the very end I bloody enjoyed every second of this movie
It was epic beyond epic and had me in awe
The effects and new beasts they introduced was phenomenal at the least
The acting by the entire cast was bang on and newt is officially my fav character in the entire HP universe
The movie was epic and breathtaking and sooo many epic scenes I won't mention just incase I give away spoilers if anyone reading ain't watched the movie yet
For me this was the best HP movie by far

It's opened up so many things to discuss and contemplate over

I will admit that this movie had a couple problems, but let's all remember that this is only the 2nd move in a 5 film franchise. J.K. Rowling isn't going to tell us everything in this film. Many people are upset that Minerva Mcgonagal is in this film when she should not even have been born, but let's remember, J.K wrote the books and the screenplay so she knows what she is doing. Another big thing people having an issue with is Creadence being revealed as a Dumbledore.

Jude Law is good as DumbledoreI liked the nifflerThat's it. Done. There are NO OTHER GOOD POINTS.
Bad points:
firstly the film is titled 'Crimes of Grindelwald'. Apart from the opening scene where he almost drops an old guy in a lake, what crimes did he actually commit?!!Johnny Depp looked like an albino Johnny Rotten. He actually looked better as a bedraggled prisoner! Seriously let himself go whilst on the run.Also what was Johnny Depp's accent supposed to be? Sometimes it was British but other times it did sounded akin to ye old Jack SparrowThe references to Hogwarts just made me even more enraged that someone could destroy my beloved Harry Potter franchise with this one god awful film.Credence is just a moody teenager and I don't care who his mother is.Why were there so many new characters? Like the brother of Lita (or whatever her name is)? How did he add to the plot whatsoever??Why does Jacob find it completely acceptable that his girlfriend has literally drugged him into marrying her? Abusive relationship much!Newt was portrayed as a socially awkward fellow in the first film. In this film he seemed to have developed some sort of disease where his face is permanently screwing his face up whilst looking downwards and mumbling.This film is so long. And boring. And pointless.JK Rowling, and I say this as a huge Harry Potter fan, you need to go live quietly in your mansion and not let anymore HP films be made. Ever.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1489,zhangellen,a bit disappointed,6,25 November 2018,"The ancient chinese beast portrayed in the film is just ridiculous and as a chinese I felt offensive. Zouyu was described in chinese literatures as a legendary creature that is righteous and only appears in a benevolant and sincere monarch. It's fierce as a tiger but gentle and strictly vegetarian. But in the film, this animal just looks stupid( the silky incredibly long tail and huge beast teeth).Despite this, the beginning of the film started with a car chase(wizards' version) which was pretty cool, then I nearly fell asleep towards the ending part because nothing was understandable and as many other reviewers said: too many questions are left for audiences, I understand that they want to make a 3rd one, but this storyline is not so appealing.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

2. What was the point of the Fantastic Beasts other than pure CGI appearances?

Considering J.K. wrote the script and she doesn't atually do that for a living, I think this movie came pretty close to magnificent. The acting was great, the actors were cast perfectly in my opinion, and the special effects were also amazing.
A few things I thought they could have done was giving us just a little more information on what had happened in that space between the movies because Queenie's character changed a lot and I would have liked to see what actually made her give Jacob that love potion and what made her flip out like that.
I also think that there could have been some dramatic music in some places, like when Grindelwald was giving that speech, it would have added some suspense and a bit more excitement for the audience. Even though we sometimes don't notice it, the music in a movie does a lot to set the mood of the audience. It would have had the audience sitting on the edge of their seats, waiting for what Grindelwald said next. That would have been the same for the 'fight' that came after.
Also, I don't get what Leta's purpose was in the movie. I get that she was newt's previous love interest, but she didn't seem to really do a lot. What I mean by that is if you introduce a previous love interest while the main character has a new love interest, there will be some tension, and I don't think they wrote that well enough.
That said, the movie WAS great and I wold definitely see it again.
I also think that Jude Law and Johnny Depp portrayed their characters perfectly. I may just be staying this because I am a ph fan, but I thought that you could see why Grindelwald was doing what he did and you could also see how Grindelwald affected Dumbledore.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1492,fatchris-12625,hit of a sequel,10,26 November 2018,Okay so i went to see this movie knowing that there ha s been horrible reviews and let me tell you i loved it i laughed out loud some times and action is very heavy the magic here is clearly seen and i adored the blonde lady i personally was blown away,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1493,riyantotan,I feel sleepy,1,3 December 2018,"Boring and sleepy plot....plot just spinning around on the characters ,conflicts not interesting enough to be risen, i feel want to go out half show",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1494,Dreamcloud1221,"Waterston, Redmayne and their awful chemistry",2,27 November 2018,"I watched it in 4D and it made the film bearable. Is the plot nonsensical? Yeah, very much so. Did I enjoy having to sit through the awkward and completely lackluster performance from Waterston? No. If she screeched ""Mr. Scamander"" one more time, I would've stabbed myself in the eye with my Icee straw. Does she and leading (?) man Redmayne have chemistry? No. Tom and Jerry had better chemistry than these two honestly. Also surprised by Ezra Miller. Is his character meant to be a whiny man-child or is this his interpretation? I honestly found Jude Law's take on Dumbledore to be the only likeable character. I'll probably sit through the next 3 films just because I HAVE to finish out the saga, but I won't be happy about it, or the acting I'm sure.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1497,thrembrant,Could have been better.,7,28 November 2018,"This movie isn't waste of money or anything, you could just wait for streaming to watch it. The stunning scenes and you'd be satisfied. It's just that this movie was quite a disappointment compared to many people's expectations I think, seeing as it basically is just a setup for the upcoming movies, which lacks a good plot. Where's the risk?",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1498,alexandravujic,Just luv it!,10,3 February 2019,I am big fan of Harry Potter and what a joy to enter again in JK Rowling fantastic world. I really enjoy and I can't wait for more!,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1499,HerbieAtOrbie,What a huge waste of time,2,1 December 2018,"Incredibly disappointing this episode.
I've been waiting for the whole film to finally start a breathtaking story.
But that did not happen.It was as if I were presented with a 16-course dinner, of which I still do not know what I have been eaten. And what the consistency is in the menu.There was no storyline to discover. Nice effects though But we had seen those before.Someone who has no prior knowledge of Harry Potter or jk Rowling has nothing to look for in the cinema. But also the potterheads will find it difficult to detect something of a story or connection. Let alone trace the various characters back into this incoherent whole.I am sorry, very sorry. I would have rather waited a little longer for a part 1 worthy sequel.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1500,christieriderdesign,Boring and forgettable,2,30 November 2018,I have just been to see this movie and already I have forgotten most of it. All surface level filler and a real shame more wasn't made of the fantastic beasts as they truly made the first film shine. Such a disappointment. Even the great casting of Jude law as dumbledore couldn't save it.,Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1501,champapal,"Rowling had the choice between right and easy, but unfortunately she chose easy.",6,1 December 2018,"Am I the only one to read Hogwarts a History? You cannot apparate or disapparate onto Hogwarts grounds! I love watching movies in the historical genre, so when I heard J.K Rowling wrote another biography, I rushed to go watch it with my parents in a muggle movie hall.
The Crimes of Grindelwald has not stuck to the rules and experiences Harry, Ron and I had at Hogwarts. I understand that you were trying to make it flashier for muggles, but muggles (I just recently found out) read the biographies on our lives too!
Another thing I need to clarify is that every spell, potion, or action in magic always has a meaning. When the crowd apparated out of the cemetery was extremely confused. If the crowd could apparate, then why couldn't Newt and Tina. It could be that the Ministry had relaxed the charms or Grindelwalds spells were too strong, but working in the Ministry myself, I can tell you firsthand the security is very strong. It is unlikely Grindelwald had more power. I appreciate how the movie clearly showed the effects of every spell.
Additionally, after 2 movies about the obscureal, I'm still confused about it's role. I understand that you are trying to keep the element of mystery around it, but I think us viewers should have at least a better understanding of what it is. The storyline is alright but I feel as though it is branching off at certain points.
The introduction was very exciting! I was at the edge of my seat while Grindelwald was escaping! After the escapade, I watched as Newt refused the job at the Ministry. I was very curious to why he turned it down. I actually really liked Leta Lestrange! Though I did get into a bit of trouble with Bellatrix Lestrange, I couldn't even hold a grudge against her! She was beautiful, funny, and easygoing. Also I admire how she keeps her hair from being overly bushy! After the Ministry rejection, I watched Newt care for all his creatures. I have a friend, Luna Lovegood, who would love to see all of those fantastic creatures. It was also truly fascinating to see the difference between how Grindelwald gathered his followers, versus Voldemort. Queenie and Jacob's love story is very sweet and I want to see how their relationship blossoms. Overall I give the beginning an A+
After the introduction, that's when I felt the story spiraled out of control. Firstly, they didn't put much background on Nagini and Credence. That made me a bit puzzled. Secondly, the character of Yusuf came very suddenly and didn't put the amount of impact he was supposed to have in the story. Lastly, Dumbledore version as his younger self was perfectly portrayed. I just feel as though we could have learned a bit more about his relationship with Grindelwald. I was so curious to know after Rita Skeeter published that horrible book about him. For Dumbledore development, Rowling had the choice between right and easy, but unfortunately she chose easy.
I love that J.K Rowling is giving Grindelwald some attention in the form of a movie. It's so fascinating to learn all about him! But as a muggleborn, the magical world was very special to me, so I would hate for other kids like me to get the wrong understanding. Thank you for reading my opinion on this movie.
Sincerely,
Hermione Granger, Minister of Magic",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1502,carstengomes-30122,Nice Movie to watch,6,8 December 2018,"Let me start off by saying that I am a big Harry Potter fan; I loved all 8 HP movies, and really liked the Fantastic beast and where to find them.But Fantastic Beast and the Crimes of Grindelwald movie just didn't really amuse me. There was absolutely nothing to complain about visually; the movie was even more stunning than the first one, with even more beautifully designed 'Beasts'. And as many other people have mentioned, as a Harry Potter fan, you just can't hate this movie. Where Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them only contained a handful amount of references to the Harry Potter series, The Crimes of Grindelwald has tonnes. Enough to hype up any Harry Potter fan.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1503,appelsientju,Spend way to much money on special effects...,2,16 December 2018,"There is a lot of magic use. Like alot! That's about every thing you will notice.
Almost no fantastic beasts, and no story line. The only thing this movie does is confuse you. When you expect something like part 1 you will be very disappointed. At least I was.I'm a fan of Harry Potter (books and the movies). I also liked part 1 of the fantastic beasts, but this is just a wasted of money.I really admired how well Eddie Redmayne played Newt. He kept the movie from falling apart. So that's why it's a 2 for me and not a 1.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1504,pedroalmeida-98121,just don't understand major public reaction to this movie,9,16 December 2018,"I'm an addicted to the magic world brang by J.K.Rowling and i think this movie was great. I've seen all the type of comments saying this movie underperform due to the plot. I totally think otherwise. Plot is really good. Is a progression on the final Harry Potter movies. There is an interesting plot concerning things that really matter for the Harry Potter universe as the life of Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and other details we only are able to understand now. This marathon has everything to go really well in further movies and in my belief it can even be better than Harry Potter itself.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1505,randomzeldafanag,I would say that I disliked it...,4,20 February 2019,"...but that would require me to know what was going on. I watched the first Fantastic Beasts and enjoyed it. The story was fairly easy to follow. Not so here. The main problem is in the title. Both the Fantastic Beasts and the Crimes of Grindelwald aspects had their own stories to follow, and they just didn't quite connect. Add that to far too many subplots to follow, and you get a big confusing mess. This movie was more like a bunch of TV show episodes. Every time you think you know who the story will be about, it's suddenly about someone else.
I really wanted to like this movie. I love the wizarding world. But it just went in too many directions at once to form any cohesive story. It definitely wasn't worth a trip to the theater, but may be worth buying on home video if you absolutely must see more of your favorite characters.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
1506,nabilasidat,Total waste of time,1,24 December 2018,"I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan and haven't seen all of the films but I thought this would be a good movie to watch with a friend who grew up loving the series.Nevertheless, we go into the theatre and commence to wasting two hours of our time.This movie made no sense at all. It just slips from one scene to another. There's never an actual point in the movie where I felt like I knew what was happening. And there's no semblance of a storyline. It just doesn't make sense.I still cannot tell you what happened. And I saw the entire thing from start to finish.And it's a shame too. The special effects and graphics are top notch. And the acting was superb. The big name actors all wasted their time associating themselves with this garbage movie.If I could rate it any lower, I would.Don't waste your time. Run.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1511,kdl-51216,Disappointed: No Plot and added nothing to the story line.,2,2 February 2019,"It doesn't address the crimes of Grindelwald at all. It shows him continuing to chase after Credence, and not really anything else. Plus the ending with Credence makes me suspect the rest of the plot and hope they don't follow the route that I think they are going to go with that.Maybe the next ones will be better but I can't think of any relevant details this film provides in the progression of the over all story line. So essentially, we're stuck at the first movie.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald

1513,ibrahimqureshae,"Visuals GOOD, Plot BAD",4,25 February 2019,"I am a huge huge harry potter fan, the visuals and the beasts were very well made , overall the visuals were right on point, better than any Harry potter movie. The acting was top notch, especially when johnny depp is around. Now coming towards the plot, the movie seemed like a movie where the ground is being set for the upcoming movies. It had a very weak plot with story too slow at some instances while develops too fast at some points, story was confusing too at times, overall if somebody watches this movie would get that this movie was more about credence searching for his family rather than crimes of Grindelwald. Disappointed with the plot.",Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald
