0,TheLittleSongbird,Returning to Downton,7,21 May 2020,"Absolutely loved 'Downton Abbey' throughout its run and still do when watching repeats, so well made, written and acted (how could it not be with that cast) and not too demanding. It was always one of my most-anticipated programmes every year with each season and more often than not was a yearly highlight. Hearing that there was a film coming out, a large part of me leapt for joy and couldn't wait to see it. Decided though to wait until it was available either online or on DVD, with it not being in cinemas long and being shown at inaccessible times and places.Finally watching it recently with family, also fans, for me it was impressive, polished and very entertaining but a little disappointing at the same time. It is a perfect piece of escapism, so easy to watch, leaves one entertained and charmed and does an awful lot right. If it was a little longer, slowed down and tried to not cram in as much as it did, 'Downton Abbey' would have been even better than it turned out to be.It did feel on the rushed and jumpy side. As a result of being the opposite of too slight (which was what was feared, being worried as to whether the show would lend itself well to feature film). In that the film tried to cram in too much, with too many subplots and characters.Like some others, it did feel like a season's worth of storylines crammed into a two hour film, indicative perhaps of it needing to be 15 minutes longer or two films. Some may not agree but that's my stance.'Downton Abbey' looks great though, very sumptuous and clearly done with a lot of polish. Reminding me of what makes me love period dramas so much. Downton looks imposing and a feast for the eyes, like its own character, and its elegant interiors brings back fond memories of visiting national trusts. The photography is beautifully framed, the costumes evocative of its period and the scenery takes the breath away. The music avoids over-scoring and intrusion and the hypnotic main theme hasn't lost any of its magic. The direction is controlled and doesn't feel too television bound, opening up the drama enough.Writing is witty and heart-warming, the disdainful put-downs from Violet really standing out. The story is never dull and does compel, entertain and warm the heart, despite being over-crowded. The cast are pretty much blameless, complete with all the original cast and a few worthy additions, with Maggie Smith stealing all of her scenes especially. Hugh Bonneville, Elizabeth McGovern and Michelle Dockery (still looking beautiful) are still great and the servants are all played with great gusto and charm. Phyllis Logan standing out.Overall, not great but very nice escapist entertainment that is impeccably acted and handsomely mounted. 7/10",Downton Abbey
1,SnoopyStyle,nice continuation for the fans,8,13 December 2019,It's 1927. The Royals are coming. They plan to spend overnight at Downton while on their tour. The downstairs grow frustrated as they are pushed aside by the Royal servants. Lady Mary recruits back retired Mr. Carson. She is also concerned about Tom's Republican views as she organizes the parade. This is a nice continuation of the beloved TV show. This is great for all its fans. It won't be quite as compelling for everybody else but I doubt those people would watch this anyways. The only thing I missed is the opening with the dog. I see the cinematic nature of this film but I would have loved to see the same opening. It's great to visit Downton once again.,Downton Abbey
2,Hitchcoc,Nice Final Episode,8,23 September 2019,"While far from a perfect film, this nicely takes the concluding chapters of the TV show and lets us see the principle characters one more time. When it is announced that the King will be coming to Downton, everyone springs into action. All the silver is polished and all the rooms made ready. The problem is the staff of his royal highness is being brought on board and they are rude and inconsiderate. So the downstairs folks find a way to rebel. We also see the fate of Downton when the Crawley's are no longer there. I won't go into detail. The cinematography is gorgeous and each character receives a kind of closure. Maybe it's a bit contrived, but it still works quite well.",Downton Abbey
3,mark.waltz,Bring Kleenex and be prepared to sob while laughing.,10,22 September 2019,"The fate of perhaps the most beloved character is revealed in a twist towards the climax of the first feature film based upon the beloved TV series that remains a modern classic. The movie is cinematic in every way, and practically everyone tied over from the original gets a great moment in the spotlight. It's funny, romantic and moving, showing the triumph of a great family thanks to the loyalty of the staff, even in a changing world.The story focuses on the pending visit at Downton Abbey by the royal family, King George and Queen Mary, insinuating abuse for their daughter, Princess Mary from an emotionally distant, older husband. The Queen's lady in waiting, Imelda Staunton, is a distant relative of the Crawley's without an heir so Lady Grantham (Maggie Smith) wants to ensure that her estate is bequested to the Crawley's. But she has a secret, and it doesn't bode well for Violet's desires.Stauntin's ladies maid (Tuppence Middleton) is a sweet young lady who helps bring Tom Branson (Allen Leech) out of the shell he's been in since the death of Sybil seven years before, and his romantic demeanor is perhaps the most touching element of the film. The way he looks at her is filled with complete awe as he deals with his continued conflict over being married into a family he doesn't respect politically but has come to love irregardless.It's nice to see sisters Edith and Mary getting along better, making attempts to communicate in spite of years of animosity. The memory of Sybil is still strong. The scenes between the wonderful Dame Maggie Smith and Dame Penelope Wilton continues strongly, although it would have been very moving had Violet confided with Isobel over the sad secret she shares with Mary. The reunion of Dame Maggie with Imelda Staunton from the Harry Potter series is very touching, and there's a sweet vulnerability about Staunton that makes her truly memorable.Downstairs, the highlights are Thomas's change from schemer to noble, dealing with his homosexuality and getting a memorable twist involving his bust in a raid on a gay get together. The world's oldest gay virgin is completely reformed and for the first time, he's involved in situations where the audience roots for him to be happy.A bulk of the film's footage deals with how the downstairs staff deals with the imperius staff of the king and queen, and this results in some truly hysterically funny situations. You can't help but laugh at the silly looking hairstyle of the king's prized chef and Kevin Doyle's hysterically funny emotions concerning the king and queen's presence. While Daisy, Mrs. Pathmore, Mrs. Hughes and Carson each get some small stories, there isn't much for the Bates to do. But what's there is perfectly detailed. Here's hoping for more films, although it is obvious that the next installment will deal with a truly sad turn in Downton Abbey's future.",Downton Abbey
4,nogodnomasters,I never argue. I explain.,6,24 December 2019,"King George V and Queen and Princess Mary are going to visit Downton Abbey. Folks in a tizzy. Staff conflicting with the King's staff. Internal drama. Since I don't watch the series, I wasn't too attracted to the film as there is no introduction of characters, nor are they well developed. The script assumes that you know them and their quirks. I think the language was too modern. I don't believe the phrase ""Then there's that then"" was used back in the 1920s. Good acting for those who watch the series.",Downton Abbey
5,jboothmillard,Downton Abbey,5,22 September 2019,"The TV show was a worldwide phenomenon, lasting for six series, and some specials, gaining millions of viewers, critical acclaim, and winning and nominated Emmys, BAFTAs, Golden Globes and many other awards, there were always rumours that creator and writer Julian Fellowes would bring it to the big screen, and it happened! Basically, set in 1927, Robert Crawley, the Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), receives a letter from Buckingham Palace announcing that King George (Simon Jones) and Queen Mary (Geraldine James) are coming to Downton Abbey as part of a royal tour through the country. His daughter, Lady Mary Talbot (Michelle Dockery), and son-in-law, Tom Branson (Allen Leech) are also informed, and are also excited about their visit to Downton. But the Robert's mother, Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham (Dame Maggie Smith) is not as excited, as Queen Mary's lady-in-waiting, Maud, Lady Maud Bagshaw (Imelda Staunton), will also be coming. Lady Bagshaw is Robert's first cousin once removed and the two families have fallen out over an inheritance issue. The staff are informed that the royal staff will be joining them, but when they arrive, they are insulted by their arrogance. They are offended that Mr Wilson, Royal Page of the Backstairs, (David Haig) is insisting that only the royal staff will be serving the guests at the future gathering. Lady Mary believes that Thomas Barrow, Downton Abbey's butler (Robert James-Collier), may struggle, so she asks Downton's retired butler, Mr Carson (Jim Carter), to temporarily resume his former duties. Barrow is upset and strongly protests to Lord Grantham, who is impressed with his integrity. He tells Lady Mary that Barrow will not be sacked. Downstairs, the plumber who arrives to repair the broken boiler flirts with maid Daisy (Sophie McShera), upsetting her fiancé, footman Andy Parker (Michael Fox). A man named Major Chetwode (Stephen Campbell Moore) arrives in Downton village, Tom suspects he is a royal detective involved with security for the royal visit. The Royal parade takes place in the village, Chetwode finds the king on his horse awaiting the Royal Artillery. He aims a pistol at the king, but he is disarmed by Tom, and Chetwode is arrested. Tom meanwhile has met and formed a mutual attraction with Lady Bagshaw's maid, Lucy Smith (Tuppence Middleton). The household is completely taken over by the royal visitors and their entourage. The king informs Bertie Pelham, the Marquess of Hexham (Harry Hadden-Paton), that is to accompany the Prince of Wales on a three-month Tour of Africa. Bertie's wife Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) is pleased but also upset as she is now pregnant and will give birth after he departs. In the garden, Tom finds a woman crying, he is unaware she is Princess Mary (Kate Phillips), they have a meaningful conversation. Meanwhile, Anna Bates (Joanne Froggatt) discovers that Miss Lawton (Susan Lynch) has been stealing from Downton Abbey, she agrees to say anything as long as the items are returned and a ballgown is altered. Downstairs, Anna and John Bates (Brendan Coyle) have a plan to retake the household and restore Downton's honour, the staff agree but Mr. Carson is reluctant. Barrow and Richard Ellis, the King's Royal Dresser (Max Brown) implement the plan, tricking most of the royal staff, including Mrs. Webb, the Queen's Royal Dresser (Richenda Carey), into returning to London. Mr Wilson is tricked into being locked in his bedroom, and Monsieur Courbet, the Royal Chef (Philippe Spall), is drugged with sleeping tablets. Barrow and Mr Ellis go for a drink together, then Barrow meets Chris Webster (Perry Fitzpatrick) who invites him to a club. The secret nightclub is full of patrons that mostly gay men dancing together. The police later storm in and arrest everyone, Mr. Ellis finds out what happened and uses his position within the Royal Household to get Barrow released. After, the two confide about their respective homosexuality, and Ellis later gives Barrow a silver locket as a memento until they meet again. At dinner, the king is impressed by the revised menu and praises his chef. Mr. Molesley (Kevin Doyle), quick to defend Downton, responds that Mrs. Patmore (Lesley Nicol) prepared the dinner and that the Downton staff are serving it. Everyone is stunned by Molesley speaking to the king without permission. Robert apologises for Molesley's outburst, but the queen praises Mrs. Patmore's cooking and tells Cora Crawley, Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern) that they are accustomed to people behaving strangely around them. Violet confronts Maud about choosing Lucy instead of Robert as her heiress. But Isobel Merton (Penelope Wilton) correctly guesses, and Maud confirms, that Lucy is her illegitimate daughter, Violet understands that this decision is out of love. Henry Talbot, Lady Mary's husband (Matthew Goode), arrives home in time to accompany the family to Harewood. The king is thankful towards Tom when Princess Mary tells him and the queen that she has been influenced by him to remain with her husband. Violet talks to granddaughter Lady Mary that her trip to London was for medical tests, she reveals that she has little time left to live but reassures her that Downton's legacy will be safe in her hands. The king and queen congratulate Edith and Bertie on their forthcoming child and announce that Bertie will not go on the tour. Back at Downton Abbey, Mr. Carson and Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan) discuss Downton Abbey's future. Carson asserts it will stand for another hundred years with the Crawley family still living in it. Also starring Raquel Cassidy as Miss Baxter, Mark Addy as Mr. Bakewell, James Cartwright as Tony Sellick and Douglas Reith as Lord Merton. All of the recurring actors we recognise from the show are great, especially Smith with her signature disdainful put-downs, and new cast members Staunton and Haig are welcome. It is a very basic story, a royal visit to the English country house in the Yorkshire countryside, it is essentially the sort of thing you would get in a Christmas special, good acting, good script and good costumes. But you wouldn't expect anything different, it does exactly what it says on the tin, a nice simple and charming story of life upstairs and downstairs in the old days, nothing very dramatic, apart from an assassination attempt, some knick-knacks stolen, and an inheritance feud, a likeable enough period drama. Worth watching!",Downton Abbey
6,studioAT,Back to Downton we go,7,26 September 2019,"After 6 series and lots of specials 'Downton Abbey' hits the big screen in impressive style.I had only seen bits and pieces of the tv series, but rest assured that by and large it is accessible for a latecomer to all things Downton.While yes, it does feel like an extended Christmas special, that doesn't take away from the fact that this is a lovely film, full of good performances from the wonderful cast.The film offers some nice twists, but also a rounded conclusion, should there not be any further instalments.This was a nice afternoon's viewing.",Downton Abbey
7,CinemaSerf,Works OK even if you haven't seen series 1-6!,8,25 November 2019,"The television series' had passed me by, so it did take about half an hour for me to establish who was who/married to whom/related to whom/liked/loathed and generally to get my bearings. Once that was all done, the film moves along apace; looks great and portrays the tail end of the period of the pre-eminence of the British landed aristocracy with style and panache. Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton stand out, though feature sparingly and as you'd expect - the costumes, cinematography and score are very good. It is a delightful, though hardly thought-provoking watch....",Downton Abbey
8,writers_reign,The Big House,6,8 October 2019,"In some of his lighter works William Shakespeare was wont to involve his characters in mild crises which, in the final act, would be deftly rsolved, following which, as if to reassure the audience that all was now well, the characters would launch into a dance. Julian Fellowes is light years away from Shakespeare except, perhaps, in his own mind, but lo and behold, his screenplay for Downton Abbey sees several prominent characters embroiled in minor dilemmas and then, at the end, a grand ball brings things to a neat close. Shakespeare, of course, was not above 'borrowing' his plotlines and neither is Fellowes; Downton Abbey is a blatant rip-off of Upstairs, Downstairs, which, in turn, was heavily indebted to Noel Coward's Cavalcade. And so it goes. If bland confections are your thing this may well be right down your private driveway.",Downton Abbey
9,oscaralbert,"This flick documents the fact that Rich Folks in general and ""Royals"" in particular . . .",8,30 September 2019,". . . are not worth the paper on which they're printed. You know the drill. DOWNTON ABBEY portrays the sort of weak, geriatric monarch with which England is still saddled Today, insipidly waving their palsied hand from a 500-year-old carriage as their mindless dupes of ""subjects"" drool in Pavlovian Response. Try to picture these ingrown toenails toiling at an occupation for which their lack of skills and dearth of Real World Experience might qualify them. Instead of sponging off the DOWNTON ABBEY working stiffs of this world, picture ""Prince Harry"" bending over double to retrieve a dented ""Budweiser"" can from the bottom of the trash barrel at the northeast corner of Elizabeth St. and Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit. If Harry's grab is successful, he can then order his footmen to roll his Royal Carriage about 15 miles northwest to the nearest big box grocery store, and redeem the ten-cent deposit on his hard-won beverage container. Though DOWNTON ABBEY's ""Lady Violet"" and Real Life's ""QE2"" are probably too long in the tooth to succeed in such remunerative dumpster diving, it might be right up ""Princes Chuck, Bill, and wee little Georgie's"" alley--as long as they keep in mind Rule #1 of Michigan Canning: ""Dang, dang, dang--No one takes back 'Bang'!!""",Downton Abbey
10,neil-476,"Poshstairs, Commonstairs",7,23 August 2020,"It is 1927. In the English countryside there is an enormous house called Downstairs Abbey. It is home to a family of posh people, by which I mean that they have boatloads of money, posh titles, get to do what they want, and are better than everyone else. It is also home to a small army of servants, all of whom are common, by which I mean that they don't have any money, they don't have titles other than Mr and Mrs (and mostly they only have surnames), they do what they're told, and they're not as good as the posh people.It turns that there are even posher people. When the even posher people tell the posh people ""Oh, by the way, we're going to stay at your house overnight,"" the posh people don't say ""Sorry, it's not convenient."" They don't even say ""Oh, OK then."" In fact, they don't say anything all, they just shut up and put up with it.It turns out that there is yet another group, posh servants. There are the servants of the even posher people. They are posher than the servants of the posh people, but not as posh as the posh people themselves. When the even posher people announce they're going to stay for the night, the posh servants arrive at Downstairs Abbey, elbow the resident servants out of the way, and prepare to do the servanting thmselves. The resident servants take umbrage and plot secretly to do the servanting themselves, all except for the head servant who should have retired but has unretired just long enough to be demoted by the head posh servant.And that is the plot of this feature length movie follow-on to the UK TV series.I haven't watched series: my wife has, hence my watching the movie. It is glossy, well written, well acted, loads of Production value splashed all over the screen, and I quite enjoyed it.I don't want to watch the series thouugh.",Downton Abbey
11,HotToastyRag,Practically perfect,10,4 March 2021,"Is there anyone who didn't watch all six seasons of Downton Abbey and wait with baited breath during the finale hoping it would all turn out all right? If there is, I haven't met her. Like millions of others (I'm assuming), my mom and I dressed up in our 1920s finery to attend the premiere of the Downton Abbey film.It picks up only slightly after the last episode left off, and thankfully, there are no terrible upheavals to the plot or large consequences to the ending that we all loved so much. Downton has to prepare for a visit from the royal family, and everyone's in a tizzy. Mary, of course, is a difficult, little pill - but how else would Carson get lured back for the movie? She goes behind Thomas's back and asks Carson to return to his duties for the occasion because she fears the new butler can't handle it. It's rude, but at least Thomas gets to have some fun during his days off.He's not the only one who gets to have a blast: Tom Branson is the belle of the ball! He's just adorable in this movie; even if you didn't like him when he initially showed up behind the wheel all those years ago, he'll sweep you off your feet. Imelda Staunton is the ""guest star"" of this episode, which could only have been cuter if she'd had a couple of scenes with her off-screen husband (Carson, for those of you who didn't know). The whole movie is cute, and just as light as I was hoping it would be. I hope there won't be any more films, for I fear Julian Fellowes will feel the need to upset the apple cart, like selling Downton during the Crash of '29, going forward in time twenty years, or worse. For now, the 2019 movie is all I'll need. It's nearly perfect.",Downton Abbey
12,phd_travel,Not a lot of story for a movie,5,5 December 2019,The story is simple- a royal visit and a couple of side plots. The rivalry between the royal staff and Downton staff is a bit silly. Not enough happened with the aristocracy. Like if the Christmas specials.Nice to see the familiar faces again.,Downton Abbey
13,gradyharp,Pomp - and many circumstances...,10,23 December 2019,"Everyone who has enjoyed the series Downton Abbey on television will find satisfaction in this cinematic extension of the famous home and its inhabitants - both upstairs and downstairs. Julian Fellowes filled this version with all of the favorite characters and added a visit from the King and Queen to heighten the pleasures. As with the usual message, there is a disparity between the household and the 'servants' - one that is more linked to terms and traditions than to the fine rapport between the two factions.The theme and variations include the schism between the royal staff and the Downton staff and how the plane is evened, a suspicious thief that light-fingers trinkets only to be caught and make amends, a further exploration of 1927 homophobia as new butler Barrow discovers a gay bar, the beginning of a new love affair between Branson and a freshly discovered heir, some new about the health of Violet Crawley, a grand ball - and much more. The manner in which Fellowes makes each new twist and interaction between royalty, the wealthy owners, and the accompanying support staffs is indeed clever and refreshing. The entire film, including the chats with the starts at movie's end, feels like a warm reunion - with viewers an integral part of it all. This is a fine way to spend a winter evening.",Downton Abbey

15,JamesHitchcock,Does not really work as a film,5,27 September 2019,"Many Britons believe that theirs is a uniquely class-ridden society, but to me this is just a case of ""What do they know of England who only England know?""; other parts of the world, including some that like to boast of their supposed classlessness, have differences in social class at least as great as those which exist in Britain. What is true is that the British have a greater enthusiasm for talking about and analysing class differences than many other countries. I couldn't really imagine a French or American version of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"", that highly successful 1970s British drama series about life in a London mansion during the Edwardian era, concentrating on both the upper-class Bellamy family and their servants. The more recent ""Downton Abbey"" told a similar story about a Yorkshire stately home. Both series featured a female servant named Rose, perhaps a hint by ""Downton's"" creator Julian Fellowes that ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" was his inspiration. ""Downton"" was such a hit that, although it came to an end in 2015, a film spin-off seemed inevitable.In 1927, King George V and Queen Mary spend a night at Downton during a royal tour of Yorkshire. As is apparently normal protocol, they bring with them their own Royal Staff to cater for their needs during their stay. One might have thought that the resident domestic servants at the house would have been pleased at the prospect of a night off their normal duties, but they resent the fact that they are not considered worthy to serve the Royals, something they would regard as the pinnacle of their careers. The main plot of the film tells of how Downton's staff manage to outwit their arrogant, supercilious Royal counterparts and end up cooking for and serving the King and Queen.If the main plot were all that there is, this film would qualify as a comedy. It is, however, surrounded by a host of subplots, all of them dealing with a much more serious subject. An Irish Republican sympathiser plots to murder the King. The Queen's Lady-in-Waiting hides the fact that she has an illegitimate daughter, whom she passes off as her maid. A butler has to accept the fact that he is gay at a time when homosexuality was still a criminal offence. An aristocrat is asked by the King to accompany the Prince of Wales on a tour of Africa, but he hesitates to accept, even though the King's request is a great honour, because he has just discovered that his wife is pregnant. The King's daughter Princess Mary is unhappy in her marriage to the much older Lord Harewood. (That plotline appears to be based on historical fact; all the others, including the assassination plot, are fictitious).I must admit that I was not a regular watcher of the ""Downton Abbey"" television series; I suspect that I would have found the film much easier to follow if I had been. Fellowes, who also wrote the film screenplay, seems to have assumed that its audience would already be familiar with his characters, and does not waste much time introducing them to the rest of us. Existing fans of the series will presumably not have a problem with this, but the film has another weakness which I think betrays its origins as a TV serial. There are too many plotlines, and the subsidiary ones are dealt with in insufficient detail. Several of these, such as the butler struggling to come to terms with his sexuality and the titled lady trying to conceal her guilty secret would justify a complete film of their own. As for the attempt on the King's life, this must be the only film in which a treasonable conspiracy which, had it succeeded, would have changed the course of history is dealt with in such an offhand manner. Over the course of a television season, typically consisting of thirteen hour-long episodes, there would be time to expand and develop all these plotlines. In a two-hour feature film the writer needs to be more selective.The film has some redeeming features, such as its detailed recreation of the look of the historical period in which it is set, typical of British ""heritage cinema"". There are also some good performances, especially from Maggie Smith as the formidable and acid-tongued Dowager Countess of Grantham, the mother of Downton Abbey's current owner. Fans of the television series will probably love it. For me, however, and for others unfamiliar with the series, the concept does not really work as a film. 5/10",Downton Abbey
16,blanbrn,A movie of family royal status and wealth with fun laughs and drama.,7,21 September 2019,"Never watched the ""PBS"" series still watching the movie I can say this is a pretty good melodrama of high class people in small moments. As a royal visit in 20 century England sends all of the Crawley family into jitters as it's a frenzy of social polish and high worry. Nice to see how the well to do try to impress. And still the themes of love, difference, drama, and turmoil is all present as I'm sure many series watchers can relate to. Some standout performances are given from Michelle Dockery and Maggie Smith as the blunt and brash outspoken Lady Mary and Violet.

17,DKosty123,Stuffy Stodgy Royal Aristocratic Fun,7,26 September 2019,"I only have seen a few episodes of the TV series. The question though is does this movie succeed on it's own? Yes, it does as the understated but hilarious humor that is done better by the British is much in evidence here.The film takes place in the past and while the year is not stated, nor important, the setting of it is done well. The original sets from the series are used and the film does not fool around with taking itself seriously, but does well with it's main strength- devloping sublte subplots around it's large character cast.There is a rebellion, and insurrection, thievery, scandal and cheeky humor, all without viollence and special effects. It is done brilliantly. The audience applauded at the end of the film, quite rightly. This is a very successful turn of tv into a feature film, and that is not done this successfully very often. It does have to skim the surface a bit on some of the plotting, but then to go into too much detail with this many goings on would have required a 3 hour movie. That would be too long and too stuffy. This one is done right.Even though I have only seen a few snippets of the TV series, I enjoyed this little trip back into the era of stuffed shirts, and sublime plotting. Yes, and there's plenty of room to do this again, in another film. There was a trailer from the producers of this of a film next year set in this era. Will be interesting to see if they can duplicate the success here with a different plot and set of characters.",Downton Abbey
18,lasttimeisaw,"why not, for once, just take this one-off bonanza and jump off the gravy train when everything seems rosy, buoyant and pleasantly anodyne?",7,30 September 2019,"4 years after this British mega-hit TV series closes off with a mega-gratifying coda through its 6-season run, DOWNTON ABBEY returns with a film sequel, continuing the storyline in 1927, for diehard fans, the actualization of watching the palatial dwelling and all its fripperies on a grand cinematic scope itself constitutes for something to lick one's lips over and they get exactly what they're bargain for.Placing Michael Engler, the TV hack who has directed 4 episodes of the hit show, to the director chair, an ill omen which implies that innovation might not be of primary concern in writer/producer Julian Fellowes' mind and script.

19,cherold,genial nobility-porn is fun but lacks the drama of the series,7,17 December 2019,"A lot happened over the years of the Downton Abbey TV series. People struggled, people died, people fought overwhelming odds, people shook up the world and culture itself shifted as a result.The movie has none of that. It is virtually drama free, except for minor subplots that resolve themselves easily. It is period-piece comfort food with a plot of I-Love-Lucy-level silliness that won't surprise you once.So it's not as good as the series, and to say ""if you loved the series you'll love this movie"" would be wrong. But it's probably fair to say that if you loved the series you'll probably enjoy the series, because it does offer the same mix of good acting, fancy houses, and vintage clothes that were so much of the appeal of the original.I hear they're planning on more movies. I don't really see why, since the show's creator doesn't seem to have much to say about this world, but if they make more, I'll watch 'em.",Downton Abbey
20,bensonmum2,My completely biased opinion,9,21 September 2019,"The King and Queen come to Downton, which quite naturally leads to a lot of harried preparations and excitement - both upstairs and downstairs.I admit that my 9/10 is very generous and most likely overstating things a bit. But as much as I loved the show, I cannot be unbiased. For me, Downton Abbey ticked all the right boxes. As a fan, it's a feel good movie from start to finish. The characters, the relationships, the majesty, the heart, the laughs (Maggie Smith is laugh-out-loud funny), the house, the music, the beauty of it all - it's all here. There's no way I wasn't going to love it.But, as much as I loved Downton Abbey, it's not perfect. First, Julian Fellowes and Company tried to do too much. There's not enough time for all of the little plot threads the movie contains. To cram in everything they tried to, it would have needed to be filmed as seventh season - not a two hour movie. Second, I cannot imagine going into this movie without having seen the series. It's not so much a movie as it is a gift to the fans. Downton Abbey isn't really much of a standalone movie.As I've said repeatedly, for me, it's all about entertainment. And I was completely entertained throughout.9/10",Downton Abbey

Remaking a small-screen serial to adjust to the long form of a theatrical release is another matter, and there are plenty of examples of features that work in this field separate from their episodic precedents. Although both motion pictures, feature-length cinema and chapter plays broadcast and streamed at home are two considerably different art forms; one might work well in one medium and fail miserably in the other. Despite mostly positive reviews from others, I consider that the case with ""Downton Abbey"" (2019), although even it's better than another such example of this phenomenon in 2019, ""El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,"" which makes it appropriate that the latter is mostly restricted to Netflix whereas this conservative country-house melodrama on classism for Anglophiles received wide theatrical distribution. That's because the show lends itself better to the big screen in a couple ways, although it also falls short in most other respects.On the plus side, ""Downton Abbey"" is architecturally grounded by the eponymous estate. The camerawork and use of space, consequently, translates well to a movie. For ""El Camino,"" they attempted to compensate for this by emulating the Western, with its sweeping vistas, but dismally so. The other thing going for ""Downton Abbey"" is the score. The script here doesn't deserve its dramatic buildup, but, admittedly, it does manage to make even setting up chairs in the rain more compelling than it otherwise would be (which is to say it wouldn't otherwise have been of any interest and barely is regardless).I never finished the TV series, but it was entirely too easy to pick back up with the characters in this movie. That's because despite all the big world events the show covered in a ""Forrest Gump"" (1944) sort of way, the characters left standing don't develop. Sure, the daughters switch beaus and this or that servant resigns or is hired, but it seems ridiculous to me that a series survives for years, hours upon hours of story, without changing. I suppose that's comforting to viewers picking up a show once a week to not be thrown off by radical shifts in character and narrative, and it makes more sense for the same reason to dance in and out of the lives of a plethora of them, but it's antithetical to good cinematic storytelling. A two-hour farewell party to your favorite characters frozen in time doesn't make for quality cinema. It doesn't help, either, that these characters and the writing are slavishly in awe of the British social hierarchy of yesteryear. Some episodes are best left in the past.",Downton Abbey
22,cricketbat,Like an average episode of the TV series,6,11 February 2020,"The Downton Abbey movie is like an average episode of the television series. The stakes aren't that high, despite the characters repeatedly telling us how high they are. However, I will always be impressed with how this historical period drama manages to elicit big reactions from me about the smallest things (such as a person speaking out of turn). Was this film a necessary continuation of the story? No. Did I still enjoy seeing the gang all back together? Yes.",Downton Abbey
23,inkblot11,"Wonderful film in all aspects, don't don't miss it!",10,23 September 2019,"In a place in the English countryside, there is a stately mansion, Downton Abbey. Rather a distance from London, the Earl of Granthem (Hugh Bonneville) and his American wife (Elizabeth McGovern) reign over the estate. Adding spirit and disdain is the Earl's mother Violet (Maggie Smith) and his daughters and extended family. It is a beautiful but costly place and the first World War has recently ended. Behind the ""aristocrats"" is a bevy of butlers, maids and cooks who make everything work beautifully. Now, word arrives that the ACTUAL KING OF ENGLAND AND HIS WIFE are going to be stopping for a day and night on a tour of the country. MY WORD! While preparations are being made in the extreme, many other matters are swirling around the house. One of the daughters may be expecting and due at a time her husband will be out of the country. An Irish widower son-in-law may be plotting something to make the king's visit a shambles or worse. In addition, Violet is quarreling with a cousin (Imelda Staunton) who will be coming with the queen; she means to confront her no matter what! In the lower chambers, there is romance, a broken boiler, an invasion of the king's personal and belligerent staff, and a quarrel of chief butlers when a retired one is called in to help. Finally, there is a thief in the house, taking small and valuable things away from the mansion! How will the king's visit come off and, ultimately, affect Downton Abbey? This wonderful film has captured the best of the television series in one fantastic, larger episode. Choosing a time period when things weren't torn apart by war and with most of the family in happy circumstances, it succeeds in doing the impossible, making a film out of episodic television. The cast is superlative, as are the costumes, sets, writing, direction and, most notably, the cinematography. Fans and non-fans should equally charge out of the house and rush to the box office for one great and satisfying view.",Downton Abbey

Everyone is elegant and lovely; along with being well acted throughout! A great film about a gathering of sorts among many charming characters that dance, eat, or otherwise. Involves princes, majesties or similar within the family quite delightful aspects to stories. I'd definitely recommend to anyone fan of the series or not.",Downton Abbey
26,Dr_Coulardeau,Lack of social poignancy.,8,17 May 2020,"Of course, they are back, and ""in one century they will still be there and the Crawleys with them."" (not quite verbatim) The show is brilliant and as rich as expected even if the parade was a little bit short. But this film is catching up on the unfinished business of the series, and there was so much unfinished business.But today things have changed in so many ways. Brexit is bursting out, exploding the United Kingdom and the COVID-19 pandemic is blowing up our modern life. It is not some nostalgia about trams in York and parade uniforms that will change one iota to it. The world is no longer what it used to be. Regalia and luxury are no longer the targets of most people. They still love parades, but they do not want fair money to be wasted in such useless carnivals and in military operations that lead nowhere like in Iraq and Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria.The Irish Republic, and Ireland, will be reunited someday soon, and Brexit and the pandemic are the guarantees that it will happen and no one will be able to stop it, just as much as one day Scotland will be an entity by itself who will have its own diplomacy, even if still in some kind of a union with England and Wales, ... or not. Just as much as the United Kingdom, or Great Britain more realistically, will still be part of the European Union, maybe on a special arrangement, but they will, because the USA is not the future of Great Britain. They are too selfish, self-centered, and imperialistic.If we then look at this film, it disappoints me slightly because the series was so deeply concerned by social issues and even the political problem of Ireland and their independence. The film is so far from that social thinking, and that political awareness. The little part about Ireland is insignificant. The attempt to kill the king, from a point of view that is neither clear not neat, is pitiful. The grossly vain and selfish parade with meals, etiquette, a slight rebellion in the house against the servants of the King who are arrogant and not even more talented than anyone else in the local and regular household's servants, all that is leading nowhere at all.We do not have one single glimpse into the reality of England or Great Britain or even the United Kingdom, not to mention the British Empire. Just glamor and music. One widow in the Earl's family who had a daughter from a plebeian man, without it being known, incognito and behind closed curtains, hidden from everyone, and this daughter turned into the maid of the widow, that's pitiful and pathetic. And the grandmother of the Earl's family manipulating her disgust about it and making the widow believe there is a good solution within the family and that she will be welcome if she comes back, only for one single reason, to marry the widow's daughter - and daughter - with the Earl's Irish Republican plebeian son-in-law to provide him with an estate. It is Machiavellian but totally unethical. Matchmaking is always unethical. It is called arranged marriages in some other circles. At least the two persons here concerned are adults and willing to play the game. But even so...!And the gay side story is funny but it does not solve the deeply anti-gay attitude of this society, and nostalgia there is beyond any understanding, even if it pretends there was a gay man in the royal household, a servant, of course, nothing else. To be gay was good enough for servants and it could not in any way be a normal orientation for everyone, as if Oscar Wilde's lover were not an aristocrat, a Lord mind you. At least D.H. Lawrence is more open on the subject than this film, with a real gay relationship between an aristocrat and a plebeian. That makes the whole film sad and far from the powerful truth, the series dealt with at times.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",Downton Abbey
27,Red-125,It won't work unless you've watched the TV series,7,25 September 2019,"Downton Abbey (2019) was directed by Michael Engler. We loved Downton Abbey as a TV show. The film is like two more episodes of the show. A few new characters, but mostly everyone that we knew before is back.Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary is still beautiful, Maggie Smith is still fabulous, and Jim Carter as Mr. Carson is still the world's most perfect butler.The film assumes that you know the characters, so there's not much backstory. It's fine if you do, indeed, know who everyone is both upstairs and downstairs. Only a few new characters are introduced, so you can sort them out pretty quickly.We saw the movie at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. It won't work quite as well on the small screen. However, don't forget that we all originally watched the show on the small screen. Still, director Engler has some great outdoor shots, which make the production values appear even more lush.Downton Abbey has a very high IMDb rating of 7.9. I gave it a 7.0, because I thought that director Engler could have had more creative, better plots. It's still a must-see if you're a Downton Abbey fan. If you're not familiar with the show, learn some of the basic plot lines before you watch the film.",Downton Abbey
28,filipemanuelneto,"A good job, which honors the original series.",10,17 February 2020,"After an excellent TV series, Downton Abbey finally arrives at the cinema, after much insistence from the fans. The film maintains a lot of the series and resembles an extended episode. So, I'm not going to go into too much, I think the criticism I made for the series is perfectly suited for this film.The film takes up the story where the series ended in the late Twenties and revolves around a visit by the Royal Family to the Yorkshire region, where they will sleep and have a big dinner at the Crawley family mansion. For them, it is undoubtedly a moment of great anxiety and prestige, but for their usual servants, it will certainly be a headache and involve immense work, which everyone is happy to accept given the prospect of being able, in fact, serve the kings of your country. But as the Royal Family travels with a vast entourage of servers, the task will not be easy.The cast that marked the series is back, both in the salons and on the service floors. I will excuse myself to nominate the actors, but I believe that they are excellent and deserve all the recognition that they had with this work of perfect historical recreation. Yes, because if there is one thing that is notorious in this film, as well as in the series, it is the care and attention to details and in the reconstruction of the time and the environments that were portrayed. Of course, the use of good filming locations helped to make the series (and the film) more realistic and authentic, and there is no doubt that Highclere Castle, the house used to bring Downton Abbey to life and, in real life, belongs to the Lord Carnarvon, you are perfect for that.In addition to the excellent sets and costumes, the film has excellent production values: a very competent photograph with pleasant colors, a remarkable soundtrack imported from the original series, a good job of filming and editing.The script, in addition to a good story, adds some developments to the personal history of the characters we've been following since 1912: this was probably the farewell to Countess Violet, played by Maggie Smith, as well as Carson, the immortal butler who, for the last time, return to activity; Tom Branson looks ready for a new page in his life; Tom Barrow, for his part, is finally a pleasant character and worthy of our sympathy, after an entire series in which he was a villain and made a long journey of atonement. I will not say more, it is best to see the film. Worth it.Is this the farewell to Downton Abbey? After several seasons on TV, in one of the most addictive and elegant television programs of the decade, and a film full of quality that, certainly, pleased the diehard fans of the series, it is difficult to say. I personally would like to see more, but only if the quality of what comes to match the material already made. I wouldn't want to see Downton Abbey drag on and lose quality just because of fan pressure or industrial interests. There is a correct time to end. But only the future will tell if the Crawley mansion doors will open again for us.",Downton Abbey

34,alindsay-al,An Above Average Period Piece Film,6,31 October 2019,"Now I am going to start this review by saying that I have never watched any episodes of the show Downton Abbey but I somehow found myself watching the film, so this review is from the opinion of somebody who isn't a fan of the show. The premise of the film sees when the King and Queen are set to arrive at Downton Abbey everybody from the heads of the house to the maids have to prepare. Now this is a huge cast due to trying to get everybody from the show involved but overall I liked the majority of the cast, Maggie Smith is great in the film, she is so sarky and charming throughout the film and is probably my favourite character in the film. I liked pretty much all of the maids and servants who have their own stories and I was most interested by their characters and their story throughout the film. Hugh Bonneville plays the head of the house in this film and for me was the most recognisable actor but he really doesn't do much in this film and I felt this film didn't do enough to show how good an actor he can be. The story is a bit choppy to be honest, there were things I enjoyed, like all the servants storyline was interesting and fun to watch. However, there is way too much going on in this film, I know they wanted everybody from the series to get a large role in the film but it means that there are certain things you care about and certain things that are underdeveloped and only really their for fans of the show. The script is pretty fun, with quite a bit of charm and light humour to the characters, but this film really lacked drama from the characters and I feel like this film didn't have as much conflict in it as it should have. The style is pretty legendary and feels very big and grand throughout and fits the time period very well. But I feel like this film is kind of split into a few different episodes in 2 hours so the pacing was indeed off and it felt like it possibly would have been better to do a mini series but then it wouldn't have got the theatrical release. Overall this is an okay film, if you are a fan of the series I am sure you love this film but for your average movie fan it is a fine film thatis worth a watch if you like this genre of this film.",Downton Abbey

The entire movies revolves around this event with several tiny family-based side stories. Watch the household and servants scramble to ready the estate for a royal visit. As the staff works hard, the family works equally as hard navigating a few inner-family and political plot points. And don't belittle the Downton staff, as the official royal staff rudely does, as they attempt to take charge of the service. With less time to devote to intriguing stories than in the series, many story lines felt underdeveloped or rushed. The opulence is full force yet the dialog isn't as crisp and overall it felt more sentimental than an engrossing drama which it certainly could have been.

All is as it should be, with little in the way of threat, Smith getting all the best lines and the characters beloved by millions all getting a chunk of action.

But, as each one made their way into the story I realized my fondness for each.). The twist was clever (as someone remarked it was UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS meets DOWNTON ABBEY). But, for most who came to the theatre, it was simply the celebration of a beloved series, that we all still miss.

This makes them to start preparation for the royal visit but soon the conflict takes place between the house servants (butler and so on) because the royal visitors will bring their own servants and chef who are to take care of all the domectic tasks excluding the local staff who feels largely humiliated. Besides that the relationship between all those aristocrats is not 100% peaceful showing more or less courtly disguised jealousies and disrespect. There are also one or two criminal scenes.

43,martimusross,Brilliantly Realised For The Big Screen,10,14 September 2019,"Downton AbbeyAs familiar as a favourite pair of slippers I failed, on the first viewing, to give this movie the plaudits it deserves. Might I add this is the only movie I have watched twice out of more than 100 movies.This was a really great movie that just about had it all. We had a sumptuous and ravishing display of wealth and privilege that will have raised the hackles of any extreme left wing Marxist Corbinista who reside in the Champagne socialist boroughs of Camden and Islington.Julian Fellows successfully transmuted his creation effortlessly from the small screen to the larger palette of the movie house with the device of a Royal Visit. All our favourite characters were there in fine order and below, what was a very funny script, there were some gently introduced issues.These were1, the role of monarchy and these great houses in society.2, the purpose of tradition3, what is community and how important it is to be kind.4, the need to innovate and move with the times or wither and die.5, how far we have come with gay rights6, we must always believe in human nature and rehabilitation.The ensemble acting was first rate and Maggie Smith played herself brilliantly.The cinematography was brilliant throughout and the editing particularly through the set piece of the Kings Parade was masterful. The styling and music really set everything in the Art Deco period with just a snippet of the jazz age.The denouement was without impediment, the highlight of a perfect script that was brilliantly realised by the director. I would add this movie would stand alone in its own right regardless of the series.If you are a fan of Downton then this delivered in spades.

44,proud_luddite,Enjoyable,7,15 January 2020,"Carrying on from the British TV series (2010 - 2015): it is now 1927; the aristocratic household is sent into disarray as the King and Queen of England have invited themselves to stay at the estate for a brief visit during a tour of the Yorkshire region. Most of the disruption is felt by the household staff who must deal with the arrogant royal servants who have decided to take over the estate during the royal visit.The first half of the film is energetic with charm and wit to spare especially during the bantering sessions between Violet Crawley (Maggie Smith) and Lady Merton (Penelope Wilton). Director Michael Engler uses sweeping camera movements that highlight the beauty of the mansion's interior as well as the beautiful countryside that surrounds it.The second half certainly does not wither but it is less spirited than the earlier half. The many sub-stories are comprehensible overall - at least to someone like myself who never watched a full episode in the series - but it is occasionally difficult to keep up.One of the more surprising sub-plots involved a homosexual character and the underground gay life of the time. During that era, gay life - and any history of it - was so muzzled that it's difficult to know how accurate the depiction was in this film. To give the movie credit, its portrayal of a situation normally forbidden to be portrayed seems realistic while also showing a bit of hope within a dismal situation.Overall, this film is entertaining with beautiful camerawork as a highlight. If it is this good to someone not acquainted with the TV series, it must have been a true joy to the series' fans.",Downton Abbey
45,gkeith_1,Nice costuming.,10,8 October 2019,"Spoilers. Opinions. Observations. Reflections.Nice costuming. The most standout are the red vests/uniforms worn by the royal servers.I also liked the women's costumes. Even Lady Edith looked pretty good this time, plus her period-era one-piece undergarment showed some cleavage and inferred a little sexuality - being that she was finally married to a decent chap and even in the early stages of yet another pregnancy. Whew, that was long-winded.I enjoyed seeing the old cast. I was disappointed that Barrow was no longer the conniving scoundrel that he had been in the TV series. I was happy that O'Brien was not in the film, but perhaps she, too, may have become sugary sweet. Ugh.The family started out poor, for aristos, since they had to be bailed out by Shirley MacLaine's family money at the beginning. Toward the end of this film, they are still trying to put their heads together to think of ways to keep the property financially afloat.Irony: Highclere Castle, the estate in real life, today has events and tours in order to keep the property financially afloat.

46,RforFilm,"Downton Abbey is clearly for the fans of the show, even if it looks nice and elegant.",6,25 September 2019,"What can I say about the TV series Downton Abbey? While I can't say a lot about the plot and characters, as I haven't seen the show, it has made a big impact, even here in America where it ran for six seasons (or series as the British say) on PBS. I know it has to do with a wealthy aristocratic family and the lives of them and the servants. Judging by the house, of course it would need to be run like it's own business. Im sure a lot of people came for it's story, but I think the major draw was the sets, costumes, and the feeling that your watching something classier then your typical cop show or reality show.Having only seen two episodes, I see Downton Abbey as a high budgeted soap opera. There's nothing wrong with that as soap operas do keep the focus of the plot on the family, thus the need to write compeling charecters in order to make it work. It just so happens that because of the 1920s timeframe, Downton Abby gets to also throw in a lot of historical context in relation to the wealthy family. So let's see what the Downton Abbey movie brings to the screen.In 1927, the head of the family, Robert Crawley (played by Hugh Bonneville) has received a letter that King George and Queen Mary will be visiting and staying at Downton Abbey as a part of the royal tour. He informs the rest of the family including his wife Cora (played by Elizabeth McGovern), daughter Lady Mary Talbot (played by Michelle Dockery), her husband Tom Branson (played by Allen Leech) and his mother Violet (played by Maggie Smith) who all have different reactions. Some are excited and some are ready to confront other family regarding inheritance and just who is who.Meanwhile, the staff, as lead by butler Thomas Barrow (played by Robert James-Collier), is thrilled that the royal family will be visiting the estate. However, the family feels that he won't be up to the responsibility, so they ask former butler Mr. Carson (played by Jim Carter) to temporary return to manage things. Though the staff feels ready, their dismayed to not only find out that the royal family will be brining their own staff, but those at Downton Abbey are told to stay out of the way. Will the staff be able to prove themselves?For someone who hasn't seen the show, what did I think of Downton Abbey? The story itself seems fine. I admire a movie for having a simple goal; to simply see that a royal visit goes according to plan. Now the use of a large cast is another thing. With the countless family members, staff members, and now with Buckingham Palace, that is a lot to juggle. Some of the side stories are easy to grasp and others clearly have more background thanks to the long running show. So the question is whether this was better as a show. I'd say so, but it isn't without it's merits.The set design and costumes are really impressive, even if they are leftovers from the show. I can understand how a large audience can get sucked into this world. Some of me wishes I could be a part of this world, even though I know I could never high class enough. All the actors feel like their in the right place, but again, that probably has to do with the fact they've already done this for seven seasons.Unlike a lot of movies based on TV shows that are adaptations, this is a continuation of a larger story. Would have I have gotten into it had I'd seen it? Probably. There were some parts I had sympathy for, such as the staff not wanting someone else to do their jobs. But whenever it cut to the aristocratic family, I feel like I'm steeping into an argument that started a while ago. Because of that, inclined to believe that the movie was made for the fans and not newcomers. It's not a way for someone unfamiliar to be introduced. It's something to satisfy someone whose had plenty of Downton Abbey and wants more.I'll give this six Downton Abbey houses out of ten. Overall, I'm not sure if this was for me, but I can see a lot of people enjoying it anyhow. I'd say watch some of the show first to know what your getting into. Heck, it might be better if you see the entire series. So check out the show first before you check into the movie.",Downton Abbey
47,eminkl,I really enjoyed the TV series but the movie wasn't that much.,6,8 October 2019,I really enjoyed the TV series but the movie wasn't that much. I wanted to have a farthing every time Lady Mary rolled her eyes. Fellows tried to jam into the two hours and it just didn't click. Still so much better than the rest of the crap in the cineplex land.,Downton Abbey
48,agmoldham,A money making exercise?,5,1 October 2019,"I sat down to watch Downton Abbey trying to think if there as ever been a good movie made of a successful tv series. Can't say that any movie sprung to mind.Having seen Downton Abbey got to say that this will be another movie that doesn't quite live up to the tv series in my opinion. The running time is 2 hours, so a number of the movie plots are very rushed in comparison to the time they are given in a tv series. It seems that if a character didn't fit into the overall plot of the royal visit to Downton then they had their own sub plot. The movie isn't terrible and the characters are very much the same as they were in the tv series. Can't say I was a fan of the lighting of the movie unless the cinema was having problems with projection.If you were a fan of the tv series you'll find the movie very watchable, but if you didn't watch the tv series you should probably avoid the movie.",Downton Abbey
49,jrarichards,"No Downton fan can really pass up this chance, but many TV episodes were better",7,14 February 2020,"American director Michael Engler's 2019 movie plays out like a (slightly below-par) episode of the series - indeed so much so that the viewer may be lulled into a false sense of security regarding ""more next week"" ... only to be rudely awakened by some very definitive-sounding closing remarks about the fate and future of the Abbey, as well as its probably most-adored-of-all semi-resident, Lady Grantham. Once again, Maggie Smith corners the best lines, be they (frequently) witty and waspish, but also (occasionally) wise and meaningfully philosophical.Given the need to offer something on a somewhat bigger scale than the TV might manage, a Royal Visit (dating to 1927-8) seems appropriate enough (indeed, it would offhand be difficult to think of a better choice of direction); and it gives the odd opportunity - well-enough explored - for the servants to ponder on the merits of monarchy and aristocracy. Only occasionally do their remarks look outrageously implausible for those times.All the old gang above- and below-stairs are back, though Matthew Goode as Henry Talbot has a symbolic presence only. Elizabeth McGovern as Lady Cora seems to have little to do and so - surpisingly - does Brendan Coyle as Mr Bates. His wife played by Joanne Froggatt comes over well, as does the ever-valuable Carson (Jim Carter), and the beloved cook Mrs Patmore (Lesley Nicol) - whose every utterance is worthwhile and joyous.Efforts to spice up and scale up the plot fare variously. The presence of a (real-life) military band and gun troop with horses certainly adds spectacle, but it is toe-curling for those in the know to have these evident artillerymen portrayed as ""Hussars"" (which are obviously cavalry not artillery). A thrown-in plot to assassinate George V looks just that, while the visit made by Barrow (Robert James-Collier) to the fleshpots of ... York??? looks massively incongruous, even if the point about active homosexuality being viewed as a serious crime back then has its impact and value. An inheritance-related issue surrounding Imelda Staunton's character works reasonably well (giving opportunities for interactions with Smith and Wilton), but Staunton and Smith look marvellously in a class of their own in the whole thing.A matter of passing interest (though given centre stage here) is the conflict between the Buckingham Palace staff the royal couple bring with them and the Downton Servants. But, though David Craig adds a little something to most things he appears in, the ludicrous plots to silence and remove his character and the interlopers raise the odd laugh, but are also uncomfortably shallow-looking.Obviously, those who like Downton will not pass up an opportunity for more of it (given the movie is now the only option for that) - and all the more so as this 2-hour chunk carries the story forward - including in respect of the apparently imminent death of Lady Grantham, and as regards a further development of the character of Irishman Tom (Allen Leech) - which offers the odd thought-provoking moment, as well as a small dose of sweetish romance.It's fun enough and pretty enough and engaging enough and even thought-provoking enough to be worth going for; but it will have to be admitted by most that the best of the best TV episodes achieved more than the movie does, notwithstanding the occasionally-higher production values of the latter.",Downton Abbey
50,bob-the-movie-man,Very little happens.... and it's totally glorious!,9,17 September 2019,"The ""Downton Abbey"" TV show is comfortingly bland. The tales of the well-heeled Grantham family and the below stairs antics of their servants. But for those who have followed Julian Fellowes' pot-boiler drama through all six seasons and a number of Christmas specials, it's like a favourite jumper; or rediscovering your comfy slippers just as the nights start getting colder.But in a world where TV spin off movies are notoriously dire, would this movie by the nail in Downton's coffin?Thankfully not! It's a glorious production! The opening of this film will, I'm sure, fill all Downton fans with utter glee. John Lunn's music builds progressively as a royal letter wends its way through the 1927 postal system, eventually ending up (as the famous theme final breaks spectacularly) at the doors of Downton Abbey (Highclere Castle near Newbury, acting as a star of the film in its own right).As the plot goes, in a year of Thanos-crushing drama, there really is nothing very substantial going on here! The King (George V, an almost unrecognizable Simon ""Hitchhikers Guide"" Jones) and Queen Mary (Geraldine James) are staying over in Downton for one night on their Yorkshire tour. This naturally sets the below-stairs staff into a bit of a tizz, as indeed it does the whole village. But their glee at involvement and recognition is a bit premature, since the royal entourage - headed by an officious Mr Wilson (David Haig) - parachute the complete gamut of staff into the location to serve the royal party, so bypassing the locals completely.The 'Downton massif' are of course having none of this, and a battle-royale ensues.Scattered as sub-plots like confetti at a wedding are a military man putting an over-protective arm around the potentially-risky Irish Tom Branson (Allen Leech); a family rift erupts between Aunt Violet (Maggie Smith) and cousin (and royal lady-in-waiting) Maud Bagshaw (Imelda Staunton); a sobbing princess (Kate Phillips) with marital issues; an over-enthusiastic shopkeeper (Mark Addy) who is difficult to let-down gently; a plumbing emergency with romantic jealousy and sabotage involved; the sexual preferences of Barrow (Robert James-Collier) get him into trouble; (and a potential love-interest for the widowed Tom with Maud's maid Lucy (Tuppence Middleton). (There are probably half a dozen others that I've forgotten!)As befits a show that has gone over six seasons, there is a huge ensemble cast involved. Inevitably, some get more air time than others. Bates (Brendan Coyle) seems to be particularly short-changed, and above stairs I thought the same was true - strangely enough - of the Crawleys (Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern).As for Henry Talbot (Matthew Goode), he's hardly in it at all! Apart from some dramatic camera gymnastics for his running up the stairs arrival, he doesn't make much of an impression at all. (I can only guess he had other filming commitments).But these are players that have worked together as a team for many years, and it shows.But the acting kudos has to go to Maggie Smith who steals absolutely every scene she's in, with genuinely witty lines - ""I'll lick the stamps myself"" (LoL). Close behind though is Imelda Staunton who also turns in a very impressive performance.The photography is fantastic throughout, with deep rich colours, pin-sharp focus and some seriously dramatic pans. A big hats off to cinematographer Ben Smithard, but also to his drone team (""The helicopter ladies"") for delivering some jaw-droppingly gorgeous shots of Highclere castle.(By the way, I thought the picture at my local Picturehouse cinema - Harbour Lights in Southampton - was particularly stunning: I queried it with them, and they said they had changed the (very expensive) projector bulb just that day! These things clearly matter!)Will is appeal? If you are a Downton fan, yes, Yes, YES! I have been a moderate fan of the TV series, but went with superfans. I loved it, but the two ladies were ecstatic with the movie.Even if you have never seen an episode, it is easy to pick up and the quality of the production is so impressive I don't think you will be disappointed.As such, I think I need to post a blend of ratings for this one. 10/10 for Downton fans and 8/10 for everyone else.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook or the web.

51,barryrd,Downton Movie Delivers What We Wanted,9,19 December 2019,"I was very happy when I heard that a movie would follow the ""Downton Abbey"" TV series. The great cast and script, historical accuracy, costumes, sets and landscape scenery made watching Downton a real treat. I was not disappointed for a moment and was happy to see the story continue to unfold as the characters grow and age. I could feel a great desire for a long-lasting family saga that may or may not happen. I can only wish.
The visit of the King and Queen in 1927 made for a high point in the Downton story that played out in an unexpected way to the delight of the audience. King George and Queen Mary had by that point reached a point in their reign where they had forged a special bond with the British public-a conscious effort to ensure the continuity of the monarchy in an age when royalty was stumbling and falling across much of Europe. Both Geraldine James as the Queen and Simon Jones as a very regal George V are outstanding in their brief appearances.
The difference between this show and the TV show was its large dose of humour and the absence of tragedy. In the long running TV show, we could see the family come back from a series of hear-breaking events and twists of fate that could only take place in a long running show.
However, that does not detract from the show's enjoyment. The movie's producers have used the opportunity to allow the characters we love to shine and make us laugh as if we are in the company of dear friend. For Downton fans, not to be missed.",Downton Abbey
52,tm-sheehan,Great High Quality Television Drama ! Magnified ?,7,12 September 2019,"I'm a keen fan of Downtown Abbey as a Television Drama so I find it difficult to rate or critique Downton as a Cinema release.
Why? you may ask. I enjoyed the movie to a point because Ive also enjoyed the 52 episodes of the 6 series on television . However I don't really think it makes a great movie transfer although it's entertaining and enjoyable.
It has all the high quality wit and sumptuous surroundings of the original TV series and creator Julian Fellowes is a master of portraying the Upstairs/Downstairs world of the Aristocracy and the snobbery from both sides of the divide.No spoilers from me other than anybody who saw the trailer knows the entire movie centres around a Royal visit to Downton Abbey from King George V and Queen Mary.
All the usual performances are as good as in the Television production but I really enjoyed the addition of Geraldine James as Queen Mary
and Imelda Staunton as Lady Bagshaw cousin to the Dowager Countess Violet Crawley played beautifully as usual by Maggie Smith .Anyone who enjoyed the Downton Abbey series will surely enjoy making acquaintance with all their favourite characters again but I'm not sure the big Cinema screen didn't make them seem more like soapy cardboard cut outs at times.
PS. As Mathew Goode heads the cast list on
IMBd I expected to see more of him than just a walk on at the end, most disappointed as I think he would have made Lady Mary Crawley played by Michelle Dockery happier and less austere and irritating.",Downton Abbey
53,brankovranjkovic,Downton Abbey -,9,16 September 2019,"Costume drama set in the late 1920's.The big screen adaptation of a highly regarded British TV series, staring some of the cream of British acting royalty. The theatre was packed with a much older audience (I'm older but all even older than me).The movie opens with Lord Grantham receiving a special letter from the King and Queen of England, seeing this being delivered was pure magic.
The Downton Abbey staff need to quickly prepare for this royal overnight stay. The Royal's personal staff, consisting of a French chef is sent ahead to prepare the food, a scary butler, to organise the rest of his staff. The regular staff are justifiably upset and plan a revolution with lots of Monty Python style humour. This is the main plot but also with many intertwining subplots.Worth a visit if only just to see Maggie Smith who steals every scene she appears in. My wife is a huge fan of the TV series and enjoyed this enormously, though she said it could have been more spectacular and lavish at the end.",Downton Abbey
54,Alexander_Blanchett,Absolutely satisfying for fans,9,15 November 2019,"I started the TV show two months ago and immediately got addicted. Now of course I was extremely curious about the movie version of it and I must say I was not disappointed at all... yes it appears like a ""longer"" version of an episode or TV Special however it is even better crafted than many episodes and makes you hungry for much more. I really hope this was not the end yet. The acting was as in the show: The star of the film was without any doubt Maggie Smith. Just as tremendous and scene stealing as she was in the show she also was here with a fantastic final scene that in the least should bring her an Oscar nomination.
Another great performance and personal favorite was by Jim Carter who is just perfect as Butler Carson and even was able to add new facettes to that amazing character. Hugh Bonneville was fine but a bit wasted here. Michelle Dockery was better in the TV show if you ask me. Therefor Laura Carmichael was better than in most episodes. Elizabeth McGovern served her role very well. I preferred Robert James Collier and Sophie McShera in the series but Lesley Nichol was just as perfect as always and so was Joanne Froggatt and Allen Leech. Too bad Brendan Coyle was very wasted. Great new addition by Imelda Staunton.
The look and feel was just as great as in the show, the score amazing (to hear it with the cinematic sound sent many shivers over my spin). It was really a beautiful film with many nice moments and surprises and quite decent character development. I really hope this wasnt the last time we saw the Crawleys and their servers, the heart and soul of Downton Abbey.",Downton Abbey

If you didn't, you probably won't go near it, in which case you'll miss one of the year's biggest treats for non-teenage audiences.As on TV, the movie teeters between soap opera and sitcom, here and there coming close to a parody of itself. Geraldine James has been invited to play a somewhat Queen Mumsical Queen Mary, not the Teutonic battleaxe she's usually sold as. Violet, the dowager countess (Maggie Smith), and Isabel, Lady Mary's mother-in-law (Penelope Wilton), are very much a comedy duo, exchanging barbed remarks. Dame Maggie steals every scene she's in; she's built a career on this, Lord love her!OK, it's just a soap about posh folk and their servants, but it's the Pink Camay of soaps. Julian Fellowes has provided a witty and whimsical screenplay, the production values (and the frocks!) are off the scale, and Hampshire's Highclere Castle once more does glorious duty as the Grantham estate.

My only slight gripe, was I'd love to have seen Spratt and Denker in it, but as not one scene was set in the Dowagers house, it would have been difficult to include them, but maybe they could have been arguing in the village shop or something, I did miss them!

To be honest, it's hard to sympathise with the incredibly rich Crawley family when they moan about getting the roof fixed and trifling tiffs with estranged cousins. But it's a treat to watch the gorgeous costumes, the lush interiors and exteriors, and, as always, the script chugs along at a a cracking pace.It is lovely to see all the old characters - about 20 of them! - from the cook Mrs Patmore, to the always elegant and smart Lady Edith. And of course the warm hearted senior maid Mrs Bates (Joanna Froggatt) is a saint and can do no wrong.Apart from the silly plot of the Downton servants conspiring to replace the royal team to serve dinner - er, wouldn't they be sacked? - there are some interesting story strands such as a gay servant's secret social life and a royal dressmaker who is unearthed by Mrs Bates as a thief.The cinematography and lighting is gorgeous, and the 1920s is a really interesting period to focus on.

60,ethanbresnett,Everything you love from the show but on the big screen - what's not to like?,7,1 July 2020,"The first and most important thing to note is that Downton Abbey is in no way a standalone film. Sometimes adaptions of TV, video game or other mediums come along which can be enjoyed without any previous knowledge of the characters or world, but this is not one of those films. This is very much an extension of the programme. I have watched the first three or four seasons of Downton, but not the subsequent ones, and there were a few new characters and gaps that I had to fill in. Without any knowledge of the characters and their quirks, this film just wouldn't work at all. That's not a criticism of the film at all, as I thought it did well not to dwell on exposition or clunkily going over old ground. More of a warning that if you aren't a Downton viewer this may not be for you.That being said, lets get into it. The plot was everything you could want from a Downton film and was really fun. There was all the usual carnage you'd expect downstairs and the usual dramas and conflicts upstairs. I'd say the emphasis was definitely more on the downstairs gang, with characters like Hugh Bonneville's Robert and Elizabeth McGovern's Cora getting less screen time than you may expect. Downton really does have a great cast, and as expected all of them brought their usual top performances to the big screen. There were also wonderful additions in Imelda Staunton and David Haig. Both of them integrated into the cast well, which can't be overlooked when most of the other cast members have been working together for many years. Overall there really isn't anything to complain about with the cast at all, they were all great!The only major criticism from me is that there were so many different plot threads going on. This isn't to say it was a confusing plot at all, just that it felt very jam packed, to the detriment of several of the plot points. I think there was a bit of a failure to completely transition from TV into film. A lot of these plot points may have benefitted from having several episodes to pan out, but conflict was introduced and resolved all too quickly in the film. That being said none of the plot points were bad at all, and they all had individual merit. Just as a collective piece it was a tad busy for my liking.All of the other aspects of the film were spot on, as with the show. The costume and set design were impeccable, the score magical, and the overall feel and atmosphere of the film lovely and joyous! You can't go wrong with a good period piece can you?If you are a fan of Downton watch this without any hesitation, however if you are yet to watch the show, definitely get that under your belt before diving into this.",Downton Abbey

However, the show is kinda one note at times, and with british content, especially from pre WW2 times, things are just kinda stale and rigid.
IF it wasa comedy, it would be different, but the days of people loving these old foppish era or prim and proper era europeon dramas is coming to an end for many. I know it is for me. King and queen stop by, by they were a small footnote in the tedious business of the cooks and servants, as they were in the show. Still, I am biased since I do like period drama only WHEN THEY ARE GOOD...this however, gets a 5 out of 10. It was average to okay. NOt a real conclusion to the show, and really, the show was better.

It was way underdeveloped I think.Then there's the ""Andy-Daisy""-subplot which was totally forced and useless aswell.Theeen there's the ""Kill-the-king"" subplot which was so ridiculously underdeveloped and VERY VERY predictable...There are a couple other of that sort so thats a real minus for me for this movie.But the set, the directing, the costumes and the characters were really well done.And the best part was Maggie Smith, as she was in the show.

72,herbqedi,Magnificent and Brilliant! Old-Fashioned Moving Making at its Best,10,23 September 2019,"To all my fellow AARP members and my fellow members of the Cinema Cafe and TCM Facebook Groups: This is a Must See - especially for those of you who proudly say they haven't gone to see a movie since The King's Speech or before because none of them are worth watching: bad writing, too much violence, cursing, sex, montages, pop music, etc. and bad acting.Not Downton Abbey. This could have easily been made by a host of great British Directos from the 1940;s through the 1960's. it is a delightful whirlwind of a ride but perfectly paced. There are what would normally be considered way too many subplots but they mesh seamlessly and completely understandable hear and with humor and pacing, perfect cinematography and ideal background music.In fact, the entire movie is entirely more bouncy (never thought I'd be using that word for this kind of movie but it fits), light-hearted and uplifting than things I expected to be reminded of such as Howard's End, Remains of the Day and other class-conscious dramas. Full dsiclosure: I never watched the series. I did watch two dozen or so episodes of Upstairs Downstairs in the day and found it interesting enough to watch but not compelling enough to be addicted to - in general I don't get addicted to soaps.And that's the most surprising thing about this movie - it does not play like a soap opera. It plays like a stand-alone movie even when you know that most of the other people in the audience are more familiar with the charactrs than you. And I did not get lost or confused or felt left out from something I needed to know but didn't.It's also a true ensmble piece. His Lord and Her Ladyship are listed first in the cast as they should be but do not have as much screen time and are really not any more and perhaps less intrinsic to what is about to unfold even though they are most certainly inextricable parts of it. And delightfully, Maggie Smith, Elizabeth McGovern and Imelda Staunton are as much in the center of things as anyone else and their subplots are marvelous.Actually, the closest thing the movie has to a star or lead character is Tom played brilliantly and seemingly effortlessly by Allen Leech who impressed me positively in supporting roles in Bohemian Rhapsody and The Imitation Game but exhibits raw star quality here. And oh those eyes and that face, just perfect from every perspective and especially in conveying the heroic yet conflicted essence of his character, bruised by past skirmishes and being widower but not unbowed. He is the only one central to at least 3 subplots, all interesting and freshly exposed and told. But the entire ensemble - all of whom I assume were regulars in the series - with wondeful guest stars. Simon Jones and Geraldine James are brilliant as the visiting King and Queen. Mark Addy is hilarious and heartwarming in his one scene as a prideful local butcher.As an old-timer, today's movies rarely impress me as candidates for my chronicles of my favorites of all-time. I keep a list of 500 which I update annually and fewer than 10 from this century are currently on it. This tops my list of candidates for next year's review.If you are over 50 or a fan of the series or love intelligent writing and dialog with terrific characters and acting, SEE DOWNTON ABBEY!!!",Downton Abbey

Not to worry because the King's staff including the kitchen staff will take over all functions while the King and Queen are in house. This very much upsets all the Downton Abbey staff. Lady Mary Talbot (Michelle Dockery) may want to sell Downton Abbey as she wants a simple, quiet life and not this one with all the demands placed on Royalty.What comes at us in a flurry are names, titles, and we have a hard time remembering all. But not to worry, we found that by admiring all the architecture of the Abbey (looks like a castle), the furniture, the magnificent rooms, and manicured lawns outside, we feel kind of satisfied. For those into costumes of the period, there's that for them. The dialogues by all a pure joy to listen to as we hear some good lines, and quite a bit of sniping at each other and all rather funny too.Maud (Imelda Staunton) and Violet (Maggie Smith) settle their feud in a way regarding an inheritance issue. This is probably the biggest plot in here. We see an Assassination Attempt on the King George V. Not to worry: unsuccessful. We see a Royal Valet pay the bail for someone caught by police at a gay bar; we see a dressmaker admit to stealing from a night stand in Downton Abbey; We see Violet tell Lady Mary Talbot she had some medical tests done and won't be around much longer.We also see the King's staff sent away by a bogus telephone call allowing the way for the Downton Abbey Staff to finish serving the King and Queen and they are so proud to do it. The King finds out and there is silence and there is an apology and silence again. Then Queen Mary says they are used to people behaving strangely around them. Not to worry, eh? We see new romance between Lucy and Tom Branson (Allen Leech). Lady Mary Talbot is the daughter of Robert Crawley (Hugh Bonneville) and has made a decision regarding selling Downton Abbey. She will inherit Downton Abbey in time.Notables: There are many, but I don't know all, but here are a few: Jim Carter as Mr. Carson, Downton Abbey's Butler former; and David Haig as Mr. Wilson, the King's Butler. And sparks fly between these two; Hugh Bonneville as Robert Crawley, the Earl of Grantham and is the owner of Downton Abbey.I never saw the TV serios, but am told all the characters on the TV show helped make the movie. There are too many subplots to describe in here. I think I hit the main ones. Great job by all the cast. Kudos The music and dancing at the end will cheer anyone up. (9/10)Violence: No.
Sex: No
Nudity: No.
Humor: Yes, Quite a bit at times.

74,bastos,For fans of the series,6,19 May 2020,"If you liked the series, you'll like the movie. This feels more like a Christmas special than a full fleshed out movie, or like they had the ideas for a seventh season and decided to cram it all in a two hour movie. I started out liking the series but like most series it overstayed it's welcome and by the end of the sixth season I had grown tired of most characters or simply just didn't like them (the Marigold subplot being a fine example), and it turned into a soap opera of who marries who or who's the next to die. The movie just reminded me of some annoying characters and forced subplots that populated the latter half of the show. Nevertheless excellent production design and attention to detail of a time that seems so long ago.",Downton Abbey

There's just enough exposition to satisfy new fans and not annoy old ones.The acting is, as usual, spot on. Each character keeps their wonderful character development and is even more happy and pleasant to watch.The ending of the film is beautiful and gives perfect closure to the fans, with no loose ends left untied.The only weak link in the whole movie was Thomas, who I was really hoping they'd give more attention to. After being dismissed from being butler while the royals are there, the movie seems to just... forget about him, instead only using him to remind the audiance that a gay character is present.

Brava!",Downton Abbey
87,eelen-seth,"You'll laugh, you'll cheer and you'll definitely want more.",7,12 September 2019,"It's been almost four years, since the final episode of Downton Abbey aired on television and we had to say goodbye to the Crawley family. Who would've thought, there was more to explore and another story to tell? As things usually turn out after a successful series, the creators decided to bring back the entire cast (excluding Lily James, for no particular reason) and give the fans what they've been hoping for - a full length feature on the silver screen.During the final episode of Downton Abbey, we witnessed Lady Mary Crawley (Michelle Dockery) take over Downton Abbey. We jump 18 months in time and everything seems to be running smoothly, although Lady Crawley doubts there'll be a future for the estate. When a letter arrives to announce a visit from King George V (Simon Jones) and Queen Mary (Geraldine James), everyone gets excited, until the royal butler and company arrive. They are here to make sure everything goes according to plan, while the estate's crew gets pushed aside as if they don't know how to handle things. What follows is a class war, behind the scenes of Downton Abbey.Of course this doesn't go unnoticed and tensions in the house rise, when Lady Mary invites retired former butler of the house, Carson (Jim Carter) to help in preparing for the royal visit, and thus pushing aside Thomas Barrow (Robert James-Collier) who had taken over his duties. Several subplots, including a snatching maid and a big secret surrounding Violet Crawley's (a scene stealing Maggie Smith) cousin, Lady Bagshaw (Imelda Staunton) keep you entertained throughout the film.Director Michael Engler and writer Julian Fellowes, who both also originally directed and wrote the series, are back and bigger than ever - even the well-known tune of the series sounds grander and more majestic. They introduce new characters, to bring happy endings to beloved favourites who never got one in the first place, and leave the door ajar for another story to be told. The film doesn't explain every character's background to watchers who aren't familiar with the series. This is clearly made for the fans, who'll love every single minute of it. You'll laugh, you'll cheer and you'll definitely want more. Visiting Downton Abbey and the Crawley family is something we should do more often. It feels good to see them all together again.Published on intoscreens.com",Downton Abbey

89,jackjack-2,VERY DISAPPOINTING!,2,19 March 2020,"My wife and I as well as my married daughter are Downton Abbey affictionados and looked forward to this film only to be very disappointed. While we were happy to see the cast again, the plot was too contrived, unlike the original episodes. There was no problem with the basic concept that the Crowleys were hosting the King and Queen if the film had left it at that. But the machinations to the plot were unrealistic and contrived.One unrealistic machination was that the Crowleys were to host a parade. Utter nonsense. The King and Queen were only staying at Downton Abbey overnight on their trip to another large home for a ball. So why would they have a parade in the middle of nowhere. That required the movement of a band and a large contingent of Calvary and troops from their remote posts to Downton Abbey.Now consider in the TV series, the nearest village to Downton Abbey was very small and which was supported by Downton Abbey. But in the movie, it becomes a large town. This is necessary in the movie to provide not only an audience for the parade but also for all the other unrealistic hijinks such as the plot to kill the king.However, the large town was necessary to make the final scene involving Thomas Barrow, the gay butler believable. The town had to be big enough to support the number of gays involved in the final scene. The whole scene was not pertinent to the film and only served as a distraction to the central theme of the film which was the royal visit to Downton Abbey. It appears as another effort for gays to tell their story. There is nothing wrong about being gay but why keep shoving it in viewers' faces, particularly when it was not relevant to the film. It only left a bad taste about the movie.One is left with the impression that this is not the last viewers will see of Downton Abbey. The ending of the film seemed to leave open the possibility that there will be a sequel film. Hope that they get it right next time.",Downton Abbey

You get the familiar faces, Carson, the ""gravitas"" Butler, and the inimitable Mrs Patmore sporting an even larger cow-pat expression than before. Just a little too contrived and stodgy, with plot-twists that led nowhere, and a lot of unnecessary blurb about traditions, blah, blah, yawn.

94,Sunsphxsuns,WHY DOWNTON ABBEY WORKS SO WELL ON THE BIG SCREEN,9,23 September 2019,"Let's get right to the point here: If you missed the PBS TV Series, Downton Abbey, which ran from 2010-2015, then you may have a difficult time easing into this beautifully executed feature film of the same name. Conversely, if you committed to watching the entire TV series (52 episodes plus a beautiful finale), you will be amply rewarded in more ways than simply seeing your favorite UK historical soap opera brought back to blazing life on the big screen.It's been 3 long years and a quite a lot has transpired since we last visited the Grand Old Mansion and her lovable occupants. Downton Abbey (2019) gently picks up where the series left off in 2015. It is 1927, roughly two ""television years"" have passed since the Downton Christmas Special. For me, it felt like I was attending the best homecoming I could ever imagine. You can put aside any fears you have, because with a few exceptions the Downton gang is all there: Mr. And Mrs. Crawley, Lady Mary, Lady Violet, Lady Edith, Tom Branson, Mr. And Mrs. Bates, Carson and his wife Mrs. Hughes, Mr. Molesley, Thomas Barrow, Daisy, Mrs. Patmore, and many more, plus some new characters that quietly stir things up for the Abbey's wealthy and ""not so wealthy."" How can I best describe the experience? In baseball terms, Downton Abbey isn't a mere home run - It's a freaking Grand Slam!All of the actors, creator/writer Julian Fellowes, and director Michael Engler deserve genuine Oscar nods for preserving the beauty and continuity of this wonderful canvas. Downton is bigger than life this time around, even though it is the same house, the same village, the same theme music, and the same general sub-plots. Obviously, this franchise supports a very large and talented cast, and because of this, a few cameo appearances simply don't get enough screen time to make an impact. Nevertheless, the focus remains consistent, with emphasis on dialogue and character development, and the payoff is huge.Given the number of great films that have emerged in 2019, Downton Abbey manages to satisfy its fan base as well as create enough enthusiasm to warrant a sequel. For Downton's writers, the question of ""Where do we go from here"" has been dutifully addressed. The answer is, ""Anywhere we want!""",Downton Abbey

100,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,A Royal Visit to Downton Abbey,8,7 January 2020,"The Stream: Better if you have some knowledge of the series, but enjoyable nonetheless.The Big Screen: The majesty and opulence of Downton Abbey in all its glory and that iconic theme gets stuck in your head.The Final Bill: A must-see for Downton Abbey fans, and not a bad couple hours for the general audience.-Trip FontaineWelcome back to Stream to Big Screen! This week we bring to you a review of the popular PBS miniseries turned drama series brought to the big screen, Downton Abbey!It's 1927, and Downton Abbey is still up and running. Not much seems to have changed since we last saw the Crawleys on the small screen. Lady Mary and, brother-in-law, Tom Branson are still running the business of the Abbey. Lady Edith is happily married although the life as Marchioness of Hexham is not as fulfilling as she had hoped. Robert and Cora continue blissful married life. The Dowager Countess is as quippy as ever. And, the staff keep the whole thing chugging along.After the series ended three years ago, other than pure fan service, the occasion that brings us back to Downton is that the King and Queen are coming to the Abbey for a royal luncheon, a parade and a dinner. It sends everyone in a tizzy, both upstairs and downstairs. It really just becomes pure fun to see the preparation for a royal visit - the food, the wardrobe changes, the pomp and circumstance. Beyond that, this cast of characters trading barbs and knowing glances is just what the Downton fan ordered. Each character gets his or her moment to shine. Maggie Smith is always a standout here. Julian Fellowes' script is laced with one-liners and tender touches that are expected of the best Downton Abbey episode.There are a couple subplots to fill out the story that do not amount to much, but are fine diversions. Everything seems to work out in the end. Time goes by, but ultimately, it seems that Downton Abbey will endure.For the Downton fans, it is absolutely worth it to see in the theater. The sets and costumes never looked as good as they do on the big screen. Just being back at the dinner table amidst the back and forth of the Dowager Countess and Lady Isobel is enough for a 2 hour stay. The theme of Downton comes on and you're just swept away.For those who did not watch the series, it is still a good movie. It is funny and light. The film is well-paced and beautiful to look at. The only slight hesitation is whether history of the characters is necessary for enjoyable viewing, but it's good enough that without any foreknowledge of the history of the family someone willing to see Downton will enjoy it.",Downton Abbey
101,helenbassett,"Downton Abbey Film Review - Michael Engler Directs Intrigue, Love & Mutiny Among The Tiaras And Cut-Glass Vowels - But It Still Needs A New Roof",9,25 September 2019,"Downton Abbey might need a new roof, but the owners of Highclere Castle, with the financial receipts from Julian Fellowes's creation, will never have to worry about scraping the money together for such a tricky problem. Michael Engler directs the film starring the cast of regulars, plus some new Royals. For Downton Abbey is expecting a visit from only the King of England.George V and Queen Mary on their tour of Yorkshire are stopping off at Downton on their way to Harewood House. Another gorgeous country house in Yorkshire. How lovely for the Crawley family. A chance to wear their finery and Lady Edith, Laura Carmichael's new Marchioness of Hexham, has just had a new gown made and she can wear that. Her days are full of charity and chat, her days of being an independent working woman are long gone. And Maggie Smith is on cracking form with her pithy one-liners and withering looks as Violet Crawley, the Dowager Duchess.And Allen Leech's Tom Branson, the Irish chauffeur not so long ago, but married into the family now, might have his own opinions about the Royal visit, but in 1927 Ireland has Independence, and we are now the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. But not all of Ireland is free as the UK retains Northern Ireland. There is bound to be someone watching his every move. But whose watching them?Barrow, the villain in the past at Downton Abbey, and now the new Butler, played by Robert James-Collier, may not be up to such a grand event at Downton thinks Michelle Dockery's Lady Mary, so takes it upon herself to ask Carson the retired Butler to come back for the visit. This gives Barrow some R&R time in York that is actually really special for him. A nice touch by Julian Fellowes. And gets all of the Downton staff back under the roof, while also giving Jim Carter's Carson a career highlight to end his 'Butlering' days.Problem for the staff though is the Royals bring their own Royal staff for continuity, and they have a habit of just taking over. Now many a staff member would like to take a break, and read a book suggests David Haig's Mr Wilson, the Page of the Back Stairs or some other historic Royal title for a Butler. But our Downton Abbey staff aren't going to lie down and allow others to just take over the running of their house on this special occasion. Even deciding the food that will be served. Mrs Patmore the cook and Daisy the under cook, Lesley Nicol and Sophie McShera, visit their grocer played by Mark Addy and he is so excited about the (secret!) news, and that he will be supplying the Royal Household, and has even gone to the trouble of adding extra items to the regular Downton Abbey grocery list. The Beamish Museum provided an amazing ready made set with its railway, trams and Edwardian style shops and street. The museum should become part of the Downton Abbey film trail with Harewood House. Tickets available for the tour at the end of the review!Meanwhile Daisy however is not overawed by the Royal visit like Mrs Patmore and the rest of the staff, and she cannot bear for Mrs Patmore to tell Mr Bakewell that Downton will not be doing the Royal catering. So she adds more to the order and off they go. That extra food may come in handy. Or they can just eat it gradually!With a huge cast both Upstairs and Downstairs everyone gets at least a few lines and chance to shine.But there's intrigue upstairs with the Dowager Duchess determined to ensure her son the Earl becomes heir to her cousin's Estate. While Imelda Staunton's Maud is Lady-in-Waiting to the Queen, and she won't be pushed around by Violet. If she wants to leave her Estate to her maid then she jolly well will. Tuppence Middleton, with a name made for Downton Abbey, is the lucky recipient of such an act of folly, as Violet would say. But you could also say that Hugh Bonneville's Earl of Grantham has enough with Downton Abbey anyway. Mary will inherit it, and Lady Edith has Hexham so they're sorted. Although Tom as Lady Sybil's widow won't inherit anything for his daughter, so maybe there might be an Estate for him somewhere? In Downton Abbey 2? Violet seems determined anyway.But below stairs they aren't worried about who inherits what, because the honour of Downton is at stake, and our plucky house staff are determined that they will have their mutinous day. Joanne Froggatt's Anna is the link between Upstairs and Downstairs and will see that all dresses fit for the great ball. And honourable mention to Kevin Doyle's Mr Moseley, who perhaps needs to perfect his curtsy just a bit, but was a jabbering hit.With sumptuous costumes by Anna Robbins, borrowing Queen Elizabeth's tiara designs and designing a stunning gown for Lady Mary in a Fortuny pleated style. And with stunning production design by Donal Woods, Downton Abbey is gorgeous. An Agatha Christie without a murder!, and made for a Christmas Day evening with a tin of Quality Street. If it at times over egged the nog it was playing to the audience tastes and good fun. And everyone found a love or the possibility of there being love in the Happy Ending. No car crashes the Christmas!Downton Abbey full cast.",Downton Abbey
102,VintageSoul56,What I Expected,9,24 September 2019,"I've seen it twice within a 48 hour period, once by myself and then with a friend. ""Downton Abbey"" was what I expected. It was like watching two one hour episodes strung together. It was like being in my livingroom on a Sunday evening, only with a much larger screen. My idea of a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours. The core characters haven't changed, the sets haven't, the introduction of new characters. It transports me to an era that I don't think exists very much anymore, unless you're part of or involved somehow with the British Royal Family. Maggie Smith was, again, ready for one of her tart remarks that made me chuckle. Well, now that the Crawley family and their devoted servants have survived a royal vist from King George V and Queen Mary, I say bring us more! I can see at least two more films from this. How does the Crawley family survive the Great Depression and the Second World War.",Downton Abbey
103,freewillyfan,Downton Abbey (possible minor spoilers),8,31 October 2019,Downton Abbey was a good time at the theatre. I was a fan of the TV series and I was nervous about them doing a movie especially since I didn't think they should do a movie. The trailers did not work for me which did not make me feel better about this. Well I was wrong and I had a fun time watching it. It is well performed and funny with a good plot that you don't have to concentrate too much on. Non of the characters were ruined which I was nervous about. Some small plots from the TV series were not kept in this and because this is a 2 hours movie and not a TV series some characters did not get as much screen time. But overall a fun time and I think many fans of the series will be satisfied with this.8.5/10,Downton Abbey
104,Opinate,meh,6,21 January 2020,I feel like the core cast was all but written out of this feature that revolved around anyone but the characters I wanted to see.

Our favorite characters field a royal visit and the royal entourage messes with Downton Abbey's downstairs staff. Mosesley was especially humorous whilst suffering an acute case of royal awestruck. The plot was really well done, giving each character enough screen time. Some might complain Lady Mary didn't have much presence, but she was never my favorite anyway.

Also, I noticed that those who were without love in their lives (Tom Branson, Thomas Barrow), were provided someone in which to start a budding romance.

You don't learn anything and there is very very little character development .Honestly if you never watched the show this would be incredibly confusing.

I found the series interesting and got to know the characters and their quirks. When the movie was announced, I thought it would just be another money grab. Usually the story is poor and the acting is phoned in. Quite the opposite was true. The story was decent and the actors did a great job. They maintained the personalities of the series. If you did not watch the series you would probably find the movie less enjoyable, but that is true for any sequel. As was mentioned by others, the gay segment was unnecessary and totally out of context in the movie. It did not spoil the movie, but it certainly added nothing and it never occurred in the series.

I knew within the first 10 minutes it was not for me.Perhaps you have to have seen - and loved - the television series, or perhaps you have to be British, or perhaps you long for times long past, or perhaps you are landed gentry, or perhaps you just like to look at elaborate locations and interior dressings and costumes and not care a penny about substance.In my wildest dreams Brexit will lessen the export of British films about how great Great Britain is... or rather, was.If you want a fun, deliciously wicked and intelligent big ensemble film about this class of people and their servants from the same era, do watch Robert Altman's ""Gosford Park"" which has a neat mystery at its centre.Better yet, I doubt if anything can ever outdo the Charles Sturridge/Michael Lindsay-Hogg 1981 11-episode serialisation of ""Brideshead Revisited,"" which launched the international career of Jeremy Irons and has an ensemble which includes Laurence Olivier, Claire Bloom, John Gielgud, and an unforgettable, career-defining performance from Anthony Andrews as Sebastian Flyte.Not only does it have all the pomp and glory of English manor life, it covers 20 years of every class culminating in the Second World War. It also remains remarkably and passionately faithful to Evelyn Waugh's novel, a masterwork of 20th century literature.As for ""Downton Abbey,"" it come across as nothing more than toff embroiled in a second rate soap opera in which the entire budget was spent on window dressing rather than a substantive script.",Downton Abbey
112,Bachfeuer,The series is dead. Long live the franchise!,8,13 September 2019,"Appealing characters and superb casting have always been the chief ingredients in DA's success. The film gives us a panorama--a three-ring circus--peopled by them. Lame plot devices continue to be a part of the charm. For the first third, the dialogue gets too cute and clever by half. But it recovers from that in good time. I look forward to what the depression and WWII will bring.
As a car guy, I lament the automotive anachronisms. While Branson was still a chauffeur in 1919, His Lordship somehow acquired the maroon 1924 Sunbeam limousine that appears in nearly every TV episode. But somehow, it is absent from the film. (Was Matthew's not the only car crash?) By 1927, the Downton men have become a Ford dealer. A glimpse of Model Ts in their showroom is all we get of this potentially interesting development. The king arrives in a then-ancient brass era Napier with acetylene headlights. Producers, please make use of the help the collector car community has to offer!",Downton Abbey

King George V (Simon Jones) and Queen Mary (Geraldine James) will be paying a visit to the Crawleys, which means panic stations downstairs as the servants - including Jim Carter's out-of-retirement butler, Carson - must contend with the royal household's snooty staff.
Just as much of a to-do awaits upstairs, where Maggie Smith's Lady Violet, as acid-tongued as ever, faces the arrival of her estranged cousin, Lady Maud Bagshaw (Imelda Staunton), and her maid, Lucy (Tuppence Middleton). A credit to Fellowes, this is just a fraction of the storylines and characters he juggles, not least as Michelle Dockery's Lady Mary must consider the future of Downton. While Engler effortlessly shuffles between the haves and the have-nots, the humour stays effervescent, ranging from Smith's withering quips to the moment King George is finally served. Somehow, Fellowes wraps it all up with amazing grace, with life, death and a poignant finale that should satisfy the die-hards and casuals alike.",Downton Abbey

The characters were so flushed out during the series like the Avengers in their solo movies.This movie is almost perfect! This is the final episode that we should've received at the end of the series.With so many characters and more royal characters added for the movie, I was afraid things would feel cramped. They tied the movie together in a good way. They also left it open so I'm completely okay with receiving a new Downton Abbey movie every 3 or 4 years.The humor is there. The family drama is there. Everything is there. I only have two minor complaints.1: Jim Carter; I love Carson. He's my favorite. Out of all the characters, I felt that Carter was the only one that didn't fall back into his role. Since he is my favorite, I could've just been overly critical of him. He's still great but the royal cast really muddled things and made some of the characters not have a purpose.2: Maggie Smith; We all love Maggie. I laughed at all of her funny parts. It did seem that the writers relied on her to carry quite a few scenes in the movie. I feel like a few of her scenes weren't needed.Should this have been in the theater?

I also appreciated the glimmers of democratic sentiment in the portrayal of LUCY SMITH and her mother and how the dowager lady Crawley took it all. The fellow playing Tom Branson was also very good.

I'm looking forward to watching this again.,Downton Abbey
118,ToneBalone60,Visually exquisite. Artistically & creatively forgettable.,7,20 February 2020,"Cinematically lush, overtime hamstrung by a pedestrian meandering plot that went nowhere leaving a promise unfulfilled.Character development was inconsistent, too many stereotypes
Good characters left the show due to other contractual commitments ( a common problem with multi- season shows) eg: losing Jessica brown Findlay and Dan Stevens so early, or because they were underdeveloped by the writers. For instance the backstory of the gay footman played by Rob Collier, was completely dropped after season 2 and his character sidelined and then removed. ( I suspect this was probably due to appeasing the conservative American market).
Maggie Smith, ( no question about her acting skills & wonderful presence) but as usual, lazily cast as the cartoon caricature Dutchess. ( We have seen this identical character so many times: ""Room with a view"" "" The best exotic Marigold hotel"".....).
Generally the plot or lack of, was the weakest link. All over the place with many interesting plots going nowhere or forgotten by the writers.
Other sub plots were drawn iutwere boring and irrelevant or a badly researched attempts to make a points about social injustice and upheaved.
Difficult to feel anything for the Crawleys a pampered family with a pompous Lord. Do we really care what happens to them? No.
Then we had the stereotypical cap dothing working class land tenants and the ridiculous notion that an Irish communist activist should suddenly be elevated to landowner status and then moving in and pomping it up with his Lordship with an increasingly rotund belly to match. (Allen Leech). The plot was so pedestrian that one quickly forgets what miraculous event occured to result in such an odd and anachronistic shift in social status. (Its usually the long lost legacy or discovery of blue blooded heritage~ always a quick way out for writers).Series 1 was exceptional without doubt, catapulting the show to global popularity. Everyone likes a good period piece with lavish costumes and a big budget.
The viewers investment was rewarded sure enough for a further 2 seasons before the inevitable rot set in and the plot meandering began. At the commencement of season 5 we are well into ""how can we keep this money spinner going without too much creative effort"" territory.It earned its position as one of the most popular TV shows of all-time but as a metaphor for the period, as a representation of the historical fiction genre, it is unfortunately, largely forgettable.",Downton Abbey

Excellent soundtrack, great repartee, scenery is so perfect, and several entertaining side issues that will not distract you from the heart of the movie. It will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy. You will not be disappointed. I'm surprised the overall score isn't closer to 9 than 8.",Downton Abbey
120,ChristianLeFeuvre,Such a beautiful movie for all fans of the show,10,23 September 2019,"There have been a few TV shows that have had the big-screen treatment, and most of them haven't worked at all, 'Porridge', 'The Flintstones', 'The Saint' to name but a few. The same can't be said for the 'Downton Abbey' movie.....
this is a fabulous film.A letter bringing news of a visit from King George V and Queen Mary to Downton sees both the family and staff in both excitement and panic as they make sure everything goes well. When the royal staff turn up ahead of the visit, their orders to the Downton staff don't go down well and a rebellion to maintain the honour of the house ensues.Fans of the TV series will not be disappointed.The film picks up the British aristocratic action in the fall of 1927, just shy of two years after the events of the series finale, and makes no attempt to provide exposition or background to anyone who may be unfamiliar with the members of the Crawley family or the staff who serves them, which was good because I believe, to do so would have killed the pace of the film.
All the favourites are back, and it was nice to see some strong storylines for both Tom Branson and Barrow, played perfectly by Allen Leech and Robert James-Collier respectively. However, that being said every character gets their moment to shine. Joanne Froggatt never disappoints as Mrs Bates, and Lesley Nichol as cook Mrs Patmore is just as formidable as ever.Dame Maggie Smith, of course, stole every scene she was in as the Dowager Countess Violet Crawley. Penelope Wilton is back as Lady Isobel, and her constant snipping with Violet is on-going from the TV show. Jim Carter is back as the proud former butler Carson, and the scene of him walking up the drive to the house showed his pleasure at being asked back to the house to take charge.
Michelle Dockery is wonderful as Lady Mary, and Laura Carmichael returns as the ever troubled Lady Edith. There were some new faces in amongst the regulars and it was delightful to see Imelda Staunton as Lady Bagshaw, and Tuppence Middleton as her maid Lucy Smith.
The costumes are as ever, immaculate, the cinematography is magnificent and everything looks even more beautiful than it did on television.
As soon as the first few notes of that unmistakeable theme tune started, you just get lost in the wonder of that time and lifestyle.
One thing writer Julian Fellows does so well, is add characters that make you think ""hang on, what's he/she up to?"". There were a good few in the TV series and he did not disappoint in the movie either. From a shady character, seemingly investigating Branson before the royal visit, to a member of the royal staff that takes an interest in Barrow. You're never quite sure what's the reasoning behind their interest until the 'reveals', which will have you both shocked and delighted.
Wonderful cast, terrific storylines, some brilliantly funny lines for both Mrs.Patmore and of course, Violet Crawley, and a beautifully played scene near the end which had me shedding a couple of tears. It was a beautifully filmed and well-paced movie.
I am a huge fan of Downton Abbey and was very excited about the film's release, and I was not disappointed.",Downton Abbey
121,michaeldoud,First Hit: This film attempted to be significant in scope and ended up small and lacked being an engaging story.,1,24 September 2019,"First Hit: This film attempted to be significant in scope and ended up small and lacked being an engaging story.I never watched any of this series on television as every preview just looked trite and uninteresting. Although I cannot speak for the series, the film was mostly dull and certainly wasn't worth my time. I guess there's a real group of people who feel different because there were two women in front of me, purchasing tickets, dressed up in costume from the era.Most of the film revolves around how the Downton Abbey house staff dislikes being replaced by the royal team when the King and Queen of England (Simon Jones and Geraldine James respectively) come to spend a night at the house. For the staff, it is about personal pride in themselves and their abilities to serve the royals. Without much background I found this trite.Then there is the discussion around who will get Downton Abbey. Violet Crawley (Maggie Smith) wants her grandchild to run the show after she's gone. But unknown to her, her younger sister Maude (Imelda Staunton) who had a child (Lucy Smith played by Tuppence Middleton) out of wedlock who is the rightful heir. That drama plays out in a couple of sarcastic and quippy conversations. My internal response to these scenes was that they were tired and ""so what.""The most exciting set of scenes were about how gay men had their own bawdy nightclub, and it was raided by the police. As being publicly gay in England was illegal at the time, it was interesting to see how the men handled it and how they were able to connect with each other given society's norms.Despite the grandeur of Downton Abbey in many of the shots long-range shots, I found the scenes and sets, less engaging and somewhat drab. The whole story about a thieving seamstress had little value.I don't think any of the actors are worth a mention because the whole film felt flat, fell flat, and reaffirmed why I did not choose to watch the television series. Julian Fellowes wrote a tiresome screenplay that might interest a small segment of the population, but I couldn't engage. I'm not sure even the fans of the television series would find this story of any interest. Michael Engler directed this tiresome story in a lackluster way.Overall: Simply uninteresting.",Downton Abbey

Immediately I recognized it as a historical study depicting the English aristocracy and their dependency on those who served them, all under the same roof. Then, after full-recovery from heart surgery, I slowly lost interest. Since it now is a movie, I was hoping that it would reach out to a general-population-audience. Instead, it was simply flat and uninteresting . . . but well done, nevertheless.I would have loved to see conversation between royalty and the Crawley aristocracy. None of that. The time period involves the late 1920's while Europe was going through tremendous social change and Britain, save for a few, remained basically apathetic. Any dialogue could have adequately suggested this. But no. Instead, of greatest concern is Thomas's unjust treatment for having been arrested in a 'molly house' as a pervert. Please. If you want to see a brilliant film set in post-industrial Salford, England about a17-year-old schoolgirl who gets pregnant and then befriends a homosexual,see 'A Taste of Honey,' 1961.",Downton Abbey
126,Teyss,Good series = Good movie? No.,4,1 October 2019,"With scores of millions of fans worldwide, ""Downton Abbey"" series (2010-2015) is already a classic. Why not produce a movie? The issue is we are more exigent when going to the theatre than when watching TV at home, and rightfully so.At home, we do not move, we do not pay, we watch a relatively small screen with lights on, we talk with our partner, we search for information on a tablet, we look at our mobile, etc. In short, we are not very attentive. And we unconsciously compare the series with others that roughly have the same downsides, regardless of potential qualities: action is sometimes repetitive since it runs for hours; a few events are far-fetched to maintain attention on the long term; characters are frequently two-dimensional; plot and style trigger easy emotions.When going to the movie theatre, we need to move, we need to pay, we watch a large screen in the dark, we are attentive, we expect to get our time's and money's worth. And we unconsciously compare the film with others that can be quite elaborate. To summarise, series are mostly about entertainment whilst movies are more about art.In this context, ""Downton Abbey"" movie feels like Episode 7.1 of the series, happening in 1927 hence just two years after the end of Season 6, instead of a full-scale picture. It delivers absolutely nothing new.There are significant plot holes. How can the Royal Butler (sorry: Page of the Backstairs) and Chef be sequestrated a whole night without consequences? And the entire Royal Staff lured away without investigation? Which mother would keep her own child as a servant for years without telling her the truth, and then continue doing so? Which determined killer would blunder away his scheme to a complete stranger just because he is Irish? Why doesn't Tom warn the police instead of risking the King's live in a ridiculous rescue? How can Andy destroy the boiler and hence ruin the house's reputation just out of misplaced jealousy? How can the Royal dressmaker steal so frequently without ever triggering suspicion? What evidence does Anna display to confound her? None, so blackmailing her makes no sense.There is nothing new about the usual characters. Everybody is sympathetic as always and reacts as expected: it is like seeing old friends. Of course, there are a few new characters but apart from Lady Bagshaw (played by the great Idelma Staunton), none is interesting. Some are a pure caricature, for instance the harsh Lascelles.Situations and emotions are shallow. The relationship between Daisy and Andy is laughable: ""You destroyed the boiler... then I love you!"" The love between Lucy and Tom develops too quickly and superficially, only consisting of a few puerile dialogues, cheap smiles and silly gazes. The bickering between Downton servants and Royal servants is overacted, notably Elsie with the Dresser. The ""drama"" of Edith potentially giving birth while her husband would be away takes gigantic proportions before deflating in a snap. The message from Tom to Princess Mary is utterly futile (""Try your best to make it work""), yet the Princess is moved and follows his advice by trying to convince her stiff husband during the final dance, of all moments. The King's compliment to Tom that he has ""more than one thing to thank him for"" is supposed to impress, but does not. Generally speaking, many dialogues and gazes are too conspicuous. The announcement of Violet's fatal illness vainly tries to compensate for the overall merry-go-round.As the series, the movie mostly shows early 20th century as good old times and aristocracy as a benevolent power. Servants seem to have a relatively enjoyable life. We do not see poverty, inequalities, hardship, even in the village. There is just one comment from the Royal dressmaker about inequalities, but the character is so unfriendly that it is meant to be rejected as indecent. We do see homosexuality repressed, but Thomas escapes unharmed. What happens to the other homosexuals arrested? We will never know, they do not seem to matter. We are in an enchanted bubble. Oh no, actually aristocrats do manage to complain about trivial matters, for instance receptions, the poor creatures.The love between Lucy and Tom as well as Violet's illness ensure the studio can produce a sequel, conveniently renewing the series concept on large screen. Let's squeeze as much cash as possible out of the franchise.Let us pause and think for a short while. Reassuring predictability, happy life, friendly main characters, cheap emotions, fake issues, happy ending: it is a fairy tale for children. I must be too old for that. Granted, settings are magnificent, cinematography is lush, there are no lengths, dialogues are sometimes witty notably between Violet and Isobel, some scenes are funny... exactly as in the series. Yet the movie's quality is probably even lower than the series' because of the downsides listed above, condensed in two hours' time. So if you loved the series, feel like seeing exactly the same in a theatre and are not inconvenienced by blatant flaws, you will be delighted. If you wish to see an original and elaborate piece of art, you can pass.Here I must confess I am not a huge ""Downton Abbey"" fan. Season 1 was excellent, Season 2 was interesting because of the WWI context... and then it turned around in circles for an extra four long seasons. Yes, it was enjoyable and there were new characters and situations, but it was always similar: secrets, revelations, announcements, loves, weddings, deaths, preparing the dinner, the party, the event, etc. Eventually the series culminated in silliness with final Episode 6.9 (""Christmas special""), drowning in rose-scented perfume, where everybody was nice and happy. Interestingly, the same director is responsible for that Episode and the present movie (as well as three other episodes of the series). In this regard, the movie feels like an appropriate continuation.",Downton Abbey

The way you react to that story will be an indicator of how you will react to the movie ""Downton Abbey"".
The cast is first rate. The acting is highly professional. The settings are meticulously correct to period. The question is: ""Why are English people making movies like this?"" Is it, perhaps, that they are aware that they are minor players in the world and, after Brexit, will be even more insignificant? Do English people look fondly of the 19th Century as a time when God was an Englishman and all was right with the world. (This is set in the early 1920s but 19th Century attitudes still prevail.)
Several audience members chuckled knowingly when various servants didn't ""know their place"". It all made me very uncomfortable. Some say that the class system (which is fundamental to Downton Abbey) is the single most significant cause of the decline of England. It seems curious to celebrate it.
If you still feel compelled to salute His Lordships, then this is the movie for you. If, like me, you have little regard for the English upper class, then you might still enjoy this movie as a satire in the same vein as many Monty Python sketches.",Downton Abbey

So, going in I am not a fan of the show and know little about the plotlines or characters of the series. That said I enjoyed myself in this film although I found the film hard to follow at times.Acting across the board is very good with interesting characters and great actors playing them. The cinematography is gorgeous and the period is authentic and beautiful and sucks to right into that time and place. I also enjoyed how simple the story was while also having time to have all these little minor plotlines that are probably continuations of things set up in the series it was very nice.However, while watching the film I kept wondering to myself, why is this a theatrically released film? Honestly aside from the sweeping shots of Downton Abbey there is very little her in terms over wonder that was made for the big screen. It feels very much like a TV movie sent to theaters. I'll compare this with a film that came out this year, HBO's Deadwood: The Movie which was not released in theaters and shouldn't have. I feel the same way with this film.Both films as a whole are good in their own right, but probably better once they sit side by side with their series counterparts. However, this film is made for a specific audience, fans of the show and they will get the most out of it.Downton Abbey is a fun movie with interesting characters and setting that really sucks you on, but you will only get the most out of it if you have watched the series.

131,Erlik_Han,Nostalgia in a good way.,9,2 December 2019,"I did not expect much. I recently watched the deadwood movie, which was ok. I also watched the breaking bad movie, which was a disappointment.Because of that I sorta avoided this movie, worried it might be a disappointment. But wow, it's like time stood still! It was a trip of pure nostalgia and immediately after I was finished with the movie I tried rewatching the show on netflix. To my disappointment I found out they removed the show where I live.Anyway the movie is great for fans of the show. I do wish I rewatched the show before. I was expecting to be disappointed so I did not bother, but watching the show I was surprised to see certain characters that I either thought had passed in the show or left the show or something. It's been a very long time since I saw the show. But even then I felt immediately back home unlike with breaking bad and even deadwood. I knew these people, I knew this house. The theme music gave me a warm feeling like a blanket covering me on a cold winter's night.My biggest criticism is that it's very much a ""feel good"" movie. It's like they made 3 or 2 long episodes and stuck them together..but removed all the drama and much of the serious tone. This isnt necessarily a bad thing, last thing I would have wanted was to return to the abbey and see a financially destroyed family struggling to keep the lights on or something. I mean they obviously have some issues to deal with like the roof but they are doing great. Stronger than ever as a family. All the staff is there etc etc.Regardless.. some parts might have been too much of a fairy tale ending. Like the already very hard to believe irish, republican son in law saga. But, you know what? I was ok with it. I wanted Tom to have this happy ending. I wanted to see Downton Abbey thriving, the family and staff happy, doing well etcI was also incredibly surprised that the cast looked like they had not aged a day. I even wondered if they used digital deaging. But I would probably have noticed it as deaging techniques stick out to me a lot.
If you are a fan of the tv show. 100% watch this. Take that trip back to downton abbey. This movie made me decide I want to rewatch the show.

It started out well and I absolutely loved the whole British feel of the story with the castle-like estate, royals, underclass, customs, etc. Even though there were too many characters, with whom I wasn't familiar, to keep track of, I still enjoyed it. Then came a scene a little over halfway into the movie. One of the principle characters (and a man formerly married to a woman) is persuaded by a perfect stranger to go to a Gay Bar (Pub?) where they begin to dance. What? In turn of the last century England, this was still considered immoral and also illegal.

That is generally what I found different from the early days of the series to the last season. It got soft and had happy endings everywhere in its storyline.

Not things we need from a 1927 drama.Well filmed and locations are great. Seems to have taken somewhat a turn from the TV shows I watched.

Presented by a marvelous cast of brilliant actors, handling the perfect balance of dramatic and comedic situations. Set design as it has always been, sheer eye-candy! The story-line is a flaw here: reducing so many beloved and well-known characters to simple stereotypes, almost citations of themselves, rushing into a cascade of Happy-Ends with too much hurry, due to the two hours of running-time only.
And for all those wood-heads complaining about gay connotations and scenes: GET A LIFE!!!",Downton Abbey
141,tonycarr,Proves that TV shows never make good movies,6,12 January 2020,"I have always been a fan of Downton Abbey and was looking forwards to seeing how it would appear on the big screen. Sadly, not well. To compensate for the fag-paper thin plot they shoehorned in a lot of sub plots that made no sense. An IRA murder plot, Barrow being gay (we already knew that and it's ridiculous to make out that he didn't know there was a gay hangout in his own area), the maid who wasn't and the farcical nonsense of tricking the Palace courtiers. Mr Bates had nothing to do, Mr Mosely was cringing, and I wanted to pour concrete into Daisy's mouth to stop the continual whining.
On the plus side Maggie Smith is brilliant and the scenes between her, Penelope Wilton and Imelda Staunton are by far the best thing in the whole two hours.",Downton Abbey

When we arrived, afternoon matinee, the theater was full! So, we knew we were not alone in being Downton fans.
The story line was great, the cast was great (as always), and done with original style and splendor of the TV series. We loved it!Our only disappointment was pushing the Hollywood gay agenda on us once again. We have nothing against these good folks, but, it does not have to be in every movie or show on TV... folks do get tired of it, thus the reason for not giving it 10 stars.However, overall, we enjoyed the move and being able to see all of our Downton cast members again.",Downton Abbey
143,linobox,Irrelevant and shoddy,4,26 October 2020,"There's so much depth in all the characters from the TV serie that ANY movie is just not enough time to develop their stories. They tried to focus on Branson and Barrow, two characters that certainly had no proper ending before but they come very very short. In fact, they don't get any closure at any level. They should have picked just one story (preferably Branson's) and go on with it. All the royal grandiosity, the lofty locations and glamour characters get completely and unnecessary thrown down in contrast by such a sordid story like Barrow's. On the other hand they had the Cinderella story on the likes of Branson. Still, they can go on with it since, like i mentioned in the title, the movie ends up being so irrelevant that is LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. I give it 4 stars just 'cause is DOWNTON ABBEY!!!",Downton Abbey
144,ronalamont-91472,Took a while to settle into the swing ...,7,15 September 2019,"I agree with another reviewer that it was a risk making the transition from small to big screen but I think they pulled it off better than some others have attempted to do in the past.
I disagree with the boundless praise for the Cinematograpy... it was so grandiose for grandiose sake for at least the first 15mins and I feared I was going to be terribly disappointed in the film if it continues. It's as if the director, DP and camera op were all trying to prove their worthiness as skilled technicians in the movie world rather than that of TV and, for me, it was just distracting and annoying. If I saw one more totally unnecessary and too obvious rack focus I was going to scream. Sweeping grandiose shots from weird angles did not reflect the DA pacing and true spirit that made the series magical and I ""get-it"" that the budget probably afforded them more access to rooms we've never seen before but I think all true ""Die Hards"" are happy with the grand dining room, the entrance hall, ballroom, library, Mary's bedroom, exterior front door and the servants quarters... it's what goes on IN them we care about most. Of course we had been seeing more and more exteriors and gardens and more grand homes interiors in the series but not at the expense of the acting and dialogue. Also, The Costume and Production Design were not as incredibly coordinated and excellent as expected (still great of course) and there were many surprisingly bad make-up and hair disappointments that were nothing to do with being set later in the 20s. I wish they'd used their regular team. Happily, about 20mins in, the direction and shooting style seemed to about turn and settle down into the seamless medium close-ups and the character-driven action we fans are used to enjoying in the TV series.
Personally as a fan, I do have to agree the storyline is a bit weak and implausible at times and agree there was a definite feel of a ""Hallmark Movie"" at times too but the acting was excellent and I want to give a big shout out to Mr Barrow who has superbly portrayed his character arcs brilliantly throughout the series and I was thrilled with his plot developments here (can't give away any spoilers) and his reactions. Mr Moseley had all my cinema audience in fits of laughter as did the usual underhanded quips from Maggie Smith. She always steals the show. Personally, I found the royal servants entourage too ""over-the-top"" and the subsequent behavior of the DA staff implausible. It also seemed to me those were their weakest scenes because I'm sure they felt their behavior was out of character too. Someone described it as more like a ""schoolboy prank"" and I have to agree. Plus Mr Carson would never have allowed the reputation of the house to be in serious jeopardy with such behavior ... royalty must have its protocols after all. So all that was a bit silly. Mr Branson's character was all over the map. Somehow I don't think he'd have been ""saying"" and ""doing"" some of the dialogue and situations he was given and certainly not at the speed he was having to do them.
I didn't like some of the editing throughout the movie and if abrupt cuts worked on the small screen they certainly didn't in the movie version it jerked me out of the flow.
Overall, I came away very happy to have seen it and to have reconnected with my favorite TV family but I have to wonder if I'd have actually enjoyed it more as another 2hr TV special.",Downton Abbey
145,hayley96,I'm rethinking mt thoughts on the show,4,25 December 2019,"I am a fan of Downton Abbey the show. It was a lovely diversion. Apparently creator Julian Fellows didn't get the memo that it was the internal lives of the Downton characters that sold the show. His movie Godsford Park understood that, using a murder mystery as the drop off point to the lives of the wealthy and those who serve them.
But DA the movie is a mess. The King is coming for a visit and the estate is all atwitter. I would be shocked if DA fans aren't also The Crown fans. Between the end DA the show and DA the movie, The Crown showed in equisite detail the rigorous adherence of the Royal staff to archaic rules on every facet of life. So, it's not a surprise that the King's advance people are annoyingly full of themselves. So, Julian, what else do you have? A out of wedlock child? An assination attempt? Granny arguing with everyone?
Ten minutes in my wife said, this is really bad isn't it? Yes, it is. Skip the movie or rent it on DVD and watch the cast interviews - they're funny. Rewatch the show and hope it is as good as you remember it.",Downton Abbey
146,tomfeller,The TV series comes to the big screen,7,8 November 2019,"My wife and I were fans of the television series, which was the mostly highly rated dramatic series in PBS history, and I watched the very first episode on DVD to re-familiarize myself with the characters. I found it interesting that the issues of money and inheritance drove much of the plot in that episode, and those issues turn up in this film as well. The series, influenced by Upstairs, Downstairs, follows an aristocratic family named the Crawleys at their home in Yorkshire and the servants who work for them. It was set from 1912 to 1926 and was basically a high class soap opera. This movie is set in 1927 when King George V (Simon Jones) and Queen Mary (Geraldine James), the grandparents of the current queen, visit them. Almost all of the actors whose characters are still alive in 1927, twenty in all, reprised their roles three years after the show went off the air. (Lily James, a very busy actress, does NOT reprise her role.) Julian Fellowes, the creator and head writer of the show and winner of an Academy Award for his screenplay for 2002's Gosford Park, wrote the screenplay, and he had the leisure to really sharpen the dialogue. The director is Michael Engler, an American who also directed several episodes of the show, and he understands the show well. The big screen allows the viewers to get a really good look at the sites and the costumes. The ballroom scene at the end was filmed at Wentworth Woodhouse, which the king actually visited in 1927.
Maggie Smith (Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham) and Penelope Wilton (Crawley in-law Isobel Merton) are just as good as they were in the show, which was excellent. Two new characters is Lady Maud Bagshaw (Imelda Staunton), a lady-in-waiting to the queen and an estranged cousin of the Crawleys, and her maid Lucy Smith (Tuppence Middleton). Unfortunately, most of other the actors have little to do, because the two hour film does not have the leisure of a 52 episode television series to focus on more than few of the 40 odd characters in this movie. An assassination sub-plot, for example, seemed rather gratuitous. There are no attempts to provide any back story, so if you haven't seen any of the TV episodes, you might be lost. We, on the other hand, found the movie very satisfying.",Downton Abbey

I would have given it 10 stars, but I'm just so sick of them shoving the homosexual way of life down our throats all the time. Right down to Stephen King's new movie opening scene. It wasn't in the book but they sure did make sure to have a 5 minute opening about gay lovers.

And I couldn't get enough of Dame Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess and her biting zingers. She was always my favorite character in the series. This film is filled with humor, social commentary, drama, self-doubt, the longing to be free and able to be who you really are, a budding romance and the cycles of life, but through it all you cheered the characters on, and hoped they would find their happy ending....whatever that may be.

Everything about the movie was brilliant.First of all the cast were nothing short of amazing. It must be hard to resume playing a character after years away from them but they all managed to do it and do it well. Pretty much all the actors returned which was nice for fans and reflective of what a great time they must have had working on the original series. I loved that every character got a moment, no matter how big or small.The writing and directing was spot on. Great to see the original team still has what it takes. Grand yet subtle.The costumes of course were stunning as usual. The attention to detail is very much to be awed.The plot was perfect. It was a new storyline but had all the hallmarks of a great Downton episode. Plenty of laughs, lots of little romantic moments, that ordered chaos we all know and love, and of course a wonderfully acted bittersweet moment from two of my favourite characters (I won't spoil it).And last but not least it was so lovely to be back at Highclere Castle aka Downton Abbey. A wonderful location. It felt like going home.In summing up, this movie was the perfect addition to a practically flawless series. As an avid fan I was thoroughly satisfied by everything about it.

I was ready to stand up and scream, ""Have you seen yourself, you fat cow?! ...Struggling to sit in your seat without making gasseous noises everytime you move a millimeter!"". Maybe I'm just used to binge watching the series snuggled up at home and not laboriously trying to ignore others. I just really don't feel this series is meant for a theater, I would've rather it ended the way it already had.
Of course you can't fault the actors or the stunning cinematography. I just feel like Julian is milking it a bit too much. I struggled to stay awake near the end.

Costumes, setting and pageantry are excellent as always, and certainly benefit from the big screen. The established characters offer no real surprises, and that's fine.But the script and the story lines? I have seldom seen worse. Almost all of of the story lines (and there are a lot of them squeezed into 2 hours - which is probably part of the problem) are appallingly bad. Believability has been thrown out if the window. Cliche-ridden, stupid, unnecessary, these adjectives don't do justice to the degree to which the script has been dumbed down.Don't get me wrong, it's not all bad, and overall it was still entertaining, but you do need to completely suspend any hope of reality or credibility. It was amusing in plenty of places, and I did laugh (in the proper places). Mr Moseley's embarrassed exit from the dining hall after his right royal faux pas was incredibly funny and brilliantly executed.Just don't go with any expectations other than to be lightly entertained.It's probably worth more than the 5 stars I'm giving it, but someone needs to bring the average down in the interests of common sense.",Downton Abbey

The movie was simply a rehash of several Disney animated Princesses. The upper class were all worried about the terrible stress in their lives, while the servants were worried about them too. The dreadful stress of keeping a huge house going versus living on a pittance and being treated like, well, servants was absurd.
The staff were outraged when the Royal staff were high handed and talked down to them, yet that happened every day in their jobs. The ""rebellion"" was totally farcical. This was the norm, so would they not say ""hurrah, a day off!""
The reference to the General Strike produced the best joke, Maggie Smith saying her maid had spoken to her in a funny tone, but was ignored otherwise as everyone in the village saw the visit of the King as the high point of their lives.
Tom the Irish Republican has been shown the error of his ways, and now sees that being part of the British upper classes is the way to go. Edith's notion that her husband should play a part in the birth of their child in 1926, rather than going on tour with the Prince is from 1996 not 1926!

The movie set in the late 1920's, is pure fantasy. If you want to see how men treated women back then watch ""Suffergett"""". That aside is is well written, and the photography is first rate",Downton Abbey

But it's more a fan service than a movie.
The plot seems like an entire season downsized to 2 hours, and this is not so good because all happens too much fast.If you haven't watched Downton please skip this movie: doesn't explain the anything of what happened in the past.",Downton Abbey

I, like many others, miss Downton Abbey dreadfully, to coin a phrase from them. It was good to see the characters, see the sets (especially on the big screen, where you can see much more detail), but I found the story lacking. It wasn't so much that it didn't have oomph, it was more that I thought the characters, particularly the downstairs ones, were acting out of character. I can't say more without a spoiler alert, but it was disconcerting. I would have so much rather got caught up with all of their lives, and the ins and outs of that. I was happy for Thomas however! I do hope there will be several more Downton Abbey movies, and I will happily go to them, but if you're expecting--as I was--that since it was fabulous on TV it will be even better at the movies, well that's not the case.",Downton Abbey

The glitz, glamour, and drama of early 20th century English society has always captivated me and is splendidly depicted on both the small and large screen. The best part about Downton's transition to the big screen is the grandeur of the costumes!! It seems that no detail was spared to make our Crawley family appear larger than life to the audience. The designs of the Crawley women's gowns were spectacular, colorful, and oh so lavish.However, as much as I personally loved this movie, it very much felt like one long episode of Downton Abbey. There was not much explanation of what had gone on in the past to arrive here in the story line, and very few introductions of characters.

193,javajan-58456,A short observation about Downton Abbey.,9,30 September 2019,"This was a nearly perfect adaptation of the television series, and fortunately, Elizabeth McGovern didn't have a lot to say. All the characters were there and in the some roles as the series. Briefly, the Royals were coming, and the King's staff descends about Downton, upsetting the both staff and family. The Moseley character was too broadly played, and the gay connection was a distraction.

194,raretxpanda,Good movie,6,23 September 2019,"This was a good movie if you like the show. Otherwise you'll probably find it boring. It felt like one long episode of the show and not like a ""movie"" though. This really was not much for scandal or excitement....no deaths or births.... I did like it but it's not something I would buy.",Downton Abbey
195,LaSaggezza,"A 9/10 for Spot on Abbey, but....",9,1 January 2020,"The cinema release was spot on Downton Abbey. And for Abbey fans this was a feast for starving eyes and fading memories of the beloved PBS Downton Abbey series. But therein lies the rub.I've seen the series several times. I'm well acquainted with the many, many gripping backstories and subplots. For example, the tragic backstory of how Branson, 'I mean Tom', marries his way into the family and rises through the ranks to become Lord Grantham's right hand man. Or the captivating backstory of Mr. Bates and his second wife, Anna. Or the origins of the comic disharmony between the sharp-tongued Dowager Violet and cousin Isobel. Above all, it's all centered around the Grantham's Downton Abbey estate and yet unborn heirs.In my opinion, Mr. Fellowes should have written another season for PBS and PBS should have distributed the series on one or more of the available digital streaming services. That strategy would have been a box office winner in every respect. It seems to me that there are still those who do not fully grasp the scale and scope of streaming distribution entertainment networks.All I can says is that if you've never seen the original series you will likely find the movie lacking coherence and bit boring. My advice would be to watch the series which can be found on PBS and then watch the movie version. If you do, you will not be at all disappointed and the movie will make a lot more sense.",Downton Abbey
196,haydendeepsy,"Good adaptation, yet unfulfilling",5,6 October 2019,"My first thought on the movie, was that the story elements where well adapted from the TV series and it felt good to see all the characters together once again, but did we actually need this film?
The film began, by introducing a rather intriguing plot with potentially good story development, that being said, in the end it all resulted rather predictable and rushed.
I was really looking foreward to the role of Thomas Barrow, and despite having his story been rather profound, his character felt more like someone who blindly follows strangers and is constantly belittled by other characters than the ""Evil Butler"" we where used to seeing in the show.
Many of the characters (Bates, ms Patmore, Anna, Mary...) where well presented, but unfulfilled by the end of the movie. The same goes for some of the new characters who looked interesting, but ended rather quickly and without ever reaching their goal.
Another issue, is that just as the movie started, many of the famous quotes of the series where reutilised to make a few jokes who, though funny, where quite noticeable.
In conclusion, the movie was very well adapted and faithful to the TV series, but disappointing in regards to character development and plot, which brings me to belive that it was made aiming mainly at the Box Office.",Downton Abbey
197,andrewrmiddleton,Genuinely Awful,1,14 September 2019,"The plot is wafer thing. The actors had almost nothing to work with.

She's easily the worst character and she's given way too much screen time. I literally hate her.The stupid servant uprising is both weird and kind of daft. You would think that these royal toffs coming in to take over for a few days might give these downton servants a nice reprieve. I would be like yay you can clean the silver thanks, but no they don't want anyone else to polish their floors.

It's still as elegant and perfect down to each and every gestures and body movements of the people to the way they all act just depicts perfectly as before.Resembling back the cast was just wonderful, along side with Maggie Smith, she's just wonderful in every way, hope she get another award for her perfectly well said lines.

This movie has the exact same feel and pacing as the TV series. Had it been any different, I would have been disappointed.There's enough drama, family secrets made known and surprises to keep long time fans satisfied. It left me wanting more. Maybe there should be a new Downton movie every three years or so like Star Wars.My only criticism is the images looked better on my HDTV than on the big screen.

The storylines were not well written, historically not believable & just poorly developed & executed. Thomas behaving the way he did toward his employer would have gotten him sacked. Lady Mauds story was so obvious & the servants rebellion would have brought shame to Downton & would not have been tolerated. Thomas was a gay man in 1927 & would have ended up in prison had he acted that way.

218,Apologi,Attempting to tie an end to every storyline,7,23 September 2019,"Ok movie. As a fan of the series I enjoyed it. But not great.In my opinion the greatest problem is that the movie attempts to bring almost every stoyline in the series to an end. Because of this, it is too crammed with stuff. Even serious issues only get some 5-10 minutes of time. In the TV series, they would have unwound slowly. The characters lose depth. Some of them appear to have been used only for laughs (e.g. Mosely). Anyway, the movie made me laugh, with some surprisingly witty remarks by the characters. That was positive.This tying of lose ends in my opinion also leads the film to focus too much on Thomas Barrow's homosexuality. In this area the film acquires a preachy tone in a blatant attempty to pander to the liberal elites of today. In a conservative series like this... This is also divergent from the TV, in which the writers apparently were able to keep themselves at bay. A more subtle approach would have been better. This also breaks the historic believalibility, which for me is a significant part of the Downton magic.I left the cinema mildly disappointed. The series would have deserved a better closing fanfare. The movie neither leaves much anything open still to be explored. Leaving the theatre I was overcome with sadness. Fortunately, in The Crown series we have something to look forward to.",Downton Abbey

The film is an absolute gem in terms of cinematography, set dressing and costume design, a feast for the eyes!
However, the script is only skindeep and lacks a real heart. It feels like a collection of (in many occasions unexpected) scenes instead of a heart touching story that gives our favourite noble family the credits they deserve. It is hasty storytelling and that made it for us a bit dissapointing.
Of course Maggie Smith's part is, again, one to treasure and the rest of the cast brings back sweet memories, but....hey.... why didn't the makers put more effort in a truly descent script??",Downton Abbey

There are a lot of characters involved in this film, with multiple story lines happening. But there is very little set up of the stories, and there's very limited character development along the way.
Knowing that this was a popular TV series to begin with, this film definitely comes across as an epilogue to the TV series. This film is made based on the assumption that you already know the background story, that you already know the journey each character has taken prior to this, so the film is merely an vehicle to give people some closure, and to tie up lose ends that the TV series may not have had the opportunity to accomplish.
The story and the characters are pleasant and polite. Everybody is well dressed, and all good people are rewarded, so, it certainly makes for pleasant viewing.

The opening scenes, with the slow buildup to the beloved theme music and a shot of Downton in all its glory, are truly magical. Then, one by one, you're treated to updates on the characters you fell in love with during the show, and you quickly learn what the main plot of the movie will be. There are some small conflicts along the way, with plenty of humorous and heartwarming moments! When the film ended, I felt extremely satisfied and hoped there would be more films to come.I recently rewatched the series and rewatched the movie as well. Upon second viewing, I am sad to say that I was less impressed. There are still many wonderful moments, and, as a longtime fan of the show, I can't say I wouldn't watch it again. However, I found that the film lacked substance and the overall plot was rather dull. One of the reasons I love the show so much is that there is never an episode lacking in emotion and drama. The film didn't have much of either. In fact, the most dramatic subplot (the assassination attempt) was resolved pretty early on. I was left wanting a whole lot more witty banter, conflict, and tearjerker moments. So, it is a 7 for me. If I weren't such a diehard fan, it might be ranked lower, but I'm admittedly biased. :)I really hope a sequel is in the works, and I think Julian Fellowes needs to go all out and gives us a dramatic story full of twists and turns!",Downton Abbey
247,john-kim-howard,Must see for Downton fans,9,21 September 2019,"Somehow they have reassembled the entire cast of the television series. So all the magic this wonderful ensemble brings to life can once again be enjoyed. The two hour movie portrays only a few days in the lives of the Downton Abbey characters so it's a quick 1927 snapshot. Lady Mary is her intriguing self, Carson is hilarious and Maggie Smith is at her best. It was wonderfully made, very clever, thoroughly enjoyable.",Downton Abbey
248,jaynekranc,Loved it.,9,28 October 2019,Such a delight to see Highclere on the big screen. I hope to see it in person someday.

250,Ben-cherniavsky,Snoozer!,3,3 February 2020,I liked the TV series but this move is absolutely vapid! No plot. Zero character development. And the most juvenile story line. It's like the writers came up with some random words for these actors to say just to provide an excuse to bring the characters back together again in the same scenery as before. Once again it proves that good TV series do not make good feature films.,Downton Abbey

That was precisely everything I knew walking into the movie.I loved it I thought it was beautiful watching the characters. There are no grand battles or cosmic good and evil. It's about people wanting a chance to be recognized as being the best, wanting to do the best, give the best and be the best. It's about a fading way of life and struggling to think about how to move forward into the future.It's about the pressure of duty versus personal want and need. It's about being human with all of its contradictions and complications. And even though I've loved other movies this year I think this is my favorite because it's about people being human and wanting to do something that is so important to them that they're willing to take a few underhanded tactics to get a wish fulfilled.",Downton Abbey

When I heard there was a movie coming out I was excited but a bit skeptical. When I went to see it, It felt as if I was in a Downton Novel. It was absolutely brilliant! I was so glad to see Branson find someone who he truly liked and could relate to him.
And then there's Thomas! I couldn't have been happier that they had finally added a REAL Love interest for him. In the series, that was my one disappointment... just make Thomas happy! And there comes Richard Ellis. Such a cool character wow!! I really wish we had gotten to see more of his story and Thomas (fingers crossed for another movie).
I absolutely loved the wee ""revolution"" by the staff. It Had me laughing hysterically and oh my, Mr. Molesly!

256,dolphinfish,Heritage TV goes big screen,6,15 September 2019,"If there's a trope the makers of this movie adaptation of the hugely successful TV show missed, I can't imagine what it was. Royal visit to Downton Abbey sees snooty Buckingham Palace servants strong-arming the doughty English yeomanry until put in their place by the resolute serfs standing up for his lordship's honour. This, apparently, was the ""Brexit"" element of the movie (the valiant rosbifs standing up to the smarmy cosmopolitans). There's the royal assassin lurking about the dales, the twinkly-eyed Irishman solving people's problems with his good-hearted openness, and the usurper who may or may not be inveigling their way into an inheritance they're not entitle to. It's all here, and it's all pretty predictable. However, it IS very well done, the production values are tremendous and it ties up all the loose ends of the TV series. It's brain candy, but enjoyable enough on a wet afternoon.",Downton Abbey

262,samuelsrenee,So So,5,1 December 2019,"Sorry, but this was forgettable, literally. When we drove away there was no resonance. The main thing left in my mind was how stupid Daisy was to think her boyfriend's sabotage was a proof of a strong character, evidence that he believed in something, i.e. his love for her; any reasonable person would stay far away from a guy like that. They didn't do well with the characterizations of the King and Queen, which anyone who read even the littlest bit of history would have noticed.

265,annaanine,Good story but maybe not for everyone,6,13 August 2020,"In general a beautiful and good movie, but maybe not one for all Downton Abbey fans.The cinematography has been adapted to the classic motion picture style, and is therefore different from the style used in the series - but it is something you get used to quicklyThe movie does not have the same kind of drama as the series had. It is more light and sweet if you may say so. But it is still a good movie. Just not an exact copy of the series, cut down into a two-hour movie.",Downton Abbey
266,mrobertson-24538,Such a disappointment.,6,30 May 2021,"I've been looking forward to watching the Downton Abbey movie. I have the series on DVD and have watched it many times. Along with the stunning scenery and the antique cars, what I most appreciated was the time and effort put into the development of the characters and each sub-plot.But the only way I can describe the movie is whiplash. We are constantly plopped down in a scene, the actors immediately say a handful of lines, and then WHAM - we're jerked out of that scene and tossed down into another completely unrelated scene. Rinse and repeat. It happened over and over throughout the entire movie. No development, no establishment. There were just far too many sub-plots crammed into the movie without any thought of actually drawing the audience into the story and giving them a satisfying experience with the beloved characters. If this were a standalone movie, it would have failed miserably in the box office.And some sub-plots were just obvious attempts at gratuitous sentimentality, like the out of the blue revelation that Lady Violet has been diagnosed with a terminal illness. No lead in, no build up. Just more whiplash.To make matters worse, several characters seemed to have moved backwards in time. The most egregious of these was Mr. Molesley. He was returned to acting the fool instead of continuing to develop his confidence as we saw in the last season. We saw him grow so much, but instead of paying that off with his new position as a respected teacher, the writer took the cheap and easy route of portraying him once again as a clown. Even to the completely idiotic and out-of-character point of having him curtsy in front of the King and Queen, and the entire house! Being nervous and chatty have been a part of his character, but never breaking etiquette (while sober, anyway) and definitely not behaving like a woman. And are we really to believe that after three years, he and Baxter are still not married?Lady Edith, now Lady Hexham, has returned to complaining all the time. The last series showed her finally taking charge and owning every aspect of her life, including her daughter Marigold by having the courage to stand up to Bertie's mother, but here she is portrayed as back to whining about life instead of taking charge. It was so great to see her become a strong woman in the series, then suddenly all of that disappeared.Tom Branson is back to being portrayed as the untrustworthy Irishman, with Lady Mary following him around because she suspects him of being up to no good. And what should have been an interesting and engaging romantic sub-plot with Lucy Smith is rushed and hurried.Mr. Carson's palsy has magically disappeared, and suddenly he is fully capable of resuming his position as butler. We think of him as being extremely principled, yet he doesn't give a moment's consideration to ousting the current butler if he gets to serve the King and Queen. And the arrangement made in the last episode was to have Mr. Carson act as an adviser and mentor to Mr. Barrow, but apparently Mr. Carson just spends all day working in his garden.Which brings up Mr. Barrow, who was last seen as being treated with respect by the family. At least he was portrayed as showing some spine when Lady Mary replaced him with Carson.One thing that was consistent with the series is that during the series there were many times when a character would do something completely out of character or nonsensical just to facilitate a plot line. It could be overlooked because the series fully developed those story lines. But the constant jumping around of the movie never allowed anything to be truly developed.Yes, it was great to see the characters again, and there were some good moments in the movie. But it just did not live up to the series. I liken the movie to expecting a fulfilling and enjoyable dinner with family and friends, only to find out you've been lured into a frantic and jolting two-hour round of speed dating. Very disappointing.",Downton Abbey

269,astena,"Some wonderful stuff, some awful stuff",6,30 January 2020,"I'm really torn about this movie. I adored the television series, and had high hopes for the film, and in some ways it does deliver. The cinematography as always is gorgeous. The plot involving the inheritance, mostly centring around Maggie Smith and Imelda Staunton, is decent, if somewhat easily predictable. The best storyline is the one given to Thomas Barrow, who finally sees some redemption in terms of his story, and for me it is really the high point of the movie. Tom Branson gets two major plots, and they're both okay, if not particularly enthralling. In an attempt to give everybody some screen time, none of the other stories are particularly well fleshed out for any character otherwise, so we don't really see a whole lot of perennial favourites like Anna and Bates.For me the real disappointment of the movie is the treatment of Molesley. The final series of the television show worked so hard to redeem his character as a thoughtful, stalwart and intelligent man. The movie has turned him into a complete buffoon. I understand that he is generally thought of as a bit of comic relief for much of the series, but there was no need to treat him like such an idiot in the movie, when the TV show had worked hard to evolve him into a much more grounded character. I don't know what the writers and director were thinking, but his appearances on screen are cringe-worthy and frankly embarrassing.Overall, the movie was a pleasant enough romp, very much just another episode that happens to be drawn out over the length of the movie. But I think I expected more from a cinematic endeavour, and I certainly expected better treatment of some much beloved characters.",Downton Abbey

I can hear the criticisms already 'it was too sentimental', 'there wasn't enough complication' but my answer to that is that many of these characters had intense story arcs in the show, so it's nice to revisit them now and see them living, or finally getting, their happy endings without too much drama.
Everyone in the cinema, myself included, laughed the whole way through this film, as is to be expected from Downton Abbey. And then there were other moments that were quite poignant to offset the humour, which blended perfectly.
Yes, it's a movie for fans of the show, but why shouldn't it be? After years supporting this show and following these characters, why shouldn't we be rewarded?

I wasn't sure how'd they resolve all the subplots (mini-dramas) but they did it well and in a timely manner.
I'm thankful that Lady Mary was not a focus. Sorry, I liked her but thought the series focused too much on her.
I'm thankful that Barrow was given more time in the movie. Robert James-Collier is much underrated and he gives his usual best. I would love to have seen him with Dame Smith.

289,erinwebster,Fun to watch,8,21 September 2019,"This doesn't really feel like a movie but that doesn't mean it was bad. It's more like an extended episode updating us on each and every character. And there's a lot of characters. This means it doesn't leave time for any deep or dramatic plot twists, just little somewhat predictable and familiar scenarios for each character to resolve throughout the film. This made it feel a little cheesy at times, and left me wanting one of those really heart wrenching or beautifully triumphant moments that Downton Abbey does so well, but we don't see that in this film. BUT I think it's better this way though, because if they were to have enough time to develop one of these, we would feel disappointed on not really getting that update on other characters we care about too. So this is light hearted, easy to watch and gives us that Downton Abbey fix we all need. I hope they will consider beginning a new series in the future to continue the story!",Downton Abbey

We gladly joined them, and savored the balm-like effect of the not-too-loud, familiar Downton Abbey theme, whose bittersweet, contemplative qualities we'd almost forgotten. We all knew were re-entering our communal time machine back to the Edwardian era, and the modern world of Donald Dump and Boris Brexit could lick our English-wanna-be , at least for about three and a half binge episodes of Downton Abbey.We did not care that the plot was a mish-mash of mildly upsetting occurrences except for one assassination attempt on the ultimate rich twit, the King of Albert Edward Land, which was also treated as a mildly upsetting occurrence. We did not object when the back stairs staff of D.A. kidnapped, drugged, and defrauded their counterparts on the Royal staff without consequence, because after all, this is our Edwardian dream, and we don't get caught or consequences here. We sat in rapt silence while Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, called Lady Mary Talbot into a private room to tell her three things: That her own character was about to be killed off, that she, lady Mary, was doomed to leading the Hindenburgenian decline of Downton Abbey for the rest of her life, and finally, that Maggie Smith would be dead before any more D.A. content could be produced, so just sit there and like it.It's a lackluster movie, but we're going again tonight in full costume.",Downton Abbey

If you like Downton, you WILL like this.God knows how he manages to give every character a story, but he does and it all works.. I actually came out the cinema moaning (to my wife) that it was too short.Roll on the next one... I want it NOW.",Downton Abbey

The acting and the sets were excellent. Maggie Smith deservedly stole every scene she was in. I hope there will be a sequel perhaps set during the Second War.,Downton Abbey

302,coco_la_nata,The movie is so so but..........,10,3 February 2020,"The movie is just about another days in Downton Abbey for having some special guests visited. Plot is simple and no big Hollywood stars made special appearance. But, for those die hard fans like me, I got my goosebumps when the theme song started and almost lost my tears when seeing my old friends in kitchen and basement. I miss you so much Mr. Bates, Mrs. Patmore, Mr. Carson, Anna, Daisy, Barrow......If any bone must be found in egg, it must be ""Where Is Matthew Crawley? Not even in flashback""!",Downton Abbey

305,anitakwall,Uninteresting,5,21 September 2019,I'm sure it was difficult to squeeze so many distinct character-specific story lines into a 2 hour movie. The result seems too contrived and of course predictable One good thing- Tom finally has an optimistic future.,Downton Abbey
306,kdr50,What every fan needed,8,22 September 2019,"If you tuned in every Sunday evening, if you bought the DVDs, you must see this movie. It's all as we remember it, with everyone polished up to their very finest for the fans, oh yeah, and the King and Queen, in 1927. We're back in the dining room, isn't that familiar and wonderful? The ladies' clothing is gorgeous, and downstairs, the staff connives to put those snooty baggages of the Palace household in their places. Team Downton triumphs. There are glimmers of future happiness for everyone, and a set-up for a believable sequel, if that ever happens (please yes!). Ten years on, this will be so interesting.
It runs a bit superficial and predictable, and fans will long for the series format so we can wallow in all those silly, daily dramas of a bygone world. But I got my fix right and proper, even survived the shock of Isabel and Daisy in full makeup. Hollywood.",Downton Abbey

It ties together the loose ends nicely and of course is full of great acting, costumes and plot lines just as the show does. I would recommend this to everyone who has seen the ENTIRETY of the Downton Abbey series. If you have not seen the show, DO NOT watch the film or it will spoil everything!",Downton Abbey
311,jillwolensky673,Pretty But Passionless,8,13 December 2019,"There is oh so much to like about this movie. Visually, it's stunning. The performances are all good, and I like most of the actors okay.The caption says it all. Decent adaptation of a well-received book; this is one which could have done with a little ruthlessness when transferring it to film, however. Almost seems to be in love with itself - a little too convinced of its own splendour and profundity.But I just couldn't really care about what became of these people, not because they were ""immoral"" but because they were boring. I keep on thinking maybe I should watch it again and see if it grows on me. Some movies are like that. As for the Academy Awards, well, this movie will do very well. But it sort of makes me sad to think that a pretty, passionless picture like this is considered the best that was done in an entire year. When you assemble the makings of a great film and then execute it in bloodless fashion, something like ""Downton Abbey"" will emerge-a movie that is somehow less than the sum of its parts.",Downton Abbey
312,stesch,Probably only works for those who waited a few years to see all their favorite characters again,5,2 October 2021,"If you finish binge watching the show and then watch the movie one day later, you get something longer than a Xmas special but with a lot less plot and spirit.The Xmas specials had the advantage of being able to continue the series' plot and bring the viewers a nice conclusion.The show had a lot of time to follow some plotlines which a movie has not. And it shows.But what is more annoying: You need to follow the rules of your fantasy world! And it's a fantasy world as long as it's not a documentary. They had rules they followed for 6 series. And now they act like clowns and commit things that could be considered treason.They think it's funny to drug a person who is employed by the royal family? To trick the other royal servants? And without consequences?This was a big WTF I can't forgive.Show: 10/10

This was such an amazing and exciting opportunity, an experience that I will never forget. At the weekend I was able to attend the cast and crew screening of the film in London! Which was so so so exciting and I even got to sit right next to the director - how cool is that?! I'm incredibly happy to be able to share this review with you all and I would love to know what you all think so make sure you leave a comment and I will get back to you. A little bit of Downton Abbey history, Downton Abbey originally aired on British TV in 2010, the show lasted for six series and ended in December 2015. The show follows the House Downton Abbey and it occupants the Crawley family and their staff. I loved this show so much, I used to watch it in my PJ's with hot chocolate and marshmallows every Sunday night. So, I was thrilled when a movie was announced, and then I got a job on the crew and I got to read the script and see what happened behind the scenes and it was like a dream come true. So, I guess the real question is: does the movie live up to the TV show? Read on to find out -",Downton Abbey

Vapid drivel, a huge let down. I thought it may expand on the characters but it's head was too far up the monarchy's arse to tell any kind of engaging story. Waste of time. Insult to fans. Ended up not even liking the characters anymore.
If I hear of any more Downton abbey, Money-milking Films I shall avoid them.",Downton Abbey
319,jackstevefitz,Disappointing.......,3,10 December 2019,Just seen Downton Abbey and sorry to say it was disappointing. Apart from a very dull predictable storyline the 'shoe horned in' sub plots about the IRA and Homosexuality were total hog wash. Acting wise only Smith and Wilton stood out and as for Michelle Dockery - looks like she went to carpentry school rather than drama school - she is so wooden. Laura Carmichael's posh voice got posher as the film plodded on and Carson hid his light under a bushel. If it was not for the lavish sets this film would be still be crashing through the Earths core. Kermode talks about films being a Nuts and Bolts film - this effort was more tacks and pins.,Downton Abbey

The plot lines were probably best served and fleshed out in the series format, because every story line was glossed over and resolved too quickly without being set up properly.

The movie is how the show should've struck: a flat narrative that I had trouble caring about. My wife and I fell asleep on two separate viewings, needing a nap before the third to finish this film.

335,Slipped_Sprocket,Very disappointing and shabby production,2,30 September 2019,"I greatly enjoyed the TV series and watched its whole run. I admit my original enthusiasm about the film version began to wane when the first previews appeared. The core premise (the ""Royals Visit"") seemed a pretty weak plot line.But I was bored enough at home one night to head to the theater to see it. Julian Fellowes should be ashamed -- maybe he drafted this script on the toilet one day since it comes off as a very rough draft or mediocre fan fiction. The characters, whose complex personalities were so well developed and became so familiar to us during the series, were given vapid lines, many inappropriate to their established personas, and a story line with zero dramatic meat. It was like a watered-down amateur knockoff of the series put on by a high school drama club. Even the scene by scene direction was sloppy, with a lot of pointless bustling, dialogue non-sequitirs, poor pacing and a sense that we were watching a bunch of first takes where people were unsure of their lines. The whole thing felt forced and contrived -- even the plot ""crises"" were negligible and mainly re-hashes of previous plot tropes like a lady's maid who steals from her employer and another hidden love-child daughter of a family member (yawn.) Oh, and Edith, despite being now fabulously rich, well married as a Peeress of the Realm and even pregnant is still whining about not liking her life. (yawn again and who cares?) Even the exchanges between Dowager Lady Violet and Isobel Merton (nee Crawley) seemed more petty and contrived than clever. Great lack of conviction in any of the script and most of the performances.I left with the feeling that the film was thrown together only to make a bunch of money, to show off dozens of fabulous gowns and to throw a bone to fans who wanted to see widowed nice guy Tom Branson and depressed gay butler Barrow find perfect love interests, which they do with conveniently uncomplicated ease.Trivia question: what happened to the baby that Lady Mary was supposedly expecting during the last episode of the series?? Didn't notice any new faces in the nursery and the character was as wraith-slim as ever.",Downton Abbey
336,MiCanuck,"Too big a budget, and too little plot. It felt obligatory.",6,23 September 2021,"Hope the second one's better, because this one wasted its cast.

The new cast additions liven it up, from the Royal staff to Princess Mary to a nice performance from Imelda Staunton, who's playing a role far removed from Umbridge as Grantham cousin Lady Bagshaw, another foil for Maggie Grace.Go see it, please.

Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton were outstanding as usual.
The rest of the cast didn't have much to work with as there scenes were so short,
30 to 40 seconds of dialogue and cut to another beautiful cinematic shot.
Makes for a very choppy fast pace story line , glad I watched at home so I could keep up.

Good to see the estate is still standing high and proud. It has lots of humours but also brings me some tears as well.

Yes, a couple of my cast favorites, were up on the screen less than I'd liked, but balancing out a cast of 20 is an art, and I'm sure Julian Fellows the showrunner, creator of the film entity knew he'd have to sacrifice a little to pull this story together.I'd love for this film to find its audience, thus assuring us at least one more romp through the estate.

1. Prior to the film, Jim Carter and Phyllis Logan (Mr. Carson and Mrs. Hughes) got people who hadn't seen the television series up-to-date on the characters. Short was maybe ten minutes or so. I kinda choked up at the Tom Branson story...but then, I always get choked up about Tom.2. The volume was pretty low, strange for a theater, especially since so many over-50 people will be going to see the movie.3. There were only 15 people in the audience but, sometimes, people forget they aren't at home. There was one couple in the audience with loud, annoying laughs. Every time Violet and Isobel had a little contretemps, it was difficult to hear the dialogue after. And, of course, no way to ""rewind.""4. the movie is 122 minutes. I'd say half is comedy.5. Some of the regular characters didn't have much story at all. Some have more story than you might guess. I was looking forward to three minor characters from the series but they didn't appear in the movie (Violet's butler & her lady's maid and Edith's assistant at the newspaper/magazine).6. I choked up only four times 1) Tom Branson in the short 2) Thomas Barrow 3) Violet and Mary and 4) Tom Branson again. Didn't even use all of one tissue.7. Downton Abbey needs to make another movie so we can find out what happens with a new character, never seen in the series. You'll know who I'm talking about.",Downton Abbey

351,dennis-868-117263,A fantastic follow on from the series.,9,20 January 2020,"I think it was worth the 4 year wait. It's just a shame we'll probably have to wait another 4 years for the next instalment. Let's face it given the massive money spinner this is, a second movie is inevitable.
The storyline is already setting the plot for the next film, while Mr Fellows clearly doesn't like to be predictable, you can see there are several avenues for him to follow in the next instalment. And there is enough scope for it to be bitter sweet in equal measure. I suspect we'll see a death and a marriage in the next film.
I think films are definitely the way to go though, if it were to continue as a series it would have to burn through a lot of storylines to keep up the momentum. And that would result in it becoming far fetched - you can only kill off so many key characters or have them do moonlight flits before it ceases to be shocking.",Downton Abbey

Was that's ever a mistake 🙄 This is an indulgent, slapstick, farcical attempt to resurrect the stories of the Crawley family and their servants. It's utterly disjointed, historically inaccurate, with frankly some of the most cringeworthy movie moments I've seen in a while. I actually groaned out loud when Molesley curtsy's to the King while serving dinner. There's an early character who we assume is either part of the advance team or security to prepare for a royal visit, and turns out to be an assassin...who promptly disappears from the storyline halfway through, a completely unnecessary side trip to an underground gay club with Barrow which serves absolutely no purpose to the storyline. And to top it all shows King George V as a genial, almost benevolent, monarch when in fact he was known to be a cantankerous, mealy mouthed, philandering misogynist.Don't waste your time.",Downton Abbey

I was so so bored all the time.,Downton Abbey
362,coocoo2014,Loved seeing everyone again!,10,12 October 2019,"Downtown Abbey as usual...! Miss everyone and so glad they all came back for another show. I wish, like so many I know, that they could come back as a regular weekly show again...that's how much we miss them. And the castle and the loveliest life of the royals...so fun to be a part of it all! Great movie!!!",Downton Abbey
363,michellemccarran,There's No Story,3,6 April 2021,"The first two seasons of Downton Abbey were fantastic--because there was a meaningful story going on. I won't get into what it was to avoid spoilers, but whenever I recommend the series its always due to those first two seasons.The later seasons are varying degrees of bad. Yes, the cinematography, setting, costumes and music are consistently well-done throughout the series, but the stories and their pacing are a complete fail.The same problem exists with the movie. There are too many storylines. And none of them are particularly interesting because they're shallow--there's no build up, no emotional engagement with any of it. The writer's should have picked one thing and stuck with it. As a result the movie feels like I'm watching a very long trailer--and a very boring one at that.",Downton Abbey
364,michaelscully,Torporific,1,23 September 2019,"A waste of time and money. Issue-oriented BS. Misused Imelda Staunton, too, one of the best living actresses in the world. I was a fan of the TV show, too. Sovereignty disappointed.",Downton Abbey
365,adyel-86726,Its ok!,7,15 September 2020,"The setting is breathtaking and magnificent, as only the British aristocracy can portray. Its a beautiful display of art, fashion, and architecture. A pathway to an era that was long ago lived. Honestly, its another Grand Hotel. The storyline is not very thrilling and i found myself hating on basically every character because they can be simple and petty, and predictable, yet I still believe its a good way to spend a Sunday evening in front of the TV with a cup of tea and definitely worth a once in the lifetime watch.",Downton Abbey

Julian Fellows delights us again with his brilliant story telling, the production was simply smashing, and the Downton Abbey cast was magnificent as always. Loved the story lines and wouldn't another Downton Abbey movie next year be perfect. We just can't get enough. The audience applauded because like me they loved the movie. The series and this movie are both a must see. I'm fervently hoping for another Downton Abbey movie next year.",Downton Abbey
369,rspady-25882,Completely satisfying and nearly perfect!,10,24 September 2019,"From the first notes of the first episode of the first season, I have enthusiastically followed Downton Abbey. I was sorry to see the series end . . . however, I knew it would eventually. I was thrilled when I learned there was going to be a Downton Abbey movie.I saw the Downton Abbey movie yesterday and it did not disappoint. I knew it would be different. Whereas the series had the ability to continue story lines across episodes . . . the movie had to keep things tidy and contained to a two-hour feature.The costumes are stunning. The story lines are limited and basically each cast member had one. The theater was full of Downton Abbey enthusiasts and I don't think I laughed as much watching the series. Maggie Smith (Violet Crawley) had great one liners. And so did Isobel (who is now Lady Merton). Their banter was wonderful.I can hardly wait for the movie to come out on DVD. I want to see again. Plus, I hope they fill it with extras . . . especially on the costuming.",Downton Abbey
370,Getreal1,"Great costumes, shame about everything else",1,17 November 2019,"Top marks to the wardrobe department, but, as I expected, the acting, the plot, the script were grim.

Big mistake.",Downton Abbey
371,rachopwood,More fun watching a pot boil,1,31 May 2020,That was the slowest movie I have ever watched. The plot was ridiculous.... It was centred around the servants serving food to the Royals. That was it. Maggie Smith's cross eyed look at the end was interesting... What a waste of time.,Downton Abbey
372,rachhenderson-66663,Enjoyed it overall but really random storylines,6,15 August 2021,"I loved the going back and seeing all the characters again. But there were some really random storylines that kind of went nowhere. Like the assassination attempt and the Princess Mary marriage thing. Daisy and Andy and the plumber who kind of just disappeared after the first 10 mins. Also where was Matthew Goode's character the whole film? It did not make sense. And I wanted more Tom and Lucy romance.I liked how Thomas got a romance though. The getting arrested at the gay bar thing was a bit irrelevant to the story though.Loved the costumes, shots and the staff reclaiming the house!",Downton Abbey
373,rayjordan-2,Everything you wanted from the TV series...on the big screen,8,16 September 2019,"Nearly all of my favorites made an appearance, and none disappointed.This film could have just been a special episode of the series, but the scale and detail was definitely built for the big screen.The story is fairly self-contained...but if you didn't watch the series, several items will seem irrelevant or leave you with questions. If you don't understand the difference between the upstairs and downstairs personnel, check out the posters.... Upstairs people are the gentry/nobility/VIPs....downstairs are the house staff, cooks, footmen.... and both have their own structure and hierarchy. This film helps us appreciate the differences and how they come together.It is a period piece, well done and intricate.",Downton Abbey

376,maikensmovies,Oh what dross,2,15 February 2020,"I thought the latter series had gotten a bit boring and predictable towards the end. But nothing prepared me for the utter dross of the movie.
The only positive thing to say about the plot is that it might be a realistic interpretation of a life with an abundance of money - where every small event can be turned into a major drama worthy of endless discussions.In its defence the costume and settings where beautiful.",Downton Abbey

379,emma-firstfiresafety,Unwatchable,1,26 December 2020,"I didnt see see this at the cinema so I am not sure if the issue i have with it is only on DVD .. it is entirely unwatchable .. the voices of all of the cast are completely off, too high pitched, maybe they left it so long they all forgot how their characters sounded or maybe it was the way it was film.

381,habanerodad,Soapy with a Touch of Knots Landing,9,14 September 2019,"I do love this movie, despite the fact it is due to my affinity for the English monarchy and such beloved characters having watched the TV show. It's very rare you see such an ensemble cast repeat their performances on the big screen. The movie suffers from *many* ""they didn't do that in the 30s"" moments, but the flowery writing that sounds taut and crisp, coupled with characters who are old fashioned, yet progressive for their time, makes this easy on the eyes.Not sure what the future holds, but if Lady Mary Crawley becomes the new Dowager Countess of Grantham, I would fall of my chair seeing more movies take on WWII, etc. Clearly, this version of ""The Crown: Rural Folk"" works seeing history through the eyes of characters you invested in making it worth it.I wish there was more emphasis on the royal visit including more chronicling of the pomp and circumstance, dishes being served, and the attention to details (i.e. Victorian Kitchen, Babette's Feast, etc.) The movie version had an opportunity to leave a few characters off the screen and deliver more of a movie than 2-hr episode of the TV show. But, really can't complain when you're a fan of the series. Possibly, the best scene of the entire TV show was when the news was delivered the morning after the Titanic sank. Seeing the morning routines, bells ringing, curtains being drawn open, etc. A history class in procession. Downton Abbey doesn't come that close to the original magic and delves into everyone's live (literally everyone) and keeps the characters honest.The story is about the King George V and Queen Mary stopping by and reconnaissance crew sent ahead of time stir the pot with the Downton staff by being told to stay away from the event and to leave it to the experts. The staff ""Revolt"" to put it mildly (more like a college prank) and take over and serve the highnesses bangers and mash and Cornish pasties instead (ok that part I embellished). They pull it off, but there's an attempted assassination, a dress arrives 2-sizes too large, and a wonderful orchestra that plays exquisitely. The bitter banter between Isobel Crawley and Dowager Countess of Grantham abates slightly, but there's more of one-liners and it's funnier. There are tears shed, but will not give away too much.",Downton Abbey
382,anna_55,haven't seen the series...,7,12 September 2019,"...but i enjoyed the movie. The imagery was gripping, the characters enjoyable, i guess i will watch the series eventually :) Maggie Smith was a triumph! Although I wasn't expecting big twists and turns, I would've expected a more intense screenplay.",Downton Abbey
383,tmaunder456,Superb Production,10,20 September 2019,"Great to see most of the Tv characters were here. The production as a whole was superb with minute details shown perfectly. Even down to Lady Edith's underwear!
The new characters were played equally as well as the usual team. Shame we didn't see anything of Lady Rose and Atticus, Spratt or Denker. The only slight spoiler I will add - where was Lady Mary's husband Talbot? I know he showed briefly at the end but In reality he would have attended such a momentous and significant event of the family. Lady Mary would have insisted!
More is wanted unless a TV series is to make a comeback, or even a few Christmas specials to help us fans with the 'cold turkey'!",Downton Abbey
384,gregoz-g,What was the purpose of this film?,2,16 January 2020,"My wife forced me to watch the TV series and I cringed but watched, the 2019 film is simply a disaster. No actor can save a poor plot. They tried to sugarcoat it so hard and make everyone happy that it was embarrassing. It's hard to recommend it even to a die hard Downton fans.",Downton Abbey
385,carolecooper,Disappointing,5,23 September 2019,"I am a HUGE fan of the television series! It was full of breathtaking cinematography, beautiful music, award winning set design, and splendid fashions and costumes. All of this set the tone and backdrop for a story full of interesting characters whose lives were riveted by tragedy, war, love found, love lost, betrayal, class distinctions and money blues! Character development is a luxury that can be explored in depth in a television series with lots of seasons and several episodes, I get that! However, it's no excuse for a movie that cannot stand on its own! You should not have to have seen the television series to understand and enjoy the movie! Watching Downton Abbey on tv...I laughed, I cried and my heart was heavy during the last episode as Crawley & Company faded to black. This movie though was flat, even feeble attempts at humor were forced. The big drama was a royal visit? I refuse to make excuses for lack of character development, life altering issues, real drama and no tears shed here! This isn't real and quite frankly an insult to the television series so brilliantly portrayed. All these ""10"" reviews make me wonder if I saw the same movie. Disappointing and quite frankly forgettable!",Downton Abbey
386,drahlers,"Weak script, self-indulgent",4,2 July 2021,"Nothing resemblant of the.series, no drama, weak script. The Crawleys have faced family deaths, WWI, and other numerous hardships but in this film, they are dealing with a rainy night, Tom stuck at the pub, and annoying houseguests that they invited. Not enough ingredients for a movie. I am sure it was rushed through as an easy money-maker and an excuse for the cast to reunite, but it was terribly disappointing.",Downton Abbey

388,brittwalkey,Beautifully done!,9,23 September 2019,"This movie fulfilled many of my expectations. In fact, I only had one issue with it.When they are filming a series they are working with eight hours to move the story of twenty plus characters along. In a film, they were limited to two hours. As much as I enjoyed the film, it was difficult to get very much depth to each individual character. This is with the exception of Tom and even his storyline in the film was choppy to say the least. The first half, he is trying to save the king and the second half he is building a potential relationship with a new character. The relationship takes off so quickly and after watching Tom and Sybil take two seasons to end up together (not to mention Mary and Matthew, Mrs. Hughes and Mr. Carson!), I felt like I wasn't getting the true Downton experience.
All that to say, I still really hope for a sequel. It was great fun and as Hugh Bonneville said at the premier, it's ""Pure escapism"". Although without Dame Maggie Smith, I'm not sure how well a sequel would do. Violet and Isobel are such a core part of the show and you can't have one without the other. Hopefully a new movie will include our dear Lady Rose and Mr. Mason.",Downton Abbey

390,hannibalsrequiem,All Plot and No Character Development,6,14 September 2019,"I am a big Downton Abbey fan and even though I liked the movie I have to say that the film spends way to much time on plot and very little time on character development. I was very surprised by this because the TV series had a lot of character development in it. Even the plot itself is rather simple and is only interesting on the surface.Another criticism I have is that if you've never watched the TV show you will have no idea what is going on in the film. I think that this was only made for money and aims at fans that are attracted to the more superficial aspects of Downton Abbey.To be fair the film is well produced, the sets and costumes are wonderful , and the performances are great. The film should be entertaining for any hardcore Downton Abbey fan.",Downton Abbey
391,kayleesmith-51323,An amazing continuation,10,13 September 2019,"So pleased that this movie did not join the long line of continuations that miss the mark. The writing, acting, and costumes are everything I loved about the series. Maggie Smith was the best part, of course. So much wittiness and sass. I was also delighted that, prior to the movie, there was a recap of each of the major characters' storylines, which makes the movie much more approachable to a newcomer. Me, a Downton fangirl, and my boyfriend, a Downton novice, both enjoyed it immensely. Highly recommend!",Downton Abbey
392,sara-276,Priceless Gem,10,27 September 2019,"This movie is pure perfection. It is a wonderful continuation of the TV Series. I think reviewers do not know how to rate this movie because it is just delightful. There is no violence, foul language, and nastiness between characters. It's just a love letter to the fans. Julian Fellows has done a brilliant job with the script and has brought the production level to the next level. Go see it if you want to leave a movie feeling good and smiling.",Downton Abbey
393,maria-41129,Storyline is rushed,3,16 September 2019,"Feels very much like the writers were planning on making another season of downtown but then decided to cram it into a movie.
All the drama is not dramatic as there is not enough time to build suspense. Characters are not explored, relationships are not build they just happen - oh they've just met and now they're snogging. Would have been better off to stay as TV series.
That being said the actors did great and the music I brilliant as always.",Downton Abbey
394,Becky_L,An Epilogue for the Fans,9,18 September 2019,"If you have not seen, and enjoyed/loved, all six seasons of Downton Abbey then this isn't the movie for you. This movie doesn't break any new territory or propel the characters off in new directions. Instead, it only provides a snap shot of the life for the Crawley family and their staff two years after the events at the end of the tv series. And it was brilliant.When this movie was first announced, I was sceptical. Of course, the first thought to cross my mind was ""money grab"". But also unplanned, and unexpected, continuation of stories that have tied up their loose ends, tend to end in a flop. I worried that, in order to make this a good stand alone movie, the writers would have to create conflict, meaning they would have to break down the happy endings. Fortunately, what they produced instead what felt like a two hour epilogue meaning all the characterisation remains intact. Yes, from a critical standpoint, this means the movie lacks any real depth but I don't think it needs too. We had all the character depth and growth from the tv show. Instead this film is light hearted romp with all my favourite characters living their happy endings and showing off how much they have changed ( I am looking at you Barrow.) It also wraps up a couple of loose ends that remained which was also great to see. It is the movie I wanted it to be.This movie has all the charm and happiness of the tv show; like visiting an old friend you haven't seen in years. I left with a massive smile on my face and new additional memories. Bring on watching it all over again.",Downton Abbey

It's nice to see the favorite characters on the screen again. The only thing the film lacked was decent content. The feeling that they shot the film only so that the cook finally agreed to get married. And yes, I'm also very happy for Tom. In the book, it would be a three-page epilogue.",Downton Abbey

405,astudyingscarlett,Beautiful and heartwarming! So close to perfection.,9,13 September 2019,"Everyone gave excellent performances, but the best characters are Carson and, obviously, the Dowager Countess. I enjoyed it thoroughly and am so glad that the creators put in the time and effort to get it right. There are a surprising amount of laughs, again with most of them directed at the Dowager Countess. I had also forgotten about the show's ability to lay out social situations that keep the audience in a surprising amount of suspense, and this movie delivers that as well. At the end, there are almost too many heartwarming moments to count. This movie made my heart happy.

How he is able to have a parade of characters varying in depth and degree while making them all interesting to watch is an achievement few can have. The. We have the cast who bring the words to life and breath nuance into them and they all perform tremendously in their return to these well eastablished characters. My only issue are small story elements that feel a bit shoehorned to provide a little action. But other than that, I love this historically fictional world we have been graced with and can't wait to see if they will decide to continue ur this story and if not then a humble ending to a beautiful story.",Downton Abbey

I am an avid fan of the series and for me, the film didn't disappoint. I think the scene stealer went to Molesley - but every character had their own story line - and everything came together well. Gorgeous locations and gowns - as it happened, I was in Lacock on holidays when they were shooting the parade scene (among others) - so it was very cool to see that on the big screen (without the take 1, take 2, take 3 etc)!!",Downton Abbey

I loved the family scenes, the small mysteries throughout, and the fun preparations for the King & Queen's arrival. However, I didn't like the gay lifestyle minor story line and I think it was very badly done & pushed in my face. It is a sin(Leviticus 20:13) I can't support and pretend it is ok. That is a fact, not opinion, written in God's word. Yet, I refused to let it ruin the movie for me. Otherwise, a good movie. I like that they showed alot of the beautiful scenery!

416,yoyo-77836,Very confusing if you haven't seen The TV series,7,28 September 2019,"I don't know who is the main character or who are the main characters. I don't know why the plot of the two men's engagement is in any form or shape related to the main event. I find it very confusing with so many characters in one movie and they all seem rather important one way or another, thus it gets boring. On the other hand, it is a story well told and the sets are quite well done. Actors are also performing well. It is something you would expect but missing some sparkles. If you are a big fan of the series, I'd say go ahead, if not, be well informed.",Downton Abbey
417,mullinskl,Fun to revisit.,8,30 September 2019,"Someone asked me before I went if the movie was going to be some stand-alone story or a continuation of the series. It's clear the script aimed to rely heavily on the first to most broadly appeal to audiences that may not have seen all the series (though I think it would've been difficult to keep up with all the characters if you didn't already know who they are).
To that end, the plot suffered for us fans who are accustomed to complicated story arcs and character development that just wasn't there for this. It was weak on interpersonal dynamics that the show did really well, in favor of a neat and tidy (marketable) narrative.
The whole assassination plotline was introduced and done in like, 4 minutes. Why wasn't that utilized better?? There wasn't any driving action stemming out of the characters' relations to each other. The Abbey staff were reduced to a monolith united against the royal staff; Bates hardly had any lines at all and he used to be a favorite character.
It was ultimately cute and entertaining enough but didn't come close to having the same verve as the show. Absolutely worthwhile for seeing these beloved characters come to life again and, as always, the Dowager Countess will carry the best lines.",Downton Abbey
418,halliemosteller,Never seen the show but decent movie,6,4 October 2019,"Ok, I've seen one episode. But yeah, I knew close to nothing about Downton Abbey going into this movie. It was pretty good but it seemed to drag on a little in some parts, especially in the first 45 minutes or so. I definitely think it would have made the movie better had I known more about the characters and felt that nostalgic connection with them. From my ignorant standpoint, it was a decent movie with an ok story and some cute romantic scenes. I wouldn't need to see it more than once or twice, especially without knowing anything. But it does intrigue me enough to maybe start watching the series.",Downton Abbey
419,hnbailey-18546,"Great for nostalgia, but plot gets a C-",4,20 October 2019,"Having greatly enjoyed the series, I was looking forward to the movie. It was lovely to see all of the characters I grew to love once again. But -- who wrote this? The plot, and even the lines, seemed to be a superficial rehash of episodes gone by. It's like they wanted to fit in a storyline for almost everyone, so each of these subplots ended up being short and superficial. A number of them seemed implausible. They wrote in a few zingers for Violet and Abigail Crawley, thank goodness, but even those sometimes seemed abbreviated, like when Abigail simply makes a face behind Violet's back (not subtle, writers -- not witty). I'm struggling to think of a part of any of the plots that wasn't recycled from an earlier part of the series. Apart from the monarchy scheduling a visit to Downton -- but a six-year-old could come up with that premise. I'm enough of a Downton fan that I would watch anything they put out -- but if this is the quality of the writing, I won't bother to watch in cinema. (Really, considering the impressive feat of gathering all these memorable characters together, the writing shouldn't have let them down like this.)",Downton Abbey
420,hollisterpeev,What a horrible disappointment so it gets a big 1/10 from me,1,15 December 2019,"If I was allowed to give zero, I would have.This was an implausible story line made worse with hesitant, empty, wooden acting - it often felt like some were reciting - badly - from cue cards. I had waited such a long time for the film to finally arrive, and within the first 10 minutes realized that to continue watching would be a waste of my time. So so sad.",Downton Abbey
421,quinnstigator,Lost in Agenda,4,18 December 2019,"Everything you loved in the series, now given the full attention of a major motion picture production. The perfect recipe for an enjoyable movie experience.
The royal family visits Downton Abbey. A dinner with all of the pomp and posh to satisfy the Queen herself. Right?
Not exactly. Cut to a greasy filthy warehouse on fishgut alley and watch men dance with each other and give your loyal fan base one dinner scene and quite lacking, at that.
So in the end, 6 years of Downton Abbey is reduced to a stage prop for the ever important political agenda. Well congratulations. Now everybody that was a fan is aware of the fact that there were gay men in warehouses who desperately needed dance lessons WHILE THE ROYAL FAMILY WAS VISITING DOWNTON ABBY.
Which is what we came to see. Frankly speaking I don't care if they revive the series now, because I feel betrayed,as a fan. You used my loyalty as a fan for an opportunity to show a gay courtship between the fill in the blanks actors in the cast. By the end of the movie Downton Abbey felt like a cardboard backdrop in a cheese ball Italian spaghetti Western.
Utterly pathetic.",Downton Abbey
422,speed_rod,Hopeless,2,4 January 2020,"Rather silly inclusion of the IRA and homosexuals. I just don't believe that anyone would ever have been silly enough to try to get rid of the King's travelling entourage, let alone actually be able to get away with that. Lots of other silly stuff. The Yorkshire Hussars were never a horse artillery regiment. That was obviously added for the visual effect. Not worth watching.",Downton Abbey
423,pollyrittenberg,Sumptuous Adaptation of a Great TV Show,10,18 March 2021,"I adored this movie. More specifically, I think one of the things the film did really well while making the transfer from the small to big screen is that it kept what made the show so fantastic (brilliant writing, the scenery, and gorgeous production design), but truly elevated it to the best cinematic levels.When the film started and there was that beautiful shot of the house, my eyes started to well up. Another shot that also teared me up because of its sheer beauty was watching Edith drive through the country side to her estate. While we are not as familiar with her home as Downton, the composition of that shot was just so stunning to me that it packed the same emotional resonance as seeing the main estate for the first time on the big screen.In terms of story, what I think the screenplay did really well was set up a high stakes event (the King and Queen coming to Downton) that everyone (upstairs and downstairs) could be involved in, but then from that one important event, various other situations spiraled out for the individuals. I know the TV show did that as well, but seeing it in a compressed amount of time, and still done well, was just amazing.Watching the ominous Major Chetwode seen boarding the train in the beginning was a great tension builder: is he working for the Crown? Is he a journalist wanting an inside scoop on the Royal visit? I adored the assassination attempt! As odd as that is to type, it was such a great moment for Tom to see how far he has come in his devotion to the family. He also seemed more settled with the push-and-pull of his Republican beliefs and being part of an aristocratic family.While it was a smaller part of the movie, I liked seeing Daisy finally grow up a bit. Andy clearly wants to marry her, but Daisy dragging her feet made me so annoyed! Jealousy over the plumber spurned Andy to make some questionable choices, but I did like seeing his devotion to Daisy.Downton is so good at dropping subtle hints about how characters are really feeling. In the beginning when Cora phoned Edith and Edith was trying to remember all of the luncheons she has to host now that she's the Marchioness of Hexham. The ending of the TV show made me so happy that Edith had found happiness with Bertie, which of course is there in spades, but the show really never got a chance to consider what her new, important life would look like. I loved seeing her Bertie discuss that together. It was one of the moments that made me think there could be a sequel film, even though the plots in the movie were nicely tied up for all. I think that moment ignited thoughts of a sequel because I would like to see more of Edith and Bertie in their new roles, with their new baby.Now for Thomas, I loved seeing him experience brief moments of happiness. I'm so glad that he got to go to a space with other gay men, even though it didn't end well. When he and Ellis were walking back into Downton and discussing their shared sexuality, I loved seeing Thomas look more relaxed. While he has played the excellent villain on occasion, all he has really wanted (personal life-wise) was not to feel so alone. If there is a sequel, I hope and Ellis get some form of happiness.All in all, if you were a fan of the TV show, you will really enjoy the movie.",Downton Abbey

426,jdevecchis,Cash Grab,5,30 September 2019,"It was just so silly and sentimental. It's a tv show gone movie. Therefore it should have been movie worthy. It wasn't.
Nothing at stake. No true conflict. Nothing new. And the characters were acting like Disney characters of themselves with a very silly premise. It's 20 minutes of set up for each character and 40 mins of closures.
I loved the show, but the movie is a cash grab of sentimental pomp.",Downton Abbey

I'm sure that there are those out there that find that it was too perfect, and everything was tied up in a pretty bow, but I say, why can't it?!
Seeing my favorite characters FINALLY get their happy endings made me smile.
This movie truly had it all: humor, seriousness, snide comments, and brilliant one-liners!
A hearty thank you to Julian Fellowes and the brilliant cast for making this Downton fan grin from ear to ear with satisfaction!",Downton Abbey
432,enid-hansen,Feel good for fans,7,15 September 2019,"Being a huge fan of the series, I enjoyed the film, but it was nowhere near as good as the series. My favourite character has always been the Dowager Countess, and she has brilliant one-liners, but little other text, making it almost seem like a spoof. Only at the end does this change.I suppose that sums up the weaknesses in the script: wanting to do too much in too little time. Yet nonetheless, being a massive fan, I enjoyed watching it!",Downton Abbey

I was afraid I would not like the movie because I would walk out wanting another show ""next week"" like it was as a PBS Series.I was wrong. I STILL LOVE Downton Abby and thought they did a great job including all the info they did include. That being said ..... I thought the first half of the movie was slow and sort of boring. That quickly changed for the second half which was great and wrapped everything up very nicely.I also think it will definitely lead to another movie.As usual.....great scenery, beautiful shows and supurb acting !!!",Downton Abbey

From the opening music which makes us all happy to the applause at the end, I was enthralled. The characters we know well and love were there and new characters were introduced who were interesting and fit right in. Without giving up a spoiler, I couldn't get over how much Ms. Smith (not Maggie, by the way) looked like Sybil. And as much as I didn't like a certain character through most of the television series, I found myself being happy for that character in the film. I am sure I will see this movie again, and enjoy it just as much the second time.",Downton Abbey
445,LivAlex,Boring overall,3,25 September 2019,"The opening sequence. The reintroduction to beloved characters. the music. Gorgeous. Perfect. Felt like I was watching an episode and it never skipped a beat. Except that it was a buildup episode to something more exciting next week, only nothing ever happens. It's very full. They tried to mash something in for every character in two hours and that didn't round the story out. Could have been better.

A bit of intrigue, a bit of snarky poshness but most of all... Just wonderful.",Downton Abbey
447,lpanure-83676,Lovely escapism,8,15 September 2019,"I waited anxiously like most Downton fans for the film & overall was not disappointed. I think I laughed out loud more than a few times, as did others in the theatre. Solid round of applause from my fellow viewers at the end.The storylines & characters were true to the series & as others have said, the costumes were even more glamorous than before. It was nice to see Mary treat Edith as a peer, and the final scenes of Mary & Violet talking about the future of the estate were perfectly done. When Isobel interrupted them my heart broke a little thinking ""OMG, she's going to be devastated.""My only negatives are 1) too many aerial/drone shots of the castle (felt like an ad for a Viking tour!) 2) no solid info on the status of Molesly & Baxter's relationship 3) Molesly was funny but almost felt over-acted, almost cheezy 4) the children were pointless - more like additional scenery than actual characters.That said, it was lovely to escape modern-world stressors & step into Julian Fellowes' 1920's for a couple hours.",Downton Abbey
448,revelstone77,Profoundly disappointed,4,26 September 2019,"We loved the series and had high hopes for the movie, but found it largely unbelievable and fragmented. The whole sub plot with Thomas and his friend was totally frivolous and didn't further the plot at all. The servant uprising was totally unbelievable and the relationship between Tom and Lucy progressed way to quickly to be believed. One last bone, the scene with Granny and Mary was over played and smarmy. Other than that, the music, cinematography, and costuming were up to the high standards of the series. They seem to have left it open to a sequel, but if I watch it at all, it will be after it comes to a streaming platform.",Downton Abbey
449,BCarl,Opening sequence and the musical themes,9,29 September 2019,"I am a musician and have immensely enjoyed JOHN LUNN's scores for the TV series. As the film opening progressed, I kept waiting for the main theme to begin. Ingeniously, Lunn's score for the opening equence started with short motifs of the themes here and there, gradually lengthening them into more recognizable phrases.
Then, just as the camera panned up and the Abbey started to come into full view, the classic opening theme began in all its glory.
If you're a fan of the series music, that alone is worth the price of admission.",Downton Abbey

Love the fact that they left the ending wide open for a sequel. Great night at the movies - it was such a pleasure seeing my Downton favorites on the big screen.

It's a good clean movie, the likes of which is almost an endangered species these days. Don't get me wrong, I'm no prude. I loved Game Of Thrones!

However, although there were a few satisfying elements relating to specific characters' development, the story as a whole was dull. The central ""conflict"", if you can call it that, was barely a hiccup worth mentioning and not enough to drive the story for 2 whole hours. Also, with the limited time, most of the characters we've grown to love had only a few lines. It was disappointing. The King and Queen were very flat, and the Princess's marital turmoil never explained. Of course, Maggie Smith stole the show with her quick retorts and one-liners. And they let Tom smile more in this movie than the whole rest of the series. But otherwise the movie was pretty milquetoast.",Downton Abbey

Maggie Smith is the cherry on top of the beautiful movie that was made to close all stories that ended abruptley during the series. A lot of people wanted more action or another twist of events but I personally love that they kept the original line, slow paced,quality oriented and they just closed the series..they didn't started another chapter that woud have probabily made us all want more. A big 10 from me! Go and see the movie if you've seen the series. If not then...it won't make much sense but you will still love the aristocratic life from the 20s.",Downton Abbey
