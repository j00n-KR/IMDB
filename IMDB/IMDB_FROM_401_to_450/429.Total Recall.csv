0,Leofwine_draca,"A soulless, hollow viewing experience",4,8 December 2014,"TOTAL RECALL, a modern-day adaptation of the Philip K. Dick story WE WILL REMEMBER IT FOR YOU WHOLESALE, is the second filmed version of the material following on from the 1990 Schwarzenegger movie. Unfortunately, it pales in comparison to that movie in every respect. In essence, this film can be summed up as follows: action/CGI/CGI/CGI/action/action/CGI/CGI, repeated ad infinitum.It turns out to be a soulless and hollow viewing experience, one which lacks depth and the kind of drive to make it an exciting production. Instead it plays out superficially, never deeper than the level of a comic strip, refusing characterisation at all times. Unforgivably, it also excises all of the good stuff from the Arnie movie: the humour, the satire, the background, the sci-fi elements, the violence, and the effects.What we're left with is one long chase movie, augmented by endless CGI effects which lose their impressiveness about five minutes in. TOTAL RECALL is a movie which makes the classic Hollywood mistake of imagining that bigger effects = better action (think of TRANSFORMERS, 2012), whereas those filmmakers who realise that greater intensity = better action (THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, THE RAID) do far better. Colin Farrell is humourless in an uninteresting lead role, while Kate Beckinsale gives an embarrassingly wooden performance. Other actors, like Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy, are given so little screen time that they barely register. In fact, the only parts of this I really enjoyed were the in-jokes referencing the earlier classic movie.",Total Recall
1,SnoopyStyle,"action, action, more action, till we're numb",6,11 August 2013,"Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) lives in the crowded colonial Australia with his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale). He travels to his factory work in Britain thru The Fall, an elevator through the center of the earth. He builds security robots with his friend Harry. He goes to Rekall to implant a created memory as a vacation. All hell breaks loose. Melina (Jessica Biel) is a resistance fighter.The 1990 original has Arnold Schwarzenegger in campy iconic fun sci-fi action movie. In this one, director Len Wiseman drops any sense of camp or light fun. Arnie's light humor is missed. There is some good action but no chemistry between anybody. The movie doesn't stop for a moment to take a breath. It's either action, action, action, or explain, explain, explain. The ending runs on, and on, and on. Basically it takes too long to finish.Now we come to The Fall. It's a visually interesting idea, but it makes no real-world sense. It looks good. It has good visuals, but IT MAKES NO SENSE. If The Fall delivers you to another planet, that would be better as a sci-fi concept.",Total Recall
2,claudio_carvalho,Outrageous Recall,4,29 December 2012,"I have watched the excellent Paul Verhoeven's ""Total Recall"" at least ten times in the movie theater, on VHS, on cable television and on DVD. For me, this movie is one of the best sci-fi films ever, with non-stop action. The story has many twists, and the screenplay has no flaws, being very attractive. This was the first movie that the beauty of the unknown Sharon Stone (in 1990) called my attention. Arnold Schwarzenegger is great performing a dubious hero, and Michael Ironside is the perfect villain.I hate remakes and I was reluctant to see the remake of ""Total Recall"". However, my wife convinced me to give a chance to this movie on DVD. The story is awful, without Mars, without the mutants and without the direction of Paul Verhoeven. The forgettable screenplay uses the visual concept of ""Blade Runner""; the floating cars of ""The Fifth Element""; and the army of ""Star Wars"" entwined with a poor recollection of the original ""Total Recall""; lots of explosions; and the hot Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel to compensate the weakness of the plot. Colin Farrell is not even a shadow of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The result is an outrageous recall, and never a ""Total Recall"" of a classic. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""O Vingador do Futuro"" (""The Avenger of the Future"")",Total Recall
3,nogodnomasters,KILL HIM ON SIGHT!,6,25 July 2018,"I kept thinking about the original film while watching this one. To put it simply: Arnold was better than Colin Farrell. Kate Beckinsale in the expanded role is better than Sharon Stone, and I really love them both. Jessica Biel is better than anyone, if you don't believe me, ask her. What I really liked about this film is the updated special effects, down to the electronic notes on the refrigerator door. I love attention to detail.The action was fast paced. The future looks similar to ""The Fifth Element"" but with more computer gizmos. If you have seen the original version, then you can miss the first few minutes of this one and be able to pick it up.For some reason they eliminated all the fun aspects of going to Mars. That is why we watched the first film. Instead we get a film where we simply root for the terrorists. The terrorists are revolting against the Chancellor who wants to replace workers with synthetics, although this theme was poorly developed.One of the aspects of both productions that I didn't like was the initial dream sequence. Had they eliminated that from both films, then the genius of the script would have been the ambiguity of reality vs. the recall machine.The film included 3D holograms, Star Wars stormtroopers, Bill Nighy for a brief moment, and an inadvertent mention of an old film ""Hauser's Memory.""What I didn't like about this film was all the action. It didn't have drama scenes outside of the beginning. No colorful characters. No time for a Biel/ Farrell love scene. It was like watching someone play a video game. Seriously, where was the writing? The clever lines? The complex character? The relationship? Any moron can write ""Bang bang, run shoot, bang, chase, shoot, bang.""Parental Guide: F-Bomb, Nudity (Kaitlyn Leeb wearing a fake chest) no sex. 3 stars is pushing it. Can't wait for the video game.",Total Recall
4,kosmasp,Reality,7,3 January 2013,"I am still very fond of the original movie. And you have to have a lot of respect for Paul Verhoeven for getting that performance out of Arnold Schwarzenegger. A performance that was like the movie itself: Hard to define and borderline insane. And therefor had a genius written all over itself! It was not greeted well, when it was announced and I'm sure a lot of people didn't even bother watching it (the fact it was rated PG-13 drove away another wave of fans of the original). You also don't have as many one-liners for our main character here as there were in the original (most one liners are delivered by Kate Beckinsales character and she's doing an awesome job). Speaking of Kate: Let's say her role is slightly different from Sharon Stones. But not only character tweaks can be found, there also some little story tweaks. I can't tell you if you'll like them. I can tell you, that the special effects here are fantastic though. And I'm looking forward to the extended cut, which will have more ""gray"" areas, coming even closer to the Original.Which brings us to the final question: Was it necessary to do a remake? The box office stats would suggest, that yes it was.",Total Recall
5,jboothmillard,Total Recall,5,5 May 2013,"The original 1990 film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone and directed by Paul Verhoeven is one of my favourite films, there was half of me that was dubious and the other half curious about a remake, the trailer made it look worth a try, so I did, from director Len Wiseman (Underworld, Die Hard 4.0). Basically at the end of the 21st Century with a war globally devastating Earth there are only two remaining habitable territories, the United Federation of Britain (UFB) and the Colony (Australia), and workers access them via The Fall, a gravity elevator that travels through the centre of the Earth, but there is a resistance going on to try and improve life in the Colony. Douglas 'Doug' Quaid (Colin Farrell) is a factory worker thinks that he is meant for something more in life and wants to get away from it all, so despite advice not to he goes looking for the company Rekall, that specialise in artificial memory implants to take someone on a dream trip and experience, he is pointed to the location by a Three-Breasted Woman (Kaitlyn Leeb). He meets Rekall employee Bob McClane (John Cho) and chooses to become a secret agent for his memories, and as the implantation is about to happen the worker pulls a gun out as he has real memories of being a secret agent, and then the SWAT gun Mac and his co-workers, and before escaping Quaid's instinct caused him to kill the men. Returning home his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) suddenly loses her American accent turning English and tries to kill him, at gunpoint she reveals they have not been married for seven years, she is an undercover agent who has been monitoring him for six weeks, and knowing that she and others are after him he makes his escape. Quaid is contacted by claimed former associate Charles Hammond (Dylan Scott Smith), he communicates via a mobile phone embedded in his hand and he tells him where to get a safe deposit box, and to avoid being traced he cuts the phone parts out of his hand, and in the safe deposit box are some useful things to help him hide, and a message from his former self, Carl Hauser. Being pursued he meets the woman he had previously been dreaming about, Melina (Jessica Biel), she helps him escape and get to the apartment he has to get to, there he plays a tune on the piano that activates a second recorded message from Hauser, in the message it explains that he was working for UFB Chancellor Vilos Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston) as a highly skilled agent, and he defected the Resistance movement which meant he was captured and implanted with false memories and a new identity. The most important information Hauser gives Quaid is that Cohaagen is planning to provide more living space for UFB by using robotic police to invade the Colony, but there is a ""kill code"" to stop this, and this is deep within his memory, he has to find Resistance leader Matthias (Bill Nighy) in order to recover it, and a returning Melina reveals they were lovers previously and got separated when he was captured. Police start to surround the apartment building as they are about to leave, and Quaid's friend and colleague Harry (Bokeem Woodbine) shows up to try and convince him that he is experiencing side effects from the memory implantation at Rekall, he says he is in an induced dream, and the only way to get out is by killing Melina, he is momentarily conflicted, but noticing a tear from Melina's eye he decides to shoot and kill Harry. The two of them travel and find Matthias, but they are captured by Lori, Cohaagen and the SWAT capture them, the Chancellor reveals Quaid/Hauser without knowing it was secretly working for him, this is how his memories were altered, and the ""kill code"" was a fictional way to lure Matthias out of hiding, so he is killed. Quaid pleads for Melina's life to be spared while the memories of Hauser will be restored, she is taken away, but SWAT team member Hammond (Dylan Scott Smith) helps him escape before any mind altering, Hammond does die, and meanwhile Cohaagen is ready to launch the invasion and to travel through The Fall. Quaid arrives and sneaks aboard, he installs timed explosive devices on the shuttle, and after finding Melina they travel and reach the Colony, as they fight soldiers and the Chancellor the explosives detonate, the couple manage to jump off The Fall before it goes below surface and with Cohaagen and his army on board it blows up. Following the explosions in an ambulance Melina greets Quaid, but he notices a scar she showed on her hand is missing, it is actually Lori in disguise, they fight and she is killed by him, the real Melina and Quaid reunite and embrace their feelings kissing near a Rekall advertisement billboard behind them. Also starring Will Yun Lee as Marek. Farrell is okay but not as energetic as Schwarzenegger, Beckinsale is certainly feistier, determined to kill and used more than Stone was, and Cranston is a dull villain, the story sticks to the same kind of premise and keeps one or two of the elements from the original, but the Mars location is removed, there is no Kuato, and the villain plot is different, some of the chase and gun play sequences were fun to watch, and the special effects were fine, it feels routine, but it's not a bad science-fiction action thriller. Worth watching!",Total Recall
6,Tweekums,A decent enough remake with more changes than I expected,7,9 July 2018,"Set in a world where much of the Earth has been contaminated only two areas remain inhabitable; United Federation of Britain (Great Britain and Western Europe) and The Colony (Australia). These are linked by The Fall, a giant gravity elevator that passes through the Earth's core, which enables workers to travel from the Colony to the UFB to work. There are political troubles with groups in the colony fighting for better conditions.One such colonial worker is Douglas Quaid, he is married to a member of the UFB security forces and has recurrent dreams about being a secret agent. After some time he goes to Rekall, a company that gives you memories of an amazing adventure without actually having that adventure... Quaid opts for the Secret Agent Package. Immediately it seems as if something is very wrong as police storm the building and Quaid easily dispatches them. He flees and gets home, where his wife tells him his whole life was a lie before trying to kill him. He manages to escape again and is rescued by Melina, the woman from his dreams. Following leads he learns more about who he is, Quaid and Melina set out to find resistance leader Matthias.Having really enjoyed the original 'Total Recall' I was a little wary about this version... a major concern being that the first was a violent 18 certificate film but this was a teen friendly 12. As it turned out this was still quite violent and possibly includes more action... this action rarely stops once the story gets going. This means it is easy to overlook flaws as we are quickly onto the next action set-piece. The story isn't too complicated although there are some decent twists, if you haven't seen the original of course. The best thing about this version is that it doesn't slavishly copy the original; there are however some nice nods to it. Colin Farrell impresses as Quaid... he may not be as physically imposing as Arnie but is more believable as a secret agent for that very reason. The rest of the cast are solid enough although Bryan Cranston was somewhat underused as Chancellor Vilos Cohaagen, the oppressive leader of the UFB. Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel a good as Quaid's wife and Melina respectively. The special effects were really impressive; they created a believable dystopian world with some amazing technology. Overall I'd say this was much better than I expected although if I were to recommend just one version of 'Total Recall' it would be the original... perhaps for nostalgic reasons as much as anything else.",Total Recall
7,paul_haakonsen,A remake that was actually worth the effort...,7,31 October 2012,"I was fond of the 1990 ""Total Recall"" movie and it had some great ideas and concepts. And when this movie was announced, it was with a great level of skepticism from my side. I don't really get the Hollywood fetish with remaking old movies. But having seen this 2012 version, I must admit that it wasn't bad. It was actually rather enjoyable.However, it just requires you to forget about having seen the 1990 version, because there are a great many similarities between the two, but at the same time they are two completely different movies. The 1990 version had some good sides and bad sides, just as this 2012 version do.For starters, then this version is a visual treat. There are so many really cool effects and details. The design of the cities was really impressive to me. I enjoyed those multiple layer designs there was to almost everything in the cities. However, I didn't fully grasp the director's fetish about having everything be Asian-influenced. The robots in the movie were really interesting in design and appearance, I was really impressed with those.The action in the movie, of which there is quite a lot, is nicely executed and visually nice to look at as well. There is a lot of gun fighting and brawling. Not to forget about all the physical acrobats where people are jumping around the multiple levels of the cities. It is all very impressive to look at.Story-wise, well then the two movie are fairly much alike. There are some deviations, but in overall it is basically the same, except on takes place on Mars while the other takes place on Earth. So it might be a matter of personal preference of to which one is more lenient.Something I was missing in this version was Benny (who was in the 1990 version), his character was great then and would have been a great addition to the 2012 version. Also it would have been rather impressive (and fun) if they had managed to gotten some from the original cast to appear as small cameo appearances; for example Schwarzenegger passing by Hauser somewhere and just do something as simple as nod approvingly to him and greet him by saying ""Hauser"". Something like that would have been the icing on the cake.As for the people they had opted to go with for this 2012 version, well I must say that they were really right on the money. Normally I am not much of a fan of Colin Farrell's work, but he did quite a good job in this movie. As did Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Bryan Cranston, Bill Nighy and John Cho (actually great to see him out of the usual goofy comedy roles).All in all, then ""Total Recall"" (2012) is a great action movie that actually doesn't add to insult to the original 1990 version, which tend to be the case with these Hollywood remakes. I enjoyed both version for what they were and represented. Definitely worth a watch if you enjoyed the Schwarzenegger version.",Total Recall
8,tavm,This remake of Total Recall is a fine thriller in its own right,8,7 August 2012,"Okay, a few years ago I rewatched the Arnold Schwarzenegger-Paul Verhoeven version of Total Recall and gave it 10 stars. So I just now watched the Colin Farrell-Kate Beckinsale-Jessica Biel version and while I still prefer the previous version, this one wasn't so bad either. I mean, there are hardly any one-liners that Arnold did like that ""divorce"" line he gave to Sharon Stone then but there is still that dangerous edge that the original had that made this a worthy remake to watch. And the ending also provided a different twist than that of the original so that was also a good thing for me. So to make comparisons, I still prefer the Arnold version but this Total Recall gets a recommendation from me as well.",Total Recall
9,michaelRokeefe,Talk about taking a trip; flip out! Outstanding!,9,28 March 2017,"Mind blowing Sci-Fi directed by Len Wiseman. This is by no means a remake of the Schwarzenegger TOTAL RECALL; when life gets mundane and boring...take the ultimate trip. Factory worker Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) stops by a place called Rekall, to be implanted with fake memories to regenerate his life a little. Things go horribly wrong and after the mind-bending procedure, Quaid is trapped in a ""cat chasing the mouse"", spy versus spy roller coaster ride/chase. Violent and brutal situations with implausible escapes. Top dollar special effects that don't take away from the great acting of Farrell, and co-stars Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel. Ruthless and blood-thirsty action-packed thrills. Also in the cast: Bokeem Woodbine, Bryan Cranston, Bill Nighy, Will Yun Lee, Dylan Smith and James McGowen.",Total Recall

11,hitchcockthelegend,Reimaging suffers a Schizoid Embolism.,6,12 April 2014,"This reboot of the Paul Verhoeven/Arnold Schwarzenegger 1990 monster hit finds Colin Farrell as factory worker Douglas Quaid who, in search of meaning in his life and maybe an answer to his weird dreams, visits Rekall, a company who implant fantastical memories to order. When something strange shows up during the initial procedure, Quaid finds that nothing in his life is at all what he thought.There's a lot of very good craft here, there really is, that is on proviso you are happy to indulge in stylised effects over character substance. It's also a cold hard fact that fans of the original Philip K. Dick story, and fans of the Verhoeven bonkers adaptation, are very unlikely to embrace such a candy shop approach to what was once an inventive premise.Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale file in for the two lead female roles, which on facial likeness is a smart bit of casting, while on a butt point of view they have two of the best in the business. Farrell is competently gruff rough and tough, but again can you avert the thought process away from Schwarzenegger cutting a swathe through a futuristic world? A big problem is that as much as Beckinsale is lovely and feisty, the decision by her husband, director Len Wiseman, to make her part a complete film filler, grates on the nerves with its obvious stench of nepotiz. Still, if you are looking for a sci-fi picture awash with outrageous excitement, bangs and crashes galore and a sexy cast? Then this will certainly give you cause to chomp down with glee on your popcorn. There's homage nods to the Arnie movie, which are gratefully received, the pace never sags and the art design for this futuristic world is grade ""A"" in quality. As remakes go it's OK and far from being a stinker, you can have fun here, but it can't deliver enough quality to those fans mentioned earlier, and they are right to have such high standards. 6/10",Total Recall
12,LeonLouisRicci,Nothing Memorable,7,20 April 2013,"Completely absent is the dark humor of Philip K. Dick and Paul Verhoeven. In its place we get stupendous SFX and non stop mayhem. It has such a kinetic feel that the complex storyline gets vague and confusing, uninteresting and seems, ironically, unnecessary.It is an eye popping, if familiar and derivative look, that is electric and exciting and it never lets up. No time to catch your breath or probe any Philosophical or Political strands of the Novel's intent, it just explodes the screen with Roboticide and Dystopian clutter.This can be enjoyed in a dumbed down sort of CGI-Fest, but those wanting anything that even borders on intellectualizing or engaging storytelling need skip it and move on to a more conceived and convincing glimpse into the Mind of Philip K. Dick. Now there is a dark and disturbing place and you may find that it is probably still spinning.",Total Recall
13,CinemaSerf,"Not terrible, but the sum of the parts don't quite add up...",6,5 May 2020,"Depends on what you want to get from this reversioning of the 1990 Arnie smash, as to whether or not you will enjoy it. The cast of Colin Farrell; Kare Beckinsale, Jessica Biel and Bryan Cranston do a professional enough job with this slightly curious story of ""Quaid"" (Farrell) who decides to treat himself to some sexy new memories from the Rekall company. The installation, for want of a better word, goes wrong and next thing he is being chased by Cranston and his evil sidekick Beckinsale. It soon becomes a sort of ""I Robot"" style battle of humanity v synthetics only it completely lacks any charm; the actors go through the motions but there must have been so much CGI that there is little, if any, depth to the characters - and as such I didn't really care who did what to whom - indeed maybe the robots were right? The effects are good, as are the well staged fight-scenes; but the dialogue is pretty stilted and in the end this is nowhere near as engaging as it's namesake.",Total Recall
14,utgard14,"""What can I say? I give good wife.""",5,20 September 2014,"As far as remakes of great movies go, it could be worse. It doesn't match the style and creativity of the original film from Paul Verhoeven. This remake is made by Len Wiseman, the guy behind the Underworld movies and Live Free or Die Hard. Wiseman is not a director I have a great deal of respect for. He believes in throwing as much CGI as possible at the screen, with little concern for things like character and story. I'm also not a fan of his visual style, which usually means everything that isn't black is saturated in blue. Some of this is because of his CGI obsession. So I have my issues with Len Wiseman. That being said, I have enjoyed some of his movies and I did enjoy this one. While there isn't much about this version that's particularly memorable, it is a perfectly watchable sci-fi action thriller. The acting, writing, directing, and special effects are all adequate. Kate Beckinsale is the best part. This doesn't compare to the original movie, which was a fun, thrilling, and sometimes wonderfully cheesy masterpiece. But you won't hate it like many crappy remakes.",Total Recall
15,zardoz-13,Half-Bake Head Games,7,12 August 2012,"The remake of the vintage Arnold Schwarzenegger sci-fi saga ""Total Recall"" with Colin Farrell replacing Arnie as the hero isn't bad. Unfortunately, this atmospheric, above-average, but convoluted British produced extravaganza won't erase the memory of the original film with its gratuitous violence and abrasive cynicism. ""Underworld"" director Len Wiseman has made a polished looking picture, but he just doesn't deliver the goods with the same panache that director Paul Verhoeven served them up back in 1990. Incidentally, I didn't enjoy ""Total Recall"" as much as some of the Austrian bodybuilder's other sci-fi forays, namely ""The Terminator"" franchise and ""Predator."" Nevertheless, this larger-than-life actioneer boasted riveting action, stunning surprises, kinetically staged action with buckets of synthetic blood and layers of latex appliances. The cast spouted the F-word approximately 28 times and uttered it without qualm.Comparatively, Wiseman's ""Total Recall"" remake shares little in common with its 1990 predecessor in all those areas. The action here is practically plasma-free. The new film's PG-13 rating tones down much of what made the R-rated original so objectionable. The escalator scene in the first movie where Arnie appropriated the bullet-riddled corpse of an innocent bystander and deployed it as a shield to absorb a barrage of bullets is conspicuous missing from the new ""Total Recall."" Furthermore, Wiseman and scenarists Kurt Wimmer of ""Law Abiding Citizen"" and Mark Bomback of ""Unstoppable"" have confined the action entirely to a post apocalyptic planet Earth. Interestingly, Wiseman's ""Total Recall"" keeps most of the elements of cult author Philip K. Dick's imaginative short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" intact with minor exceptions. The short story concerned a white-collar hero, while the two films feature a blue-collar protagonist. Although the ""Total Recall"" remake shuns the Martian setting, it retains the template of the original without any aliens. Sadly, the chief villain in the remake seems congenial compared to the original scoundrel who spewed venom. Additionally, while the first movie eliminated Sharon Stone as a supporting villainess early in the action, the remake with Kate Beckinsale in Stone's role not only rewards her with considerably more screen time than Stone but also expands her role. She becomes the villain's right hand henchman.The new ""Total Recall"" unfolds in the late 21st century after chemical warfare has devastated the planet. Humans retreat to the only two remaining places. What had been the United Kingdom has become the United Federation of Britain. Meanwhile, Australia has become the Colony. If the cities in the United Federation of Britain bear a passing resemblance to both ""Metropolis"" and ""The Fifth Element,"" then the Colony resembles the overcrowded urban landscape of Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner."" Humanity is quickly running out of places to live. Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston of ""John Carter"") seeks to sanction urban renewal. He wants to lead his army of synthetic robots into the Colony and clean it out. Basically, the Colony is a dreary, rain-drenched, ghetto of a community. Cohaagen is searching for an excuse to storm it. A resistance movement has emerged around a notorious but enigmatic rebel, Matthias (Bill Nighy of ""Valkyrie""), who strikes fear in Cohaagen's heart. Cohaagen orchestrates terrorists' attacks on the UFB so he can invade the Colony. He plans to take advantage of the commuter train which runs between the UFB and the Colony. Essentially, this commuter train looks like a gigantic puck that plunges between the two destinations in fifteen minutes or less. The tunnel bores past the Earth's core where the train loses gravity briefly before entering the UFB. Working class stiff Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell of ""Minority Report"") lives in the Colony and has been taking the train to work for years. He assembles synthetic storm troopers for Cohaagen's army in a factory. When he isn't building better robots, he lives with his gorgeous wife Lori, (dark-haired Kate Beckinsale of ""Contraband""), who works as an emergency medical technician.Lately, Quaid has been having bizarre dreams. He has fantasies that he is fighting alongside a mysterious woman, Melina (Jessica Biel of ""Stealth""), in the resistance movement who loves him. One day Quaid decides to relieve the tedium of his meaningless existence. He enters a place known as Rekall that will implant memories which will enrich his life. Rekall is tantamount to a tanning salon except that they inject drugs into their customers so they can experience a number of role-playing scenarios. Quaid wants to fulfill his desire to be a secret agent battling hordes of bad guys. Little does our clueless protagonist suspect he may have been a secret agent.Make no mistake; the producers have spared no expense to create elaborate settings for this somber, straightforward dystopian thriller. Although Colin Farrell qualifies as a better actor than Arnold Schwarzenegger, Farrell lacks the iconic charisma of the former California governor. Schwarzenegger amounted to as much a special effect in the first one as all of the elaborate latex appliances that adorned a three-breasted prostitute as well as the mutants. Mind you, Wiseman makes an allusion to the three breasted woman, but he makes no reference to the resistance leader in the original that had a midget attached to his stomach like a bizarre Siamese twin. Instead, the remake pits Farrell against twice as many adversaries as the original. The villain's army of robotic warriors resembles those in the ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy with similar outfits. Although it bristles with careening car chases and close-quarters combat galore in cliffhanger encounters, ""Total Recall"" rarely provides anything remotely memorable. Wiseman has lost his knack for choreographing nimble action that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Beckinsale makes a terrific villain, while Farrell and company go through the motions. Somewhere in the ""Total Recall"" remake lurks a first class movie, but it never reached the screen.",Total Recall
16,grantss,Disappointing,3,21 May 2020,"Disappointing. Starts in intriguing and engaging fashion, but quickly degenerates into mindless twists and turns, chases and action scenes.

17,Boba_Fett1138,"Average genre movie, all the way through.",7,7 August 2012,"In all fairness, this is not a bad movie at all. As a genre movie it's simply providing some good fun and eye candy as well. However when you start comparing it to the first Paul Verhoeven movie version, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, you'll have to conclude that this movie, by far, is being an inferior one.There really were plenty of problems I had with this movie but the bottom-line of it all was that this movie is being nothing more but an average one, in about every regard. It stands out in absolutely no way, except maybe for its looks.Visually it's being a great movie to look at. Not only are the special effects just fine but so its set design. The movie really has a very typical futuristic/science-fiction Philip K. Dick look and feel to it and the movie is incredibly detailed looking. They definitely spend some money on this movie, which luckily can all be seen back on the screen.But lets get back to the problems of this movie. Probably the biggest problem of the movie is that it does a poor job at handling and telling its story. I would imaging that anyone who had never seen the first movie version, or has read the Philip K. Dick short story, will have an incredibly hard time figuring out what is going exactly on in this movie. It's never really focused enough on telling its story and the main plot line gets introduced far too late in this to its audience.Basically this is being a movie in which its main character is constantly on the run. It's like a non-stop chase movie, in which the movie never stops or slows down to elaborate on anything or let stuff sink in. It probably sounds like a good and awesome that this movie is incredibly fast paced and basically has non-stop action in it but let me tell; you get fed up with all of it after a while. It's also hard to remain impressed with everything this movie constantly throws at you. Instead of having one or two standout action scenes the movie is being like one, big, long but average action scene.This is probably why this movie will be a big disappointment to most people; it does absolutely nothing to stand out. It's sort of funny how the movie is constantly paying homage to the first movie version (also to please the fans no doubt) but it leaves out all of its greatest moments and does almost nothing creative or interesting by itself.It's hard to really feel involved with this movie, or with its main character, played by Colin Farrell, since it's mostly being average and predictable all the way through with its story and developments. This takes away so much of the tension and thriller aspects of the movie and besides ruins everything that potential could had been interesting and clever about this movie its story.Nothing wrong with being average.

Well, to be fair to him, he has to commute across, or rather through, the entire planet(the one exaggerated portion of the political overtones(the only place this stands out compared to the old classic), that aren't terribly preachy, and make a lot of sense, showing what the middle class life is like for far too many people today), on The Fall(an elevator that, at the halfway point, swaps the gravity around so you go from sitting regularly to being upside down... it's one of the few genuinely cool concepts in this) to get to a crappy job with no chance of getting promoted(because they're not from the right place) and then go to a bar and get drunk. So he decides to go to Rekall, where they implant fake recollections of something you'd like to have done, where something goes wrong, and suddenly people are trying to kill him. He still hesitates when Jessica Biel(or ""someone who really doesn't look like their name would be Melina""... and yup, hers are the other 50%; she kicks much less ass than you'd think, for the actress and the other take on the role, instead being saved by ""The Man"" in the lead) pulls up in a hovercar in front of him(because if it was a regular car, they couldn't rip off the vertical road chase from Minority Report, silly), doing the ""come wid me if you wan do live"" thing, because, well, words like Stealth and Blade: Trinity go through his head... then he remembers that he was in Alexander, and gets in, and we have our unnecessary remake. Obviously not an Arnie flick, this is instead today's brand of action movie(and gone is the satire and self-awareness of its genre)... big, dumb, loud, Michael Bay-ish, looks like a video-game and overpowers us instead of drawing us in. We have vehicles hunting each other, choreographed martial arts sequences(something the cast of this opens up to) and shootouts(with notably terrible aim on the bad guys, sucking the potential tension out). They blur together, start at 110% intensity(and never, ever lower that) and go on for too long, making them as much, or more of, a trial on the audience than a thrill. There are nice moments between the too shallowly characterized people in this, except they're few and far between. Cranston is a decent choice for a villain. This is over-CGI'ed, if the actual filming and, to an extent, editing of fights and the like aren't particularly a problem. Production design is phenomenal, with the multicultural(many different groups of people trying to make it their home) slums seeming like a place you could live... though you really don't want to(and thus our sympathies are with the downtrodden). This goes into the central theme(and one of the favorite subjects of the author, R.I.P.) from the Philip K. short story, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale - fantasy vs. reality. Where the '90 one used its structure to do so(making us believe something, then proving it to be an illusion), this uses philosophical exchanges of the otherwise dull dialog, and it works pretty well. This is never funny, in spite of numerous attempts at it. There is a bit of moderate to strong language, mild, bloodless ""violence"", a little sensuality, and brief topless nudity(yup, we have three-breasted lady again... because this thing can't go for long without reminding us of the excellent first film adaptation) in this. I recommend this to people who enjoy the current approach to the two genres this is so much that they don't need the motion picture to be, y'know, good. 6/10",Total Recall
20,view_and_review,Totall Recall 2.0 Should Have been Recalled,5,1 November 2014,"24 years ago I watched the original Total Recall. I can hardly remember it so I couldn't tell you how closely related this version was.Total Recall 2012 is another variance of the action packed spy movie. Long chase scenes, expertly choreographed fight scenes and plenty of shooting. So, what separates Total Recall from any other thrill-a-minute movie? Um, nothing really.The story is intriguing so long as you don't think about it too much as I unfortunately did. An agent of the state becomes a double agent that doesn't even know he's a double agent (or an agent of any kind). OK, that's not too bad, what's the problem there? Well, when Total Rekall (sic), a virtual reality experience center, uncovers that he is a secret agent he's instantly on the run while trying to put the pieces together. As he's following the bread crumbs he left for himself he discovers more about the people trying to kill him. The problem was the story and the bread crumbs.I ended the movie with questions and a feeling of dissatisfaction. To ask those questions in this review would give too much away but many are along the lines of what came first, the chicken or the egg? By the time the movie was all said and done there was a lot of superfluous fighting, shooting and running. I was largely disappointed.",Total Recall
21,neil-476,This will be more enjoyable if you have never seen the 1990 version - it's good but unoriginal,7,31 August 2012,"There are some interesting casting decisions in this film: Colin Farrell plays Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jessica Biel plays Rachel Ticotin, Brian Cranston plays Ronnie Cox, Bill Nighy plays Marshall Bell, Australia plays Mars, and Kate Beckinsale plays both Sharon Stone and Michael Ironside.All of which is my way of saying that Len Wiseman's 2012 remake of Paul Verhoeven's 1990's Total Recall is what I call a ""redecoration"" remake - you can hang new wallpaper, paint the woodwork a new colour, sell the antiques and Persian rug and replace them with Ikea and fitted Axminster, but the door and windows are still the same size and in the same place, the chimneybreast still comes down the same wall, it's still the same distance from corner to corner, and there's still only one sensible place to put the telly. The story here is virtually identical with the earlier version.It is, to be fair, dressed completely differently - to be specific, in very effective state-of-the-art CGI locations virtually throughout.The action is well handled, and the look of the film is terrific. The plot maguffin is to do with an elevator shaft through the earth rather than an oxygen supply for Mars, but that's all it is - a maguffin which serves the same purpose in the story. Farrell is a much better actor than Schwarzenegger, and conveys the utter confusion of Doug Quaid, suddenly immersed in a plot outside (he thinks) his experience, with a skill which Arnie could never approach. But the revelation here is Beckinsale. Sharon Stone's Lori has the edge as far as sexiness is concerned, but Beckinsale delivers a performance of dynamic and implacable malevolence which blows Michael Ironside's thug - who I still love - right off the screen.There are no surprises here if you have seen the 1990 version, but the story still works as well as it did before, and I enjoyed it.",Total Recall
22,anaconda-40658,Ferrell Wimps Out to Beckinsale.,5,25 August 2015,"Total Recall (2012): Dir: Len Wiseman / Cast: Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Bryan Cranston, Bokeem Woodbine: Unnecessary remake of the 1990 science fiction hit about the invasion of one's mind. Here, Arnold Schwarzenegger is replaced with Colin Farrell, and despite the reduction there, he still fares better than anyone else is this misfire. Set in the future of floating skyscrapers that will remind viewers of another Phillip K. Dick adaptation, Blade Runner. Visually the film is stunning, and the screenplay has its moments until its all out kick ass climax that is merely for show. Farrell is bored with his routine job so he hooks his mind up at the Recall centre with the fantasy of becoming a secret agent. Unfortunately chaos erupts and he finds himself on the run with a few clues as to who he is and why he is on this mission. Kate Beckinsale plays his wife who turns out to be a double agent out to kill him. This is where the film becomes a joke. Farrell is barely able to compete with her in physical combat and it comes off as a lame equal rights cry as oppose to a believable character. She bares none of the believability of Gina Carano from Haywire. Jessica Biel plays a contact who helps Farrell but the role is cardboard. She is at least able to have a reasonable scrap with Beckinsale where hitting her in the face for self defence isn't frown upon. Bryan Cranston plays the lifeless villain. Bokeem Woodbine plays Farrell's co-worker who apparently is really an agent. Directed by Len Wiseman of Underworld fame, and should be recalled along with the last of that franchise.

For Quaid, Rekall (a process by which false memories are implanted into a subjects head) seems like just the ""getaway"" he needs. Quaid finds himself thrust into the midst of a global conspiracy when the procedure to implant a secret agent mission into his memory goes wrong - or does it?First things first, this doesn't have anything on the Verhoevan version, but Farrell is more convincing then Schwarzenegger as an everyday blue collar worker.It's wonderful to look at, even though I'd see it all before, via the way of Bladerunner, The Fifth Element, Judge Dredd and numerous other dystopian visions of the future.It's all good stuff though, Beckinsale has never been better, and Biel has never been more forgettable, but Wiseman keeps the film at a heady pace, and it never gets boring, it's just the fact that the Verhoevan version is so memorable, and this is very hard to remember anything that outstanding that happened in the process (apart from the fact that one of the distributors of this remake are called Original Film).There is one scene that is very clever to fans of the original, a real red herring if I've ever seen one.

24,phd_travel,Total let down,2,6 August 2012,"This movie is one of those remakes which is not as good as the original 90s version. In other words it was pointless.There is some continuing action that keeps one mildly engaged but the story is weak. The Arnie version had a clear and interesting plot with charm and wit remember ""Sweetheart, be reasonable. After all, we're married!"", ""Consider this a divorce"". Also the climax was grand and fascinating - the lack of oxygen bug eyed thing.There are some vast multi level future cities that resemble an overcrowded Hong Kong or Shanghai. But the chase routines that race through them are repetitive after a while.Kate Beckinsale's character kept popping back too many times and there is no reason why she is so relentless. Maybe just because her husband is the director. It was nice to see Jessica Biel in a big budget movie again. Colin Farrell plays a more regular guy than an action hero which is good but he doesn't have interesting lines to deliver.Overall, see this if you want to but be warned it's not as good as the 90s version.",Total Recall
25,gradyharp,"'We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.'",6,30 December 2012,"Perhaps adding a little reference to Shakespeare adds a bit of dignity to this exercise in special effects wrapping Philip K. Dick's little short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"". As entertainment this film works well for those who like clever constructs of apocalyptic destruction and robotic culture and the idea behind Dicks story is fascinating to a point. But to make this noisy jumble of fighting and falling and tension last over two hours is begging indulgence.The summary with the product tells it well enough: 'Welcome to Rekall, the company that can turn your dreams into real memories. For a factory worker named Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), even though he's got a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) who he loves, the mind-trip sounds like the perfect vacation from his frustrating life - real memories of life as a super- spy might be just what he needs. But when the procedure goes horribly wrong, Quaid becomes a hunted man. Finding himself on the run from the police - controlled by Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston), the leader of the free world - Quaid teams up with a rebel fighter (Jessica Biel) to find the head of the underground resistance (Bill Nighy) and stop Cohaagen. The line between fantasy and reality gets blurred and the fate of his world hangs in the balance as Quaid discovers his true identity, his true love, and his true fate.There is some fine dialogue that gives the film an uplift: Matthias (Bill Nighy) 'It is each man's quest to find out who he truly is but the answer to that lies in the present, not in the past. As it is for all of us.' Doug Quaid (Colin Farrell) 'But the past tells us who we've become.' Matthias: The past is a construct of the mind. It blinds us. It fools us into believing it. But the heart wants to live in the present, look there. You'll find your answer.' The actors cope with this concept well - Collin Farrell is more buff than ever and handles his impossible role well, and Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Bryan Cranston, Bokeem Woodbine, and Bill Nighy (in a momentary role) all offer interesting moments.If you love sci-fi and clever visual tricks then this is a film for you.

26,trashgang,the PG rating made it lame against the original,7,10 September 2013,"I really liked the original because that was the era I grew up with horror and science fiction and knowing that Hollywood can make really bad remakes I doubted if I ever wanted to see this, not only that, Colin Farrell isn't an actor that I want to see because there's a thing about him I don't like but I must say that I didn't had any problem with him here.On part of the effects this is really stunning and I was surprised that it wasn't filmed in 3D like so many SF flicks nowadays. Storywise it followed the basics of the original but the most notorious scene was left out here. The one with the woman and her head opening up isn't here. We are tricked that's for sure because we do see a woman arrive in close-up and that's the moment you think, a-haa this is going to be it. But it wasn't. In fact, it wasn't that splatter full as the original. No mutants, inflating heads or bodies coming out of stomachs. Must be the PG-13 rating. Of course you can't have the comedy of Arnie talking but still, it's entertaining.I understand the negativity about the remake, no brutality only Beckinsale showing of here as a babe and doing some moves like in the Underworld saga. Even Bill Nighy is here from Underworld but only for a few minutes. If you never have seen the original then you will like it but it can't stood up against the 1990 version.

27,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Total Recall,7,2 August 2012,"I guess the floodgates are now open. Adapting Philip K. Dick's stories are no longer enough, and now a trend may follow either to remake the films that have already been done, to give it another spin for a new generation, or how about remaking all of the films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, starting from Conan, and now Total Recall. For sure, Colin Farrell can't step into the ex-Mr Universe's hulking frame in playing the construction worker turned double agent Douglas Quaid through what would seem like a fantasy walk in the park for the mind gone all wrong, but if you'd put away your memory of the past film, then his outing here would stand out against his recent slate of projects, bringing him back to action-hero mould even if Len Wiseman's vision here turned a little bit suspect.Fans of the original film will see only slight similarities in this one, since it took on a different adventure altogether after the familiar introduction. Quaid experiencing a nightmare of a dream only to wake up beside the sexy wife in Lori (Kate Beckinsale, in a role played by Sharon Stone previously, in lingerie no less), and finding that there's probably more to life than just home and work. Enticed by the fantasy inducing company called Rekall where one can live out one's fantasy for a fee, Douglas soon discovers he got more than he bargained for. The contraption's design got brought over, and so did the cult favourite in the three breasted woman, which Singapore back then didn't get to see at all because our censors found it offensive and unreal. The identity mask also has another go, although with less fun, being solely functional and little else.But what was sorely missed in this remake, is the quip after quip of Arnie-isms, those puns made each time Douglas Quaid did something smart alecky, dispatched an opponent, or just wanted to drawl on something in his Austrian accent. In the typical Arnie movie, there's always room for fun, jokes, and those legendary one liners. Here, all we get are dead serious moments, with the whole look and feel being laden with the need to feel all gritty. Colin Farrell wears a scowl throughout, being perplexed and confused about his true identity in Jason Bourne style complete with mysterious artifacts stored in a safe deposit box, and having doubts to the role he has to play in the entire battle between the Haves and Have Nots.This Total Recall requires that you junk all memories of the Schwarzenegger film, in order to enjoy the new narrative involving a chemical fallout across all lands save for Britain and parts of Europe now being part of a Greater Britain, and Australia, known as The Colony (yes, some slight historical references here). There's no Mars this time round, as the story gets set strictly on Earth, involving a carnival styled train service that commutes between the two territories, having to pass adjacent to the Earth's core, for some nifty CG effects involving gravitational force reversal.CG seemed to be what Director Len Wiseman ordered for the film, with green screen effects and CG laden landscapes peppering the entire movie, that makes you wonder about the tagline ""What is real?"" indeed. It's big on action sequences and slight on actual story, with pauses only to allow the film to breathe a little, before embarking on yet another stunt sequence that involves plenty of running for Douglas Quaid, and his new found love interest / revolutionary partner Melina (Jessica Biel), as they escape from rooftops to elevators, pass through deadly three dimensional elevator shafts and tunnels, fighting their way past synthetic troopers ala Star Wars. It does get pretty generic after a while, that these sequences all start to look very much the same, and probably a Star Wars: Clone Wars episode gone wrong.Also for the tagline of ""What is real?"", this remake doesn't really keep you in suspense in a what is, and what is not thought, because for this new generation of audiences, Len Wiseman probably considered it best if everything was spoonfed. So there's no need to guess, and everything got explained verbatim, that you'd know whether it's real, otherwise, and just about every plot and character twist being laid out for all and sundry. Between the two female leads, Kate Beckinsale got more screen time for obvious reasons, though it's not everyday that we get to see her in a negative role. It's clearly expanded here, with her Melina being something of an amalgam of the roles played by Sharon Stone and Michael Ironside as the relentless pursuer of Douglas Quaid, adamant in hunting him down and finishing him off, against orders.Ultimately, Total Recall 2012 is one big amusement park ride. This will probably be enjoyable for anyone in for an average CG action adventure extravaganza and have no knowledge of the fun blockbuster the first one was, but for the rest of us who have seen Paul Verhoeven's version, this one definitely pales in comparison, in story, action and just plain fun. And Arnold Schwarzenegger was in his prime then, with big shoes that didn't get filled this time round.",Total Recall
28,siderite,Not so total recall,7,4 November 2012,"I remembered the old Total Recall movie with fondness and for that reason I decided to watch it again before watching the new version. While the 1990 version was 80% Robocop with a different script and Conan instead of a robot, the 2012 seems to be 80% Underworld, without vampires and werewolves, yet, ironically, with robots.Mars was replaced with Earth. Mutant workers replaced with the population of a controlled colony, the ridiculous scientific ideas in the 1990 version were replaced with other ridiculous scientific ideas, only completely over the top (transporting people from one side to the other of the Earth via a giant elevator, for instance), and the CGI was punched to the max, on the tune of Blade Runner and Minority Report.The general idea remains the same, though, with Colin Farrell doing a very decent acting job and the two insanely lovely actresses mostly running around and kicking butt. However this version places a lot of the emphasis on the action scenes. Remove them and the entire plot is stripped down, empty, mediocre. That's why, even being better on all counts than the Paul Verhoeven version, it doesn't measure much above it overall.Bottom line: visually stunning (and not just because of Kate and Jessica), exhausting speed, good acting, a plot that makes no sense and a very small, oh so very small role for Bill Nighy.

30,KineticSeoul,Lacks psychological thrills and emotions and is nothing really intelligent but still a entertaining popcorn flick,7,17 August 2012,"This is basically a cooler version of the one with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. Now some audiences and critics might bash on this movie cause just about every twist and turns you will see it coming if you seen the original. Well for me it's been quite a long time ago since I seen the original so I was fresh walking into this movie. Now this lacks anything psychologically thrilling and anything really emotionally driven. And also lacks the feeling that something major is at stake. Something major is at stake but it just doesn't feel like it. But it does have some cool and stylized action and chase sequences that Len Wiseman is known for doing. This movie is basically a mash between ""The Fugitive"" cause it's about a guy on the rune while trying to outsmart the authority. ""Blade Runner"" because of the environment and ""Equilibrium"" because of the action and fighting against a corporation that tries to enforce false realities. And maybe a little of ""Fifth Element"". But like I said it just lacked the psychological thrills or anything emotionally driven like some of these movies. Colin Farrell is alright in this and Jessica Biel is good and believable as a rebel. She is just attractive and believable while playing the tough chick that fights for what she believes in. But the main show stealer is Kate Beckinsale, she is just badass. She may not be a very developed character but her presence on screen is just charismatic and likable, yeah she is one of the villain in this but she is likable. Because she plays the badass villain in a charismatic and cool fashion. It was nice to see Bryan Cranston in this as well. What it comes down to is a unintelligent popcorn flick that mashes a lot of sci-fi stuff together but it's entertaining to watch. Sure, it might not be as creative, in depth or thought provoking as other sci-fi films out there but it did it's job when it came to entertainment without it annoying the viewers. But there is one part where Lori Quaid tries to kill the main protagonist and it did not make much sense when compared to the original. It did lead to a cool chase sequence afterwards though.7.5/10",Total Recall
31,Hellmant,Lacks a presence like Arnold Schwarzenegger!,8,8 August 2012,"'TOTAL RECALL': Four Stars (Out of Five) Director Len Wiseman's remake of the Arnold Schwarzenegger 1990 sci-fi classic directed by Paul Verhoeven. This version stars Colin Farrell in the Schwarzenegger role, Jessica Biel, Bryan Cranston and Kate Beckinsale in the femme fatale role made famous by Sharon Stone in the original. It was written by Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback and based on the 1990 screenplay by Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon and Jon Povill as well as the 1966 Philip K. Dick short story 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale'. This version doesn't contain any elements set on Mars and is laced with political overtones. It's not nearly as memorable or classic as the original but it is a decent action film and spectacularly visual special effects film! Farrell plays Douglas Quaid, a factory worker in 2084 who is growing increasingly bored with his tedious and monotonous life. The world is ran by the United Federation of Britain (UFB) and The Colony and the two nations are at war over the minimal amount of space left in the world. Citizens, such as Quaid, travel between the two nations in a gravity elevator called 'The Fall'. Quaid lives a poor mundane life in The Colony while traveling to the UFB for work. Despite having a beautiful wife (Beckinsale) he dreams of something more and continues having violent nightmares involving another woman (Biel). He visits a special business one night called Rekall that promises it can implant the memories he's always dreamed of. While undergoing the process something goes horribly wrong and Quaid learns he's actually a spy working for the resistance and is caught up in something much bigger than he had ever dreamed of (or is it just all part of what he paid for?).The movie is packed with some fantastic actions scenes and looks amazing (some of the best visual effects to date). Wiseman (who also directed the first two 'UNEDERWORLD' films and 'LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD') does an adequate job directing on a technical level but the film lacks the dry wit and dark humor that made the original so memorable. It also lacks a presence like Arnold Schwarzenegger! Colin Farrell is a good and likable actor but he's no movie star. I had heard they were considering Tom Hardy for the lead role, who would have been fantastic (he's definitely got what a movie like this needs). The film also is missing multiple classic elements and scenes from the original that, if you're a die-hard fan of, are hard to do without. It's one improvement though is Kate Beckinsale. She's not quite as sexy as Stone was in her prime (which is when she made the original film) but she makes one badass femme fatale and what they did with her character in this version really is an improvement over the original. Not a complete waste but not one of the best remakes I've seen either. It's way too hard to top the original but it's still an interesting and entertaining film going experience.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diBy263FaHs",Total Recall
32,thesar-2,Totally Recall the Original was Better,4,6 January 2013,"Funny. Not to begin with such spoilers, but Total Recall (2012) seemed to accomplish in two hours what George Lucas spread too thin over three over-long Star Wars prequels. (Yeah, that's a plot point giveaway.)In a movie that's basically just one long chase scene with oodles of CGI backdrops, Total Recall (2012) seems to completely wipe out all the heart, fun and excitement of the 1990 original. Sure, the Arnold one wasn't exactly what the book's author had in mind – Mars, anyone? – it still was one of the most enjoyable action/sci-fi flicks I've ever seen and one of the best Schwarzenegger films. This onethis visionwas so realistic it made the adventure way too drab.I was about to write the synopsis of this reimagining tale, and even though it's only been done one time before, who really doesn't know the story of bored future worker, Doug Quaid and his journey to ""Rekall"" to implant fake spy memories? All hell breaks loose and he's being chased by two women, a corrupt leader and a rebellious underground guy. Same ole, same old? Well, sorta.This is probably just me, but it was hard for me to tell the two women apart, they looked so similar. Yeah, yeah, it was just me, but I believe and will stand behind, that was a poor choice to cast both Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel in these roles. The movie, as good as it looks, is so overrun by special effects and futuristic designs, that I had to constantly remind myself which girl was the good one or bad one.I miss the 1990 version. Absolutely it was pure 90s and a Schwarzenegger vehicle, but I ""rekall"" a better ride with more depth, characters I cared for, surprises I didn't anticipate and funnier lines. The writer here must've known that and, though I appreciated the two minute scenes of homage, I think with more time on the story and less on I-Robot droids, we would've had a better project to want to see again.For, I didn't hate this, but I never, ever want to see again.

All the same, parts of this are quite enjoyable. While the lead is a little too bland-everyman, Beckinsale is fun as a very determined heavy, and the story itself is still twisty and clever, although less so if you already know the story, as fans of the original do.There are some good action scenes as well, yet I was rarely on the edge of my seat. The special effects seemed underwhelming, especially that flying car chase, but they were decent (perhaps technically better than the original, which I haven't seen for years but which may not have aged well). The look of the film tends towards monochromatic. This movie aims to be serious in a way the first one didn't, which may explain why the heroes are so bland. While I don't think the world needed this remake, I don't object to its existence. It's entertaining enough. And the original wasn't such a masterpiece that it outrages me to see it remade; it was pretty silly. But between the two, I'd take the first one.",Total Recall

in the extended version of the movie, there was a scene at the very end in which Colin Farrell pulls off the bandage on his elbow and you can see that there is no longer the marking that he received when he first went to recall. I think that very strongly implies that he is still in a mental psychosis state after doing the recall and didn't want to come back to reality , which changes everything and alleviates a lot of the issues I had with the movie the first time I watched it. and also adds a lot to the story, making you wonder if the scene from earlier in the movie when they try to convince him to come out of that fantasy was actually the truth , and if he just stayed in his fantasy because he was so bored and fed up with his life",Total Recall

Only Doug takes his fantasy to be reality, as a secret agent, the only hope against the tyrannical Cohagen (Bryan Cranston) who is opposed by a group of resistance fighters, lead by Matthias (Bill Nighy.)""It's not a re-make, it's a re-imagining!!!"" came the cry from all involved. In a day and age where movies (certainly, big budget action movies) seem to lack any sense of genuine inspiration or creativity, this was a novel idea to sell this, er, re-imagining of the unforgettable 1990 Arnie film on, and left it with more to prove of itself, given what inevitably high standards it would have to live up to and how comparatively recent the original still is. If it felt like Len Wiseman, of the Underworld saga, had genuinely tried to craft the film from this angle, and simply taken the original film and genuinely just written/told it in his own way, there might have been something to work on. Unfortunately, 2012's Total Recall plays out in an almost the same way Gus Van Sant's Psycho did, scene for scene just like the original, leaving it a turgidly by the numbers experience that just goes through the motions till the end.Cast wise, Farrell is as solid and reliable as anyone else might have been in the new role, even if his performance or the writing of his character hardly make a massive impression. Special mention must go to Kate Beckinsale as Quaid's wife, originally played by Sharon Stone. There isn't much doubt she's a better actress than Stone, and she honestly gives the role a style and presence all of her own, but even so, she can't make you hark for the original any less. Conversely, in a role Ronny Cox brought to life with such cruelty and menace, Cranston's Cohagen is just a cardboard blandstand. It's surprising an actor of Nighy's calibre wasn't given more to do and more of a chance to make his supporting role shine.Although being a remake of one of my all time favourite Arnie films was always going to make it set low expectations of itself, had it honestly tried to be a re-imagining of the story all on it's own, it might have worked. By playing out almost scene for scene like the original film, it shoots itself in the foot and proves those low expectations right. **",Total Recall
36,Pjtaylor-96-138044,We can remake it for you wholesale.,4,31 May 2019,"'Total Recall (2012)' is just a humourless, heavily watered down version of Verhoeven's classic. In terms of its construction, it's perfectly competent - aside from its use of lens flares, the absolutely insane amount of which would make even J.J. Abrams cringe. It's just characterless, though. It really is as bland as it could possibly be. It hits all the beats you'd expect but changes a couple of them just enough to remove them of their impact, while also unnecessarily gutting the piece of its most interesting visual aspect: mars. Perhaps it's trying to be closer to the book, but it is clearly influenced heavily by 'Total Recall (1990)' and includes a number of film-specific references. It also glosses over some things, seemingly in the assumption that its audience is already familiar with them. Therefore, its changes feel especially pointless because they make the experience worse; it's different just for the sake of being different. Of course, if it were exactly the same as the original it would be superfluous, too, but - in theory - it would have a chance of being close in quality to it. Look, the flick isn't absolutely terrible. There's some decent action and the acting is, generally, alright. It also moves quite quickly - though, not quite as quickly as you'd perhaps like. Overall, however, the picture doesn't do enough to make you care, goes overboard in expressing its themes (which aren't captured as concisely or as comprehensively as they could have been) and is, generally, just dull. It's not particularly enjoyable and it isn't doing anything new. 4/10",Total Recall
37,bowmanblue,"A good film, only flawed by the original",7,8 February 2015,"Imagine a world where 1990 didn't happen. Then, some 22 years later, a sci-fi action film comes out where Colin Farrell plays a lowly construction worker who wakes up one morning to find out that he might be a spy and everyone is trying to kill him. Everyone would love it and hail it as a great film.However, 1990 DID happen and, during that year, Arnold Schwarzenegger released Total Recall - a much loved sci-fi romp where he does all that and more.Therefore, many people (including me) said, 'Why are they bothering to remake it?' To be fair, Colin Farrell's version isn't bad: it has great sets, great special effects, awesome chases and some nice ideas (more based on the original source material - short story by Phillip K Dick than Arnie's version was). However, its major drawback is a sense that we've seen it all before. Every now and again, you'll find a scene which is nearly word for word identical to the 1990 version and it keeps reminding you that you've actually seen this story before. I found this quite jarring.It gets the action and tension right and plays the whole things straight - quite a major change from Arnie's 'one-liners' and pulpy comic book feel to the original.If you haven't seen the original and you like sci-fi, then you're definitely missing out. I think for those who might not have seen it yet, they'll appreciate Colin Farrell's version more. But this is a project that was always semi-doomed from the start. Schwarzenegger's version was always going to be too popular to completely match. Fair play for them for doing their best to go in a different direction, but I think this is one film that would actually benefit from NOT being called Total Recall.It's a good film and it certainly doesn't deserve the typical scorn that most remakes automatically receive. However, I still think it comes back to the question, 'Why did they bother?'",Total Recall

And I thought it was OK for a popcorn action flick. The special effects were good, with the flying cars, the buildings in the air. So, most of earth's land has been destroyed and there are 2 sections left, Federation of Britain and the Colony. The Federation wants to overtake the smaller Colony and move some of its people there. Colin Ferrell plays, Doug, a worker from the Colony, but later we learn he used to work for the federation and all his memories are lies. That's when the chase starts and he is ""hunted"" by his not really wife, Lori, and gets into all these fights. He finds Melina whom he sort of remembers and it's up to them to save the Colony.FINAL VERDICT: It's watchable, good special effects, I think 20 somethings will like it.",Total Recall
39,g-bodyl,Too Harshly Judged!,8,9 February 2014,"This film, the remake of the 1990 sci-fi classic Total Recall, shouldn't be judged as a remake film but more as a film in itself. As a remake, it's pretty awful and has nothing of what made the original stand out. But as an original film, it's a fun, action-packed blockbuster that is nothing short of explosions, a very creative and futuristic set design, and plenty of car chases and such to keep the action junkie in good spirits.Len Wiseman, who is most known for the first two Underworld films, directs a film that has a rather complicated plot, similar to the original. This film is about Douglas Quaid, who after a visit to Rekall with implants him with fakes memories, goes on the run after something goes terribly wrong.This film has solid acting for the most part. Colin Farrell does a decent job in a role which Arnold Schwarzenegger made famous. Kate Beckinsale is still pretty and she does not have to be Selene to kick some butt. Jessica Biel is quite sexy in this film, but I think she has more to offer. There were some memorable supporting turns by Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy.Overall, this film fails as a remake. But being merciful, I'm judging this film as an original action film. It has some typical action clichés and a few script issues, but it has lots of big action pieces and it looks very stylish. I had a fun time watching this film and because I watched this film with a closed mind and found it entertaining. I rate this film 8/10.",Total Recall

It's not particularly enjoyable, but as it is a remake you wouldn't expect much, I don't think that they're always bad ideas, but this 1990 sci-fi Arnold Schwarzenegger film did not need one, it just felt very unnecessary, the entire time I was watching it all I could think about was how did anyone think it was a good idea. The effects are certainly stunning and the best part of the entire movie, they clearly put good money in to it and some great action sequences take us away from how poor the film itself generally is. The weakest point is the major plot changes, though I do think it's right to do this is in remakes, to a certain degree, but it was too extreme here, going to Mars is the whole point of Total Recall, which they don't even do in this movie, it's like making a new Jurassic Park without dinosaurs, it simply didn't feel right. It's not awful and certainly has its moments, but Total Recall is a very weak remake that nobody asked for, and I think people would be better off avoiding it.

42,inkblot11,"Total letdown, but not because the cast was unworthy",5,25 June 2013,"In this remake of a classic Schwarzenegger film, the near future-earth has great new tech-achievements. One is that, if you are lacking a carload of cash, you can buy a memory of vacation you never really took. Carl (Colin Farrell) has dreamed of going to Mars but as an ordinary maintenance man, the price is too steep. So, he wants the next best thing. His sharp-tongues wife (Kate Beckinsale) tries to talk him out of it but, no dice. However, when Carl steps into the memory-maker's booth, everything goes haywire. It seems Carl has other, deeper memories that come to the surface, memories of his life as a secret agent. A beautiful young woman, Melina (Jessica Biel) comes to Carl's rescue, just before wifey succeeds in killing her hubby. Truth is, the wedded couple were recently married, when Carl's memory was erased, and she, as an agent for opposing forces, was suppose to keep an eye on him. Now, through an enormous, populated city, Carl, whose real name is Doug, and Melina try to avoid being captured. This is serious stuff, folks! Will they make it out alive? Wow, what a total letdown from the Arnold version. THAT ONE was marvelous despite being made before effects were at the level of today. This one has an art direction that is a failure, sets are too busy and the effects don't work for the benefit of the story. Len Wiseman, the director, should be faulted, too, as the outstanding story from Philip K. Dick was supposed to be on Mars and this one takes place on earth. What's director for if not to fight for the best effects and setting that is? Yes, Farrell is an engaging performer as is Beckinsale (Wiseman's wife) Biel and all of the supporting cast. But, alas, one still can't spin straw into gold, so all the actors are shortchanged by the other elements of movie-making. This is, of course, my opinion so if you decide to judge for yourself, by all means, go ahead and rent it.",Total Recall

Not giving anything away but instead of going to save Mars in this one Quaid tries to save Australia (it's a future version but still). To me that was a little hard to get behind.

45,Bored_Dragon,"""It's safe to say we're separated""",6,12 January 2019,"""Total Recall"" from 2012 is much better done than its predecessor from 1990. I did not read the story of Philip K. Dick, but while I watched it, I would bet that it was more faithful to the original material than the first film. And I'd lose that bet. The first film is a quite loose adaptation of Dick's story, while the second is based on the first and not on the source material and, although it is quite different, it takes on a lot of details that are not in the book. The atmosphere is more serious and darker, and Colin Farrell is much more convincing than Schwarzenegger. The same applies to the girls in the main female roles, who are also way hotter than those from the original movie. At any time I would change the year with Sharon Stone and five with Rachel Ticotin for just one night with either of these two, for which I have learned ""Blade"" and ""Underworld"" by heart. They brainwash him to forget Jessica Biel and plant Kate Beckinsale instead... Really tragic. I'm so sorry for him that I am willing to take his place in Kate's bed, so that he can search for his true love in peace. Three-breasted prostitute here is also much more beautiful than her predecessor, and the entire rest of the cast is also more attractive and/or better actors than the previous set. Nevertheless, while the 1990 movie is a striking adventurous SF thriller, the 2012 film is a classic action blockbuster, masked in the reboot of its predecessor, with which it shares only a similar premise and a bunch of essentially irrelevant details. Although technically better and seemingly more serious, it is essentially empty and forgettable, unlike the first one which, despite all the flaws, has remained in the vivid memory even after almost thirty years.6/10",Total Recall
46,tabuno,An Action Packed Sci Fi Thriller,8,17 January 2019,"4 August 2012. Take Ridley Scott's vision of the future world at least on one side of the world in Blade Runner (1982), add a little more oddly enough mainstream and strangely enough organized or neat clutter and you have the setting for this remake of Recall (1990). Add a touch of I, Robot (2004), and the basic background of the action theme is offered up for the new Recall (2010). Using the same basic plot outline which unfortunately for those who ""recall"" the 1990 version takes some of the psychological twists out of the movie, somewhat like discovering the ending of The Sixth Sense (1999), nevertheless like the old James Bond movies there a decent last twist not found in the original Recall movie. Even an effort was to keep in some of the memorable scenes from the original movie, taken out was the pathologically sexual threat to the female protagonist at the end of the movie which would have added an additional layer of the sadistic mentality of the evil antagonist.The basic plot elements from the original movie are well edited into a new script and the original elements are consistent and the unfolding of the movie appears to occur in a logical manner. The special effects and futuristic car chases are dazzling (if perhaps a little overlong) using a fascinating innovative angle on the transportation of the future concept unlike Minority Report (2002) or The Fifth Element (1997). The movie is best scene by those who haven't seen the original movie because comparisons are really not appropriate and can only diminish the more practical enjoyment of the movie. Entertaining, gripping, and the physicality especially the first half is rather amazing in its, if one could even say so, subdued and underplayed approach to stunt making (making much more realistically plausible).Overall, this remake of the original movie can easily stand on its own as a summer action adventure, sci fi thriller.

47,The-Sarkologist,Wiseman should have distanced himself more from the original film,7,31 August 2012,"I really don't know what to make of this movie. On one hand I really enjoyed it but in another sense I found the obvious aspects that identified this movie as a remake to rather annoy me. A friend of mine suggested that this film is what Total Recall should have been, and with that I am in agreement, however this film seems to have been based on the original 1990 movie more than it was based on the short story by Phillip K Dick. I guess the only reason that it is closer to the book than the other movie is the all of the action takes place on Earth.Basically Earth has emerged from a very devastating war and the only inhabitable parts of the planet are England and Europe, referred to as the United Federation of Britain, and Australia, referred to as the colonies. In this aspect it is similar to the original movie in that there are two societies that represent the rich and the poor, and the main conflict is that the rich want to eliminate the poor, though the difference is that in this film it has a lot to do with living space, namely the rich people of the north want the living space of the south while the south want to free themselves from the oppression of the north. In the original movie it was all about conflict over a finite resource, air, and the attempt by the rich to prevent this finite resource from becoming an infinite resource.I actually found this film to be much better than the original in that they got ride of a number of aspects of the original movie that many found to be rather annoying, namely the aliens. Okay, the woman with three breasts is still there (please, why did Wiseman have to keep this in here), but they got rid of the aliens, and the suggestion that the entire adventure was little more than a dream was pushed a lot further into the background. In fact, there is only one suggestion that this is all a dream, and that is where they approach him telling him that something has gone wrong, but then again, the way Wiseman handled this part of the film was, to me, quite flimsy. Personally, if he was taking things out of the original film, then this part of the original film was actually a lot better, and a lot more realistic.The final thing that I must say that made this film better was the choice of actors. Arnold Schwarzenegger never really came across as a realistic spy. As a special forces operative, or a robot, or even as a barbarian, then sure, he fits the role perfectly, but he does not the fit role as a spy, and the reason for this is spies are not supposed to be obvious. Spies, in reality, are very bland and non-obvious individuals. They are not supposed to stand out, and a hulking guy with muscles does completely the opposite (especially when he has a thick Austrian accent).",Total Recall

49,johnnyboyz,"What, no Johnny Cab?",4,16 February 2013,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the latest in Hellish production-line remakes and updates. Just how does a film as rich in spectacle; vista and action be as boring; as lifeless and as painfully uninteresting as Len Wiseman's 2012 remake of Total Recall? Going on the reputation that the following respective writers each have, and the respective adaptations of their work which I've seen, it would seem he's somehow managed to make Phillip K. Dick look like Dan Brown; the film an excruciating mess of flash and polish, a coldly uninvolving and idiotic piece that epitomises everything wrong with post-I-don't-know-when American action movie making. The film is, of course, a remake of a popular 1990 Paul Verhoeven but where there was chase and tension, there is tedium and repetition; where there was adult narrative requiring patience and working out, there is confusion and silliness. Where there was a craft to its production, there is a large black void as interesting science fiction with a jarring undercurrent is stripped down for petty teenage kicks.Colin Farrell is hopeless in the role of Douglas Quaid; an ordinary guy who lives in post 21st Century Australia but commutes to Great Britain through the centre of the Earth via what might as well be a metro train so as to go to work; work, of which, is to aid in the production of those useless foot soldier droids you saw in Phantom Menace. It's explained to us that in THIS future, The U.K. and Australia are the only two nations left after some sort of germ warfare epidemic wiped everyone else out. Out of work, he lives in a huge concrete apartment complex often doused in rain; drinks cheap beer at a cheap bar with his best friend Harry (Woodbine) and ploughs along with wife Lori (Beckinsale). Around him, trouble brews between rebel and government forces over the control for the territory.His life goes all ""Bourne"" on him when a trip to a company specialising in implanting fake holiday memories occurs, Rekall here depicted as a shady; back alley and border-line illegal base of operations situated in a red light district when they before seemed a richer, more thriving corporation. Before Quaid can be given a ""package"" that'll have him think he's a secret agent with a special agenda, the employees twig he actually IS a spy and all Hell breaks loose when government troops wind up to arrest him. Escaping home, his wife turns on him and we are reminded of that similarly depressing film ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" when a little skirmish ensues between them. Once the fight has ended, we do not, for our troubles, get to watch Kate Beckinsale seductively pose and say ""If you don't trust me, you can always tie me up(!)"". Principally, that is down to the fact Michael Ironside's character has gone, and there is no need to distract Quaid as he and his forces arrive because the idiots in charge of the production have doubled up the wife character AS Ironside's character. What this allows for, they'll argue, is lots of cool looking parkour stuff over roof tops since NOW, the chasing villain is more agile than before.Where in the original it felt like we took a break from the action now and again, as Quaid composed himself; discovered clues and had audio visual pieces of himself he doesn't remember making helping him out, this is just in a rush to get absolutely nowhere as quickly as it can. There was a brilliant scene in the original, whereby this weedy looking man arrived at Quaid's hotel room all alone and tried to convince him it's not real, before Lori walked in from nowhere and did her best to convince him likewise. Three people, in a small room, saying all this stuff and it was heightened and terrifying. Switch to how the powers that be feel the above should be done in 2012: a HUGE stone lobby with LARGE amounts of guards everywhere and the camera juddering and zooming and unable to keep still as people talk nonsense: no threat, not convincing and badly handled. The action sequences are additionally too long and too frequent; there is zero sense that a plot is stirring in the background as Quaid attempts to get to wherever to unravel more mysteries, while his eventual aide and love interest Melina (Biel) is introduced in that way that tells you an action movie has no idea what it's doing: they pull up to the lead in a vehicle amidst a chase and yell for them to ""get in!"" In short, the film is terrible – it makes Lee Tamahori's 2007 crack at Dick's work, in ""Next"", look like some sort of science fiction masterpiece. This is more an exercise in second unit stuff on a green screen background; a tacky and unfulfilling film wherein human beings are equal to robots in speed, agility and hand to hand combat. Through what it is, the film makes hating it a very easy thing to do indeed; I imagine living with the fact that you produced it an altogether tougher prospect.

It was an average remake of an old cult classic with bigger budget and better special effects. And that's about it. Was it good? In some ways, yes, but not really. Was it bad? Actually, no, it wasn't. It had very nice action scenes, it looked amazing and on thw whole it did its job admirably and at least tried to be entertaining and interesting, largely succeeding.The highlights of this film definitely include the special effects. The future world, packed full of people, filth and poverty, looked awesome and my eyes kept constantly wandering from one detail to another, which the film readily allowed with numerous sweeping shots of the cities. Furthermore, the actors, while nothing overtly special, weren't bad either and I enjoyed their takes on the roles. Though I must question the decision to cast two very similar-looking tall-haired brunettes to play both the love interest and the antagonist. I kept mixing them up every once in a while, especially in the beginning. And the action was nice and looked good, as stated.On the downside, the story isn't all that good. It does its job, to a degree, but it's very predictable and mostly exists to hurry the plot along from one action scene to another. And unfortunately the subpar story keeps to film from being anything else but painfully average. It's still entertaining and watchable if your expectations are not too high, but I still prefer the original to this one. It had more humour, better characters and a better story, silly though as it was. So if you're just looking for a action-filled scifi adventure, I'd give this one a watch.

The two fine actresses, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel make the movie worth while in many ways. Since Sharon Stone and Rachel Ticotin did wonders for the 90's version. The fight scenes between the two is nothing to sneeze at. Both versions were great. Though the new version looks more futuristic, the original has more depth. But the one thing I can really agree on is when they had the 3 breasted woman, a little change of the character of being the only freak in the movie. I would not cut down this movie because of the change made, it's a different version, with the same action and violence. Robots instead of mutants, Earth, instead of Mars.

Action movies suppose to be heart pounding, not a cause for heart attack. Speaking of which, I truly was about to have one by the sequence of the elevators' chase. This is enough reason to hate the movie, its makers, and its way of making!",Total Recall
54,Bezenby,Scrotal recall,5,5 March 2013,"Sometimes it's hard to be objective about a remake. I'm not fanatical about any particular film from my youth, and do get a bit worried when I run into folk who are (the 'George Lucas ruined my life' crew, for instance). Films are there for a laugh, for entertainment, and certainly not for draping your own fragile psyche over. That said, I couldn't help but compare the two films that have the title 'Total Recall'. Total Recall, the original that is, was an over the top violence and cheese classic of sci-fi parody, one liners, special effects and probably Arnie's greatest film. Still, it's just a film. However, I can't help but think that making the film a 12 (or PG-13 in the states) was a bit of a mistake. Also, replacing Arnie with Colin Farrell is like replacing a glass of tequila with a glass of pond water, and swapping Sharon Stone with Kate Beckinsale is like replacing Sharon Stone with someone who can't act at all (unless striding purposefully with a protruding chin is acting, and I guess it is as Keira Knightley does the exact same thing, come to think of it). Replacing Michael Ironside with no one at all doesn't help either, although Beckinsale steps in there too.Story wise – it's the same as the previous film in a sense. Quaid wants something better in life and dreams he's an agent on the run, goes to Recall, reality and fantasy mesh etc etc. He doesn't go to Mars in this one. He goes to Britain, via the Earth's core. Yep. The three-boobed mutant is here though, for those wanting a bit of three boob action. No other mutants though.Things sorely lacking in this remake: over the top violence, mutants, prosthetic effects, cheese, Michael Ironside, any sense of fun, one-liners, actors that are any good (bar Bryan Cranston, who would be good in anything). The set designs are nice and the special effects are top notch, but the film was depressingly average (not even bad, just kind of blah). It'll pass the time while you're waiting to die.Also, Bill Nighy for reason adopts a terrible American (Australian?) accent - not sure what that was about. It's an okay time waster, but lacking in the general daftness of the original. Not anything to get upset about, though.",Total Recall
55,BeneCumb,"Externally impressive, internally shallow",6,12 January 2013,"It is seldom so that a remake is better than its original and then it is usually connected to film quality, low budget etc (e.g. I am not keen on watching black-and-white mono-films, with some exceptions like Chaplin or Lloyd). In this case, the use of state-of-the-art technology does not provide additional value to the storyline; well, Colin Farrell is definitely better than Arnold Schwarzennegger, but Kate Beckinsale vs Sharon Stone - I am not so sure... And casting Bill Nighy for being ca 5 minutes on screen was a total waste of a talented actor. As regards Bryan Cranston, whose character Chancellor Cohaagen is supposed to be harsh and ruthless - he is not convincing, looks like an average top politician. Sci-fi equipment and element fill more time than humans and the ending is also predictable.In other words, cinemas-TV-Internet are full of similar and far better movies.

He catches up to Melina(Jessica Biel), someone who helps him, and she might be from his past? Will they uncover the truth before it's late?The futuristic setting is awesome. Colin Farrell is good, so is Bryan Cranston has the main villain. Kate Beckinsale steals the show as the evil Lori.

58,freemantle_uk,A poor remake and as an a sci-fi film in its own right,3,21 July 2013,"The 1990 version of Total Recall is a sci-fi action classic and one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best films: but it was known for being a loose adaptation of the Philip K. Dick story We Can Remember It For You Wholesale. Sadly the 2012 remake is great example of turning a classic film into genuine sci-fi.In the future most of the world is decimated by a chemical war and only two population centres are left; the United Federation of Britain run by Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston) and the poverty stricken The Colony based in Australia. The territories are joined by a gravity lift known as The Fall and many people from The Colony work in the UFB's factories. But tensions are increasing between the UFB and The Colony as a terrorist leader known as Matthias (Bill Nighy) is launching a bombing campaign against the UFB and the futuristic version of London.In the middle of this conflict is Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), a factory worker who has recurring dreams. Quaid goes to Rekall to implant memories in his head: but ends up discovering he was a spy working for the Resistance and his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) is a highly trained spy who meant to keep him under control. Quaid has to go to the UFB to find out who he is with a resistance member, Melina (Jessica Biel) and stop Cohaagen's evil plan.The original Total Recall worked on a number of levels, it was a well done mystery, had a dark scene of humour, a very well thought political situation and had plenty of substance and themes and worked as a hardcore, brutal actioner. The remake is basically a dumbed downed version with a more idiotic and unbelievable world (which is something considering the original was set on Mars) and nor had an themes like the original. Kurt Wimmer, the writer/director of the overrated Equilibrium wrote this adaptation and his grumpy fingerprints are all over this adaptation and the very clumsy world building.Len Wiseman of the Underworld series and the surprisingly good fourth Die Hard film took on the directing duties. Wiseman does give us some decent action sequences, but his remake was basically wall-to-wall action and it did not have the raw nature of the original. Wiseman's visual approach is basically a mix of other sci-fi films, particularly the slums looking like Blade Runner, to the cars and moving lifts looking like Minority Report and the white, clean world of J.J. Abrams' Star Trek with a little sprinkling of I, Robot. The film also references V for Vendetta with the use of a dyspotic version of Britain in a destroyed world, has a Chancellor instead of a Prime Minister or President and how the Chancellor maintains power is similar to how the Norsefire party rose to power.For a $200 Million blockbuster this remake has some of the worst cinematography you will find in a major film: it was too dark and murky to make anything out in the early scenes in the slums and there is so much lens flare that even J.J. Abrams would have been embarrassed. There are some decent angles during the fight sequence in the moving lifts but it is too dark at times. Also some of the special effects were also weak for a big budget film, particularly during the car chase in London where the effects don't hold up so well.Colin Farrell was okay but his accent kept slipping during the film, but he was a solid enough lead and he could do the fight scenes. Beckingsale's Lori was combination of the original Lori and Michael Ironside's Ritchter, acting as both the fake wife and the determined hunter. She is convincing in the action sequences but she was poor as one of the villains. Biel too was underwhelming as the other main leads. Overall the film was a downgrade to the cast of the original.The 2012 version of Total Recall is a poor film both as a remake of a classic film and as a sci-fi film in its own right. The original had much more to say, much more subtle and more entertaining. And the saddest part is a remake could have worked well if the writing was better and expand the already existing themes.",Total Recall
59,JoeB131,Total Pointlessness,3,30 December 2012,"The major rule of Remakes- If something was good enough to warrant a remake, it was probably good enough to not need one.Case in point, they remade Total Recall, when the original was perfectly fine.They got rid of Mars and replaced it with a devastated Earth where they can't fix the environment, but they can drill a hole through the core of the planet and run a giant elevator between Britain and wherever this ""Colony"" is. They combined the Michael Ironside and Sharon Stone characters into a less interesting one in Kate Beckinsale. In fact, NONE of the characters or actors are as good as the original.Which brings us to the next problem of modern film- too much CGI and too much action sequences to pad out what is maybe ten minutes of plot.The film has little humor, a lot of call backs to the original film. (They had a three-breasted woman with no reason WHY a woman in this version would have three breasts.) In short, the original was a better, smarter film without the benefits of modern CGI.",Total Recall
60,estebangonzalez10,Total Recall: Just another unnecessary remake,5,3 September 2012,"¨The past is a construct of the mind. It blinds us. It fools us into believing it. But the heart wants to live in the present. Look there. You'll find your answer.¨ This new version of Total Recall is better than the original, but that's not saying much considering I wasn't very fond of that one either. This remake shares sort of the same problems that the original had considering there is a whole lot of action going around, but hardly any time for character development. The entire movie feels like one big chase scene and by the end instead of feeling the climax you are wishing it would end already. The movie isn't that long, but it feels like it. What I liked better about this film was the look of it. The dark futuristic vision of the world was engaging and some of my favorite scenes involved this imagery and brilliant futuristic designs. This movie has a much better look and it was also a plus that it took place entirely on Earth instead of Mars like in the original. I also think Colin Farrell is a much better actor than Arnold, but when it comes to action scenes Arnold was the best and in this film Farrell doesn't have much to work with besides running around from one action scene to another. The action scenes have gotten repetitive and there isn't anything unique about them in this movie either; director Len Wiseman could have come up with a better plot to engage the audience and not focus as much as he did with the action scenes. The setting was the highlight of the movie for me and I enjoyed some of the devices they imagined in this futuristic world but that was about it. Wiseman, who is better known for directing the Underworld franchise, also hired Kate Beckinsale to play the role Sharon Stone did in the original. I had no problem with the casting, which for me was good, but I wished the characters were given more meat.Sometime in the future only two countries exist: The United Federation of Britain and the Colony. It is a dark time where most people live in poverty in the Colony and have to travel across the world to Britain to work. There is very few habitable space for the people as a Chemical warfare has destroyed most of the planet. Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston) is the Chancellor of UFB who is dealing with a rebellious group from the Colony under the leadership of Matthias (Bill Nighy). Times are unstable and the future doesn't look bright for the residents of Earth. Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) seems to be living a normal life as a factory worker with a beautiful wife named Lori (Kate Beckinsale), but he feels like escaping from the routine of work and decides to pay a visit to Rekall, a company that specializes in implanting brain memories. At Rekall he asks for an escape from his everyday life and he chooses the option of becoming a spy. Before they implant the memory something goes wrong and Quaid realizes that he is not who he thinks he is. He has special abilities and even his wife seems to turn against him. Quaid suffers an identity crisis and begins picking up clues about his past which involve him working as a spy for the resistance movement. He immediately begins to be chased by Lori and Cohaagen's people and meets Melina (Jessica Biel) who claims to know him from the past, but with another name. Quaid will have to try to discover whether what he's experiencing is real or if it's just a fantasy implanted on him from Rekall.The main idea is very similar to the original film, except for the fact that the resistance movement is in Earth and not in Mars, although it is a very different planet by now. Colin Farrell plays the same role Arnold did, Kate plays Stone's role although Kate gets much more screen time as she's also the main persecutor as well, and Biel plays the role of the heroin who helps unlock Quaid's past. This film has a better cast in my opinion, but the plot is equally as poor developed. At least in the original version we had some funny one liners (what Arnold did best), but here the film is much darker and serious. I enjoyed this version a little more, but I still didn't enjoy it very much. Maybe if the final action scene were a little shorter I could've enjoyed it a little more. Total Recall shouldn't of been remade it, it just isn't that remarkable of a film in my opinion.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Total Recall

Even though the film was attempting to strike a more serious tone than the original, it's no excuse for the nearly comatose acting on display here.

I can't remember the original very well so I was able to just take this for what it is without making too many comparisons.The story is action packed with fight scene after chase scene and filled with very great SPX and cool future technology. I liked the world created here even with its shades of Blade Runner (the look of the city; rainy streets, hover cars and (off world) advertising. I kept waiting for ""walk now, walk now."" and towards the end there's a Star Wars (Attack of The Clones) vibe as Colin Ferrell fights an army of (Stormtroopers) ahem, bad guys. He plays a factory worker, branded a spy after an attempt to take a virtual vacation goes horribly awry, sending him on the run as he tries to recover his true identity.There's a decent cast including Ferrell's two wives, Jessica Biel and the ass kicking Kate Beckinsale -great fight scenes there and I also enjoyed a blonde John Cho as the Rekall tech dude...""happy trails man"" I didn't love Brian Cranston however in a role that anyone could have put on a bad wig for and played.

64,3xHCCH,This Does NOT Recall the 1990 Original Very Well,4,16 August 2012,"In 1990, a big sci-fi blockbuster film came out entitled ""Total Recall"" starring the biggest action star of that time, Arnold Schwarzenegger. The plot of that film was very complex. Arnold played a construction worker named Douglas Quaid, blissfully married to beautiful Lori (Sharon Stone). Bothered by dreams of Mars, he goes to Rekall, Inc., an establishment where they sell memories, so he can take a virtual trip to the Red Planet. After a snafu during the memory implantation procedure, Quaid suddenly becomes the target of government agents who seem to think he is Hauser, a secret agent working for the Martian resistance. So what is real and what is not? We the audience were taken for an exciting trip, that was as much an action as well as a mind game. Now that was one interesting and enjoyable sci-fi film.Fast forward to 2012, ""Total Recall"" gets remade. Colin Farrell takes on Arnold Schwarzenegger's Douglas Quaid/Hauser role. The sexy and sleek Kate Beckinsale becomes a Lori Quaid that melded the characters of BOTH Sharon Stone and Michael Ironside in the first film. Jessica Biel completes the triangle, as the girl in Quaid's ""previous"" life (played by Rachel Ticotin in the first movie). Honestly, this remake felt more like a Kate Beckinsale movie. If this is because the director Len Wiseman is her husband, I do not know. But to be fair though, Kate really excels in these action roles, as she did in her ""Underworld"" films, very believable that she can really kick serious ass. In contrast, Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel had very wan screen presence here. I did not really care about them at all, which was ironic since they were supposed to be the heroes. For all the flack that Arnold Schwarzenegger got about being a lousy actor, his charisma and sense of humor was really missed in this pale and leaden remake.I do not know if it is because we already know how the basic story would go, but there was not really much improvement to be seen in this redux. Of course, the computer-generated special effects were expected to exceed the original, which still had obviously fake blood and creature effects. However, it is really unfortunate that the director concentrated too much on making this a slam-bang action movie via these computerized effects.The basic mental conundrum of Quaid's real existence, which made the first film interesting, is lost in all of these computer-generated action sequences. It seemed only a vague backgrounder or a mere afterthought. For some odd reason, the current makers even decided to take the whole Mars scenario out of the remake! The very heart of the first movie about the mutants and the precious commodity of air were not here. Therefore essentially this remake is just another soul-less futuristic chase movie, like we have seen so many times before.",Total Recall
65,TdSmth5,Interesting and entertaining,8,7 December 2012,"Some guy named Quaid has a recurring dream of escaping and rescuing some girl while being chased. He works assembling synthetics--law enforcement robots. He's married to the lovely Lori who works for some emergency institution. He's mentally a wreck and is looking for something. He decides to go to Rekall, which implants fake memories in people as to give them something nice to think about in a drab world. One limitation though is that they can't and shouldn't implant anything that the person did actually experience at some point. He decides to go with memories of a spy. But there's a problem. When he's injected with the substance, the Rekall staff realizes that Quaid is indeed a spy. They stop the procedure and cops break into the facility and start shooting everything. Now something clicks in Quaids brain and he kicks everyone's behind and eliminates the cops.He escapes home only to find that his wife isn't who she says she is. And he isn't who he thinks either. She's a government agent. And he's a big bad terrorist the government is fighting but whom they had under control and hoping to use to guide them to the main bad guy.But it turns out the government isn't the good guy here. In the world of Total Recall, the British empire is resurrected, and the only other area inhabitable is the colony--Australia, which us populated by poor exploited laborers. The two land masses are connected by a lift called The Fall that goes through the core of the earth. The government of the empire, to save money, seeks to replace all law enforcement and perhaps even workers with synthetics and creates the hoax of terrorism as an excuse to invade the colony.Total Recall is a pretty good action movie. There's no point in comparing it to the original. It has a good cast and attractive ladies and a rich story of empire vs terrorism that resonates today. It's not a perfect movie; we could have learned a lot more about this society of the future but the movie instead chooses to give us lots of chases. For what it aims to do, this movie succeeds and entertains. The lighting is somewhat annoying with overuse of flare while the equally fashionable base/drone fade sounds are pretty cool.

If not for the way it follows the beats of the original, I'd have no clue where anyone was or what was going on because it's all just one dreary locale after the next and somehow ends with two dudes fist fighting...

67,ShootingShark,Enjoyable But Muted Remake Of Sci-Fi Spy Classic,5,18 April 2015,"In the late twenty-first century, Douglas Quaid works a menial job constructing security robots. Seeking excitement, he goes to Rekall, a company selling fake memory implants. Suddenly he is thrust into an espionage adventure where he holds the key to an invasion; but is this really happening, or just a delusion in his mind ?This remake of the Verhoeven / Schwarzenegger science-fiction classic has good points and bad points, but overall is pretty enjoyable and deserves respect for trying a different premise from the original, albeit balancing this with the expected big budget action and effects. It has several good ideas, but in my view many of them veer towards the Silly Science category; the Fall concept is interesting but if there's only one tunnel how many people can you realistically transport each day (not to mention the apparent absence of gravitational forces climbing an external ladder on a vehicle travelling about 30000 kmh). Visually it's a lot of fun, especially the production design by Patrick Tatopoulos, which mixes grimy rusty overcrowded slums in the first half with shiny super-duper stuff in the second, and there is a good score by the reliable Harry Gregson-Williams. However, a lot of the elements seem familiar from other, better, science-fiction films; the rain-drenched masses from Blade Runner, the villain's robot army from I, Robot, the hovercars from Minority Report. The biggest liability for me though is the script - the Verhoeven movie is full of fun, goofy ideas and buckets of gore (only he would have a dwarf prostitute with a machine gun), while this one is much more restrained and dogmatic, substituting too much action and visual effects where humour and characterisation are needed more. The cast do their best but haven't much to do except look confused and pant a lot as they rush about (I hope Nighy was paid well because his role is the most thankless I've ever seen). The exception is nutty Beckinsale, who livens things up as the traitorous pseudo-wife and steals the show. I love the way she deftly plays the first half-hour with a standard middle-America accent, then switches to a well-heeled English one (she's from London) after her cover is blown. It must have been interesting for Wiseman (the director of the first two Underworld movies) to cast Beckinsale in this role, since she is his real life wife.",Total Recall
68,dierregi,I hope I will forget,1,13 August 2012,"I knew I was heading for disappointment when I went to see this movie. I am a fan of the Verhoeven version, which managed to be both a great SF movie and a commercial success. Also, the star-making vehicle for Sharon Stone, who was in it only in a few scenes and yet managed to steal the show.What we have here is: three anodyne lead characters; endless CGI-saturated chase sequences and not much plot to go with it. Crazily, the Mars angle was dispensed with and replaced by Australia (the Colony) and Great Britain surviving as the only inhabited regions of earth.For obscure reasons – since both seem overpopulated – workers commute back and forward through the centre of the earth to work in the Colony. In this silly scenario enters Doug Quaid, played by Farrell (the least bad of the trio). Not surprisingly he is introduced with a chase sequence, a very bad start of worst chases to come.The bad girl role, which was so lucky for Stone, is played by Beckinsale, who is also the director's wife. Probably for this reason her part was extended, and she is the movie right to end. However, looks like she can perform only the athletic model role, running, kicking and fighting her way through the movie. Consequently, lengthening her role did not add anything to the character.The good girl part went to Biel, who is an astonishingly beautiful woman, but perhaps more suited to fashion modelling than to acting. Besides, she resembles so much Beckinsale that I wondered why they bothered putting two look-alike babes in the same movie Maybe so that neither could be jealous of the other's acting skills? Farrell, Beckinsale and Biel are basically the only characters in sight. Only a handful of minutes is given to anybody else, so that they can be easily dispensed with, which they are without a hint of irony. There is zero chemistry between Farrell and either of his leading ladies, so the romantic angle is also doomed.I dozed off during one of countless chase scenes, waking up to realize that I missed nothing, as our hero and the good girl were obviously there to stay. More chases, explosions, fight scenes and finally the end.P.S.: worth mentioning that the ""look & feel"" are a cross between Blade Runner (the endless rain and night scenes) and Star Wars (the white soldiers), although even this plagiarism fails to bring any value whatsoever to this wretched film.",Total Recall

71,rgkarim,Is What The Trailer Promised Real or Just A Dream?,7,4 August 2012,"Hollywood seems to be making a living on remakes lately. This could most likely, as John Goodman says in a recent trailer, to do half the work and take all the credit for it. Regardless this weekend we have Total Recall, a remake of an Arnold Schwarzenegger film of the same name. Now talking with many friends and fans, there was a lot of concern about remaking such a ""classic film"", yet the action of the movie held great promise to hold my attention, especially with Miss Action herself Kate Beckinsale being a headliner for the movie. Did it deliver this and other surprises, or was it merely a ""dream"" that the trailers implanted in my mind to get me to spend money? Read on to find out.The plot of this movie has been edited somewhat from Schwarzenegger's story, in which Quaid (Colin Farrell) is a depressed factory worker living in the slums of a transformed Earth. Years of chemical warfare have left only two places in the world habitable, which naturally means one side rich and one side poor, sound familiar like say Hunger Games? Anyway one night in an attempt to escape the harsh reality, Quaid goes to ReKall a place where memories can be implanted to make you live your dreams. Unfortunately something horrible goes wrong, and soon a chase to bring the supposed outlaw in begins. The first thing that might come to mind is where in the world is the Mars atmosphere and the mutants? Well with the exception a three boobed woman, yes she is still in there guys, all of that has been replaced with a post apocalyptic Earth. That's right the red foreboding deserts and caves have been replaced with rather impressive cities that look like something out of George Lucas' mind, i.e. Coruscant from the Star Wars prequels. While the sleek and polished cities are rather impressively designed and polished, they still aren't equivalent to the alien landscape we so much loved in the original movie. Regardless Len Wiseman and crew did a decent job directing the extras and actors to integrate with the digital art, and kept the environment evolving as the movie continued to go. Moving away from the scenery though, let's talk about the highlight of this movie: the action. Yes despite having a rather linear storyline and some pretty shallow characters, this movie is all about high speed adrenaline and ridiculous chases. From scene 1 of the movie, one will know that the movie is going to be lots of lights, running, and some gun play. Most of the action involves lots of running or fast driving that are similar to the action scenes in Minority Report. The futuristic cars and pistol shots lead Farrell and Jessica Biel ducking more than acting, which gets stale after a while. About halfway through the movie though Biel and Farrell's characters finally get the courage to fire back and start actually shooting against their attackers. While its impressive that they can wield prop guns and react to fake bullet wounds, there really aren't that many impressive fight scenes in the movie. The exception to this would be a brief cat fight between Biel and Beckinsale, where the former vampires shows off some of her acrobatic moves to beat the tears out of Biel. Aside from that, the action is more about the cast running away from the white artificial police force, cough Clone troopers cough, while Beckinsale continues to fire shots and stare at the camera.While the action may not have been the style I was looking for, there was another aspect to this movie that was impressive, the gadgets. Like a futuristic bond movie, Total Recall has some clever integration of spy gadgetry at their disposal. Cellular phones integrated in their hands, the ability to pull up view screens by touching glass, and many more technological wonders fill this movie to the brim. Although they weren't as deadly as some of London's finest treats, they were well integrated into the movie to help keep the plot going, as well as to throw the audience into a loop as to whether the experience was real or not. Yet, some of the gadgets were actually rather hastily introduced, or had no meaning to their use, but in this kind of movie I guess you don't need a reason. Now are half of these gadgets original? The answer to that question is not really as we've had countless movies do the same technological feats that this film does. In fact there are a lot of things about this movie that are obvious references to other science fiction works like the Matrix and did I mention Star Wars. However, the delivery is still smoother than Beckinsale's flowing hair, and I have to appreciate the effort they have made to impress.Total Recall is not a bad remake. With some fast paced scenes, nice graphics, and a chance to see to lovely ladies run across the screen it does have its high points. However, the bar was set pretty high on the classic film, and this movie just didn't reach the promised potential. Those looking for a vague ending will get their demands met, as like the first film you still haven't figured out if it is real. Yet, the one dimensional characters, the lack of exciting gun play, and the fact that Farrell's character seems to have endless adrenaline is just not enough to recommend a trip to the theater. My scores for the movie are below: Action/Adventure/Sci-fi: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0",Total Recall
72,p-stepien,Poor Dick,3,6 January 2013,"In a post-apocalyptic dystopian future, where a vast part of the world in incapable of sustaining human-life all people inhabit two areas: the United Federation of Britain and the subservient Colony (found in Australia). The less-populated colony serves mostly as cheap labour for UFB, traversing daily by dropping directly through the Earth via ""the Fall"", a gravity elevator taking the most direct route to the other side of the world. Amongst those who commute is factory worker named Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), happily married to Lori (Kate Beckinsale), but still with a lingering feeling of emptiness. When co-worker Mac (John Cho) convinces Quaid to seek the services of Rekall, a semi-legal company dealing with computer imprinted dreams, he decides to take on the visage of an special agent. The resulting programme initiation brings about an unexpected realisation, that Quaid has repressed memories, as in fact in the past he once was a secret double agent of the UFB and opposing insurgents. Thus his beloved wife is a hoax, with his true love being rebel Melina (Jessica Biel). Or is it?Remolding vast parts of the 1966 short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" by Philip K. Dick and the Arnold Schwarzeneggar original feature brings together a dishevelled story, which at times seems all too reminiscent borrowing vast sequences and moments from its superior predecessor, while at others bringing about wholesale changes which detrimentally make the trip overly fantastic, even for a sci-fi movie. Nonetheless ""Total Recall"" features a visually stunning future metropolis, albeit borrowing undoubted inspiration from the ""Bladerunner"" with a touch ""The Fifth Element"", still comes off as original and breathtaking, undoubtedly the highlight of what is otherwise a disappointing venture into the whacked out mind of American novelist Philip K. Dick. In search of some mode to forward the story Len Wiseman changes the whole movie into a prolonged triangle cat-fight, where Lori has the knack for appearing in every other scene, at times seemingly self-teleporting herself or even rising from the dead, to enter into a brutal marriage spat with Quaid or direct her aggressive brutality towards Melina. Making Lori into what is basically the key antagonist, especially given her paper-thin character development and Beckinsale's lazy portrayal, proves especially distracting, as the narratives inexplicably suffers. Not much is helped by Jessica Biel, the third in this misguided lover's triangle, who does an absolutely atrocious acting job, losing many acting creds and coming off as pure eye candy. With all these factors kicking in not even the undoubted screen presence of Colin Farrell can bring the movie back on board. Labored with some conspicuous plot tools such as the introduction of Hammond (played by Dylan Scott Smith) an essentially conceptless ""Total Recall"" lacks any longevity with its limited sensibility.",Total Recall
73,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It's well made production wise but is quite generic,5,23 August 2015,"Hollywood is criticized countlessly for rebooting various popular films from the past in the forms of remakes. Unless the project is given to people with the right skill set, many remakes end up paling in comparison to the original material they spawned from. A big cause of these foul-ups is that it's a remake alone. Many fans feel there is nothing to re-invent about what was made prior. Another issue is how sensitive the rating system has become. With more and more studios believing that PG-13 rating is the best way to get a mass crowd of viewers, less and less fans become interested. During the last half of the 20th century, many films were made with R ratings just because. However, more PG-13 ratings are given and that mindset is still taken into account when it comes to redoing certain properties. Unfortunately, this lesson hasn't been entirely learned yet. For director Paul Verhoeven a lot of his late 1980 and early 1990 films have not been given enough leeway.Although in some ways the original Total Recall (1990) has not aged nicely, its narrative, hard R rating and Schwarzenegger's memorable acting made it a sci-fi classic. Skip 22 years later and you have this remake, which like many studios claimed was ""introducing it to new audiences"". It is watchable but is probably only worthwhile once. The story is fairly similar to that of Verhoeven's version. Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) is an average guy married to his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) who works at a factory with Harry (Bokeem Woodbine) where they make synthetics (robot cops). Yet every night, Quaid keeps having dreams where he's trying to escape with some girl named Melina (Jessica Biel) and he feels like he knows her. In the background, there's a ""civil war"" occurring between Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston), the man behind the Synthetics and Matthias (Bill Nighy) a man labeled as the ""leader of rebels"". Among all this, there is a giant elevator that transports people from one side of the earth to the other passing through the earth's core and it's called ""The Fall"". It is this that people believe the phrase ""The fall enslaves us all"".For writing, which was penned by Kurt Wimmer (Salt (2010)) and Mark Bomback (Unstoppable (2010)) takes the mind-bending screenplay from the original and waters it down to where the story comes across as really generic. Just how does the fall enslave everybody? There barely is any depiction of what the fall does to the people who don't approve of it. Here there's not much of a reason given and most audiences will continue watching the film than try and figure out the motivation. Another subplot Wimmer and Bomback couldn't effectively translate was whether after Quaid visited rekall, if he was in a dream or not. There is a hint of it later on but it is so weak in comparison to Verhoeven's version, which kept its viewers guessing every step of the way. This version has no transition from when Quaid gets his memory implant. The only part of the writing that is flattering are the various references. Remember the ""two weeks"" disguise - which's there. Remember the three breasted female - she's there, mind you that doesn't even make sense because there is no mention of mutants in this world.Although not many standout, all main cast members act believable between each other. The actor who looked like he had the most fun went to Bryan Cranston as Cohaagen. Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel pass as a couple and Farrell has his moments along with Kate Beckinsale. Bokeem Woodbine as Quaid's friend was okay but felt predictable. The only actor who is completely useless in his role is Bill Nighy as the infamous rebel ""leader"". The only thing Matthias does is give a one line quote of insight to Quaid and that's it. Nighy is not even allowed to let his hammier side of acting show, which is unfortunate. The action entertains but only initially. The physical fight scenes between Quaid and other characters have energy; that part is worth it. What gets tiresome on the other hand are all the sci-fi action scenes that involve car chases, synthetics and other worldly technology. Like a structured story should be written, every action-related scene should get bigger than the last but for these, it becomes preposterous. That's not to say they become mind numbing like a Michael Bay film but they suffer from obvious CGI overload.The special effects are well put together no doubt, it all looks real and physically tangible singularly. It just becomes too much sometimes when everything is together all at once. The cinematography by Paul Cameron (Collateral (2004)) doesn't always help either. For the outside scenes it is hard to tell what is real and what isn't. There's no problem having wide panning shots to give the audience a better idea of scope. However, it helps to also shoot scenes with techniques like those while including parts of the set that are real so each scene doesn't feel so CGI-ish. The other fault Cameron keeps making are continuously having lens-flares in various shots, whether it be indoors or out. It's rather distracting when one is trying to focus on what is happening. Harry Gregson-Williams composed the music, which consists of hybrid orchestra. For this score, Williams does have a main theme for the film but it lacks any kind of memorable cue that'll make someone think of the film. It is literally a two-note cue involving horns and deep synth base.It's a watchable film but only for a one-time stand. It has acceptable special effects, hand-to-hand action, okay acting, music and flattering references to the original. Yet this doesn't make up for the occasional CGI overload, generically written plot, weakly written dream subplot and continuous lens flares in its cinematography.",Total Recall
74,Rob_Taylor,The Elephant in the room....,5,24 December 2012,"First off, I did get some enjoyment out of this re-imagining of the old Arnie classic and the Philip K Dick novel. It is nothing like either of those stories, but it has its merits and is generally enjoyable.But... as the title suggests, there is the most gigantic and ridiculous elephant in the room in this film that did destroy any semblance of credibility the movie tried to muster.I'm talking, of course, about the ridiculously dumb idea that you can build a tunnel through the Earth's core. This is just so retarded that I can't even begin to understand who thought it would be a good idea. It comes from the ""Five year old's guide to physics"" written by Rod For-my-own-back.Anytime the characters are on the ""train"" through the Earth, my mind was saying things like:""How does the pressure not crush the thing?"" ""What material can withstand the heat of the molten core?"" ""Do they not have seismic movements in the future?""It is so dumb as to be entirely unbelievable given the technology of the story's setting. The last time I was this stunned by a film's lack of attention to its own setting was Aeon Flux, where people could have hands grafted onto feet, deliver mental messages in pill-form, yet apparently could not cure infertility.Apart from the tunnel, the only other irritant was the hand phone. A cell phone apparently implanted into the palm of your hand. When said phone was extracted, the phone was made of lots of inflexibly parts. Just think how irritating it is to get a splinter in your hand and magnify that a thousand times. More dumb ideas from some writer that didn't do a physics/biology class at school.There are few things, in fact that tie this film to the previous one, or the original book. Those things are: Character names and a woman with three breasts. Literally, that is it.Other than the above, the movie is not too bad. It won't ever become a classic and it stands head and shoulders BELOW the Arnie movie.To be honest, if they had called it something other than Total Recall, and changed the characters' names, then the movie would have come across as a very dumb dystopian future story, immediately forgotten.By associating it with better stories through the use of the name, it comes across as a very dumb dystopian future story, immediately forgotten, that was made solely to cash in on previous successes.I can't for the life of me understand why Hollywood persists in remaking perfectly good older movies and turning out sub-standard efforts that have plenty of CGI and eye-candy, but very little substance.This version of Total Recall is like going to a meal and eating nothing but sickly desserts, ignoring the main course entirely. It has no real value and will be joked about in the future.SUMMARY: If you want to enjoy this movie you need to have your brain surgically removed and then re-implanted afterwards. If you don't, this movie will cause you much more pain than the aforementioned operation. It's a nothing movie with all the charm of a snake-oil salesman, tempting you with promises of a remedy for all your ills, but actually delivering something that will make you sick to your stomach.",Total Recall
75,bob-rutzel-1,Great Action Thriller. Terrific CGI,7,26 December 2012,"Factory worker Douglas Quaid (Colin Ferrell) believes he has memories that he was a former spy. So he goes to a company that may be able to help; but when they hook him up they determine he already has these memories because HE IS a real spy. They try to disconnect him and his spy training takes over and he wipes out the room. What a guy!Quaid still has memory problems: is he a factory worker or a spy? Eventually, he figures it out and knows he must stop an invasion that, if successful, will enslave the population. There will come a time in the story when you see Quaid become confused and they try to tell him he is actually still in that chair getting memories. Oh, oh now what?For the most part, all we see are multiple fight scenes, bullets spraying all over the place and a lot of karate/Judo etc moves. And, in case you missed the Mr. and Mrs. Smith movie, Quaid and wife Lorie (Kate Beckinsale) go at it trying to off each other.The cinematography is unbelievably good as we have never seen cities constructed as these are, with elevators going up and down and also sideways. It looked like cities were built over canyons becoming cliffs themselves. The fight scenes are many, too fast, and go on for too long, but the choreography is so amazingly good you don't mind. Kudos. No other way to say it. The only problem I saw, other than trying to figure out who the good/bad guys were, was that Kate Beckinsale and Quaid's new girlfriend Melina (Jessica Biel) actually looked too much alike and I had to keep in mind what each one was wearing and who had the pony tail. Hey, that's a lot to remember. This is a good futuristic non-stop action thriller with terrific CGI. We came for the action and we got it. (7/10)Violence: Yes.

(PG-13)Unimaginative and unnecessary remake had the opportunity to use the source material as a jumping off point for a different kind of mind-bending thriller, or to tweak the first film's narrative by going even deeper into the illusion of reality and fantasy and how the brain interprets them. But, no, instead it mostly just follows the plot points beat by beat, making changes that restrict imagination rather than develop it (events are kept earthbound, the resistance leader is no longer a mutant, etc.), and whittles away all the quirkiness, humor, and over-the-top violence that energized the original, presumably for the purposes of crafting a more streamlined and linear random-action-generator. Though derivative, there's visual vitality in the exterior world design; too bad it's usually only briefly glimpsed during establishing shots or frenetic chases and shootouts.

79,rivertam26,Totally awesome!,7,4 August 2012,"I love when a remake/re-imagining comes out and all of a sudden there is this legion of fans who don't want the original being messed with. It's just kind of silly because in all of my cinematic circles I have never met a group of people that hold the original in such high regard. Sure it's a fun, entertaining, mind bending popcorn flick one of Schwarzeneggers' best but that being said it's just that a fun flick. This new re-imagining of the source material is a completely different film from its predecessor. It moves the action to earth, creates a unique if not as exciting back plot and takes the material a lot more seriously. Which works for the most part in its' favor. If you've seen the original film it's still the same basic setup a guy goes to Rekall a place where they insert memories into your psyche that are chosen by you. But something supposedly goes wrong and the main character Doug Quaid or is he? finds himself on the run from the cops and his psychotic wife amongst others. Insert Melina a love interest a big sub plot for world domination this time around and you have the makings of this film. What I loved about the film besides the updated spfx is the insane action sequences and stunning fight choreography. Less effective were the films plotting, generic performances except from Beckinsale and the slightly forced second finale wrap up. That being said Collin Farrell is sexy as hell in the lead and Jessica Biehl fills out her role solidly except that its just not much of a role. Kate Beckinsale steals the show here front and center. It's her movie. She eats up every scene she's in. in both a good and bad way but always fun. Her character is the most unstoppable, maniacal, kick ass female villain ever to appear on screen. Those who have seen her physical acting in the Underworld films will be blown away this time around she takes it to a whole new level. She's like the terminatrix the way she should've been lol. Despite it's flaws Total Recall 2012 is almost as entertaining and solid an effort as it's predecessor what it lacks in story chops it makes up for in intense action sequences, stunning cinematography, lush visuals and kick ass fight choreography. This update also thankfully relishes in that late 80's early 90's modo of killing innocent bystanders during all the chaos it's a much welcome infusion into the now too carefully censored world of big budget action fests.

80,Troy_Campbell,"Mind-numbing, bombastic fun.",7,23 August 2012,"I quite enjoy Arnie's Total Recall, but I am by no means a die-hard fan and subsequently viewed this updated version without prejudice or the desire to compare. Len Wiseman, director of guilty pleasures Underworld and Die Hard 4.0, has delivered the mind-numbing, bombastic goods yet again. His Recall is packed with exciting futuristic landscapes, stylish action sequences (the vertigo-inducing car chase was thrilling) and near-perfect CGI; all merging to create a wonderful couple of hours of real-life escapism. The story is engaging without being mind-blowing – and it chucks in a few cheeky references to 1990's Recall – however it runs out of puff in the final act and provides a ho-hum ending. Colin Farrell is reliable as the perplexed anti-hero, Jessica Biel notches up another satisfactory action chick role and Kate Beckinsale most definitely ""gives good wife"", however Bryan Cranston lets the team down as the one-dimensional villain. Slotting in somewhere under Christopher Nolan and above P.T. Anderson on the filmmaking scale, Wiseman isn't a master of the blockbuster movie but he certainly knows how to produce a rollicking good ride.",Total Recall
81,blumdeluxe,Too much action,7,14 October 2017,"""Total Recall"" is a remake of the old Schwarzenegger classic and deals with a normal worker that through a series of events learns that his memories have been faked by the government to prevent him from returning to his old life as an agent for the resistance movement.Although there is some serious thought put into the underlying story of the film, this remake is only slightly more than your average action movie because most of it mainly consists of long chases or gunfights. This way the plot stays unpleasantly superficial, even though I have to admit that the production is of high value and meets all the standards for a decent Hollywood Action Movie. I am rather critical if this new version would have been necessary. Yes, the new technical possibilities surely suit the story well but they also tend to force the actual concept behind it a bit into the background.All in all this is a better action film, spiced with some sci-fi- elements that guarantee a stringent story-line.

Some special effects but not so it runs the movie, Then there's this. Colin Farrell is okay as the fit, tight-lipped hero, Jessica Biel is ALWAYS welcome as the best looking girl in movies (and a fine actress), and Kate Beckinsale is almost equally appreciated as the nice looking witch. So the first hour or so runs okay, the problem is the eventually endless sequence of Colin with or without Biel gets free, the bad guys corner him in what looks like certain doom, somehow Farrell gets loose, Beckinsale is mad.....repeat 10 or 15 times. The escapes get increasingly unbelievable and other than the above recipe there really isn't much going on.

83,TheUnknown837-1,"In an era where the only safe bets for box office seem to be reinventing old favorites, this Total Recall can be regarded with a certain level of respect.",7,12 August 2012,"If you are going to go to the trouble of remaking a film, you might as well have the self-confidence to reinvent the material while still honoring the original premise. That much can be said of the recent, somewhat unnecessary remake of Paul Verhoeven's 1990 film Total Recall. It is questionable why the filmmakers decided to rehash this story, since it was done a mere twenty-two years before. After all, almost twice as much time passed before King Kong was first remade, and almost again before Peter Jackson took his hand at the classic tale about a monster and the blond who captured his heart. Furthermore, this new film is so quickly so distant from its 1990 counterpart that, with a little more creative thrust, the makers might have constructed their own idiosyncratic tale from it. But, nevertheless, it is an interesting and engaging little effort.The two films only bear semblance for the first 30 minutes; after that point, they completely part ways. Without giving too much away, I can safely tell those familiar with the original to forget about a climax involving a giant machine buried on Mars. But what I really commend the screenwriters for is their decision to approach the material with a completely different mindset. The story not only deviates, but the attitude of the picture is different. Paul Verhoeven's original was very much akin to his other science-fiction spectacles: big and beautiful with a touch of deliberate hokum. It had an almost self-parodying sense of humor. The remake has almost no humor at all. While that does not make it more engaging, it does prevent it from becoming a distraction. If it had attempted the same mindset and gags as the original, it would have inevitably just drawn up a checklist, forcing us to make comparisons between versions. By tackling a new plot line and new focuses, the filmmakers have allowed the audience to stay interested.The film, like almost every science-fiction picture made in the last 30 years, takes place in the distant future. What displeased me, however, was that it was nothing more than the Blade Runner future. The city is grimy and dirty; smog fills every square inch of air; people wear hoods and cloaks and snarl at each other; it rains almost every second of every day; the sun is a treat to see. Even when it is not raining, the sky is almost incessantly blanketed with a fine overcast, giving the film a washed-out appearance. Oh, how I would love to a see a The-Future-Drags setting where we can see the sun shine down upon some unfortunate characters for a change! Total Recall has been competently directed by Len Wiseman, who only loses his head badly in one sequence. Early in the picture, when our protagonist (Colin Farrell) encounters some bad guys, the entire fist-and-gun fight takes place from one shot—a shot where the camera swishes around several times, slowing down to close in on a kill, and then whisking about again. As a result, the sequence does not have a sense of shock or surprise. It comes across as gimmicky and forced. After that point, however, the action scenes are well-staged and the director is not afraid to pull back on his camera lenses and allow us to see more than just a boot stomping into somebody's face in extreme close-up.To address the ultimately question: no, I do not feel this remake of Total Recall is in the same league as the 1990 original. That film had such a terrific sense of humor so that it became a good time as well as pretty to behold. But to attempt the same mindset would have been limp and unimpressive and I would have been left to ponder: why didn't I just rent the original again? In this era where the only safe bets for box office seem to be reinventing old favorites, this Total Recall can be regarded with a certain level of respect. For at least it tried to be different. And, on its own terms, it is worth seeing.",Total Recall

86,ASouthernHorrorFan,"My Review Of ""Total Recall""",5,12 December 2012,"""Total Recall"" is directed by Len Wiseman and stars Colin Farrell, Jessica Biel, Brian Cranston, Bokeem Woodbine and Kate Beckinsale. It is a remake of the Shwarzenegger sci-fi classic about a civil war between the ruling government of earth and a outpost colony. In the original it was a Martian colony but in this new vision I honestly have no idea where the fricking colony is founded. This film has basically the same story complete with climactic action sequences and sci-fi spectacular scenery. In the new ""Total Recall"" the story follows a factory worker undergoing a personal crossroads of sorts. He decides to change things up in his life but gets more than he bargains for when his fantasy becomes far too real. He soon becomes the last man standing for a resistance movement against the oppressive ruling regime.This movie has all the qualities of a great sci-fi film but the true star of the movie was missing for me-Mars! The thing that made the original story so entertaining and whimsical was the concept of a human colony on the one world we constantly dream of which is our closest planetary neighbor. In this film I never really new who was who in the great civil conflict. Both the colony and ruling society were so identical in appearance that it was hard to focus an emotional attachment to the physicality of this sci-fi world. The scenes carried the highly produced and fantastical scenes and technology that is truly a future worth dreaming of much like the original however I found myself constantly wishing for the Martian fragility that the colony faced. In this version I never could figure out what made society so dire that the government had to conspire to take hold of a founded colonies land. Although the population was critical the advancements of this reality were so great that even the desolate and toxic areas outside of the city could have been re-populated so I never felt completely sold on this story. I have to give props to the action and fighting sequences between the stars of this film because they were quite intense and entertaining. Even though the one thing was missing that could have made ""Total Recall"" epic and I found it's absence irritating I did enjoy the movie's effects and view of the future-minus the conflict of course.",Total Recall

This really isn't a bad film, and despise featuring a tunnel that goes all the way through the planet, it's just so very ordinary and forgettable. Colin Farrell is better than most could have been, but unlike his stuntman he's given very little to work with here. His support is fine even if they're given even less to do than even Mr Farrell.

The direction and cinematography is great, the writing isn't quite on the same level, a longer runtime might have helped to flesh out the characters but might have hurt the pacing if that would be the case. The film received generally mixed reviews from critics, and it's completely understandable. The lack of humor isn't a flaw, I didn't mind it all. The lack of emotional impact and character development is its biggest flaw but the world building, overall production design and direction makes up for it. The sets and locations are stunning and amazingly created, the musical score deservers a lot of praise too. Then of course the action sequences and the acting of Colin Farrell and the other cast members, impressive performances, but Farrell's are the most important and impressive performance in the film.The world of Total Recall works so well for an action movie as it does a crime film, the world building and visual effects we got today makes the impossible, possible. The action sequences are full with suspension, entertainment and tension. The locations are rightfully chosen and the choreography is on point. Honestly, this is a good and entertaining film. I get what the director wanted to create and he succeeded with a fast paced sci-fi action film. If we're talking about an amazing adaption of Philip K Dick's short story, I think it doesn't do it justice, one that I believe the 1990 adaption does better. But I still have to watch that one.

89,natashabowiepinky,Meh,6,19 May 2013,"Remakes are a difficult thing. You have to contend with fans of the original, as well as make a good film in it's own right. In the case of this one, I have to confess to being deeply biased: the 1990 Schwarzenegger starrer is one of my favourite action pictures ever, so this version has some very big shoes to fill. Alas, this is more of a size 6 than 12... While having enough gun and martial-arts related mayhem for ten other movies, it forgets completely to engage the brain the way the 90's version did. Battles with squadrons of robots and epic car chases using futuristic vehicles are all well and good, but if there's no SOUL behind any of it, if it all feels like an exercise rather than a pleasure, then what's the point?I may have been a trifle harsh in my above paragraph: This is a decent action movie by most standards. Colin Farrell and Kate Beckinsale face off against each well, and the MANY fight sequences are directed with a sense of real pace and professionalism. So, why did I miss Arnie's weird accent and his customary one liners? Why did I feel that the new elements added to the plot hindered, rather than helped it? Why did I get the feeling that this was purely a money-making exercise, and not a labour of love like... you guessed it. It says a lot that the moment that stood out the most to me was a homage to the original involving a woman at the airport.Fact is, if you're going to call your new movie by the same name as a classic, you better make sure you're not just riding on it's coattails. You have to give it some credit for not being EXACTLY the same story-wise, but there's enough similarities here (including all the character names) for the comparisons to be unavoidable. It does its job adequately, but will always sit in the shadow of it's predecessor. Shame, that. 6/10",Total Recall
90,petra_ste,Forgettable,6,23 January 2015,"Let's be honest here, people totally recall (har har) the Paul Verhoeven original mostly for how unfeasibly hot a young Sharon Stone looked in it. This remake is destined to a similar scenario, as Kate Beckinsale's sexy, feral action villainess is the only thing likely to be remembered - Jessica Biel, quite a looker herself, has a blander role and is often pushed into the background. Director Len Wiseman, Beckinsale's real life husband, clearly belongs to the Luc Besson/Paul W.S. Anderson ""let's just focus on my gorgeous wife's acrobatics"" school of thought.Loosely based on a Philip K. Dick short story (which steered towards a very different, sardonic direction at the end), Total Recall is decent entertainment. Farrell as the blue-collar dreamer who ends up involved in a lethal spy game is okay; visuals are okay; set-pieces are okay. Cue rooftop chase (the best of the bunch), car chase, factory chase, first twist, second twist, climactic boss battle.If competent but bland sci-fi is enough for you, open wide.6/10",Total Recall

I'm delighted to see a classic movie (at least for me) remade using today's technology and actors especially when the results are as good as this film. The actors were surprisingly enjoyable, especially the female antagonist who seems to put quite an effort in her acting and it shows. The whole mind bending plot is on par with the above mentioned, making your confused mind wonder over and over again about which is the truth.

Sadly for Total Recall 2012 we need much much more than pretty pictures and this film failed on nearly every other aspect people in 2012 expect from films. The script was nonsensical rubbish. There was a story in there somewhere and probably some insightful comment on the modern world but it was pretty hard to see anything over the endless chase scenes and Dumb with a capital D delivery. What's with the all over the show acting from some really quite good actors? Who thought that would be a good idea? There was so much hot air and puff over nothing details, massive detours away from the flow of the story over silly visuals then back to the badly told plot.

Compare the two versions is tricky. The new one has outstanding special effects and certain things, like the resolution are less disappointing than creating an atmosphere in Mars in just a few seconds; however the humor of the first movie has nowhere to be found in the new version.Colin is a good replacement for Arnold and Kate is a total bitch so her character is credible.

95,deatman9,Somewhat like the first but just not good.,6,31 October 2012,O.K Im going to start off by saying Im only giving this movie a six solely because they spent 150 million on this and it shows through the CGI effects they are pretty good. They need to make more SCI-FI movies they kind of depleted the last couple decades.So this movie had some what of the same story line. Some people say its the exact same but like its very very different. It almost seems like its a new movie and its just ripping off the old one. There were actually certain scenes from the original but they completely changed them or messed them up it was a real mess in my opinion.They turned this one into one giant action flick instead of having a solid story. The story in the original was so much more entertaining and interesting. Colin Ferrel is a pretty good actor but everyone else was sub-par. Lots of action and barely any information on a very boring plot. Instead of seeing Quaid interacting with mutants and the suspense of the first one. this one drove me nuts with the constant shooting. The only good thing was the CGI and if you want to turn your brain off and just get drunk watch movie then this will probably entertain you.Well overall if you liked the first one I would say stay as far away from this as possible. Its a pure action film as silly as any John Wu film. This was a real disappointment I usually don't hate remakes that much but this one was really bad.I think Im going to watch the original now. 2 WEEKS..2WEEEEEKSSSSS...2 WEEEEKKKKSSSS,Total Recall
96,jdkraus,An effort that pales in comparison to the original,6,11 August 2012,"The 1990 release of ""Total Recall"" is one of my favorite Arnold films. It is violently action- packed, wickedly funny, and has an ambiguous plot that poses an interesting query. Is the main hero, Douglas Quaid, in a nightmare that is brought on by his visit to Rekall, or is he awake, running around as a secret agent in a sci-fi adventure? Hollywood has a tendency to reboot for newer generations. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Christopher Nolan proved that his Batman trilogy is far better than any prior works of the original comic book hero. However, can the filmmakers do the same with Douglas Quaid?This ""Total Rekall"" is not so much of a mere copycat as the 1990 film. The characters and plot may be relatively the same, yet it has its own feel and atmosphere so to speak. While Paul Verhoven created a clean, almost too good to be true future, director Len Wiseman gives us a very futuristic yet dismal dystopia. Rain is constant, many scenes take place at night, and the world itself is filthy and overpopulated. In watching this movie, I could not help but think of Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner."" The CGI is a bonus for the filmmakers, for it puts the world on epic proportions. In fact, the robotic minions of the Cohagen Corporation are flawlessly motion-captured. At times, I had to compare them to the genius of design and animation of the droid army in ""I Robot."" While the world that the filmmakers have created for us is astonishing on the big screen, everything else about this movie is mediocre. Colin Farrel is a good actor. In this, he seems disgruntled and confused. Farrel seems to lack an element of fun as Quaid, (unlike Arnold in the original). Kate Beckinsale is a fine actress, yet she becomes no more than a, hot, psychotic stalker as she constantly chases and tries to kill Quaid. She gets a good line here and there, but there is no flamboyance in her character that Mike Ironside delivered as the ruthless Rixter 22 years ago. Even Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy are extremely limited in this film—only about 10 minutes of screen time are given for each actor. This is particularly bad when their roles are supposed to opponents of one another—Cohagen and Matthais. How are we supposed to boo or root them?The story tries to stand up as its own. There is no Mars or mutants—just earth split into two inhabitable areas due to pollution (a hint to our global endeavors). There are references to the 1990 film, such as: a chick with three boobs, an elder woman that repeatedly says ""2 weeks,"" and of course the machine that supposedly wipes your mind. These references are amusing to watch. Unfortunately, the writers do not make anything particularly special about this movie. While the action and effects are entertaining, they are nothing new. It would have good for some sort of twist to happen at the end or a level of ambiguity to occur throughout the film. Well, there is kind of a twist, but any sensible viewer would see it coming at least 10-minutes in advance. In addition, the story feels rushed—no doubt a way to keep the movie under two hours. ""Total Rekall"" is not a bad film. If anything, it is just an average, big budget action flick. It is an effort but it pales in comparison to the original.",Total Recall
97,jessegehrig,"so Hanna called, said to me, its not as good as the first EP",1,10 March 2014,"Not as good as the original. PG-13 means you as a film maker are a coward. R equals balls, the '87 Total Recall is and awesome mindless parade of violence and goofy effects, it has nothing to do with Philip K. Dick but in no way should that be a slight to the writer. The original Total Recall was a vehicle movie for Arnold Schwarzenegger and made no pretense as to be anything else. While this movie pretends to be closer to the source material left by Philip K. Dick its in reality merely a vehicle for computer generated effects. Its a bunch of programmers saying ""look what we can do with computers!"" Film is film, if lit well it looks as real as life, so far no computer generated image has come close to looking like real stuff.

Also gun violence and gore kick ass.",Total Recall
98,tomimt,Soulless exercise,5,31 January 2016,"I guess I should start by saying that I have nothing against remakes. Some of my favorite movies are remakes, like Cronenbergs Fly or Carpenter's The Thing. Those two movies show nicely, how you can make a remake of a movie, that didn't quite work, or at least I didn't think neither of the original movies worked, and improve upon the solid ideas the original has. Or if a movie is based on a book, like Lord of the Rings, you can always do a new adaptation, like Bakshi's version VS Jackson's.Now, Verhoven's Total Recall is a great action sci-fi movie. I count it among the best Arnold Schwarzenegger has starred in as well as one of the best made in the 90's. It's just an overall solid movie with nothing wrong with it. But, as it's based on a book by Philip K. Dick and as such is quite a different from the source, I do understand why someone would want to remake it. I understand it the same way why someone would want to make a new version of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep that is closer to the book than the Scott masterpiece is. So why, I ask, did the makers of this new Total Recall opt to try and remake the Verhoven movie and not try to make a new adaptation of We Can Remember It For You Wholesale that would have been closer to the book? Total Recall 2012, just like many other modern remakes, don't try to improve something that has previously existed. The makers don't try to remake movies that might have had interesting ideas in them, but fell flat. No. What the makers of remakes like Toral Recall 2012 try to do is to take an existing, well remembered title and make a cash grab product. They aren't interested in making a different take, they are more interested in following the previously placed guide lines. Sure, they might change things a bit, but overall this and Verhoven's Recall follow the same path.I'd like to add, that Total Recall 2012 isn't utterly horrible movie. But at the same time it lacks a soul. It saddens me, that Hollywood churns out these kinds of remakes, as there's bad movies with interesting ideas in them out there that deserve to be remade.",Total Recall
99,Likes_Ninjas90,"Excruciatingly dull and visually derivative, more intent on being a video game instead of a film, but unlikely to have the faintest impact on the most seasoned gamer",3,28 August 2012,"In the future, a war has left Earth divided into the United Federation of Britain and 'The Colony' (formerly Australia). Both the UFB and the Colony are overpopulated and people travel between the areas through an elevator called 'The Fall', which transports through the core of the Earth. Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) is a factory worker who is having nightmares and finds little comfort from his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale). He decides to visit a company called Rekall, where false adventures and memories can be implanted into his brain. Yet when Rekall scans Quaid to see if he is holding any secrets, he is accused of being a spy. Quaid manages to escape, but only after killing several cops. Lori turns out not to be his real wife but an agent for the UFB who is monitoring him. Escaping from her, Quaid is told that his name is Hauser and that he has a code that could stop the evil Chancellor Vilos Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston) but it must be shown to the resistance leader Matthais (Bill Nighy) first. Aiding him in finding Matthais is Melina (Jessica Biel), a woman from his dreams. Meanwhile, Cohaagen is blaming a terrorist attack on rebel fighters so that he has an excuse to use his army of robots to wipe out people on 'The Colony'. Total Recall is excruciatingly dull and visually derivative, more intent on being a video game instead of a film, but unlikely to have the faintest impact on the most seasoned gamer. It is also an unnecessary remake of the 1990 Arnold Schwarznegger film, and another loose and problematic adaptation of Philip K. Dick's short story 'We Can Remember it For You Wholesale' (1966). The original film, which I rewatched recently, had the framework of a Schwarznegger vehicle, combining humour, ultra violence and technology. But the director Paul Verhoeven was also skillful in the way that he planted ideas in the audience's head about what is real and imaginary. What was also interesting about the original was that it predated the golden age of video games, but still played like an advanced version of Donkey Kong at times. Now that Total Recall is over twenty years old it has been succeeded by more lavish films about memory and dreams, like The Matrix (1999) and Inception (2010). On the back of the success of Christopher Nolan's film, someone thought it would be a good idea to remake Total Recall for the Call of Duty generation. That job has been given to director Len Wiseman, whose equally tedious Underworld (2003) series is every bit a computer game, minus the controller. Incidentally, he has a background in developing commercials for companies such as Sony and Activision. And the stylistic choices he has made for this film show how much he is willing to pander monotonously to the video game demographic.Wiseman has stated that he wanted a more grounded approach to the film. The sterile look of the original is replaced by grittier, dirtier tones of a highly industrial and mechanical landscape. This is fine until you realise that the film's iconography is simply derivative of much better games and movies. The flying cars and cityscapes owe all too much to Blade Runner (1982) and Minority Report (2002), while the frequent long shots seem employed only to show off the design, echoing the likes of open world games such as Grand Theft Auto. The amount of detail in the city feels wasted since it holds no greater stylistic meaning. Notably, there's no Mars and only a single mutant in this supposedly grounded take too. Instead, there are robots to be destroyed because they're bloodless targets (no one bleeds in movies like this anymore do they?) and it allows the film to steal from the recent Star Wars prequels. But why is there such a disjunction between games and films when they look to imitate each other? Heated debate surrounds whether games can be art and whether they are becoming as sophisticated a medium as films themselves. The technology surrounding games continues to grow and gamers are also now encouraged to make moral choices that can shape the outcome of a narrative. However, part of the reason why Hollywood has continually failed to bridge films and games together, through some awful adaptations, is because games are a medium defined by interaction. Games place a higher emphasis on action rather than narrative because the player has physical input, rather than merely watching the story unfold, like a film. By their nature, video games are rarely allowed the time and space to develop narratives of thematic sophistication. They are fun and often visually imaginative but not art. The two mediums are simply divorced by their purpose and design, as much as their audience. Total Recall epitomises this problematic relationship. The intricate themes of Dick's short story, how we acquire knowledge and process information and the misuse of technology, are dissolved by the director's insistence on action and designing a video game that you can't actually play. The humourless cast, which includes Bill Nighy limited ridiculously to a single scene, are treated like tokens of a board game, moved from one set piece to another. The action sequences they're thrown into, which involve dodging flying cars, escaping from an exploding lift and jumping over rooftops, are long and boring to watch. Most frustrating is that there is less ambiguity here because I wasn't convinced that Quaid was dreaming this time. There's a scene in the original where a man in a bow-tie provides scientific reasoning as to why Quaid is dreaming. It puts doubt in your mind. In this version, Quaid is told to shoot Melina and he'll wake up. Anyone who can believe that really is dreaming. Exit game.",Total Recall
100,Darkside-Reviewer,Total Reimagining,7,6 June 2019,The original Total Recall movie cannot be recreated it is a one of kind movie and is favoured by fans and critics this movie should not be compared to the original just enjoyed for a what it is a new interpretation of an older movie taking its ideas and making something new with them.The movie follows a man who finds out through an accident during a memory augmentation procedure that his memories have already been augmented and his life and past are just a constructed memory awakened to this shocking truth he sets out to find out who he really is who the people in his life really are and why his memory has been altered.The movie is very action oriented and fast paced after the 20 minute mark the movie kicks into overdrive and delivers scene after scene of action when the movie does slow down it doesn't give much dialogue to explain the movies world or how it works or even why.The effects are good for an action movie and the science fiction city landscape and architecture is interesting and nice to look at just doesn't show or explain half the things you see for example structures suspended in mid air with no support or visible special effects to show possible gravity suspension of any kind which ends up making you feel like it's just scenery and not a lot of effort was put into its design other than to make a scene look futuristic and flashy.The characters go through action scene after action scene and after all the sweat rain and explosions still have there hair perfect lipstick still shining cloths intact this lack of detail let's the movie down and makes it feel plastic especially against the bright light backgrounds and green screens.I recommend watching this if you enjoy a decent action movie and just wanna switch your brain off and watch a movie for a while just don't expect anything mind blowing.,Total Recall

This being the case, I wonder why movie studios feel the need to spend millions of dollars remaking a movie that was good, into a movie that is not good. Granted, the special effects and visual style are great in this modern version, but the movie doesn't have the thrill, feeling and entertainment factor that the original.Besides, the performances are mediocre. Farrell, a great actor, is wasted in this movie. Biel plays her usual tight-pants bimbo character, which doesn't make her any favor as an actress nor give her credibility as such. Beckinsale shines at times as villain, but not much because she is not the person for this role, which needs of a mix of house-wife bimbo dangerous gal both in looks and performance to create the ambiguity that her role needs to be believable.I found myself bored while watching this movie, despite some scenes being visually stunning, all the visual production very sleek, and quite cool.Despite some glimpses of goodness, this movie is not good.

102,Laakbaar,Colin Farrell excels in high-tech futuristic shoot-out flick,7,8 September 2012,"This movie is set in a high-tech post-apocalyptic future in which the world's atmosphere has been mostly poisoned. The remnants of humanity are crammed into two areas called UBF and The Colony, which are roughly centred on Britain and Australia respectively. These future cities are fantastically high-tech, crowded, multinational developments extending into the sky.UBF economically and politically oppresses The Colony. A massive transport vehicle has been constructed to transport cheap labour on a daily basis through a long tunnel from The Colony to UBF. It takes 17 minutes.Doug Quaid (Colin Farrell) is a factory worker from the Colony who makes this journey every day. He is married to Lori (Kate Beckinsale).He is rather dissatisfied with his lot, so he decides to visit ""Rekall"", a company specialising in chemically inducing exciting memories. He decides he wants the memories of a double spy. The needle goes in...and the process is abruptly halted. Is the incredible adventure that follows real or part of the Rekall treatment? This movie is exciting enough. It's a sequence of shoot outs, explosions, chases, acrobatics, close calls and so on -- the futuristic world serving as the backdrop for all of this. Part of the fun of this movie is the incredible futuristic technology. The movie directors, designers and technical people really did a good job with this, showing much of it in detail. Despite its futuristic, high-tech angle, it turns out that this movie falls into the same genre as a lot of action/spy movies nowadays, including the Bourne movies, Safe House, the new Bond movies, and so on. I think the same writers must be involved because these movies all feel the same.The main characters have almost superhuman intellectual and physical abilities, far beyond that of trained athletes and martial arts experts. They jump fearlessly from roof to roof, get injured, smash their heads and knees, fall unconscious -- and yet press on. They all fight like Bruce Lee (although you never see them spending hours in training). One man can kill ten highly armed opponents without even breathing hard.In these American films there are almost always intense shoot outs and chase scenes. Everything happens very fast. Lots of crazy driving, crashes and near death escapes.The heroes can fly airplanes, drive like stunt men, do daredevil tricks. They have superb memories, training in explosives and computers, and knowledge on how to use the most complex technology this ultra-high-tech future has to offer. These people are not only highly trained, super fit, super smart sharpshooters trained in martial arts and computers to an unearthly level, but they're also sort of invulnerable.They're superheros really.And of course there's always a rogue element: it's always the case that someone has become, will become, or is suspected of being, not what he seems. The viewer is invited in virtually every film to try to figure out the twist. In a spy agency you can't trust anyone, can you. It's almost a rule now. Nothing is as it seems. This movie is no different.Usually someone is on the run.What is one to make of this? What's going on in Hollywood? Why is this happening? It's like all the genres have been fused: spy, superhero, martial arts, science fiction, mystery and action genres. And they are invariably shot in exotic locations.I don't like this new genre. I suppose I've reached the point where I no longer enjoy movies that are based primarily on shootouts and chases, technology and quasi-superheroes.The best part of this movie: Colin Farrell. Always an exciting actor, he's very believable here. I must add he is looking sexy and very fit. If you're a fan, you'll enjoy seeing him in this movie.The worst parts of this movie: -- The whole UFB v. The Colony story line. What a mistake. Even though ""The Fall"" was cool, it didn't fit into the rest of the plot.-- The Lori character. She just wouldn't stop, but we're never told what her problem is. It's just a job for her, right? -- The Cohaagen character, especially at the end. Sorry, but the movie just fell apart for me at this point. I don't want to give anything away though. Two good actors let down by bad...what? -- Finally, all the many rows of highly armed synthetics, trapping them hopelessly in corners and endlessly shooting powerful machine guns -- but with bullets that never hit their target. Unrealistic. And annoying.",Total Recall
103,dfa120374,Surprisingly Enjoyable,7,10 December 2014,"Total Recall is the story of a man who wants more from his mundane life and decides to visit Rekall - a company that enables their clients to live out their fantasy lifestyles by implanting fake memories into their minds. However, things start to take a strange turn as Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) starts to find out that everything he knows about his life may not be what it appears to be.Now, I have seen the original (who hasn't?), and thoroughly enjoyable, Schwarzenegger version of Total Recall and I went into this remake with little hope of it being any good & maybe expecting the worst, but at the same time I tried to keep an open mind about it. I'm happy to say that I'm glad I did go into it with an open mind because I was very pleasantly surprised with how well this remake was done.The story travels at quite a fast pace (especially during the abundant action scenes) and you may lose your way sometimes, but there are moments in the movie where it allows you to catch your breath without it coming to a boring crawl or even standstill.The visuals and special effects are absolutely outstanding even if there was slightly too much happening at one time in a lot of the scenes. To be honest, though, you just get drawn into the amazing environment as you continue to watch the movie unravel.When I first knew that Colin Farrell would be playing the part of Douglas Quaid I immediately thought ""No way - they've definitely got the wrong guy"", but I'm not ashamed to admit that I was wrong because he was excellent throughout the whole movie. Kate Beckinsale was fantastic as well, and played the perfect part of being a total b**ch.While this is a remake it does attempt (and succeeds) to be it's own movie, and there are a few good homages to the original. A couple being a certain ""alien"" female with an extra appendage and the scene where Quaid arrives at his destination in disguise (but with a nice wee twist).All in all this movie is a great film to watch and I definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about wanting to see it.",Total Recall
104,billygoat1071,Total Gloss,4,24 August 2012,"The 1990's version of Total Recall was a solid sci-fi adventure despite of its silly moments, especially the remarkable scene when Arnold Schwarzenegger's eyeballs are popping out. But those unhinged moments are the reason why the first film is so charming. This remake tries to be more serious and wants to take away the silliness from the first film. The result is it looks cool. It looks so cool, it looks like that is the only ambition of the movie. Anything else is just bland characters and a series of chases, and action. When it becomes suspenseful, it fails to deliver the tension. Total Recall seemingly doesn't care about anything else but to play around the futuristic world that is set in.It's a total gloss. The film is nothing but a series of action set pieces and cool looking visuals. The world of the film looks intriguing but we don't get to know much of it. We know its origins and nothing else. Aside of its Blade-Runner-esque world, the story is still there, but it loses focus by the overlong sequences of action. There's nothing wrong with too many action, except if you don't care about the characters, you wouldn't feel the thrill and just watch these soulless beings run.The characters are incredibly bland. Colin Farrell ends up being a boring generic hero. Kate Beckinsale is just doing her action swagger. Bryan Cranston is the only one who is fun to watch among the cast. The rest, Bokeem Woodbine and John Cho are both pretty awkward with their short roles. The worst is Jessica Biel who basically embraces the blandness of the script. She may not be the right one for this role but she could've at least gave some personality to the character.For its fan service, the film recaptures some scenes from the original, but they're just there. It doesn't make any difference. There are scenes that tries to be suspenseful, but they somehow fail to work because, once again, the looks has more attention. Its fortitude is replaced by the excessive amount of shoddy lens flares. The only merit here now is the visuals. They sure look good even though we've seen most of them before. It's still pretty eye candy.To be honest, I'm actually optimistic about this remake, but unfortunately, it is really disappointing. It does succeed to be less sillier than the original but it is also less interesting. Too much action and explosions may sound fun, but most of it is just stale and empty. Years from now, if someone mentions this title, people will still recall Schwarzenegger's unhinged performance and the fun from the original.

Dated as it is, Paul Verhoeven's film is still a more enjoyable experience and makes slightly more sense than Total Recall 2012, even with the unique acting (in)ability of Schwarzenegger.I required a large glass of Saint Emilion to get though Len Wiseman's version and will probably need to wash my brain out with at least another two. At 118 minutes, it is five minutes longer than the original and at least five times more painful. The initial claims were that Total Recall 2012 would be closer to the source material, We Can Remember it for you Wholesale by Philip K. Dick. However, it bears scant resemblance to the 18-page short story and is little more than a louder, brasher, more expensive reimagining of the original film albeit with far, far better effects.And that's the high point, the solitary peak in this turgid lump of filmic fecal matter: the digital scenery is often very good. The cityscapes stretch out on vast digital canvases, constantly moving, constantly busy and, sometimes, it isn't even possible to see where the set ends and the green screen begins. The scenic backdrops are fantastically expansive and darkly depressing. Is this what the future holds for us? But the capaciousness of the wallpaper can't mask the cracks, no, chasms, in the film.We are told in the opening sequences that Earth has been reduced to two usable zones: The United Federation of Britain and Australia, which is now known as The Colony. But there is no explanation as to why everyone, Asians aside, speaks with American accents. The method of transportation between the two zones is painted across the screen attractively but, without dropping plot spoilers, is not sufficiently thought through to make it believable. And so it goes on.Far too much effort has been given to winking at the original (triple-breasted prostitute, lifted lines of dialogue, body-scanner episode etc. etc. ad nauseum) and far too little attention given to the subtleties like, um, plot There is noise, lots of noise; there is violence, gunfire, explosions; there are fights and stunts and flying cars; there are aliens and robots and villains and beautiful girls. And all of them have been unceremoniously dumped in a blender, whizzed at high speed and hurled at a wall in the hope we'll enjoy the result and still, somehow, be able to identify it from the mess that is left dripping.It became an arduous viewing experience where I wished home was not a half-hour drive away but a five-minute cab ride that would allow me to glug not a glass but a bottle of brain-numbing juice.So what was it about? You know what? I haven't a clue, other than age-old quip ""About two hours too long!"" What's more, I don't care. I don't want to see it again and I don't really want to relieve the experience by talking about it after this minor rant. Wiseman broke Dick and if you want a really good Philip K. Dick adaptation, there is still none better than Spielberg's Minority Report.Total Recall isn't a 'could do better' film, it's a 'has been better' flick: Kate Beckinsale has been better (in The Aviator and even Whiteout), Colin Farrell has been much better (in London Boulevard, In Bruges, Phone Booth) and Total Recall has been better (in 1990).It's a noisy, pointless mess.On the upside, the summer is almost over and autumn is on the way with a new batch of films that should make sense and be far more memorable than, um, what was it I saw?

107,davidgee,Fast and Furious - and confusing,7,13 September 2012,"Not so much a remake as a re-imagining, this is a dizzying movie in more ways than one. The extended chase and fight sequences on grungy city streets and futuristic aerial freeways are as vivid as those in Blade Runner and Inception, both of which this film calls to mind (though it's not as good as either of them).Where I got lost (as does Doug Quaid) was in Cohaagen's headquarters in a vast tower block, which incorporates a gigantic express elevator that seems to link Britain with the Colony (Australia) - presumably via the earth's core. Did I miss something?Colin Farrell has a powerful screen presence, but even he can't quite hold this confusing movie together. The 1990 version had awesome special effects that created a genuine flavour of the 'otherworldliness' of life on Mars. This earthbound version is pacey and enjoyable at the level of an arcade game or a Fast and Furious movie, but it hasn't got the Wow Factor: too much action, not enough plot.I never expected to say this but I kind of missed Arnie Schwarzenegger - clumsy, yes, and barely articulate, but always very, very watchable!",Total Recall
108,beresfordjd,Good fun,8,23 November 2017,"Much as I enjoyed the Arnie version and I really did, I liked this a lot more as it seemed less cartoon like - very Blade Runner influenced, thought. I am not a huge Colin Farrell fan but he always does a reasonable job and this is no exception. The humour that was below the surface of the first film seems to be totally missing from this one. The film looks great and is well designed. Bryan Cranston is always good value and proves to be so here.",Total Recall
109,osj2507,I remember and like the classic film with Arnold,6,19 September 2015,"I remember and like the classic film with Arnold, so I was a bit skeptical about a remake of this and would if live up to the memory of the classic ..... it does not.If you have not seen the old one, this is a very descent movie, lots of action, suspense and twists in the story and what is to be believed for the main character Douglas Quaid and for the audience. I have however seen the old movie or classic, so this is kind of a new way of telling the story, with some modifications, some great new things, something has been kept, but unfortunately also some things are not what they used to be (according to my memory).I did like this film, it has all what a modern day total recall should have, great effects, great scenery, great action and great characters and actors. It did also keep most of what made the classic fresh and interesting at that time and there are few dull moments so the action and pace is great.",Total Recall
110,richieandsam,Not as good as the original...,6,3 February 2013,"TOTAL RECALLAs soon as I heard they were remaking Total Recall I was not impressed. I honestly believe they are remaking too many films. It would be nice to have more original ideas instead of most of the time ruining a classic movie. There are a few remakes that I really liked, but I can't think of a single remake that I have seen that is better then the original. Unfortunately, Total Recall is no exception.The original is a classic... I love it so much that I think it is one of Arnies better films.This remake was pretty good though.The action scenes were amazing... the effects, camera angles and fighting scenes were really impressive. I also loved the futuristic gadgets and vehicles. There is an awesome scene where the hover car was falling and stops right before hitting the floor... don't worry... that scene is in the trailer so I have not spoiled anything.The story was not put together brilliantly. The original was flowing a lot smoother. This film just didn't seem to gel together that well in places.The acting was alright. I am not a huge Colin Farrell fan, but he did a good job. Kate Beckinsale was awesome in this, just a really really bad shot... but great at hand to hand fighting. Jessica Biel was alright... not the greatest actress ever, but not too bad to ruin the movie.I liked the little sly nods to the original film though... there were some great bits in it that were repeated from the original... ""Two week..."" & ""I'm gonna make you wish you had 3 hands"" to name 2. :)I will give this film 6 out of 10...Pretty good, but not brilliant.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Total Recall
111,Al_The_Strange,"""The past is a construct of the mind. It blinds us.""",7,19 December 2012,"This film has received its fair share of outrage. In this day and age with all kinds of films being arbitrarily remade for a quick buck (like Footloose, of all things), Total Recall comes off as just another tired remake. What makes it worse is that the original Total Recall is one of those films that's firmly established its status as a classic science fiction picture; I've known many fans who've expressed their disgust over taking Paul Verhoeven's pulpy masterpiece and practically desecrating it.Frankly, the hate is justifiable, given that this remake hits up all the same plot points but changes so much around. One could probably spend pages comparing Len Wiseman's film to Verhoeven's, and highlighting everything that made the original better.That being said, there are things I enjoyed about the remake. A lot of things, actually. The film definitely has action and spectacle: the cityscapes rendered here are among some of the best I've seen since the Star Wars prequels (and they do bear a lot in common with Blade Runner), and serves as a very interesting setpiece for a constant barrage of fight scenes, pursuits, and huge explosions. The action is pretty cool, and I was especially enthralled by the hovercraft chase in the middle of the film. There is a little bit of drag in the first half of the film, but otherwise, I found it most enjoyable.The plot is pretty much a clone of the original 1990 film, just swapping out specific aspects and the setting. Mars is no longer a major setting; it's all set on a pair of highly futuristic megalopolises. Surprisingly, I believe this is one change that actually benefits the film: as crowded and condensed these cities are, there's finally a logical reason for having the Rekall virtual vacations in this universe. Additionally, the film does show a lot of really cool futuristic things that appeal to sci-fi nerds like myself: I was really intrigued to see a man using his hand as a phone, or to see an entire building fall through a tunnel running through the core of the Earth. Above all, the overall look, style, and tone of the film matches up really well with the type of sci-fi adventure that Phillip K. Dick (author of the original story this franchise is based on) is better known for.Problem is, all the originality in these few parts don't make the sum of the parts original. Characters don't really stand out much, and the story overall just feels like it's using the structure of the original film as a mere template for all the action scenes and cool ideas. All style and no substance. It figures.The most criminal omission in the story would be the ambiguity of whether or not the events of the film are ""real."" In the original, you could conclude that it was all in Quaid's head. You can't in this new version; it's not a mind-bender by any means. In fact, it's the opposite.Say what you will, I still find the film slick and stylish, as expected with a Len Wiseman film. The opening scenes proved to be a little painful on the eyes, with the lens flares and intense strobe lighting, but I was grateful that it didn't persist for long. Otherwise, I enjoyed the camera work and editing. The actors do the best they can: Collin Farrell is the man, while Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale put on their typical tough-girl acts. Writing is not a big standout. This production has a ton of great-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music has some cool parts.As expected, the new Total Recall offers a lot of spectacle and cool new toys, but the original is still the best. Sci-fi fans and action junkies might want to give this new take a look; it's about as good (or as bad) as something like The Day The Earth Stood Still remake. If that just appalls you, then you might want to keep your distance.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Pretty Good)",Total Recall

115,lagudafuad,"wait till the car chase scene is available on YouTube, that is all you need to see about from this movie",4,2 November 2012,"The high note of this movie is the intense actions scenes, there are so engaging that they will keep you glued, the first chase that saw Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), leap of his apartment to the busy street and then engage in a car chase against his ""beautiful wife"" (Kate Beckinsale) is a scene that I tell you is worth seeing.The problem with the movie is everything in between the action scenes; they are humourless, emotionless and down to the last word boring.Unlike the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger original this Total Recall has no trip to Mars or any trip out of the earth's atmosphere.Total Recall is a dystopian science fiction action film remake of the 1990 classic of the same name, which in turn was loosely based on the 1966 short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" by Philip K. Dick.Boasting of nice fight choreographies, this Len Wiseman film is not so catchy after a while you forget all the highs and can't wait for it to end.The movie plot is quite similar to the original; at the end of 21st Century, the Earth is divided into two territories the United Federation of Britain (UFB) and the Colony (Australia) after World War 3 devastates the remainder of the planet.Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) is bored of his life and decides to go visit a company called Rekall (which implants memories in your brain), so they can implant in his brain the memory of a super spy.Reason why Douglas will want this is because of his constant dream he keeps having, where he is being chased. Things go wrong at Rekall when the police break in with the intension of taking Douglas. Then Douglas was able to kill all ten officers without knowing how he was able to do it.Then at home his wife also tries to kill him, this makes him run off trying to find what is going on, till he ran into the girl of his dreams who tells him that all the things he knows is not real.Now Douglas is on the run finding clues that he left behind leading him to his real life. Len Wiseman is the man behind the Underworld movies with wife Kate Beckinsale and he directed the fourth installment of the Die Hard series, Live Free or Die Hard in 2007.It was rumored that Arnold Schwarzenegger wanted to reprising his role, a rumour that I'm glad wasn't true as Colin Farrell instead was picked to play the title role of Douglas Quaid.This movie had a 30% approval rating in Rotten Tomatoes which is nothing compared to Farrell's last two movies Horrible Bosses and Fright Night both done in 2011 which had 69% and 73% approval ratings respectively. Two of Colin's best films were done in 2002, Minority Report and the wonderful movie Hart's War.I will advice you wait till the car chase scene is available on YouTube then go watch it, cause that is the only good thing to see in this action flick.www.lagsreviews.com",Total Recall
116,blackmamba99971,A unique change of pace,6,20 August 2012,"It's strange to see this kind of film remade with a new kind of twist. From the original total recall with Arnold, this one had too much eye candy to make it believable. Colin Farrel was also a bit timid it seems in this movie where his play wife Lori who is a secret agent had more impact than the rest of the cast. Plus the fact that this looked like it was taken place on earth, and not mars like the first. Using a large transport through the planet is also non-believable. Physics state in any form that moving through a planets core will crush it with enough force to squash it to the size of a grapefruit. Plus the heat itself is enough to melt titanium. I liked the original story, where Arnold's character has to start a massive core element machine to melt a glacier to give the mar's atmosphere air. But this film was only about a tech robot invasion to wipe out the populace in order for co hagen to rule supreme. Too many clichés for my taste, on the run, bullets flying, an evil ex wife, no kind of character development. It is however a great display of technology for the kids. And that's all its good for. I am disappointed in this movie, Philip K. Dick is in my view a real visionary when he wrote novels before his death. I just wish some Hollywood producers will stop these film remakes to quench the thirst of tech geeks. Money isn't everything to make a film. It does help, but to go too far with the effects ruins the story.",Total Recall
117,willcundallreview,Remake that fails to step up,5,12 March 2015,"Rating-5/10Total Recall is a movie remake that although does boast good action and OK performances, it never manages to break free from the usual thing we see in Sci-Fi movies and action and ends up average. Not the best but not the worst remake ever seen this should please some people but I strongly feel those who have seen and like the original will be sorely disappointed in this one and who has replaced Arnie.Now the cast including Colin Farrell, Jessica Biel, Kate Beckinsale and Bryan Cranston sounds like an OK movie and one that should pass by relatively untouched, but with this it's a remake of a movie seen as a cult classic so you know you have to be top notch to please die hard fans. They don't put on a bad show and it is far from bad acting, in fact it's pretty much not the actors faults I found this one a so so affair but it's the writing.Now the writing as I say is the main catalyst not only for generic fights and Sci-fi ideas but also for the weak dialogue and almost at times it seems it makes actors seem worse. The script really Is the sucker punch right in the heart of this movie and with a better writer or just a better bit of script from the numerous writers involved on this, it could have been so much more fun. The director Len Wiseman isn't so bad and he manages a steady ship at his helm, The action we see in movies he has done like Die Hard is plain to see and involved in this is a hell of a lot of roof top chases and smashing through things, good old action fun.I wasn't too sure what to make of the effects used here and although this is what I think is the top brand CGI these days, it still feels overused and the landscape un lovingly crafted. All and all even the sets seem too much like a stolen piece of Blade Runner and the only set that really interested me is one that gets destroyed within minutes, great stuff. I felt the lack of humour is one thing again that takes the lovingly crafted part out as it seems stale and never ever not even once tries to joke around or crack a joke, poor writing again.Is Farrell better that Schwarzenegger?, well no, now don't get me wrong again, Colin is probably better that Arnie but in the original so much strangeness and life came from that movie, with this feeble remake only stalling any character development within the first 10 minutes. Is it an interesting movie, well yes it is and I imagine if you say let 100 people watch this, 50 would enjoy and 50 would not that is just what this movie is like, mixed reactions and bordering on boring.I think it is worth a watch though, my review so far may seem bitterly negative but I assure you it is far from awful, it manages at least to bring good action scenes, albeit similar to movies seen before but still exciting and pulsating. I would recommend this to anyone who basically like, and here is that word again, Sci-fi, this is an interesting plot and I tell you that if no one has seen or knows what the originals about, then they may enjoy this much much more. Now one question if you wanting to watch this may be ""does it have links to the original?"" and well although that is a perfectly reasonable question, in the eyes of the director it is not. The film only offers fleeting glimpses of it's older twin and in the end feels disconnected and lost. So overall a pretty average affair although a strong go at it.",Total Recall
118,michaelarmer,Total Rework,9,26 May 2020,"Most remakes are not as good as the original, this is one of the few that are better, its not as stylish as the first, but its made better and better acted, The special effects are better as well.Colin Farrell is great and good support from Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel, although Bill Nighy looks a bit odd in the role, Bokeem Woodbone and Bryan Cranston are good.There are a lot of action scenes, which takes something away from the acting, but it is what it is, an action flick, so you can't expect too much drama. The most unusual thing about this movie is ""the Drop"", the shuttle which travels through the centre of the earth from Australia to Britain in 17 mins, a novel idea, but very very unlikely, especially since the core is molten and moves, and is extremely hot.So a bit unlikely, and a few dodgy items but overall well done",Total Recall
119,LloydBayer,Total Rehash,6,26 October 2013,"Remakes are always tricky. They shouldn't be, considering there is usually about a decade or so between the original and the remake. In this case, TOTAL RECALL is remade 22 years after the original. At face value, this gives the new makers the advantage of using technological advancements in film production compared to when the predecessor was made. However, no matter how many times a film is remade, the only true constant is the story. How it is told defines the necessity of the remake and its reception. As far as reception is concerned this is the kind of movie where the audience claps in the end; only because it finally ends.Towards the end of the 21st century, Earth is decimated by chemical warfare, thus displacing human population into just two inhabitable territories – The United Federation of Britain and the Australian continent renamed as the Colony. People in the Colony, a select few, work for people in the Federation (UFB). This makes the UFB the ironfisted aggressor while the oppressed citizens of the Colony are secretly assembling a resistance. With a revolution on the horizon, Colony worker Douglas Quaid (Collin Farrell) has to console himself with a nine-to-five job at a UFB robot factory. Jaded with this routine, Quaid decides on an artificial memory implant at Recall. Almost instantly, all hell breaks loose. Quaid becomes a high priority target of the UFB and wanted as a covert member of the resistance. Worse, his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) turns out to be a covert UFB agent hell-bent on taking him down. Confused and on the run, Quaid finds Melina (Jessica Biel), a woman who holds the key to his true identity.So far, the plot feels like a recall, if you will, of the 1990 original. The execution however, leaves much to be desired. On the upside, returning viewers will find some well-placed icons borrowed from the original, including a woman capable of nursing triplets simultaneously. Paul Cameron's cinematography deserves a mention for being a cross between BLADE RUNNER and THE FIFTH ELEMENT. For a 2012 movie, this is nothing new but deserves a nod for art direction. That being said, some viewers may find strong lens flares and strobes annoying enough to induce epileptic seizures. The downside is just about everything else. There is a heavy dose of action but it soon gets repetitive in nature. Quaid and Melina are expert platform jumpers. They get to do this a lot; on and off and through elevators that seem to move in all directions. Between elevators they also get to dismember a hoard of forward marching robots; All 50,000 of them. Between robots our protagonists must jump across more platforms to evade Beckinsale's Lori, who keeps up with the chase like a product placement for a heavy duty battery. All of this goes on like a medley, and then you clap at the end.Bringing back characters from the original would have been a good thing if these characters were given adequate depth to drive the story forward. Instead, director Len Wiseman has the odds in favour of high octane action while snuffing out the humane aspects of thriving in a post-apocalyptic world. With Mars and mutants out, the story leans toward an altered ending by relying on the manner in which people travel between both territories. This is where the remake branches off from the original in giving the story some originality. Viewers who have not seen the original may also find Farrell better suited as Quaid than Arnold Schwarzenegger was. Then again, in retrospect there is simply no replacement for those cheesy one-liners that made Arnie a popular action movie icon. Our lovely ladies Beckinsale and Biel are best seen in cat-fight mode although the former has some of the meatier butt-kicking scenes and ends up as the main antagonist. Their inclusion adds to the eye-candy, no doubt. Other supporting roles are interjectors at best, from Bokeem Woodbine as Quaid's friend, and Bill Nighy and John Cho in roles too short to be considered cameos.In the end, the impression left by the original remains stronger. Objectively, this remake doesn't even qualify as popcorn entertainment irrespective of one having seen the original. What do they call leftovers packed into a pie and thrown back into the oven? Rehash! Only this one is half-baked.",Total Recall

Dull. Senseless action scenes with practically no storyline, no depth and poor acting. I mean, really lousy acting. Colin Farrell didn't seem comfortable with any of the women. With his side glances and body turned away from them. They took a little Blade Runner, a little Bourne and a minute amount of Total Recall, mixed it together, added no plot, nothing meaningful at all, dull dialog, crappy sets and threw it in the can.

121,xamtaro,Remake shows all the pros and cons of modern film making trends,7,8 August 2012,"What makes up who we are? Are we the result of our past experiences and memories or does our identity stem from something much deeper? These are questions that the 2012 remake of the classic action film ""Total Recall"" could have delved into. What we have instead is a showcase of the best and worst of modern science fiction film making. It is Definitely a product of 2012 as much as the original was a product of the early 90s.The aforementioned themes are only teased but never developed in this intense tale of on man's quest to uncover the truth of his identity and past. In a vastly overcrowded, class segregated future, everyman Douglas Quaid is haunted by dreams of being a secret agent on the run. Convinced that these are repressed fantasies brought on by his monotonous life assembling security automatons (which are like Cyber Stormtroopers) Quaid visits this place called ""Rekall""; Rekall claims to implant fake but realistic fantasies into one's mind. So he gets a fantasy of being a double agent implanted. Suddenly, its discovered that he already has memories of being an agent: meaning he actually is an agent with his memory erased. A swat team busts in for some reason and he dispatches them to some beautiful camera camera pans. What follows is ""Kurt Wimmer's 'Salt: dystopian future edition - minus Angelina Jolie"" (surprise surprise, this movie is also written by Wimmer) with Quaid's wife turning out to be a psychopathic killer, his past a complete sham and his grip on that fine line between reality and fantasy slowly slipping. In the background lies a dastardly plot by a rich chancellor involving the poor dissidents of the overcrowded Colony and the leader of an underground resistance.The most striking feature of Total Recall would be the stunning vision of this overcrowded future. Floating buildings to make up for scarce land, a country confused by its melting pot of cultures, cyborg police, hover cars, it is amazing. This is a future that seems very real judging from our current world: Strict class segregation taken to the extreme. The dichotomy in the design between the rich and elite United Federation of Britain and The ramshackle Colony is beautifully rendered thanks to the amazing production design headed by Patrick Tatopoulos (the guy who worked on Independence Day, Starship Troopers and Dark city).A pity that the rest of the movie is fairly typical of modern day chase thrillers. Compared to the original Total Recall film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, this remake has Less twists, a less ambiguous ending and lacks the cynical dark humor that made the original so memorable. Instead of keeping it ambiguous as to whether the events unfolding are real or part of Quaid's implanted fantasy, this remake spoils its own mystery for the audience.Director Len Wiseman brings in all that is good and bad in modern day film making into this movie. He shoots Total Recall with an over reliance on shaky cam and lens flare, almost like a ""Paul Greengrass meets J.J Abrams"". Think Bourne Supremacy with the visual style of the 2009 Star Trek film. The future is epilepsy inducing, we get it; and sometimes this really distracts from the tip top designs.The cast is basically a reunion of mist actors that were in Len Wiseman's Underworld franchise. They do an excellent job with the acting and chemistry but the good actors like Bill Nighly felt under utilised. Only Kate Beckinsale was able to truly shine playing Quaid's wife-turned-assassin. Quaid himself is played by Colin Ferrel and is perhaps the only improvement this remake boasts over the original. Schwarzenegger's Quaid was the quintessential action hero but Ferrel's portrayal of the character had a greater sense of peril: he looks nothing like an action hero and this makes his transformation from everyman to savior of the downtrodden all the more powerful.Whether one finds this a good movie or not depends on whether one can accept the modern trends of science fiction film making. It is the same plot as the original with all the ""1990s"" elements taken out and replaced with ""2012"" elements. Art Aficionados will be impressed by the overall look, style and camera-work showcased here. Those looking for a deep meaningful dive into the nature of human identity or even those looking for clever twists or smart dialogue will be let down. Take away the visuals and it's a rather generic, straight forward modern chase thriller.",Total Recall
122,cat_ranchero,Better than I was led to believe...,7,19 May 2013,"Very heavy on the special effects, which are all very well done by the way, this film looks great. The narrative, although quite well known to me, was told in a unique enough for me to accept it as a new take on the same story. The performances were all very good, particularly Colin Farrell and Kate Beckinsale. I just wish they had made Jessica Biel look a bit more different to Kate Beckinsale; they look too similar, a different hair colour would have helped! On the downside, I did find the premise a little weak and that did kind of spoil it for me. It does look very spectacular though and for those who are fans of the original; yes, there a triple breasted hooker to be found. Worth a look; yes Unless you're a die-hard Arnie fan.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 6.7/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Total Recall
123,ericrnolan,"A quick review of ""Total Recall"" (2012)",8,8 May 2015,"""Total Recall"" (2012) was a fun, slick update of the 1990 classic; I'd give it an 8 out of 10. It can't match the magic of the original (especially with the abandonment of one particular twist near the end), but it was still fun enough. Plus, any fast-paced, CGI-heavy, sci-fi action movie with both Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsdale really is just pure nerd fun.Beckinsdale grows on me. She's a great actress, especially in roles that require her to be powerful or angry, and she does physical stunt-work superbly. She deserves to carry her own franchise, and I mean something better and more mainstream than the ""Underworld"" films.Anyway  I'm pretty sure I have a good answer to this movie's central mystery (as well as that of its predecessor). This is the question of whether or not everything Quaid witnesses is real. (Is he a secret agent, or is this all a fantasy generated by ""Rekall?"")It is real, and here's why. In both movies, the viewer witnesses events that are outside of Quaid's experience. For example, we see the police plotting to capture him and interviewing witnesses. Quaid is nowhere near these events when they occur, and does not see or hear them; therefore they cannot be part of his virtual reality fantasy. Yet you and I see them up on the screen. So they are real, within the story, and not imagined by Quaid. To me, it all seems pretty straightforward.All in all, this was a fun ride. I recommend it.https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",Total Recall
124,HelenMary,yet another reboot that outdoes in show but not in substance,6,2 September 2012,"Of course I'd seen the original Swarzenegger (sp?) version, and this reboot was far superior - mainly because of the special effects and the distinct and obvious reason that a) Colin Farrell is cuter, b) more believable and c) can act - he was well cast in this role and did it well and single handedly saved the film from being a CGI show reel (CGI porn another reviewer called it; I agree). Although and despite really liking him I found it hard to care; the characters weren't deep enough to matter and of course you know the outcome, and the script was bland and unemotional. Obviously you want ""good"" to win but you're ""Meh!"" Kate Beckingsale was great, had obviously used Underworld as training and I wondered whether she forgot she wasn't a vampire sometimes! You'd think that being with Colin Farrell was a pretty big perk of her job, but she seemed pretty hard-done by, which wasn't quite realistic and it made more sense in the original with two characters. The CGI was impressive - especially the city scapes - but as with many CGI-fest blockbusters it was empty entertainment and left me feeling unsatisfied as the film was just one green-screen moment away from the next with no substance. It could have done with the laughs and the cheesy one-liners, I missed them, but it was a nice homage to keep in the triple-breasted hooker. It just went on and on and I found myself bored as the baddies just kept on coming *yawn* in ever more improbable scenarios and I felt that even for a reboot they'd not put anything new on the screen; either taking from the original or stolen from other sci-fi creations. Even Bryan Cranston, usually an acting heavyweight didn't pull it off for me and it did suffer with (non-comedic) hamminess from Kate's smoulder/pout and gung-ho ""someone just called action"" jump-starts to Bill Nighy (Slartiblartfast) seemingly just not giving a toss so it failed on many counts. Biel and Farrell were good together, and there were some nice eye candy moments, the piano scene was really nice, and sci-fi dystopia gems. William Gibson (Johnny Mnemonic) in feeling it made me want to read Neuromancer (Sprawl Trilogy) again... Is it a Philip K Dick story? It was okay, I'm glad I saw and it was a nice thing to do after dinner on a Saturday evening with popcorn, but I won't rave. I think SFX and CGI often are the only thing that save a film, and that's sad for the actors not being able to show their true worth. BTW look out for an extra at the end - not committing to role - after a save the world explosion he just sort of shrugs, and was pretty much the only amusing thing in the film. I did miss the comedy of the original but the SFX in this outclassed the 1990s version. Still don't understand the obsession with reboots - has Hollywood lost all original thought?",Total Recall
125,dvc5159,Total Rehash,5,3 August 2012,"Fond memories of Paul Verhoeven's ""Total Recall"" kept coming back while watching this remake. Arnold Schwarzenegger's screen presence was also an added plus in the 1990 film, as well as the one-liners, Mars and of course heaps of bloody violence. If you've seen the original, then you know how it goes.Len Wiseman's remake of the same name replaces Arnold with Colin Farrell, in his first lead action role in years, while eliminating Mars as the backdrop of the action and replacing it with an overpopulated Earth where transportation from one corner to another occurs, literally, straight through the center of the earth. The rugged subterranean mazes of the red planet is replaced with dizzying skyscrapers and lots of sleek, flying cars, not unlike Philip K. Dick's own ""Blade Runner"" and ""Minority Report"".Farrell can act and is definitely a strong action lead and it shows here, as per the beautiful ladies Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel who both show off brawn over beauty here. Alas, everything is taken way too seriously in this version. I have fonder memories of the Verhoeven/Arnold version where one-liners come post-Arnie-kill. Gone. Certain characters are trimmed or even cut completely from the original. Bryan Cranston's Cohaagen makes me miss Ronny Cox even more, and Bill Nighy's resistance leader doesn't stand out compared to the 1990 film. The best thing the screenwriters did is to combine Sharon Stone's and Michael Ironside's characters from the 1990 film into one, and as portrayed by Kate Beckinsale, she kicks serious ass here.The script is a near complete rehash of the original, save for the setting and the final act of the film. The scene where Bokeem Woodbine's character tries to convince Quaid (Farrell) where he's still in a dream is certainly a standout scene which was very well done. Alas, the majority of the movie is laced with action sequences and sensational special effects (seriously, this is CGI porn) that may get this film a nomination for Best Visual Effects this year. No kidding. While the editing is fast-paced and the cinematography sleek (with a little too much lens flare ala J. J. Abrams), the music score by Harry Gregson- Williams was kind of bland in my opinion. It was just there, does its job, and I didn't care. Where's Marco Beltrami; or even for that matter his legendary mentor, the late, great Jerry Goldsmith when you need them?Director Wiseman has a knack for action sequences (""Underworld"", ""Die Hard 4"") and it shows aplenty here. Sadly the script could've been a whole lot better, but then again, if they had set it on Mars it would've been a shot-for-shot remake with better characters, but still I would've loved to see action on the Red planet once again. The PG-13 rating is justified, and there are indeed little homages to the original, but overall this remake is nothing more than a fast-paced, popcorn munching good waste of time, with some really nice CGI to chew on.However, I'd rather watch the old one again. Arnie has a much stronger screen presence than Farrell and it is much more ambitious and has more heart than this sleeker, newer one.Overall rating: 53%",Total Recall

128,ayoreinf,Another unavoidable comparison,9,12 September 2012,"I must start by answering the question every remake entails - was this remake really needed. Well, not at all, the original is a very good film, that still stands well on its own. It does have a clear moral core and the only reason to remake it was - to get more money for a somewhat diminished effort - the basic story was already at hand and had been a proved box office success. All that said, this is a well done movie that does give a different version of the same story, different enough for a fun of the original to watch this and not feel that every twist and turn of the plot is already familiar, and all that while it does maintain the same moral core. It doesn't matter who you were, what does matter is who you choose to be when it counts. As for the comparison, the dialogue is less snappy, the CGI, as might be expected is way better, and it serves to create a striking world image, that sometimes alludes to another Sci-Fi classic based on another novel of the same author (Philip K Dick), another story dealing at least partially with the issue of what man is. The acting is good, the camera work super, the pace is about as relentless as it was in the first version. So if you saw the original, you don't really have to see this one, but it might be educational to compare notes and see how the different approaches to the same story altered it, and whether you like one approach over the other.",Total Recall
129,Chris_Pandolfi,If Memory Serves....,7,3 August 2012,"I could turn this review of ""Total Recall"" into a debate over which version of the film is better, but unless there are obvious gaps in idea, execution, and quality, I refrain from approaching remakes on that level. Paul Verhoeven's 1990 film of the same name had particular traits that made it entertaining, and the same can be said for the 2012 reboot. I'm most appreciative of the one element common to both films, namely the concept of false memories being surgically implanted in the brain; the question of whether the events in the story are actually happening or are merely a technologically-induced delusion is ultimately never answered, and we're left to wonder the extent to which virtual reality will someday extend. Is it possible that one day we will be unable to distinguish an authentic physical object from a computer simulation? Can it be that memory files will eventually be uploaded into and deleted from the human mind?Loosely drawn from Phillip K. Dick's short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,"" the film differs from its 1990 adaptation in that it doesn't take place on Mars. Instead, it takes place on a future Earth rampant with extreme pollution and severe overpopulation. Following a societal and governmental collapse, the world is now divided into the United Federation of Britain, a domineering superpower, and The Colony, which today we refer to as Australia. In the former, the powerful and elite live in comfort. In the latter, all the workers are cramped into miniscule living quarters, which are restrictively piled into superstructures of staggered concrete and steel. The two are connected via a massive underground tunnel called The Fall, which actually bores through the Earth's core; travelling past it, passengers experience momentary weightlessness as the gravity reverses itself.In The Colony, we meet a lowly factory worker named Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), who has been plagued with nightmares involving a woman and a failed escape attempt. By day, his job is to piece together law enforcement robots. Although he has been happily married to a woman named Lori (Kate Beskinsale) for seven years, his lot in life, coupled with his recent rash of bad dreams, has made him solemn and introspective. His dissatisfaction leads him to Rekall, an organization that specializes in implanting artificial memories of alternate lives in the minds of its clients. Quaid selects a secret agent package, believing himself in such a role. But before the procedure can begin, a Rekall tech (John Cho) analyzes his brain and discovers that he is an actual secret agent. Quaid has no idea where this accusation is coming from, but in due time, he realizes he has the quick reflexes and precise coordination necessary to take down an entire squad of policemen.Panicked, he returns home to Lori, only to discover that she isn't his real wife and that she now wants to have him killed. According to her, his name isn't really Douglas Quaid, and every memory he has of being married to her and working at a factory were all implanted. He doesn't have the chance to fully process this; he has to outrun the lethal Lori and the entire police force. He's eventually approached by a woman named Melina (Jessica Biel), who claims his name is really Hauser and that he's part of an underground resistance movement hell bent on bringing down the ruthless Prime Minister Vilos Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston). Quaid/Hauser follows a trail of clues, most provided by himself, in the hopes of finding out who he really is. He's eventually asked to meet an elusive resistance figure known only as Matthias, thought by most to be nothing more than an urban legend.All this is told with a great deal of style. The production designs by Patrick Tatopoulos and the cinematography by Paul Cameron convey a grittier, filthier, murkier, less streamlined vision of the future. Large sections of The Colony have a distinct urban Asian market influence, and neo-noir scenes are repeatedly set by the addition of rain and wet neon-reflected surfaces. This could, perhaps, be an homage to ""Blade Runner,"" another film adapted from a Phillip K. Dick story. The more space-age designs are reserved for The Fall, a technological monstrosity that stretches the limits of plausibility but doesn't actually break them, and for a highway system in which cars float over and under magnetic fields. Looking at them, one is reminded of ""Minority Report"" – again adapted from a Phillip K. Dick story.True to its cinematic origins, ""Total Recall"" is also a pulse-pounding action thriller and a dazzling special effects extravaganza. Both are utilized in ways that set the film apart from the 1990 version. The violence, for example, is toned down to a level in which escapism is at last possible; it has shootouts yet doesn't become a shoot-'em-up, if you get my meaning. Admittedly, one of my issues with Verhoeven's film was the gratuitous gore, which didn't serve a purpose any higher than that of sickening spectacle. All the actors prove themselves adept at handling the stunt work. As for the performances, all I know is that, no matter what movie he's in, Colin Farrell is an infinitely better actor than Arnold Schwarzenegger. This time around, there's more at stake than a bodybuilder landing the lead role in a sci-fi movie – we can actually invest emotionally in a man who has had his memory erased.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Total Recall
130,jb_campo,Average reboot. KateB kicks butt.,6,6 February 2016,"This is an average reboot of the Schwarzenegger movie from the 1990s. Colin Farrell ably portrays Quaid, who lives in the Colony as a simple worker who commutes via The Fall to his job in the United British Federation. He assembles robot police, day in and day out. He lives with his wife, a police type played by Kate Beckinsdale. However, he's haunted by the same dream that keeps recurring, where he's being hunted down, but he's with another woman - not his wife. He can't shake the dream.One night he ventures into this Rekall shop that can supply him with artificial experiences. One catch, you can't experience something you already are. When he has the idea of being a secret agent, he laughs about ha ha, I'm not a secret agent so no problem here. Or is there?All hell breaks loose, lots of people get killed - and the chase begins.Kate Beckinsdale is stunning, I'd say Terminator-esque in her non-stop determination to reign in her husband Quaid. She's like the energizer bunny going on and on in kick-ass non-stop action. She's easily the best part of the movie. Jessica Biel delivers an OK performance as a rebel leader, and with Farrell, they exhibit OK energy. But it's just average.The chase scenes get a little tiring, though innovative for sure with a magnetic car chase. And you just keep wondering why the cops don't just kill Quaid when they have the chance, until you near the end. Some of the scenes are gratuitous and unnecessary. The movie could have certainly been tightened up to ratchet up the drama by a much better editing job. The cinematography was pretty good, and depicted the type of future that was a good backdrop for this type of movie.All told, this was a solid B-grade movie with decent action, OK plot, and great performance from Kate B.

131,stormhawk2021,Rekalled,1,21 January 2019,"I finally saw this movie, and am a little disappointed. Having seen the 1990 version of this movie, I knew that there would be changes (a reboot) to the original in this outing, and figured that I would give this movie the benefit of being able to stand on it's own.To start, the entire setting of the movie seems off, almost as though the director - Len Wiseman - decided to mesh Blade Runner, Minority Report with the video game Mass Effect. In fact, the synthetic security force is a complete rip-off from the video game, to name only one. It's hard to write this review without picking the movie apart, and the stigma of the first movie will always be there as a critique because this movie modelled itself completely after it. It's not really a complete reboot, but it's as though someone with a better budget and technology decided to make a visually stunning film with the story of Total Recall kind of spliced into it. Things, like the three breasted woman or the fat-woman disguise, made a cameo in this film, but they were very out of place.You can forget about getting your ass to Mars because this version is set solely on Earth, a dystopian and post-chemical warfare future where there are only two areas of the world left inhabited by humans: the United Federation (Great Britain) and the Colony (Australia), connected with a tunnel which allows fast travel in a giant vehicle that is dropped down the shaft, to emerge at the other side.There was a great suspension of reality in several parts of the film, but I guess in the future, people crash through windows, survive gunshot wounds without treatment, and climb ladders on trains going 500 mph through the Earth's core everyday. At times, the fight scenes and the constant chase scenes can become very tedious and boring, and the story appears to fall on the back burner to move these scenes along.There were very few memorable characters in this reboot, unlike the original movie which had more acting and less scowling from the actors and actresses; in fact, I had a hard time keeping up with Jessica Biel's and Kate Beckinsale's characters because they looked similar to each other, and their characters weren't exactly fleshed out very well. Having seen it, I can't recommend this movie to anyone just yet. I admit that I've watched it once, and that sometimes a different frame of mind may change one's interest in watching a movie. But this movie seems to lack something that you can't really put your finger on, and the design choices, once you've seen them elsewhere, are distracting and dislikeable. Do yourself a favor and watch the 1990 version first, if you haven't, then watch in YouTube Mass Effect 2's videos after watching Blade Runner before you watch this movie, and you'll see what I mean.PD: If some of the commenters found the train that transports the protagonist from the UK to Australia interesting, go see ""Crocodile Dundee"" or ""Finding Nemo"", films that revalue Australians.",Total Recall

It's not that the film is bad, it just hasn't got the good stuff. Schwarzie's character had much more charisma and his 2 different persona were more clearly separated, in Farrell's case they just seem the same bland dude.

136,ghost_dog86,I almost fell asleep.,2,10 August 2012,"Is showing a topless woman with three breasts still considered nudity? Directed by Len Wiseman, who seems to have an unhealthy fixation with lens flares, and starring Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel and Bryan Cranston, ""Total Recall"" (a substantially worse remake of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger/Paul Verhoeven action adventure) tells the story of a seemingly depressed factory worker named Douglas Quaid. After one boring night in bed with his wife played by Kate Beckinsale (that was supposed to be a joke) Quaid decides to seek out this company called Rekall, which implants a client with fake memories of any fantasy they desire. For some reason he chooses the memory of a secret agent, and soon after Quaid begins to suspect that he really might have been a secret agent in the past. He then spends the rest of the film attempting to learn the truth about a dark past he may or may not have had and also discover the truth about Rekall, when the simple truth about ""Total Recall"" is that there is nothing about this film which is the least bit impressive, action packed or even worth paying to see.""Total Recall"" sees a future dystopia where the world is all but uninhabitable for some reason, except for England (now called ""The United Federation of Britain) and Australia (now referred to as ""The Colony""). These two factions are fighting for power, with the government of The United Federation of Britain as the oppressors and The Colony as the rebels struggling for equality. As you can tell, this new storyline is pretty different than the original, not to mention there is no extreme violence (this one is PG-13) no memorably cornball one-liners (this one stars Colin Farrell instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger) and the Mars storyline is all but discarded. And while this still sounds like a rather interesting Sci-Fi premise on its own, with the plethora of different paths the filmmakers could have taken, they chose a story arch that we have all seen a thousand times before and depict it in the most lackluster way possible. Also, with lack of mind-blowing CGI effects, and with a script itself that was is so devastatingly bland and shrug inducing, it will quickly becomes obvious that while the actors on screen (all of which are fine in their roles) are attempting to pull ""Total Recall"" from mediocrity, Wiseman and his writers are content with aiming vastly below audience expectations. Don't get me wrong, there are loads of action sequences, loads of visual effects, and loads of things blowing up, BUT every one of these aspects is handled with such flippancy (there is never any sense of danger or thought that Quaid may not survive) that the mind-numbing blandness becomes palpable, resulting in audiences checking their watches twenty minutes in.The Problem with Remaking Arnold Schwarzenegger Classics: Since Arnold was such a cartoonish (and larger than life) character in and of himself, and there is no real action star of today (maybe The Rock) that can hold the same screen presence while delivering his lines with a knowingly cornball voracity, filmmakers wishing to remake an Arnold classic are time and time again plagued by the ""lack-of-Schwarzenegger"" Syndrome. This really has nothing to do with the films subject matter, but more so the lack of a lead that can give a mediocre film such as the original ""Conan the Barbarian"" or ""Predator"" that huge protagonist boost, which allows the film to be so memorable and quotable. Let's face it, the original ""Conan the Barbarian"" without Arnold Schwarzenegger would have been half the film that it was. Another issue that goes hand and hand with Arnold remakes is without a lead that can deliver the comic book one liners, the script writers are forced to structure the remake in a darker and all together more serious fashion, draining all (or most) of the fun out of experience. I mean, the original ""Total Recall"" was based on a very intriguing Science Fiction plot, but Arnold's laughably distinctive (and very serious) Austrian delivery is what gave the script life (sending the entire film over the top). In this version of ""Total Recall"", writers Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback downgrade the film by creating a super serious atmosphere and then haphazardly inserting an asinine one-liner wherever they may see fit. And I'm sorry, these one-liners in particular sound utterly ridiculous coming out of the mouths of Farrell and Beckinsale.Final Thought: This remake of ""Total Recall"" is so underwhelming and forgettable, that other than some watchable A-list acting, the entire thing feels like a SyFy Channel made for T.V. movie (and some may enjoy that). This is a movie whose filmmakers seemed to be content with creating a middle of the road action film. The problem with that is that Wiseman, Wimmer and Bomback have failed to hit that middle of the road mark entirely, giving audiences this half-assed remake that is nothing more than a monumental bore-fest.

Also, Kate Beckinsale is absolutely amazing. This movie is worth watching just for her. I like how her character was more important in this film. Sharon Stone's version was a super-villain that had a supremely anti-climactic death. That is not the case here.

It is really made up of a series of chase scenes with not much else in between. A friend described the movie as unrelenting and that is a good description.Set in a grim future Colin Farrell plays a factory worker who keeps having dreams where he is a secret agent. His wife, played by Kate Beckinsale, assures him not to worry but he feels that something is missing from his life so he goes for a session of ""Rekall"", where artificially created ""memories"" of his choice will be implanted in his brain. This is where the chase scenes start to kick in and the movie hurtles along to the conclusion.Kate Beckinsale does seem to relish her dual role but of the other actors Farrell and Jessica Biel aren't stretched at all. Bryan Cranston is wasted as a pantomime villain and Bill Nighy has a bizarre five-minute role in which he has to utter some dreadful dialogue.My memory of the original movie is quite vague (maybe I should get some Rekall myself!) but I certainly remember it being a lot more fun than this.",Total Recall
140,virindra,Don't remake if it's not going to be better.,5,17 August 2012,"First of all, I am a huge fan of the original Total Recall movie, so I was curious about the remake. In the first part of the review I am going to tell my point of view about the movie at itself and in the second part I will compare it to the original movie. I have seen the making of, of this movie. It wasn't that great. Meline and Loire very look much alike. They are both brunettes. Acting is flat, characters aren't coming out very much. Robots are awesome, and even the vehicles. There were a lot of flaws in the movie, like the movie takes place on earth, when will there be women with three boobies? Melina never told Douglas that her name was Melina, so when he got captured by Cohaagen, how did he know her name? Movie is boring. The action scenes are very slow, so the fighting scenes are not very amusing or exciting.There were some blinks to the original movie. The original movie was over the top, what suited more to this kind of movie. The original movie was not boring and really got into the characters of the people. When I saw the original movie, I wanted to see it again and again. I don't have the same feeling with this remake. I liked the woman-helmet Schwarzenegger was wearing when he got to Mars. In this movie Douglas is wearing a mask to, but it's not that exciting as the original mask. So that really bothers me. If one is going to make a remake, be sure it is better and more exciting than the first one. Like, where was Kuato? After 22 years you should think they would make a better remake. But to be honest, this movie proves that Paul Verhoeven really made a fantastic movie, 22 years ago, less cgi and it worked out better.",Total Recall
141,Tcarts76,"As a remake goes, it's pretty good",8,1 November 2012,"Hollywood obviously has such a lack of originality that almost all movies coming out these days are remakes of older movies, or are Americanized versions of foreign movies, or movie versions of video games and comic books. ""Total Recall,"" isn't any different but it is entertaining.So we already know most of the story, In a futuristic world, this time where most of the earth was destroyed through chemical weapons, an average joe ( Colin Farrell) working class guy wants to take a vacation. He decides to do so with the help of a new technology fad which is known as Total Rekall (How original, they changed the spelling. note the sarcasm). The idea is that a fantasy/memory is created and implanted in your brain so that you have a complete memory of a dream vacation without having to actually go on one and miss time at work. The whole thing goes wrong, plunging the average joe into a life and death adventure involving another woman (Jessica Biel) ,other than his wife (Kate Beckinsale), and a little political intrigue.The Good: The acting was OK, Colin Farrell is definitely a better actor than Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Kate Beckingsale is just hot as always. Though I am still trying to figure out why anyone really casts Jessica Biel for anything because she really only has one or 2 plastic expressions. The CGI was surprisingly good. If you have read my reviews I am usually not real kind to CGI because when I want to see a grown up movie I don't want to watch cartoon (i.e. Star Wars episodes I, II, III). There was a plethora of CGI and some scenes where it may have been overused but overall not too cartoony to bother me.It does stick to the original, but adds in a lot of stuff that makes it different than the first, I can't really say it was better or worse in this respect, than the original, but it is nice to see a remake that sticks to the original story, yet adds some new ideas and material as well, unlike the totally unnecessary remake, ""The Amazing Spiderman,"" or the almost word for word, scene for scene remake of, ""Footloose.""The Bad: First, Jessica Biel is in it, unless ""Seventh Heaven,"" is coming back she needs to stay out of big budget movies, and why would this guy ever be involved with Jessica Biel when married to Kate Beckinsale? really? Oh well, we all have different tastes.Also, This IS a remake, so a lot of fans of the original are going to be haters. One of the biggest problems with a remake is the fact that it is just that. You go into it already knowing the story, therefore the plot twists are already known as well, although the end to this one may surprise you as you may be waiting for something else. I realize I am getting older and I might sound funny for saying this, but I really didn't feel the original was old enough to really forget and make a remake warranted. I mean ,""The Running man"" (1987) was an entertaining movie too, but instead of remaking that one we have gotten more original takes on the same story with ""Gamer"" (2009) and ""Death Race"" (2008). So my problems have less to do with this particular movie and more to do with a Hollywood who either is too cheap to hire talented writers, or just completely lacks any imagination. All in all, I give this one an 8 which is pretty high for my criticisms, but hey, it was entertaining and that's what it was supposed to be. Visually its pretty good. The acting is around what you would expect from this type of movie. It also stayed close enough to the original to be recognizable, yet did come up with some new stuff to differentiate it from the original. Not too bad!Like my reviews? Hate em?

142,rgblakey,Find out what is real and what is Total Recall,5,2 August 2012,"With all the remakes coming along these days none of them seemed more unnecessary as Total Recall. The 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger action film, while campy still holds up well as one of not just his best, but a great sci-fi film. When the trailer for the new version of the film debuted it gave the hope of delivering something kind of cool, but with a PG-13 rating will it be able deliver the much needed action and sci-fi originality to do it justice or will it be one you wish was just a memory? Total Recall follows Douglas Quaid who is tired of his frustrating life and decides to visit Rekall, a company that can turn your dreams into reality. When things go wrong, Quaid finds himself on the run for his life not knowing what's real and what's Rekall. While this wasn't a needed remake it turned out to be pretty fun. This is actually more of a reimagining than a remake as the premise is almost identical, but some of the story elements are changed. The film felt like a mesh between Minority Report and Blade Runner, with the Total Recall premise thrown in and works well. The cast do a great job delivering on the action, but they are a bit lacking on the development. The story jumps right in with little to now set up, which on some level works, but does leave a bit of it unresolved. Len Wiseman does a great job creating a cool sci-fi universe that is needed to make this film work. This may not have all the bloody action delivered in the original, but this is still a non-stop thrill ride that works on every level from the hover car chases to anti-gravity shoot outs to some extremely well-executed fight scenes. Farrell, while not as big as Arnold, did manage to deliver just as much character with a little bit more acting ability and still made sure to jack up muscle wise too. Beckinsale took a page out of her Underworld book and kicked some major ass, but this time got to bring out a bit of a devilish side. Beil does a great job with her character and the action as well, but didn't really get a chance to establish anything about her. The always great Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy do fine with what they have, but are highly underused. This is a movie that should be watched more for the action than anything else and it delivers as the majority of the film is non-stop action, just slowing down enough to deliver some aspect of a story.Most will be upset about the lack of Mars in this version, but they still created an interestingly clever world to work in. This is a solid remake/reimagining of a film that just didn't need it, but still managed to work. Sadly, most will instantly hate this film comparing it to the original and never give it the chance it deserves. For those wondering if the key scene from the original is still in-tact with a PG-13 rating, rest assured you will not only get the three boobed hooker, this one is much hotter and does show the goods.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",Total Recall
143,TheMovieMark,"Gunfights, shoot outs, and eye candy, oh my!",7,3 August 2012,"Considering that much of my youth was invested in films starring Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, and Arnold Schwarzeneggar, I'm surprised at myself that I've never seen Arnie's original Total Recall, nor have I read the Philip K. Dick short story (We Can Remember it for You Wholesale) that both films are based on. Therefore, I have no frame of reference other than this film itself. That's good for the sake of this review because you're getting a completely unbiased perspective. However, if you're a fan of the original and you want to know how this stacks up then I can't help you.What I can help you with is letting you know that Total Recallsuccessfully follows the formula of a typical popcorn-munchin' Summer blockbuster. The film finds its action comfort zone early and delivers two hours of non-stop fist fights, shoot outs, chase scenes (both on foot and in futuristic landspeeders), and explosions all amidst Quaid's quest to find out who he is and what he's supposed to do. That's pretty much it. It's fast and it's loud. You've got Colin Farrell duking it out with Kate Beckinsale, Kate trading kicks and punches with Jessica Biel, and Colin wrapping up the festivities with a Bryan Cranston smackdown. All the bases are covered here.Oh, and of course there's the expected eye candy. I don't think it's too hard to figure out how the production meetings went down:""All right, so guys are gonna want to see Kate and Jessica beat each other up. Got that covered. But we have to convince their girlfriends to come with them. Make sure Colin understands there will be an extended shirtless scene. Oh, and tell him to start practicing his method of flexing while drinking coffee.""The upside is this is a film that brings to surface my dormant teenage movie preferences. Sometimes cool stunts, well-choreographed fights, and lots of things that go boom are enough to satisfy me, and in that regard Total Recall entertains. It's a 2-hour escape from reality that never slows down long enough to be boring. You can argue that some of the action sequences are repetitive or that it's stuff that you've seen before, and I won't argue back. My only response is, ""Yeah, maybe, but cotton candy is cotton candy and I enjoy it every time I eat it."" Total Recall KateNow the downside is that the film never steps out of its comfort zone. The story was fresh to me, and thus kept my interest, but I couldn't help but feel that the plot could've gone deeper. There's some suspense, but mostly the story is a side item that accompanies the action.As for the acting, Colin obviously doesn't fill Arnold's frame, but that's not what the role calls for. He's believable enough, but the real standout is Ms. Beckinsale. This is her first role as a villain, and it's obvious that she's fully enjoying it. I've always liked Kate in action roles, and she plays this with just the right combination of menace, sass, and sizzle. And all of my readers who love Mr. Cranston will be happy to know that he chews the scenery in his limited screen time as if it's a 3-day old steak.If you're looking for a movie experience that's completely original and cutting edge then you're likely to be disappointed. But if you can suspend your disbelief and accept the movie for what it is then you'll enjoy a couple of hours of action-packed sci-fi entertainment. At least I did.",Total Recall

145,RichardSRussell-1,"Not Really a Remake, and That's Both Good and Bad",5,3 August 2012,"Total Recall (1:58, PG-13) — 5 — SF, biggie, remake, OSIT cynicsI'm usually not fond of remakes. The few exceptions are when the original film totally blew a good story possibility, and the story's still worth doing right. That doesn't happen very often. Usually remakes are of successful films that Hollywood thinks can be milked for more money by throwing in contemporary actors and shinier CGI, but without having to employ creativity or brainpower on a new script, and to those my usual reaction is ""Why bother? We can always get the original on DVD.""This both is and isn't a concern with the 2012 version of Total Recall. Yes, you do get the fresher faces and shinier CGI to try to extract new bux from a fresh audience. But no, it's not really the same story, and I actually like this STORY better than the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle. For one thing, the science is more credibly late 21st Century, with a transit tube called The Fall running thru the Earth, relying on the cheap ""power"" of gravitational attraction to zip giant commuter trains between London and Australia (the only 2 places on the planet still functioning well after a global chemical war). This is theoretically possible if the engineering problems of temperature and pressure down deep in the Earth's interior can be solved, but 80-90 years down the road, that's not unreasonable. Some of the other tech — such as the mag-lev cars and hand-implanted phones — is ingenious and credible as well, unlike the train wreck that was Prometheus earlier this year.And there's the same central theme of a protagonist not being sure who he really is, since his memories are completely untrustworthy. The 1990 movie did a better job of exploring this theme, and Arnold was actually more convincingly human in his bewilderment over what was happening to him than Colin Farrell is here.The sad thing here is that most of the film's 1:58 running time is devoted to chases, crashes, and gunfights. They are spectacularly well staged, and mucho credit goes to production designer Patrick Tatopoulos for creating a convincing environment. But I was hoping for more intellectual heft, as well as greater credibility for the scenarios that ""factory worker"" Douglas Quaid has to go thru. Since he starts out in the brain-diddling chair in the Rekall parlor, being assured that his soon-to-be-your-own recollection of being a secret agent will be the best memory he's ever had, his subsequent inhuman physical resiliency and stamina — to say nothing of the unlikelihood of the leader of the free world personally leading a SWAT assault on a terrorist HQ, followed by being the 1st guy off the ship of an invading army — should have made him question ""Wait a minute. This HAS to be fake. Nobody can possibly be this good or this lucky."" I know that's what I was thinking for at least half the movie. But he never does.Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Beil are the only other actors with meaty roles, which generally involve running, punching, kicking, shooting, and reckless driving. They sure do look good doing it, tho.There was potential here, but most of it was thrown away for cheap thrills, and not even R-rated thrills like the earlier one. Too bad.",Total Recall

147,helmutty,Entertaining for someone who've not watched the original,8,3 August 2012,"I know that this is a remake of the original movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger or a new adaptation of the novel. Either way, I do not know the detail of the plot. So i will base on my review without any knowledge of the original. Total Recall is a fast-paced action-packed action thriller directed by Len Wiseman who's famous for Die Hard 4 and Underworld. This together with his other action movies proves that Len can handle big exciting action scenes. But to tell the truth, if this hadn't had the exciting action, the movie would not be exactly worth watching. The many exciting action scenes are the one that hold one's interest as the story is there as a background to these scenes.The story: When I read the summary for this, I thought it could have been a mind-bending movie. The tag-line, ""What's real?"" seems promising. I got a little disappointed when I saw that this movie does not exactly make use of the promising summary and the tag-line. Instead it is pretty straight-forward movie with little twists. It is hold up by the exciting action scenes. Luckily not all is lost, Len can create some thrilling and exciting action scenes that are just worth watching alone. The action scenes range from chases to fight scenes. Although the story did not maximize its potentially great idea, the movie is a breeze to watch with its fast-paced plot and great action. Special effects are good too. Acting is alright. I definitely know you can't compare Arnold and Collin but I think Collin did a fine job. Kate and Jessica are also alright. Music is okay, the getting-tiring usual electronic music heard in almost all of the futuristic movie.Overall: It is worth a watch for those who have not seen the original like me. I doubt this will be a big hit but hopefully it doesn't end up like John Carter or Battleship. Now, I am seeing if I can catch the original to see what the big fuss is all about.",Total Recall

Now its not the original, but it is a stunning take on the story, with better action, sleeker visuals, and a better sense of awe and dystopia.The film creates a brilliant world, the likes of which we haven't seen in a dystopia since Blade Runner, and shares several similarities in aesthetic to the equally great Blade Runner 2049.The story is good, the world building is immense, this is truly unmissable- Science Fiction.",Total Recall
149,thekyles99,Watch the Verhoeven version,3,2 December 2012,If you haven't seen Total Recall yet 2012 or the 1990 version then most definitely go with director Paul Verhoeven's original starring Arnold Schwartznegger as the 2012 version is a very poor carbon coby with a few changes that were not made for the better. I myself am incredibly leery on watching reboots of films and Total Recall is the main reason as to why. The updated storyline is crap with the evil Cohagen this time round wanting to issue a force of his created robots on what's left of the 21st century inhabitants on the two colonies left in the world titled the UFB (United federation of Britain) and the colony (Australia) (Stupid idea) . Yep no trip to Mars this time round folks (or like Arnie likes to call it Maaas) In this one director Len Wiseman still used a majority of the same names used in the 1990 version however took a lot of liberties with the story and not necessarily good ones either.Kudos to both Farrell and Beckinsale for hiding both of their accents but that's all i can congratulate in this film.

150,jdring2007,"a reimagining, not a remake, and a laughable one at that; devoid of likable characters, a CGI fest of derivative writing",5,7 November 2021,"While not a massive fan of the original, I'm familiar with it and respect its creativity. Perhaps the biggest crime of this ""reimagining"" (I refuse to accept it as a remake, due to all the massive changes) is the title. It should've been called ""Rekall,"" given that's how it's spelled in the movie. However, it would've still been a 5 from me. Maybe a low 6. Some of the action scenes are good, at best; CGI laden and a headache to watch for longer than a few minutes, such as the prolonged highway scene. I really enjoy Colin Farrell but not enough to solely carry a movie and that's what you get here. His character was the only one that had some variety to it, although that's not saying much since he plays a reluctant or confused character for 80% of the movie. Jessica Biel, I love, but she's just a mirrored image of Colin's. I also love Kate Beckinsale but she was a bore in this, and I wish her character had died as early as she did in the original. Given that she's the wife of the director, not surprised. The quips are one of the worst parts about the script, never clever and often repetitive.

153,vailsy,severely lacking in a number of areas,5,31 March 2013,"I'm always prepared to give a movie a chance.. I did not think the original Total Recall was a perfect movie, it was far from Arnie's best work (see Predator and Terminator for that) but I do remember that it had a strong and clear creative style, a really great score and beautiful martian imaginary, when I watched it I felt like I was some place else In this movie I didn't get that, the score is extremely generic sounding and underwhelming, the world seems very claustrophobic and apart from one or two wide shots we don't really get to see it, nor hear it.. the ambiance is practically non existent. Visually they go for an Asian futuristic Blade Runner blend, but it comes nowhere even close. Unlike Blade Runner in most scenes we have ambient things going on in the background that we do not hear at all So the focus is more on the characters in this remake than the world which they inhabit.. unfortunately this draws attention to some very bland performances and quite poor acting. I always like watching Farrel but even he feels restrained here, Beckinsale is 100% rubbish as usual.. her accent meandering from something resembling American to posh British, she has no expression and is just a bore to watch same as always. I've seen video game characters with better acting skills (eg. Miranda or Jack, Mass Effect 2). No one else really stood out to me I love sci-fi so if this truly were a good movie I would know about it, but it just isn't. The best sci-fi movie of 2012 without a doubt was Dredd so do yourself a favour and watch that instead, it's budget was one quarter of Total Recall and it has all the things this movie lacks in spades",Total Recall
154,achyutaghosh,Total Recall review- Enjoyable popcorn actioner.,7,6 August 2012,"Recent remakes have often raked enough moolah but have been spectacular failures as far as memorability is concerned, more so because they have always been based on movies that have a special place in our hearts- and giving them just a digital makeover complete with today's ubiquitous PG13 action are always surefire ways of enhancing recall for the original. Pun was necessary here, as the original 1990's Total Recall was one of the best sci-fi movies ever- mind bending action sequences, hairpin plot twists, the woman with three who redefined male fantasies, and other assorted R-rated fare. It was one of the last movies to use miniature effects for which it got an Oscar- It even gave Arnold a non- robot role and made him act, and for that i gift it 10 additional ones.The 2012 version tries to do something different- its still based on Philip K Dick's short story 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"", which asks if a supposed nobody acquires the memory of being an actual somebody, how do they know what is real- but adds some plot twists of its own. Gone is the mutant and Mars angle- Its completely set in earth 2084, as a result of massive chemical fallout from World War 3, there are only two habitable places left in the world- the United federation of Britain (no prizes for guessing where it is), and The Colony (no prizes for guessing where this is too). Both the regions need each other to survive, and every day citizens travel between the two via ""The Fall""- a massive gravity elevator that travels through the earth's core to reach the other side in 17 minutes. Factory worker Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) has been having recurring nightmares about a violent past and is bored with his existence in general, bombshell of a wife notwithstanding. To spice up his life, he goes to visit Rekall, a firm which specializes in memory implants. A secret agent implant is what he wishes for, and what happens next could be either Quaid's post implant paranoia and delusion, or a spectacular quest to save the Colony from its would be occupier, Cohagen (Bryan Cranston).The movie is essentially a two hour chase- Quaid being pursued with Terminator-like ferociousness by his wife till yesterday, Lori( Kate Beckinsale). The action literally shifts from one set piece to the other, as bit by bit, Quaid recovers his memory. Comparisons with the far superior Veerohoven classic aside, this is a fairly entertaining, serviceable sci-fi thriller. The pace is dizzying, the action non-stop, and the attention to detail is fantastic. I loved the magnetic car chase sequences, the gravity shift visualization and the elevator shaft jumpathon. Director Len Wiseman wisely keeps things fast from start to finish with strategic inspiration from various other sci-fi classics- The Colony's multiracial crowded streets and constant rain seem right out of Blade Runner, the robot invasion army looks straight out of I, Robot, and the train ride through earth looks like from The Core. And the three main actors- Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel look awesome dunking it out in the action sequences- they are afterall comic book/video game superheroes who can singlehandedly change the fate of the world, and you name it all- robots, flying cars, crashing through roofs, 100 feet drops.nothing can leave more than a few strategic scars.On the flip side, though high on energy, it lacks pizazz, and will go down as just another actioner- obvious culprit being the intent to get a PG13 rating to appeal to a wider audience. So not too much gore, or sadism on display here - the original was a no holds barred unrated sci fi classic that made stars out of Arnold, Sharon Stone, and Michael J Ironside by daring to be provocative in its presentation, this one will again just be another flick in the resume of its stars. Colin Farrell looks good throughout, matches the continuously puzzled look that Arnold Schwarzenegger perfected in the original and is certainly a better actor here, but when Arnold jumped through walls, you would expect him to get up, and when he clobbered a robot, you would expect the robot to stay down. When Colin Farrell does all that, you kind of question physics. Sharon Stone had a bit role in the original but there was enough of her on ""display"" to guarantee future stardom. Kate Beckinsale is a hell- hound who doesn't know when to give up, an icy amalgamation of Stone's and Ironside's character from the original, playing Underworld's Selena here while Jessica Biel is Kate's angelic version who matches her every kick with one of her own. Total Recall is based on an intriguing idea- it is a fairly capable sci- fi thriller in its own right, its fast, will appeal to today's generation, has a bit of the original's spirit and has enough inspiration to make it a fun, popcorn flick. It is not memorable stuff like the original, but so long you go in with a mindset to have a good time, there are enough twists and turns to ensure you will have one. Pity though, for all the high tech on display, it all ends with a knife fight :)",Total Recall
155,mgruebel,Total Remake,5,1 January 2016,"I'm sure dozens of the other reviewers came up with the same clever title for their review. But this is only fitting for this film.Paul Verhoeven's original is a masterpiece of deft plotting, one-liners, violence, and physical special effects (one of the last non-CGI films). The remake does not transcend it in any of these or in other dimensions.You can't really have Hauser despatch his fake wife with ""Consider this a divorce"" again, can you?On an Earth with a habitat problem, does it really make sense to build a building, then have a gap, then another building bridged above it. Just fill in that space by putting a single skyscraper there. The ""brutal realism"" architecture that Verhoeven picked in Mexico City for his backdrops seemed more real.A robot arm cut-off by an elevator is not quite the same as a bad guy that we got to know pretty well being double-amputated by an elevator, is it?A narrow shaft running a train through the Earth, so easy to disable even with black-powder technology available Down Under is intended to carry an invasion force from Britain! Hardly as magnificent as an alien terraforming device left on Mars aeons ago, is it?A holographic head malfunctioning in CGI is not quite the same as a fake ""fat lady head"" popping open and revealing Arnold Schwarzenegger, is it?Speaking of the ""fat lady head"": the remake is full of annoying and weak references to the original, like the cut off robot arm. Why are they there? If a new generation of youngsters is going to see the new film, they won't even know what the homage refers to. If an old-timer who knows the original sees these references, they won't be any more pleased.My main reason for displeasure is that the plot substitutes solid plot points from the original with weaker ones just to avoid completely copying the original. For example, in the original ""psychiatrist tries to talk down Hauser"" scene the sweat trickles down the right forehead, and Hauser's decision makes sense. Here, it seems like a wild guess. Likewise, in the original Cohaagen was going to restore Hauser to his original state as he and Hauser had planned, not restore him to a ""pre-turned-rebel"" backup. The latter of course leaves Hauser no choice but to try and flee, as opposed to showing how the man evolved away from what he once was.To a large extent, the film devolves into chase-action. There was plenty of it in the original, but somehow one felt that Hauser was really looking for himself. The CGI sets are nice, the acting is OK, the plot not completely bad, being copied off a Phil Dick story, so 5/10.",Total Recall

Replacing most of the people killed in the movie with robots, because that way blood can be avoided really p*ssed me off. Especially when they copied the scene where Richters arms are cut off and he fails to his death and replaced him with a damn robot.The story is boring and besides from the always gorgeous and always incredibly sexy Kate Beckinsale who is a convincing villain (who is always welcome to kick my ass :))the other villains are pathetic. Especially Cohaagen which made me miss Ronny Coxes Cohaagen.I miss Mars, I miss the mutants (aside from the three-breasted hooker) but most of all I miss the humor, the one-liners and the graphic violence.For god sake, when people get shot, they bleed.

I am sick of greedy producers wanting kids to see movies, that aren't suppose to be for kids just so the greedy producers can make more money.There ought to be a law against PG13 and Steven Spielberg should be forced to publicly apologizing for ever inventing that rating in the first place.This movie takes itself way way way too seriously. Especially with all the new-age philosophical bull-sh*t about how we all want to know who we truly are. Bla blah blah, shut up!!

Colin Farrell is terrific - actually, everyone in it is terrific. I just had to get past constantly comparing it to the original. The original was a movie for its times.

What the crap is wrong with you? This movie is a rehash or reboot. It means that. Not remake. There is a difference between rehash and reboot from remake.Same thing happens to other movies like. Friday the 13th 2009. That is a reboot, but the movie got trashed, and called a remake instead and trashed for it. Same thing going on here. I am for one that likes change. I rather see different things in a movie, than the same ship different day crap that is like some people in these reviews are expecting.You say its not original. That is mostly true, but it was way more enjoyable than more than 3/4 of the movies that were out within the 10 month time of this movie. Chick flicks I never go see. Drama is for family, and family don't go to movies. Friends never say anything about going to theaters.So I basically go on my own to see movies. I still think there is just way too much picky people here. I feel sorry for the Directors. It is way too hard to please you picky people. There is more than just Friday the 13th 2009 movie that has been trashed for no reason at all. Every time I read stupid trashed reviews makes me want to do the opposite of what they say.Most of the time the reviewer is just very much over exaggerating on what the movie is really doing. Sounds like someone to some extra medication before entering the theater or been drinking a lot of alcohol. I go for the enjoyment of relieving myself from normal life. You people sound like you go for the complaining.Just noticed that there is a blacklist for people that spoil the movie and don't mark it as spoiler. I think there should be an automatic rate this movie over that. There are so many people that say it should be a rating that is not there to be a rating. Never seen them fix that. The rating system on here sucks.There are so many movies here that are rated so low or too high, because no one uses the rating, when making a review. So it should be mandatory to select a rating. If no one rates, and said this in many reviews of other movies. That the no rating just makes the movie rated higher. If you don't like the movie rate it, same as if it was great.The dang thing is right there above where you are typing, about 1 and 1/2 to 2 inches above. Easy to see. I have not been writing too many reviews lately, because of the crap you read here on this database. Glad I watched this movie at home, and not have to listen to people give this movie crap for no reason in the theater.I enjoyed this movie. I will see it again, even if it isn't original, it was better than a lot out there.",Total Recall
159,plasticanimalz,"Ugh, What a Bummer",5,3 August 2012,"To put it simply, Rebel Wilson from 'Bridesmaids' exited the movie in front of me and she looked bummed, which is exactly how I felt. I had my doubts but was at least hoping this movie would be cool and it wasn't. Even two hot chicks couldn't save this movie. The sad thing is I think they were both hired to make up for Colin Ferrel's lack of charisma or stage presence. I've only ever liked him in two things: a guest spot on 'Scrubs' and 'Fright Night.'He is just so boring, soulless and small, and can not fill Arnold's shoes. Not even one of them.I vaguely remember the original 'Total Recall' but I know I really liked it and it was fun. This was slow and kind of pointless. Not to mention, I didn't care about anyone. The only redeeming thing this movie had was that it looked amazing. The production was fantastic and it's a real shame to waste all that nice eye candy with a boring story where everyone is just running around from scene to scene with no real sense of urgency or explanation. I mean, they had urgency, but the audience couldn't feel it 'cause it was all just so cobbled together. And I don't know if this was more true to the book which is why they changed the Mars aspect, but why change the part of a film that was one of the coolest things about it? Raise your hands, who wants to go to Mars? Raise your hands, who wants to go to New Great Britain? Yeah, that's what I thought. And don't get me wrong, I love Jessica Biel and she was half the reason I was going (Kate was the other half). But, you mean to tell me this model-perfect looking girl is from the rebel forces of the Colony? I don't think so. Kate is at least believable to be some special agent cop from New Great Britain. The least they could have done is put some grime on Jessica's face to make it halfway convincing.I would say the best thing about the film is its '70s style sci-fi poster and the production. Other than that, not particularly exciting, slow, gets kind of boring. You would be better off to watch Repo Man with Jude Law. Similar, on the run, sci-fi kind of story but much more entertaining and not even a fraction of the budget.",Total Recall

Total ReKall is yet another remake by the chimp script writer committee. Yes they added a 'K' in total 'rekall' . How I bet everyone slapped themselves on the back for that original and ground breaking idea. Other than that it's like they drew up a list of all the best parts of the original film/story and then discarded them or so diluted them as to be meaningless. The shame is Farrell and Beckinsale worked really well in the roles, shame they didn't have a script to match their talents.

161,Tehmeh,Passable. No match for Verhoeven's original.,5,16 August 2013,"I read many bad things about this movie, and now that I've seen it, it's not a total disaster. The problem is - it's not good either. There are some nice nods to the original, nice special effects, plenty of action. It just lacks the soul, the essence that the original had. Some important themes are pushed aside, and generic robots/hover cars/action scenes are crammed in. Many times there is action just for the sake of action. You don't often feel the element of danger. The soundtrack is constantly on. There's that little thumping tone that's never shut off, and along with some action scenes this accomplishes the exact opposite what they're trying to do - I didn't really care what was happening. It didn't move me, I wasn't excited. I got simply bored, or ""tired"" in some sense. PG13-rating doesn't help much (although this one wouldn't have been a masterpiece even with the R-rating but certainly more enjoyable). Verhoeven's original was very violent, and the violence set a certain important tone. This was bland, generic and hoped to please everyone. This PG13-nonsense needs to stop, there are plenty of movies that NEED to be R-rated to have an impact. I weep for the upcoming Robocop remake.That said, the movie is not that bad, it's borderline decent. The core of the original Total Recall is somewhat intact. Many have disliked Jessica Biel's performance, which is funny. I thought she was fine in her simple role, at least equally as good as her counterpart in the original film. So she was a positive surprise in that regard. Colin Farrell on the other hand is very bland. He doesn't exactly suck, he certainly (probably) tries, but...something is missing. His character lacks character, it's hard to get a grip on him. When your main character doesn't work well, it hurts the entire movie. Beckinsale/Cranston as villains are somewhat adequate. Beckinsale sees plenty of action though and she's good at it.A somewhat decent movie, not more, not less. Very forgettable. The original is a great one though, and I recommend it for everyone. Original Total Recall's Verhoeven/Schwarzenegger/Stone - combo is very solid, and the whole movie is a little classic for me.",Total Recall
162,CMTiago,Good as a stand alone movie,7,12 June 2014,"Had this movie not had a connection with the original movie and it would have been a nice summer movie with all the cool explosions with it. By carrying this burden of being a remake, the Total Recall movie of 2012 is sometimes harshly criticized for failing to live up to expectations, and while I do agree that the original is better, this one does have its perks. For example, the action scenes are more modernized and hence a little more fast paced. While the 1990 version was a more over the top adventure, this one takes a more serious route and also a darker vibe about its future (Mars isn't even a part of this film). Performance wise, the movie is okay with Farrell and Cranston handling the good guy/bad guy dynamic well. As for the girls I think they actually succeeded in making Melina much more hotter by casting Jessica Biel. Of course, Kate Beckinsale is wonderful as Lori as well. When compared with Arnie's Sci- Fi classic, this version of the futuristic tale won't stand a chance. If you choose to view this as an entertaining movie that only resembles the latter in its premise, then I guarantee you will have a good time.Rating 7,5/10",Total Recall
163,vip-danii,Complete Rubbish. Not Worth Seeing.,1,29 March 2013,"The original ""Total Recall"" is one of my favourite movies. But this crap...? It's got nothing to do with the original. No common theme, nothing. Why was the name ""Total Recall"" used in the first place!? It's actually quite offensive.Even if you never saw the original, and there's nothing to benchmark against, this movie is still a HUGE stinker -- even as a stand-alone movie.I won't even mention the vomit-inducing ""romantic"" scenes. The romance was present in the original ""Total Recall"", but it was subtle, tasteful, and believable. But here... just cheesy and, like I said, barf-inducing.I can't get over how BAD the acting was. None of the lead characters should be considered actors; they're lame and unconvincing amateurs at best. Honestly, it's difficult to imagine a more talentless cast. I can't believe someone would pay for these people's ""acting abilities"" (of which they have none).And the movie itself... it's so poorly-done... to the point of irritation. Totally distasteful and over-the-top (particularly the action scenes).I won't even bring up the plot, since there was none. None-existing story and never-ending action/special effects that give you a splitting headache -- aside from p***-poor acting, that's all there is to this garbage of a movie.A totally forgettable (and actually quite irritating) piece of junk.

I'm not sure where to begin on my critique of this in-name-only rip-off. I like many of the actors here, and having enjoyed the 1990 Total Recall, I thought this would be a decent way to pass time. But after 90 minutes, I was completely ready for it end. The story very loosely follows the screen story written for the original film but relies on CGI and feels more like a video game. The strobing lights and constant eye-pain-level flashes were trying. None of the characters attempted to connect with the audience. The part of Lori was way over-done and she became boring fast. It was nice to see Brian Cranston but this film was too small for his huge ability. The story was practically non-existent. This entire film really seems to be just a vehicle to display gaming and CGI talent. If you like watching people bouncing around with pin-ball machine effects and lots of shooting, you might enjoy this film.I've called the 1990 film 'the original' for convenience, but Verhoeven's version is leaps and bounds more engaging and provocative than this mess, which many have noted is more of a reimagining than a remake.",Total Recall

Succumbing to the upper hand of the tyrannical regime and their super-powered robots captained by a super-powered Kate Beckinsale, Farrel and Biel stay on the run as Beckinsale beats the crap out of both of them repeatedly. The beatdown of the good guys is so bad that when they barely stop the wicked plan to kill the innocent oppressed populaton, by the skin-of-their teeth, within an inch of their lives, it is completely unsatisfying with nowhere near enough retribution.

166,metalrage666,Totally worth seeing,7,22 August 2012,"I had some serious misgivings going into this movie, thinking that this was going to be another rotten bastardised version of a movie classic, such as Day the Earth Stood Still turned out to be, however this came as a complete surprise.The only similarities to the Schwarzenegger version are the character names, and the overall premise of the main character and that's pretty much it. There's no Mars, no Johnny Cabs, no mutants or issues of air- taxes, all that is gone. Other similarities seem to have been melded together, such as his wife, being a mix of Sharon Stone and Michael Ironside rolled into one. Also the company-guy who delivers the bag and his safe deposit box at the Mars hotel, is now just a sole safe deposit box in a bank complete with all the trimmings including what appeared to be Barack Obama dollars.Despite the CGI laced action that didn't really exist in the 1990 version, this can be very easily seen as a stand alone movie, but as you watch this there is no way of escaping from the similarities that do crop-up throughout the film. However that's actually part of this versions appeal, knowing what was done previously and seeing how it was done this time around.What detracted a little was the glaring hommages to other movies. The whole idea of mankind being reduced to only 2 inhabitable areas on the planet seems scarily reminiscent of Judge Dredd and the whole mega-city principle; and the city design is not a far cry from the cities seen in Blade Runner or Fifth Element. Even the car chase scene has been updated however instead of being chased in small Eco-friendly style cars, these are more akin to those seen in Minority Report, I-Robot, again Judge Dredd and anything else remotely similar. I also felt that some of the characters were a little misplaced, especially when compared to their earlier counterparts. Ronny Cox was a far better Cohaagen than Bryan Cranston. Also I don't really get why the leader of the resistance is now called Matthias instead of Kuato. Every time they said Matthias I couldn't help but think of the mutant leader in Omega Man.To make things slightly worse was the lack of humour that gave the original so much charm. This version concentrates on being in your face with action most of the time, there's no room left for humour. Even some re-hashed lines from the original seemed to fall flat as does the appearance of the 3 breasted prostitute. As there are no mutants, you're left to assume that she's the product of cosmetic surgery or something.This is well worth a look as it's a great sci-fi action flick, it won't open any eyes in the effects department as it's been done before, but it's still very enjoyable.",Total Recall
167,jaxbubba,"I'm Surprised, I liked it!!!",6,8 August 2012,"I'm surprised, I actually kind of enjoyed this film. Though I am really not a fan of movie re-makes, this film has the baseline of the original film; however, the film offers enough originality to actually stand on its own.Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) is your average, everyday, run-of-the-mill blue-collar worker. Day in and day out, he goes to work, takes public transportation, sits in the same metro seats, and lives in a dump. Eager to add some spice to his life, he goes to a memory in-plant facility where he has a secret double agent experience uploaded into his subconscious. However, once the process is initiated, all hell breaks loose.In the original, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, there was some ""gray area"" at the end of the film as to whether the events that the audience had just witnessed were ""real"" or just a part of Arnold's Total Recall experience; however, that ambiguity is not present in this film. I would like to extend kudos to director's Len Wiseman's subtle homage's to the original film, which included a three-breasted prostitute, and one of the best scenes in which a heavy set red-headed lady in a yellow suit is passing through a checkpoint, and the guard is overheard saying, ""One moment please"". Everyone who has ever seen the original film knows that ""she"" has to be Quaid (Farrell) in disguise. So again, bravo to Mr. Wiseman.The film's true star is Kate Beckinsale as Quaid's wife Lori Quaid. Talk about a woman scorned!!!! She is ruthless, fanatical, certifiable, and in one word ""FAB-U-LOUS""!!!! She takes her mercenary job serious, and she does not quibble with the ""whys"" or ""why nots"". She has only one purpose in this film, and that is to secure and/or destroy Douglas Quaid. PERIOD.Gone from this film are the mutants and Kuato; however, this film does have that George Lucas ""Clone Wars"" / ""I, Robot"" / ""Blade Runner"" feel. Where ""air"" was the reason for resistance in the first film, ""living space"" is the issue for this film. Again, I did enjoy this interpretation of the Philip K. Dick short story, and feel that Kate Beckinsale simply steals every scene that she is in. I recommend seeing this film, and definitely wished that I could have experienced seeing it on the big screen. So if you are a Sci Fi geek, or fan of the original, I do not believe that you will be disappointed in this rendition. SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ ""THE FARIS REEL""",Total Recall
168,cadillac20,"Kinetic, Entertaining Reboot",6,2 August 2012,"I might be one of the few people who doesn't have the fond memory of the original film. While entertaining, it's not a favorite of mine and it's a film I feel hasn't aged well. So, I don't think this new film is a crime against nature like so many others have felt. The cast is likable and Colin Farrell is a decent Quaid, though he doesn't quite have the heroic presence of Arnold. The film is mostly about the kinetic action and energy that the cast brings to the film and the exciting action sequences which do a pretty good job of entertaining.If you've seen the original here, the story is pretty much the same. There's no Mars, but it is replaced with a high society territory on an Earth where what's still inhabitable is separated on either sides of the globe, one a poor, Blade Runner-esque society of mostly impoverished worker bees, and the other a high class society of white walls, clean streets, and hover cars. The story remains much the same, even containing some of the same beats as the original film, like the security box at the bank, the terminal sequence, and even the scene where Quaid must question his sanity. However, the film replaces much of the brain jogging with high energy action sequences. A far cry from the original film, which had more brutal and violent action, this feels more like a modern sci-fi, with everything being very shiny and in constant motion. In fact, there is very little down time, as scenes of exposition rush along to the next action piece.The actors all seem to be enjoying their time on screen too, in particular Kate Beckinsale, who picks up the role as Lori, the wife who is really a special agent. She relishes in her role as a villain and kicks major ass too, looking as hot as ever doing it. Jessica Biel is the other leading lady who kicks ass as well and lends her good looks as Quaids right hand woman. In the role of Cohagen, we get Bryan Cranston, who also seems to be having a good time in the role and plays Cohagen less sinister than the original, but no less menacing or powerful. Cranston even gets his hands dirty here and it's pretty nice to see Cranston get a bit physical. As mentioned, Colin Farrell does a good job of taking on the Quaid role, though he doesn't carry the same presence as Arnold.The biggest crime the film commits is being mostly just another sci-fi flick. Where the original stood out with a unique vision and a great story, this new reboot, while fun and entertaining, does nothing terribly special. We've seen this kind of sci-fi before and nothing here is new. I did like many of the action sequences, especially the elevator jumping bit in the hotel, but besides the fast paced action, everything else is unremarkable. It's all merely eye candy wrapped around a light retelling of the original film. In a summer full of exciting blockbusters, this one comes off as lackingStill, for all the mundane the film carries, it's a decent time at the theater. It's not a bad film, but not a great one. It's hard not to call the film mediocre, but sadly, I think I won't remember much of it in about a week or two. Still, it was fun while I was sitting in the theater.",Total Recall
169,toqtaqiya2,A passable science-fiction film with impressive action sequences.,5,2 October 2012,"This remake actually has little in common with the 1990 film, which was directed by Paul Verhoeven. Doug Quaid is played by Colin Farrell here, and he's a good screen presence. As a man trying to find out who he really is he goes through a lot in a few days. In director Len Wiseman's hands the film pops with excitement though it offers little else. Jessica Biel and the lovely Kate Beckinsale are little more than eye candy here, with little to say of any importance. And the best actors in the film, Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy, have little screen time. The special effects are certainly good. They're incorporated very well into the action sequences, which are truly entertaining. The plot of this film has nothing to do with Mars however. Here it's a dystopian world where only two territories on Earth, the United Federation of Britain and the Colony, exist where people still live. Except for the Fall there's nothing seriously original in this science-fiction setting. Still, one can't deny that the filmmakers put effort into the scenery because it's very detailed. Wiseman includes very little downtime between the action so there's hardly any time to think about what's going on. As to be expected this film is a product, so it's not an improvement on the 1990 film. It doesn't have the charm or the characterization of the original. It was made to entertain and I doubt that you will think about it after it's over. Watch it if you're looking for a fun time at the movies.

This is the way it should have been done in the first place.For those who are loyal to the original, they obviously never read the book. There is nothing about mutants. It involves a planned invasion of earth by rodent-like aliens.Both films took the seed of a great idea and fleshed it out in wildly different ways. The latter film kept things down to earth, as it were. No colony on Mars, no mutants.

But what happens when the transportation is repaired? And why didn't the colony sabotage the transportation system earlier? And how come the Federation did think to better protect the transportation against sabotage? And all those colony workers who used the transportation to go to the federation to work, what do they do without the transportation?The fight scenes often look unbelievable. One unarmed person takes down a team of armed police? Come on. Also, Kate Beckinsale seems to fight in slow motion. I suggest next time they get a stunt double for her.

172,dharmendrasingh,Total Nonsense,4,12 September 2012,"Len Wiseman's remake is a soporific hash of the 1990 Paul Verhoeven original, which Arnie made so famous. Still based on Philip K. Dick's short story, 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale', the story has been tweaked for a generation who won't remember the first film, i.e. not very much, except there's no Mars. A global chemical war leaves only two nations, the civilised United Federation of Britain, led by Governor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston), whose plan is to create an army of synthetic cops to use against the resistance - so-called terrorists who live in the other nation, referred to simply as The Colony. The Colony is a dystopian metropolis, necessarily rainy, which somehow has an 80s aesthetic. In this godforsaken land of treble-breasted women and other such riff-raff lead character, Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) works in a factory making Cohaagen's robocops. He's been having what he thinks are dreams, which leave him confused and anxious. He is told about a mysterious company called Rekall (a pathetic attempt at difference), which enables customers to have fake memories inserted into their brains and live briefly as film stars, or whatever else might be their fantasy. Quaid reads Ian Fleming novels, so chooses to be a secret agent. That's when the excrement enters the ventilation system. Jessica Biel pops up literally as the girl of his dreams, and together they uncover the reasons for why Quaid has never really felt like himself. I'll stop there with the exposition, not because I don't want to spoil it for you, but because I'll annoy myself for remembering so much of this claptrap. The least worst part of this messy film is ass-kicking Kate Beckinsale, who is the Sharon Stone character, Lori Quaid. She's made quite a name for herself as an action starlet, thanks to all that experience she has of killing vampires and werewolves (Oxford education: you can't beat it!).Strange choice, Farrell. He matches Arnie for being expressionless, but doesn't have the big man's curious charm, or his biceps. The script is bereft of any wisecracks. Maybe the original script had none either, but Arnie's delivery just made words sound funny. I'm sure there's a colony of techie nerds out there who'll be scrutinising this twaddle for hidden meaning, and trying to persuade the rest of us of that this film has a profound plot with great twists.

173,JimmyCollins,Visually amazing.,5,24 September 2012,"In my opinion this movie has a couple of really good things going for it, firstly it is absolutely amazing to watch, the visuals and special effects are breathtaking, and secondly it has Colin Farrell, who is a great actor no matter what the role. Unfortunately though, that's pretty much all that's positive about Total Recall. When I saw the trailer I thought it looked like a cool scifi romp that would be easy to watch, however about half an hour in I had to be awoken by my friend because I had fallen asleep. The story takes far too long to get going, the beginning is such a drag, and once it did get going I'd lost interest, it also seemed as though there was too much going on that it was hard to keep track of anything.One big thing that I really disliked was Kate Beckinsale, everything I've seen her in previous to this I've thought she's been great in, but in this she is extremely overused and is overacting so much that it's embarrassing, her character is probably meant to be the cool villain but I just didn't like her at all, and Jessica Biel was good in her role but she was underused and her character was underwritten, the characterization between the two females should've been a little more equal. Colin Farrell is great, he hasn't ever really given a bad performance, and it's good to see him buffed up and playing something a bit different. I haven't seen the original so I can't compare the two, but I've heard that the story is extremely different, which begs the question, why remake a movie if you're just going to change it, just make a new movie.All in all the movie was a letdown, it was probably about 20 minutes too long (it's not a good sign when you keep falling asleep in an action film), the script is cheesy (I give good wife), and the overall pace is disjointed, however hardcore scifi peeps would probably love it.

The original film was incredible – a staple of my VHS days alongside T2, Star Wars, Die Hard, Rocky IV, and all of those other gems that could teach a boy how to be a man when played on a loop in the living room. Steroid-pumped action aside, the original was a dream. A colorful, visually-charged adventure from beginning to end, that first Total Recalllet my imagination run wild. As one good friend put it, ""Total Recall is the ultimate movie."" He's right. There's a girl with three boobs, a tumor baby that's actually really smart when you give him a chance to talk, and half the movie takes place on a colonized Mars. This new effort mines one of those three to poor effect, but unlike other remakes, you kind of wish the new Total Recall did less to differentiate itself and merely copied as much of its superb brother as possible. Seriously, Total Recall is total garbage, a total waste of time, and totally uninspired (though I'd imagine some 90% of reviews will contain ""total"" puns, I can't help myself). If you'd like, feel free to stop reading now and live on with the solace of knowing that you've responsibly saved ten-plus-dollars.I was really, really excited for this remake. Len Wiseman was helming, and his directing of the last Die Hard movie was more than competent. Even though the Underworld movies – more of a way into the director's chair for Wiseman (or so I thought) – were not my cup of tea, Live Free or Die Hard was action-packed and introduced me to a director who knew how to shoot killer gunfights and chases. Another ray of hope was the look and marketing of the movie in general. This was a much different take on the story, one which primarily didn't included Mars (neither did Philip K. Dick's source material I'm told). I love when remakes have the moxie to try something fresh. But man did we receive something stale here.First and foremost, I haven't seen an uglier movie in a while. Vivid reds and a believable future were traded in for the dullest grays and a sci-fi world that sloppily crams so much indistinguishable crap on screen that we're left with a muddy, murky soup that fails to inspire awe on any level (and isn't that one of the best part of watching science fiction?). Aside from some fancy camera-work and creative shot choices, Total Recall looks just as bad and sewer-like as the Underworld trilogy, but with egregious lens flare dropped on top to remind us that we're in the future. Oh man, the lens flare. You thought Star Trek overused the technique (I actually liked it and found it appropriate there)? Well prepare to have some flashlights in your face. You thought scenes in the Star Wars prequels felt so remote and computer-generated as to remove you from the world (that I do agree with)? Get ready for a whole lot more of that with apparently much less of a budget. There's a climax explosion that looks particularly cornball. And what's with technology in the future looking so unusable? At least in Minority Report and Avatar, the touch displays had somewhat of a user-friendly simplicity to them. Here everything looks so complicated and nonsensical. I guess convoluted is supposed to translate to cool? It only gave me a headache. Probably the worst offense is the overall depiction of the slum- ridden city, the alleys and street corners of which look like hand-me-down Blade Runnerknockoffs complete with Oriental theme.To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/total- recall/",Total Recall
177,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film Review: Could have easily been Total Recall Two.,8,6 August 2012,"Total Recall is the story of Douglas Quaid/Hauser (Colin Farrell) attempting to make sense of his life and decides to visit a virtual vacation company to have a memory implanted. In doing so he learns that all he thought to be true about his life is not. I really enjoyed the action sequences and the special effects, the look of the Colony was industrialization on steroids, but it had a really cool appearance although very similar to the Fifth Element. The story was not what I had expected because I assumed that it would truly be a remake, not a makeover. The most consistent attributes to the original story were the names of the characters, other than that I was left asking questions about the things that were most endearing from the Schwarzenegger film. Mutants, Mars, Quato (open your mind), and Johnny Cab, so what's up with that? This film could have been the Total Recall sequel that never materialized, all that was needed was for there to be newly named characters and voilà, Total Recall Two! Anytime that I see Bokeem Woodbine (Harry) in a movie it always strikes me that he is ageless,and then I consider how he has never been acknowledged for what a gifted actor he is. He should have been nominated for an Academy Awardwhen he played Joshua in Jason's Lyric, I digress, but when I saw the trailer and he was delivering the news to Hauser that he was still back at ReKall, I immediately thought 'uh oh' The ladies in this film delivered first rate performances and both immediately elicited strong emotions. Lori Quaid (Kate Beckinsale) was so good at being bad that you loved hating her right off the bat. Melina (Jessica Beil) was the most endearing but when she and Quaid encounter as seen in the trailer and she provides him a ride, I just knew that she would say 'Come with me if you want to live'. She didn't, and I think I was giving the Schwarzenegger relationship to the story too much weight, not to mention different franchise. I liked this movie, even though I thought that the military was too close to I Robot, it had great action and really good acting in spite of some of the poorly crafted dialog. The film was fairly close to being given an amber light because I felt that the three-boobed lady was gratuitous and served absolutely no purpose,but I was still entertained enough to give it green.",Total Recall
178,basilisksamuk,Not a Terrible Film Shocker!,8,1 September 2012,"I'd written the review for this film in my head before I'd been to see it. It went something along the lines of – too much unbelievable CGI, Colin Farrell has none of the charisma of Arnie, it's an appalling waste of money and talent and should never have been remade. Three stars out of ten. What's more all the advance reviews I'd read said much the same.The shocking thing is though that now I've seen it for real I think it's not only a fun action movie but I actually slightly prefer it to the original. Yes, it is packed full of CGI but in that way in which there's so much CGI that you forget about it and within the world of the film it just works. Colin Farrell isn't terrible and I now believe he can play an action hero. Whilst there are lots of borrowings from I, Robot, Blade Runner and Minority Report they have been done very well. The acid rain drenched overcrowded city is done as well as Scott and it's on screen for considerably longer, the robots are better than the I, Robot robots and the flying car chase scene is better than Minority Report. There are some very clever references and misdirections too which I won't spoil but the director has found a way of doing some of the memorable and key scenes from the original in a different manner. It suggests to me that he or the writers have a genuine affection for the original. Even the dialogue is half way decent.Kate Beckinsale carries out that weird transformation that she's famous for (well at least in my mind) from unremarkable looking woman with limited acting range to super sexy action heroine once she's in a pair of tight trousers, acting angry and running at top speed. All is not perfect though. It's hard to switch off that nagging voice that keeps asking how come there's an elevator through the centre of the earth, what speed does it have to travel at to make the passage in 17 minutes and how come people can fight on the outside of it without being fried, squashed or sucked into oblivion? The director also has an irritating obsession with using lens and light flares which appear in nearly every scene. It's just distracting. Despite the generally negative reviews that this has garnered so far I actually like it and the Mars-free remake worked for me.",Total Recall
179,tkarlmann,Not as good as the Original,5,30 September 2018,"For the first half of this movie, I found myself quoting lines from the Original with Schwarzenegger. Hurry, I said, get into the Johnny-Cab -- there was none. You need to get to Mars, no one ever did. The drip of sweat giving away the 'guy sent from Rekall' -- not there. I guess the original just blew me away --- this one did not. A travel-thing that goes through the earth? Stupid robots that look and act like Galactic Storm Troopers? And the the two lead female actresses -- could you tell them apart? That would be three ""no's"" from me.",Total Recall
180,JamesRutland,total dumbness.,1,31 July 2020,A movie so childish and predictable to be rather annoying. A man and his wife fight from the beginning to the end.

I'm sorry for this piece of garbage. Some CGI effects cannot save this shame.,Total Recall
181,stermix501,Incomplete Recall,7,7 September 2012,"after reading so many bad reviews, I expected to see something awful. Certainly the current about 1 point overall rated difference from IMDb viewers between the old and new difference seems too little, because the 1st one was much ahead of its time and really impressive when it hit the screens. The new one is not a bad movie, especially if we forget the comparisons with the 1st one. The plot is a bit changed, but the 2 little parts of the world separated by vertical elevator passing through earth's core (especially like nothing happens except a switch of weight's direction) is a bit weak to keep us believing in what we see. The acting and dialogs are too expected, quite weak and flat. Colin is nearer the average person to help one identify with, but Schwarzenegger was so much more believable in that role. There was a total absence of humor. Just a flat running. But if you want to do a remake, you have to show something different. Not just update a few items and change the wording in the same sentences. Also in the original there was an excellent music. Here there was not any music. The positive points go for the performance of Beckinsale who probably did slightly better that S.Stone and deserve to keep up to the last scene. The Chinese-like town was quite well thought, with those small water canals and Buddhist Total Rekall center. The 3d elevators scene was quite interesting. Finally I like the clin d'oeuil at the older version, when at the station a yellow dressed red-haired fat woman passes in front of Chinese faced Quaid, confusing us about who will finally be Quaid. I put a 7, but the old one deserved at least a 9.",Total Recall
182,edwardrevans,Arnies Totally better,8,1 September 2012,"Total Recall 2012, would be better if it wasn't for the original. You see the problem is that its gives too much nod and a wink to Arnies film. Saying that it does however have its qualities that been they have upgraded Lori's role (Benkinsale) and have given the plot more of a back-story as to why Quaid goes to recall in the first place. Now because they have developed the back-story part of the main plot suffers somewhat in the fact the Cohaagen and Matthias characters are well underused and underdeveloped. Watching this movie i couldn't help thinking of the following films that I kinda felt that had bits borrowed or referenced.1. Terminator 2 2. Alien 3 3. The blues brothers (yes the car chase) 4. Bladerunner 5. Attack of the clones. 6. Minority reportThe UK Certificate 12A personally this should be rated a 15 as the violence is not comic book and the swearing though mild is frequent. This is the first time I have seen such a film and feel the censors have got it wrong.Farrell is a worthy action hero and this performance is much better than the Boring London Boulevard.",Total Recall
183,drew_atreides,I will never again pay money for a Les Wiseman production..,6,3 August 2012,"...just got back from the new Total Recall.I, as probably everyone seeing this movie, were big fans of the original Arnie/Verhoeven epic. It still stands as one of the finest examples of sci-fi/action that exists on celluloid. That being said, I was leery of this remake for pretty much all the same reasons already mentioned by others, foremost being: WHY REMAKE IT?THAT being said, i was curious enough about the cast to give it a shot.First off the good: Kate Beckinsale is pretty good as the combination of Michael Ironside and Sharon Stone from the original. She plays crazy psycho wife really well, and her relentlessness was fun to watch.The FX on screen are pretty spectacular. That city, and the whole elevator between the 2 continents was really really neat, in both concept and execution. The evil robots were kinda menacing and cool, too. And the art direction and set design were top notch.John Cho actually has a pretty cool cameo, as well.The bad:Expecting Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel to be able to carry a movie. Seriously these 2 are about as exciting as milquetoast. I found myself falling asleep during pretty much most scenes that focused on these two. Really the movie's success hinges on these 2 actually being compelling to watch. They aren't.Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy do what they can with what amounts to 2 glorified cameos, but they really don't have much to work with. Cranston seems to be having fun, but they both deserve better.The overriding sense that one comes away with from TOTAL RECALL 2012 is Mediocrity. This flick is the very definition of mediocre summer flick. It's not terrible, but it's also highly forgettable. Which is my issue with all of Wiseman's films. At this stage i have a large enough sample size, now.. I will never again pay money in the theatre for anything this guy does.",Total Recall
184,christophersarles,White bread,2,11 October 2020,"The graphics were OUTSTANDING, the story was weak and pointless, at least the first one gave reasons WHY the main character had been erased, in this one it's some vague resistance..
it's just one long chase scene, one in which you don't care who is chasing or who is being chased.
I can only imagine the actors spending months in front of a green screen, because only about five minutes of this movie doesn't involve endless, outlandish and impossible chase scenes for no reason.

185,Animus,Facepalms galore!,4,21 February 2013,"I liked the old version even though it was nothing like the Phillip K. Dick short story. The new version has even less in common with the Dick original. That said I spent most of the movie wondering who allowed the screenplay to be used. So many face-palm moments including (spoiler alert):Based on the distance traveled and time taken the ""fall"" train does a good 45000 mph. WOW that's Mach 60 and yet when people open emergency hatches and climb out later they are not instantly shredded by friction. (yes there was an emergency slowdown in effect but even shedding 90% of the speed would have still been deadly)why would a projection need a bullet proof vest?why would robot need the push buttons on its own arm to activate software? what happened to the gravity reversal warning? and why did the 0-gee period last 10x longer ?Who refers to deactivated robots as being in stasis?who programs robot soldiers to be sadistic by squeezing an injured shoulder?

186,cattjones,No Need to Recall,4,5 August 2012,"I was completely exhausted after seeing this film. If you like chase scenes and a lot of action, then this is the film for you. I think that people who have seen the original Schwarzenegger version will not be too thrilled with this film, me included. In the original film there were more mind games while this film is diluted with action sequences. I am not saying that the action parts were not good, there was just too many of them. I have to say that the futuristic look of the United Federation of Britain and The Colony (Australia) was pretty cool; although there were times that I thought that I was watching a video game. Also, the concept that you could travel between the two locations (which are on opposite sides of the earth) in roughly 17 minutes in a tube called ""The Fall"" was utterly ridiculous. I can't even imagine how fast that thing would have to travel to do what it does. Colin Farrell (Douglas Quaid/Hauser) was not all that engaging. This is not necessarily his fault because the dialog was pretty bland and boring. By the end of the film I really did not care what happened to him, I just wanted it to be over. Kate Beckinsale (Lori Quaid) and Jessica Biel (Melina) were formidable as two butt-kicking adversaries, although I have to say that Kate's character kind of reminded me of the female terminator. She was relentless in trying to track down Hauser. I am always happy to see a woman cast as a tough, larger than life super human. Bokeem Woodbine (Harry) was convincing enough as the best friend, but his dialog was no better than Colin's. I do not think that the film was all bad, but about an hour or so into the film I was wishing that I was back at ReKall. You are definitely going to need an energy drink after you watch this one because you will not be energized after seeing it; you will be worn out. Len Wiseman was definitely not a wise man for trying to redo this film. He should stick with the Underworld series and call it a day. This film really makes me long for Mars and the cheesy special effects in the original. I am giving this film a very weak amber light only because the action scenes were so well done.",Total Recall

188,bdgill12,Adequate and That is All,5,9 August 2012,"Allow me a moment to break down my review writing process.1. See a movie; 2. Discuss that movie with whoever I saw said movie with or, if I saw said movie alone, engage in a Gollum-like solo discussion; 3. Spend one to two days decompressing to allow myself to fully grasp the film and settle in on an opinion; 4. Write the review.It is the third portion of this equation that can cause me problems. I'm an opinionated guy and sometimes breaking those opinions down into a well-reasoned statement. On the other hand, this section of the writing process proves equally challenging when a movie like Total Recall comes along and leaves me almost entirely devoid of opinion whatsoever, prompting me to give the very vague summary of, ""Well, it certainly was a movie.""In the future, the world has been ravaged by the inevitable nuclear war. As a result, only two countries remain: The United Federation of Britain which consists of a chunk of Western Europe and The Colony, formerly known as Australia. Each day, lower income workers from The Colony travel through the earth's core in a super subway known as The Fall to work in the UFB. Like many of his contemporaries, Doug Quaid (Colin Farrell) is unhappy with the life he shares with his wife, Lori (Kate Beckinsale). On a whim, Doug pays a visit to Rekall, a company that inserts memories into the brain, giving one the feeling of having done something fun, adventurous, or dangerous at a fraction of the cost. But when Doug is strapped into a chair, his real memories are accessed and a host of UFB troops besiege him, claiming that he is a spy. His reflexes take over and he quickly dispatches the troops in a manner that he would have never dreamed possible. Forced to go on the run to discover the truth about his identity, Doug comes in contact with Melina (Jessica Biel), an old friend who insists that he plays a vital role in the fight between the UFB's Chancellor Cohaggen (Bryan Cranston) and the rebels from the colony. ""Adequate"" is the word that comes to mind most often when trying to describe Total Recall. A remake of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger ""classic"" (depending on your use of that word), this version was intended to come closer to the original book written by Phillip K. Dick. Instead, it sort of bridges the gap between the two while attempting to balance the need to remain similar to the 1990 film while still finding ways to strike out on its own. I actually liked the abandonment of the Mars storyline that was central to the 1990 version and the concept of The Fall and the way in which that giant piece of machinery symbolized the struggle between the classes. Other changes, however, didn't make as much sense and in the end, the helpless need for director Len Wiseman and his crew to pay homage to the original became distracting and at times disjointed. There are at least a handful of scenes within this Total Recall that would leave the viewer very perplexed if he/she had never seen the first one. The storyline, too, doesn't measure up to the film's concept and though it isn't a bad narrative, it is certainly bland. From an acting standpoint, Total Recall is marginally above average. Farrell throws himself into his character and does his best to flesh out his feelings and emotions even if there's not much there to work with. You could make the case that his performance is better than Schwarzenegger's was but the character lacks the magnetism, as it were, that Arnie's version had. Biel and Cranston, as well as Bokeem Woodbine, John Cho, and Bill Nighy are neither asked to do much nor given much to do and as such, they serve their respective mediocre, not-good-but-not- bad purposes. Without question, the star of the film is Beckinsale who has a keen knack for bringing life and glorious power to relatively meaningless characters and films. The Underworld films, for example, are all fairly awful but Beckinsale's fierce charisma makes them worth watching. This role in the original was the jumping off point for Sharon Stone's career but took to the screen for only a few brief moments. Here, Beckinsale chases Farrell from place to place, providing both our lead character and the audience with a tangible adversary while Quaid deals with all the unseen questions about his life. I hope that someday Beckinsale is given an opportunity to play a meaningful role in an actual good film but for the time being, she's pretty great at what she does.All of this makes Total Recall a decent but thoroughly underwhelming action movie that leans heavily on the action but falls short of making any sort of impact. Had Wiseman gone for a more mysterious, ambiguous conclusion, it could have reached higher but then it might have been too risky in terms of reaching the average summer blockbuster viewer. I can't pick out a single element that is inherently wrong with Total Recall but then again, I can't pick out something that is supremely right, either. It is, at its best, cheap, decent, borderline meaningless entertainment that should probably be reserved for a sick day on the couch rather than a trip to the theater.Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.com",Total Recall
189,trnjamesbond,Comfirmed as trash!,1,6 November 2012,"Total Recall 2012 is the the epitome of what is wrong with Hollywood today. This film looked out of place in the trailer, and now that I have seen it, this is a definite confirmation that it is a total waste of time and money.The film starts out with a subtitled sub-plot with a re-imaged story line. Yes folks, no Mars in this one. then we move on to slamming an action sequence into our faces without any character development at all. Jessica Biel is beautiful as usual, Colin Farrell is a wonderful and talented actor too bad both of their talent was wasted in this film.We now are directed toward the performance of Kate Beckinsale which seemed a little lack lustre. The car chase scene was okay, but still even with this statement a lot of the CGI seemed stolen from films like iRobot and Minority Report. Speaking of iRobot, the robots in this film looked like iRobot mated with a Storm Trooper from Star Wars.Now I will move onto the three breasted woman at the beginning of the film. She again didn't even fit into the scene, why was she there? It didn't feel right to me. So I concluded that this was just made for a silly laugh in this film, a throwback if you will, to the original film. Well I didn't feel moved or even felt like laughing at this three breasted woman. Why would they put this in this film. Throughout the whole film it seems to have no humour written in the storyline at all. That's why this scene seems out of place.The original film was filled with lots of one liners and so forth, with an intricate plot hiding underneath. This version takes itself too seriously and that's what ruined it for me. There is no character development as I said, the CGI looks old and done before, the score was way too monotonous. There are so many action scenes it gets quite annoying also. The film to me needed to take a breather every once and a while.There is nothing else to be said. This film is confirmed garbage and I will not watch it again. I don't know how it got a rating of 6.3 on this site. Some rigging is involved the makers I must say.",Total Recall
190,bennyhagen,I am genuinely amazed,9,17 December 2012,"While it happens just all to often that I don't like or straight out despise an amazingly popular movie, it never happened before that I was genuinely blown away by anything so critically unacclaimed as this one. Given that Total Recall is currently rated 30% on Rottentomatoe's critics-meter I am going to do intricate research regarding the parts that I apparently missed while I sat trough this movie hypnotized.But it could be just me and I can explain that. Maybe I had the privilege to just accidentally view the movie exactly as what it really is about. The the ride that Rekall provides, optimized exactly to one man's fantasies and boy do they do a great job. I would agree that keeping this fact in mind at any time does compensate for some of the flater parts of the movie and also gives it a certain dimension that is not there if you take the trip for real. Take the undeveloped side- characters for example. Surely they could have been given more attention, but knowing, that they are merely props of this ride, with their specific little uses, there only to deliver the right impulse at the right time to the ""subject"", they work just fine. This is also thanks to Colin Farell who does a great job playing the buffled protagonist in the wet-dream of his life. For me - watching it that way - the mind-games, the performances and the smart, well choreographed action sequences all worked pure wonders, while the visual experience was nothing less then mesmerizing, meaning not only the mind-boggling quality of the CGI but also the amazing visual design of the new world and its technologies. There is a slight, temporary decline in quality at about the beginning of the third act, still, this does not manage to overshadow one of the most genuine, most intense movie experiences I had in my whole life.9/10",Total Recall
191,plex,Great FX cant save the monotony,6,20 February 2013,"I enjoyed the original with Arnold. It was sort of campy, the make-up was pretty lame, characters a bit cartoony'. But at its core is an interesting story line that could have been approached several different ways. Its sort of like the film Groundhog Day, where you can make it is a deep as you want to, or choose to keep it as presented. The language was much simpler in the original and it built to resounding climax. When you keep it simple, you then empower the audience to run with it on their own. Not so much with this remake. On the plus side: the cast is sexier and better. The CGI and action sequences are excellent along with some cool futuristic concepts. But it felt to me they purposely tried to distance themselves in this remake, yet abandoned a great opportunity to delve into its interesting concept. In fact, the only explanation you get at all comes in the scene with Harry trying to convince and explain to Quaid he is still in the labs at Rekall ( they even changed the spelling to separate themselves-ridiculous) living out his spy fantasy. The rebellion theme is pretty weak, as they try to play up the population explosion and loss of ""room"" that ensues giving rise to eliminate millions of people to build new establishments. Seems sort of odd they can build an entire new city and vast transportation systems but cant make high rises for people. 75 Years from now we will be colonized on the moon and mars and there is no limit to vertical space, so I would think the bigger issue would be global warming, arable land- but hey this is all just pointless conjecture. It amaze me though that in the future we have guns that can lasso up a person with a capture-beam, but still rely on bullet technology. Obviously, the approach to much of the urban sets were based on Blade Runner, with a little less Asian, and a lot less rain. The film is very stale with its story telling approach. Little is really explained, and assumed the viewer is familiar with the original. However, there is no mars, no mining, no secretive alien presence, but hey, we still got the gal with 3 boobs thrown in although it was painfully obvious as to its pandering. The film really exists as a long action sequence with above-par directing and editing. I don't even remember hearing a music score, the original was really cool. But the film is shallow with few peaks, sort of drones along at high energy with the climax being the collapse of a transport station- whoopie. There is little sense that our hero's made any difference in the world, no celebration of any type, no political acknowledgment. Just sort of ends abruptly. Probably looked great on the big screen, but was sort of boring on the home theater.",Total Recall
192,AzSumTuk,Well...,10,24 August 2012,"Well, reviewing this movie can be quite difficult... How am I supposed to evaluate it? As a stand-alone movie or as a remake? Because if you are not falling from, um, Mars you probably know this is a remake of one of the best Arnold Schwarzenegger movies ever...Hmm... Let's see. How about starting with its' critical acclamation? I guess you can easily see the movie's rating on Rotten Tomatoes. If not, I recommend seeing it if you want a good laugh. 30%. That is it. Needless to say, any sane person would be shocked. Not because the movie is too good for that rating. You don't need to like the movie... You don't even need to have seen it to know something is very, very wrong here... I mean, 'Die Hard 4.0' has 81%... How the hell can the next movie created by the same writer/director have almost three times lower rating? I know, writers/directors don't always make movies of equal quality but the quality NEVER fluctuates that much. A little research about RT helped me realize a few things.First, critics tend to give sequels of beloved franchises high ratings - of all movies of that kind that I checked only one - 'Die Hard 3' - had less than 65%. Everything else - even the abysmal 'Attack of the Clones' - was rated as ""Fresh"".Second, critics tend to have a certain bias against sci-fi, fantasy and horror if they are not directed by a supposedly great name like Ridley Scott or Nolan. 'Willow' - a fantasy genre icon - has 49%. Go figure.Third, Rotten Tomatoes is not even a good representative of critics' opinion... I mean, does anybody believe the critics considered the last Indiana Jones movie better than 'Forrest Gump'? Check their awards and you will see. And yet.. Go and see. So much for RT being a good source...---I wasted your time with this but it just had to be told. Now, about the movie itself. Well, it IS good. It has its' shortcomings, mainly in the writing department, but it stands on its' own.As a stand alone movie... Well, after 'Prometheus' disappointed everyone, TR2012 is probably the best sci-fi movie of the year. It has a great story, great chemistry between the actors and the writing is at least acceptable although sometimes flawed. The acting was good from all actors. The only slight disappointment comes from Bill Nighy - he delivered a fine performance but he looked like he spent no more than an hour on the movie set. However his character, although important, has no more than 10 minutes of screen time so... Action-wise this movie is EXACTLY what 'Die Hard 4.0' was - relatively bloodless, wonderfully captured and complicatedly choreographed. Smooth camera movement, NO shaky cam, extremely long cuts - look at the first fight in the trailer and you will get it. And, believe me, the action looks better than that on the big screen. What is also worth mentioning is the fact that the movie feels more real than most sci-fi blockbusters recently, mostly because the use of CGI and green screens is as minimal as possible. I don't know why so many people think it is loaded with CGI. It isn't, trust me.Overall, as a stand alone movie the new 'Total Recall' works, and it works well.As a remake... Well, it did keep the basic story but that is it. Verhoeven's humor is gone. The blood is gone. The gore is gone. Mars is gone. Mutants are gone. Richter is gone. Arnold and his one-liners are gone. Although the story is basically the same, the new movie is completely different from the original. There are a few nods to the 1990 movie but that is it. This is a new movie.If you want to see the old one, see it. It is great. If you haven't seen it you will love it. If you already have seen it... you will love it again.The new movie is different. If you see it with an open mind you will probably like it at least a bit. Give it a chance. It is a good movie and a great entertainment.",Total Recall
193,albrechtcm,So-So,4,18 December 2012,"This is an unfortunate ripoff of the original. While the cast is good and does its job, the Blade Runner atmosphere doesn't really add anything and in our BluRay copy, the lips and voices were way far apart throughout. This flick was sad enough without that. If a person was paying attention in the original, the title of the spy program they gave Quaid was a new one. I won't mention the title, but if the viewer is paying attention in the original, the viewer should know by the end whether this was real or just a snappy vacation romp to be cherished forever. In this messy remake I don't know, or care. For me the whole film was a bad dream. All the CGI stuff didn't impress me in the least, and lots of flash and glitter can't make up for a poor script that doesn't really make much sense at all.",Total Recall
194,antony-1,"A vivid film, probably done a disservice by its Total Recall connection",7,6 January 2013,"This is a good movie. Fun, action etc. all as expected. But what it does best is setting a very vivid future of Earth. In this way it does better than the original by keeping the action solely on Terra. We get to see a distinct vision of the future, and if you just pause on any city scene you'll see the extreme care and detail that has gone into make this future Earth real. It was wonderful seeing this world - and I want to see more and I think any sci-fi fan will get a buzz just by being immersed in the movie.The thing is by being called Total Recall it does itself a disservice. Rather than being a new distinct branch of Dick's story it of course hangs on to the original, with the name and various nods to the original plot. But the original film is iconic and fun and a huge fan favourite - and a quite different beast. You start comparing two very different films because you have to.The new film tries to be better, but ultimately is shackled by its past.It should have been called something else - and it would have done so much better in its own right.All that said - I enjoyed it. But just see it as its own version, not as a remake, and you'll enjoy it more.One final word - what was with all the weird lights flashing all over the screen all the time? That was the key distraction.",Total Recall
195,Pingo-2,I wanted to like this so much...,4,6 August 2018,"As with the new ROBOCOP (2014), this falls short of the original films from 1987 and 1990 (both directed by Paul Verhoeven, by the way).This ""new"" Total Recall looks cool, but is simply boring. Characters are dull, story is what you expect it to be - nothing more, nothing less - and since the whole Mars-thing is removed, there is nothing exotic that makes it interesting.It feels more like a standard action-film that doesn't present anything new. If you've never seen the original, and you like shiny CGI-action, then you might enjoy this for two hours. However, if you enjoy the original 1990-version, then this is forgotten before it's even ended.And that's sad. As with the original RoboCop, this removes everything that made those two originals exciting, fresh and cool, and just spray paints them with CGI action. Sure, the 1990 Total Recall might feel a bit dated for the younger audience, but it is a far better film, much more fun and much more exciting. The 1987 RoboCop on the other hand, is by far surperior to its ""new"" take. Even when it comes to the effects...This film though, has nothing you haven't seen before.",Total Recall
196,brent_or,Watchable,6,27 September 2013,"This Total Recall is not as interesting as the Schwarzenegger version, but is not half bad as a strong dose of action and eye-candy. I do not criticize the absence of Mars from this story, as I understand that the source material is not itself set on Mars.The Good - Visual effects, novel technological elements, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel as thematic opposites, brisk pacing. There are also at least three really funny (to me) lines of dialog that would make Arnold proud, delivered in the best tradition of disarming otherwise very serious situations.The Not So Good - Colin Farrell does not project much personality, a bit shallow on depth of story, the Farrell/Biel relationship could have stood being developed further.While this film is nothing too terribly special from a storytelling standpoint, I did not really find anything about it horrible. The more unrealistic parts were at least imaginative and extremely cool, and in spite of Farrell's one-note character, I did feel emotionally attached to his plight. I point that out because this film has some definite similarities to Elysium, and surprisingly Total Recall is the more emotionally effective of the two. That is not a great compliment, but it is something.This one is not as profound as one might wish it to be, but it is entertaining.",Total Recall

Leap forward 8 years and a colleague has put it on. It's Christmas Day, we're at work and on stand-down which is the only reason I'll watch this version of Total Recall to the end.At least with the 1999 version you had that excruciatingly poignant question at the end; was it all the Recall implant or was Quaid really the secret agent. The same thoughts and feelings occured at the end of Inception and the spinning thing.The version I'm watching now is devoid of all that cerebral intrigue or even any of the humour of the 1990 version. This 2012 version looks great in parts albeit not wholly original. For all its banging and crashing and explosions it is quite boring.",Total Recall
198,JamesIan2021,"Best Movie Ever, Well #2 Favourite",9,28 May 2015,"2 years on and still, Total Recall is my favourite movie; it's the ultimate sci-fi action adventure. This remake is a blast of fast paced action with a breathtaking world at the centre of the story. Colin Farrell stars as Douglas Quaid, a factory worker who visits Rekall, a revolutionary company who can implant fake memories of a life their client's wish they had. Quaid's dreams of becoming a super spy soon become real as he is forced to go on the run and the line between what's real and what's not blurs. What follows is a heart-pounding chase movie that spans across the stunningly created world of the ""UFB"" and ""The Colony"", with landscape visual effects that are the best I have ever seen, you will be fully immersed into the world of Recall. Taking the lead role is Colin Farrell who plays Quaid this time round. I prefer Farrell over Schwarzenegger's original Quaid, Farrell seems more realistic and vulnerable whereas Arnold will always be Terminator to me, an unbreakable machine. The supporting cast are excellent, they don't fall behind the main characters shadow and they are very well fitted to the film, for me the film really gets going when Kate Beckinsale turns to that sexy British accent of hers and reveals herself to Quaid, ""I'm UFB police Intel, assigned to play your wife, six weeks ago I didn't even know you"" right after they fight it out. Lori literally snaps, switches to bad girl mode and every single camera shot of her is hot, and Beckinsale's evil facial expressions are awesomely sexy, gritting her teeth as she fires weapons, she propels this movie, a one woman killing machine filled with motivation to kill her target and a knack for defying her leader's orders. Jessica Biel plays Melina, a lieutenant of the Resistance. Biel plays the innocent part, a sort of love interest for Quaid, and the moment she appears in the hover car my jaw dropped, she has authority and when she's in the action scenes she kicks ass. Her best line is ""Oh I'm ending this bitch"", right after she fires at Lori in a firefight. Jessica Biel carries the emotional bulk for the movie which is a big job and she does it well. The best new is that the characters don't fall back behind the action; they are focused on closely during the action as they are knocked about brutally. I can't get over how exhilarating the sequences are, they are some of the best I have ever seen, each of them are expertly crafted, very well shot and wild from start to finish. The Hover Car sequence is the best part of this epic adventure, it moves so fast you feel part of the chase thanks to seamless visuals, the world of the UFB in the background and a riveting motion, plus the camera focuses on the characters getting knocked about as they dodge and ram into traffic at ridiculous speeds. The elevator scene is suspenseful as Quaid and Melina jump from unbelievable heights to escape capture, there's a great catfight in a lift between Lori and Melina whilst Quaid fights against a synthetic cop. I loved the rooftop escape from Quaid's home, and the finale on ""The Fall"" is explosive and brutal as knives slash and fists punch with ferocity, plus the zero-gravity moment is jaw dropping. Harry Gregson Williams' soundtrack is perfectly fitted to all this excitement, in fact he enhances it even further. Len Wiseman's superb direction and lens flare effects give this movie a stunning visual flair, the excellent cast blend together very nicely along with a haunting and futuristic soundtrack that fits so well with the on-screen action, especially during the Hover-Car chase and Elevator sequence. The cast are spectacular, with Kate Beckinsale stealing the show. The special effects are outstanding; Total Recall is action perfection and strong storytelling from top to bottom.",Total Recall
199,Corpus_Vile,Surprisingly enjoyable.,6,27 March 2013,"Well maybe it was lowered expectations but after reading some very negative reviews of this, I must confess that the Total Recall remake was far more enjoyable and entertaining than I expected. No, Farrel's no Arnie as Douglas Quaid, but in fairness did anyone expect him to be? Also, Beckinsdale is surprisingly effective as Quaid's homicidal badass wife.The film itself looks pretty cool and switching the location from Mars to an overcrowded Earth it engages in some nice ideas with a nicely realistic portrayal of cramped living quarters and twisting narrow alleys. It also presents a bleaker, grittier more dystopian view of the future than its predecessor and is rather akin to Blade Runner actually. It's also a film which (gasp!) CGI is actually done right.Now, parts of it are quite silly with Cranston being woefully miscast IMO as Cohagen. Another quibble I had is that it's overall more plot lite with a rather dizzying array of action sequences used to cover up for this.However, overall I gotta say I had fun with this and while nothing stand out or special, it's still a dumb but fun flick that as a stand alone action flick manages to be entertaining enough and it kept my attention throughout.Basically anyone willing to park their brain at the door should have a reasonably good time with it.That having said... Farrel is no Arnie...6/10 overall, a daft but entertaining flick that reasonably delivers.",Total Recall
200,aaronjbong,Energetic Sci-Fi Flick that is Forgettable,6,7 August 2012,"So what made them decide to remake the great 1990 sci-fi classic? No answer. This year's ""Total Recall"" remake is an entertaining sci-fi flick with lots of mindless action, extraordinary sets, but redundant. Its visual effects are energetic and watching them on the wide screen is a pleasure but that can't hide the fact that it has a convoluted plot and decent performances by the actors.Colin Farrell replaces the Governator as the lead character here Douglas Quaid. World War III has caused most of Earth uninhabitable and only two territories exist, the United Federation of Britain (UFB) and the Colony (Australia); there is no Mars in this film although it was mentioned in one occasion. Quaid lives in the Colony and every day he uses this elevator service called ""The Fall"" to get to work in the UFB. One day, he decides to visit Rekall, a place where they implant memories into your mind. The police arrive and Quaid escapes. Later on, everything in his world turns upside down. He then gets involved in a series of action sequences filled with mind-blowing special effects to discover his true identity.Let's start with the good things. The visual effects are just marvelous. The buildings, cities, and everything was just jaw-dropping. It's full of energy. Everything that is part of the set is just so energetic and bright. This is certainly a triumph over the remake. And the action sequences come along with the visual effects. You'll be satisfied with the action sequences as there are more than enough presented here. You have action all the time and you can only catch a short break before explosions run all over the screen again.Like most Philip K. Dick's stories, it's science-fiction and set in the future. So, we expect some rad futuristic technology in this film. And it does not disappoint. A lift that takes you half around the world in just 20 minutes. Flying cars that use some magnetic force or something (I'm not good at science). Handphones that are integrated into your very hand (for video calling, all you have to do is put your hand on any solid like glass or mirrors). This is all great stuff. For those who love seeing futuristic items, this movie offers some great inventions. However, the actors' performances aren't all that great. Colin Farrell is a great actor but he hasn't got the power yet to head an action film. He ain't Arnold Swarzchnegger. A lead in an action film may not be his strongest point but I'm sure he can improve that in a couple of years. Also, Kate Beckinsale gave a stunning performance. She portrayed Lori maliciously. However, Jessica Biel drove a mediocre performance as Melina, the good girl. Her dialogue delivery was typical and she gave a normal performance. The others did decent performances and didn't give anything special.The plot is definitely NOT one of the biggest points for this film. It doesn't change much with the original plot. I like how they added some finishing touches and gave some extra bits to this one. But not all of the scenes work. In fact, sometimes I get confused on what is actually happening in the film. Some of the twists work but some of them just leave me confused. Who's the good guy? Who's the bad guy? Maybe that's part of the movie experience as the main character is in a desperate search for needs but for me, that just makes it confusing.Oh yeah! If you're taking your kids to watch this film, watch out! There's one particular scene where it is inappropriate. Yep! All in all, ""Total Recall"" is a fun and energetic sci-fi film that is easily forgettable. It's full of action sequences, mind-blowing visual effects, impressive fictional inventions, and fascinating sets. It's full of energy but is downed by some mediocre performances and unclear plot. Overall, it is good but easily forgettable.Rating: 6/10Final Verdict: This ""Total Recall"" remake is an energetic sci-fi effort filled with endless action, pleasing visual effects, and cool fictional inventions that is easily forgettable.",Total Recall
201,c-kelsall,Where were all the Australians?,5,15 June 2013,"So, a remake of Total Recall....I mean, why bother? The original wasn't perfect, but it was grand and slightly ridiculous, and of its time. Surely the only advantage of a remake could be better special effects? Well, I'm happy to report that, on the whole, the special effects were pretty good. And it wasn't a terrible film; I enjoyed it for what it was, slightly interesting sci-fi action. But a fulfilling remake it most certainly wasn't. Let's take a moment or two to address the shortcomings: 1) Where were all the Australians? Seriously! Just to put you in the picture, this is a dystopian future in which the Earth has been ravaged by global chemical warfare, to the extent that the only habitable territories are most of Britain, and Australia. Somehow, though, the majority of the people seem to have American accents whether they live in the 'Federal Territories of Britain' (sic) or The Colony (aka Australia). I didn't detect a single Australian accent, though many of the Colonists did seem to be south-east Asian, and to have been transplanted with their buildings from the set of Blade Runner! So either the Americans were the aggressors and basically stole all the habitable land, or the film-makers didn't really give a ****. I'll leave it up to you, dear reader, to decide which it was. 2) The Fall? Seriously? What utter nonsense. The only means of transport between Britain and Australia was a giant underground train that skirted the Earth's core. This isn't science fiction, it's pure fantasy. Similar ideas were pedalled in The Core (don't get me started on that one), and they were just as scientifically misguided then. I'd have had a lot less trouble believing in a colony on Mars to be reached by spaceship. Which, by the way, was a fundamental plot element of Philip K Dick's original short story upon which the first Total Recall film was based. At least Arnie's version had the spectacle to leave the viewer uncertain as to whether the whole thing might not be a delusion after all. Daft as the remake is, it never conveys that feeling; just the idea that it's all a load of badly-conceived hogwash. 3) The pointless nods to the original film - why bother? It might as well have had a different title, so little did it resemble the plot of the original in any meaningful way except the identity crisis of the hero. 4) The acting. Okay, it wasn't terrible, but to a man/woman the cast had nothing to get their teeth into with the dialogue. The blame clearly lies with the screenwriter and the director, because the leads (including cameos) have all been much better in other roles. So, not phoning in their performances from Mars so much as...well, Australia maybe. So what has this film got going for it? The aforementioned special effects are perfectly respectable, some of the fight scenes are well- choreographed, and the pacing isn't bad. And maybe that's all it really needs if you're happy to switch off your brain and reach for the popcorn.",Total Recall

It's sad that the average movie goer loves CGI over story and moves like this get the green light. There was absolutely nothing that made this movie remotely entertaining other than the adorable girls. I see the robots went Star Wars Stormtrooper school of marksmanship. Note to bad guys and girl: STOP TALKING WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO KILL SOMEONE. IT DOES NOT BODE WELL WHEN YOU DO.Everything the original Total Recall had was ridiculously removed in the remake. Half the fun was the villain henchman Richter and the scenes of decompression. Walter White was not a good Copenhagen but the girls were adorable.

204,tay-sedai,Average,6,21 May 2013,"If you don't want to know anything at all about this movie, then obviously you shouldn't read this review. That said, I haven't included any spoilers, i.e. plot twists or endings, in this review.I think I probably would have enjoyed this movie more and given it a higher rating if I wasn't a child of the 80s/90s and overly fond of the super-cheesy original with Arnold Schwarzenegger. I enjoyed the world-building in this version, and yet I kept waiting for us to get to Mars and...it never happened! I think the actresses and actors who were in the original (Sharon Stone, whoever played Quaid's Mars love interest, and of course Arnie) did better jobs, though I guess I have to say that being as biased as I am. In short, I went into this loving the original and exited the theatre feeling a little bit let down.There were very cool aspects to the ""modern"" world in this remake that the original didn't manage due to the fact that it came out in 1990, but all in all the cheesiness of the original was a huge part of the fun! And I think it was a cop-out that 2012-Quaid didn't have to pull a huge metal ball out of his nostril!Pretty sure the original made me laugh (and always does when I re-watch it!) a lot more than this version did.",Total Recall
205,J-bot6,A vast improvement over the 1990's film of the same name.,8,23 June 2014,"This 2012 version of Total Recall starring Colin Farrell is a welcome improvement over the campy 1990 Verhoeven film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger). I had high hopes for the earlier Verhoeven film and was disappointed in the cartoony special effects, convoluted plot, campy character portrayals, and substandard editing.In this new version of the film, the editing and musical score have both been improved. As a result, the events flow much better. Visual effects have -- of course -- improved. However, it should be mentioned that the 1990 film already suffered from some truly horrid special and visual effects, even for its time. Fortunately the people working on this new film clearly have a more critical eye for effects and shots. The cinematography in this 2012-release is excellent. If I were to ask for anything in this new version, it would be a bit more time for certain establishing shots, since some of them appear to have been cut a little bit shorter than they should be (giving the sense that the shot was a bit rushed).And it's on that note that I should mention the pacing. I don't generally like action sequences, simply for the sake of action. However, in this film I'm okay with it. Regardless, the action sequences are on the verge of being an over-load; it would be nice to have just a few more scenes in which the pace is slowed down a bit. The lull points would help pull the viewer deeper into the film's richly-rendered world.I found the main character to be much more convincing in this new version. Colin Farrell plays the character in a more realistic manner than Schwarzenegger. In the 1990 film, there was little feeling that the main character was in any real danger, since he was being played by a massive (literally) action hero. Arnie in his prime isn't someone who generally looks like he's under any real duress. Colin Farrell plays a more believable everyman at the beginning -- which more effectively sets the audience up for the reveals that follow. Nice work by Kate Beckinsale for her portrayal of a convincingly-threatening villain.Finally, kudos to the people who worked on design development for this new film. The concepts are a joy to watch, and are brilliantly executed on-screen. Believe me, I've seen a ton of sci-fi, and this is some of the nicest to watch.I'm sure there are many who hold the 1990 film close to their hearts. So be it. For those who are more into the immersive, atmospheric, and less-campy variety of sci-fi, this new offering is well worth seeing.Ignore the negative reviews and give this movie a shot. After all, cinema is a highly-subjective art-form. If you're truly steeped in this genre (especially in science fiction from 1977 to 1983), I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",Total Recall
206,jaguiar313,Nice action and a bad ass Kate Beckinsale in a been there done that remake.,6,3 August 2012,"Total Recall is a totally unnecessary remake of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger starrer that itself was based on Philip K. Dick's short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"". While the 90s version was directed by Paul Verhoeven with the same sly, over the top style as his Robocop, this version takes itself a lot more seriously under the helm of Underworld director, Len Wiseman. And the fun is sadly lacking. Wiseman directs the action scenes well enough, they are entertaining and kept my attention. But, it's the important stuff in between, like the story and the dialog scenes, that lack the strength to hold our interest. And the humorless tone doesn't help warm us up to the characters either. Therefor Total Recall becomes a series of action scenes strung together by a story we never get emotionally interested in. The 90s version may be campy, to a degree but, it held our interest and drew us in. I don't think Wiseman is a bad director but, I do think he is a lazy one who rests on his influences instead of trusting his own ideas. The fact that his Underworld films are his best stuff, proves this as they were his own creation and there is more passion in their making then in his later projects. It also doesn't help that the design of the film by Patrick Tatopoulos is completely derivative of films like Blade Runner,The Fifth Element and even the Star Wars prequels but, I've always felt Tatopoulos' work was very derivative so, not surprising. This and the retread story from the screenplay give the whole film a 'been there done that' feel in more ways then one. The cast is fine. Colin Farrell's Doug Quaid isn't larger then life like Arnold's but, he gives a good performance and is capable of carrying a movie. Kate Beckinsale as an assassin pretending to be his wife, steals the pic as a totally bad ass bad girl who combines the Sharon Stone and Michael Ironside characters from the previous version and she totally has a blast doing it. Jessica Biel is also fine as rebel Melina but, the character is very underdeveloped like most of the supporting characters. Rounding it out are Bryan Cranston as the generic bad guy, Cohaagen and a blink-and-you'll-miss-him Bill Nighy as the rebel leader, Matthias. The SPFX are all top notch but, again, are undersold by the derivative production design and the score by Harry Gregson-Williams is completely generic and forgettable. So, in conclusion, while I did enjoy the action scenes and loved Kate Beckinsale's gung-ho killer Lori, there really isn't all that much else to recommend this flick for. Wait for rental if you're curious or a fan of someone involved.",Total Recall
207,Legendary_Badass,"No Mars, No Mutants, No soul",5,3 August 2012,"I'm very much anti-remake. If the original worked, leave it alone. In the case of the 1990 Total Recall we had what was built to be the biggest movie yet made starring the biggest movie star around. Yep, that sounds like a viable candidate for remaking.In a future where most of the Earth is decimated, Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) can't shake his adventurous dreams. He heads to Rekall where vacations come in the form of memory transplants. In the process of becoming his own secret agent, Quaid discovers that his life is a lie. Wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale filling in for Sharon Stone but doubling for Michael Ironside and offering the best performance of the film) leads a chase to capture the awakened Quaid. Meanwhile freedom fighter Melina (Jessica Biel) attempts to persuade Quaid into finding his true identity and leading the cause against oppression.This version of Total Recall does feature some upgrades. Of course visuals have come a long way. Where the original only had one computer-animated sequence involving primitive animated X-rays, this version has all the bells and whistles. There are maglev cars, a myriad of elevators, and a multitude of future housing developments. The art direction is noteworthy albeit not entirely original these days. You can see a frame of the 1990 version and understand immediately what you're looking at with its consumer-ready technology; do the same with this movie and it's another film looking back at Blade Runner. Fight sequences and most of the action come across as deft, if not too numerous.The omission of the plot to free mars creates a chasm of asinine edits. The people at peril are never characterized. Since they aren't sassy mutants, there's trouble in understanding the context of early fan service. Only two inhabitable territories exist in the world. The Colony as it's called (Australia) fills in for Mars but since it's the early setting of the film there isn't anything majestic about reaching it. The film hops between the Colony and the controlling British Federation with early going ease that it fails to divide acts.The lack of Arnold Schwarzenegger helps one appreciate Arnold Schwarzenegger. For someone considered a bad actor, we never actually won a Razzie—he actually got an honorary Razzie for failing to win the award, but did get a Golden Globe. Like Sylvester Stallone, Schwarzenegger's typical role at the time of the 1990 original, exuded masculinity. However, the difference is in the touches of humor that always cropped up in the Schwarzenegger films. One can't watch Predator without shouting to get to the chopper. Transversely Stallone's Rambo never brings the fun factor. Looking back at Total Recall (1990), little touches from Arnold make even the most gratuitous of Paul Verhoeven gore strangely comical. That odd nature interjects the ardor today's films overlook. This remake is clinical. No mars, no mutants, no soul.",Total Recall
208,winopaul,Another action porn yawner,6,4 November 2016,"So I have labeled Interstellar as drama porn, and Grand Budapest Hotel as character porn, so this is action porn. Like conventional sex porn, the movie sacrifices everything just to obsess over some single-minded thing. They keep people running about and chasing each other and shooting. There really needs to be a believable plot to hold things together. It makes the whole thing as implausible as anything to come out of North Hollywood. Problem is, when you are doing science fiction, plausibility is the most important thing.This is a great study in failure. Fantastic sets, great acting, wonderful special effects. Financial flop. This is yet another action flick that seems born out of a video game mentality. Like a mobile spinning above a baby's crib, just make a lot of motions and pretty colors and noises and the baby is happy. Its simplistic bordering on infantile.Implausibility, as if cars would have steering wheels, they use whatever 19th century tropes will allow some action. I am surprised they didn't have a buggy whip fight. And its just like Matrix Revolutions. One hundred bad-guy machines would be semi-plausible, but there are always thousands if not millions. Trust me, Google and Microsoft will make sure the government does not have to chase you anywhere. No matter where you run, they will know exactly where you are.

Lets hire some decent actors, some hot babe actresses, get a flunky to rewrite the script and by the way don't even remotely follow the original script that was a success, these brain dead idiots thought they should rewrite the story so it would make no sense to anyone who has half a brain and tries in vain to watch and understand a fraction of what he or she is watching. So that all being said I ask you this, would you consider this a good idea? Would you spend your hard earned money to watch this crap? Is your life so void of any measure of worth that you would waste 2 hours of whatever time you have left on earth watching this trite? If you answered yes to any of those questions, then quit sniffing those paint flumes, put down the crack pipe, get a day pass from the sanitarium you reside in and enjoy. For the rest of us, carry on and forget about it.....",Total Recall
211,pootc,Superior in cast and action with some good ideas,7,29 August 2012,"I've read the countless reviews and was very sceptical about seeing this one because of the negativity surrounding it. I always liked the original Total Recall, there were some memorable scenes but there were certain things that bothered me because I always felt there was a more serious plot at the heart of Phillip K Dick's book 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale', which wasn't completely recognised in Paul Verhoeven's take and I am pleased to say that some of those gripes have been rectified here, that's not to say the remake doesn't have its problems but I hardly feel as though the story and direction was soulless.This time around the action tasks places on earth, there is no Mars like the previous movie or book. Instead our world is uninhabitable except for the UFB (United Federation of Britain) and the Colony (Australia), now space is the biggest commodity. A new transportation system has been built providing a quick connection between the two remaining places but Colony's rebels are attacking it justifying the need for more synthetic police which are controlled by the UFB. Farrell plays Quaid, a weary factory worker building robots for the UFB who wants more out of life and opts to have an implanted secret-agent memory inserted at 'Rekall' where customers are fantasies are realised through the implants of these false memories. Only in Quaid's case things go pear-shaped. I'm not going to spoil everything so here are my thoughtsFirst of all Colin Farrell plays a much deeper and emotive Douglas Quaid (Quail in the book) than Arnold Schwarzenegger who was so corny and in my opinion miscasts in the role. Quaid's meant to fit in and be a normal everyday guy and Farrell played this everyday man to a tee, really questioning his life. He was very convincing bewilderment and in his journey to discover his own true identity while Kate Beckinsale, Quaid's wife was also a big improvement over Sharon Stone and seemed to have the most fun in her role chasing down Farrell at every twist and turn which was fun to watch making this a great action/ chase movie in its own right. The villain in Recall 2012 (Bryan Cranston) is thinly a bit thinly drawn for my linking and could've had more to do so in this case I have to give my vote to Ronny Cox from the original film but Jessica Biel beefs up the drama with a good performance as Quaid's former love interest Melina.The set-design's are breathtaking, the world is rich in atmosphere and detail while the special effects are top-notch and the action is very finely tuned by director Len Wiseman having taken it's cues from more Phillip K Dick classics such as 'Blade Runner' and 'Minority Report'. The action moves at such a fast pace, never really slowing down once it gets going but the film is guilty of looking sterile in some places and there is a distinct lack of gore compared to the original which I thought hurt some of the impact of all the stylised violence. Where the original Recall practically sprayed you in the face with the blood and had no qualms about breaking necks, and gouging out eyes this version is a lot more scarce in the blood department partly due to the rating but also probably because the majority of the action involved the dismantling of the synthetic police which of course, don't bleed so this point can be forgiven as the remake is heavy on action, and does have some great fight choreography and plenty of hard hits to keep the action fans happy. Another note is the synthetic police force look fantastic and if you're thinking ""I Robot"" these are far more believable and menacing. My only other gripes that if anything the movie takes itself too seriously at times where it could've slowed down and afforded to have a little more fun which was actually part of the originals charm - to a point. I didn't miss the cheesy one-liners because I prefer a serious movie but the original had a certain sleaze about it and some very memorable scenes including Johhny-Cab sequence which is from the book. The removal of the tracking device from Schwarzenegger's nose is cringe worthy scene which really wasn't equalled but fans will be happy to know the three-breasted woman returns - and she's lovely.Overall the remake is superior in cast and action. It's a more serious action movie which does away with the dark comedy routine but the story is there with some good changes and ideas. While it pays homage to the original film it stands on its own enough without being a complete rip- off of the original. The first film will always be cherished by fans, it has some memorable moments but it's through rose colored glasses and sense of 80's nostalgia that make this so great in people's eyes. Schwarzenegger was in his prime and was it's entertaining but it's dated now and if anything Philip K Dick's book should be the standard by which this is measured. Did the film do it justice? Yes. There was a story to be told and modernized and this was a solid effort. I had my reservations but don't think the reviews have been entirely fair. I enjoyed this for what it was and would happily watch again.6.5",Total Recall
212,pintaxandre,Interesting remake but...,6,21 December 2019,"I enjoyed this movie because it didn't just copy the story of the original, but tried to come up with a few new ideas for the story. But that's about it with the plot: ideas. The rest is not very well written and has really huge plot holes.
However, I like the idea of making a remake because the technologies have evolved. In this film, the decors and CGI are very well handled and provide an added value compared to the original.
The action choregraphy and fights are also very well done, but sometimes have horrible jum cuts in it that ruin a whole sequence. The editor of this movie should be fired. This film could have been so much better, had he done his job correctly.
Acting is average and even quite good at times. I like Colin Farrell in the main role and also his false wife. They have a good chemistry and make the best performances of all the film.
The directing is also good with a few interesting scenes.Nothing outstanding though.
To sum up, good and very interesting new things are in this remake. However, they didn't work on the most important point: the plot or storytelling. It's not enough to come up with new things, you have to work also on the source material and improve it. Very interesting study case to analyse though...",Total Recall
213,nexus-37,Total Recall but 97% different movie totally still watchable,6,20 August 2012,"First of all this is not like the original, some quotes ripped here and there, the recall is there.. nothing more.This is totally different movie. Can't blame, movie was actually watchable, seen lot worse.Justin Saved the whole world which is nice ;) did great job in Arnold's shoes I didn't except that, unbelievable actor .The plot was something totally different and cgi didn't get me hot at all it was almost annoying.Justin is going way up with movies, well made and so, still this is a totally different movie than the original. Don't expect see aliens or mars.Story changed, machinery was changed .. all changed.So those of you who liked original its totally different maybe forth of watch, I kinda got bored but Justin saved me from passing out. He needs some award for that one :)Not bad not too good but watchable and annoying because it doesn't follow the pattern.No waste of time though.Stupid that should have been recalled again or so, why put out these things for money when Justin is already pretty famous? I'm not gonna pay for this. Justin's great meta-morph to Arnold was funny, not literally. But funny.If you liked first one this might suck a bit but think it as a different movie .. minuses: too much cgi, no mars stuff, all that gone, no funny stuff enough .. bored. But 6/10 is supposed to be what I got out of there.Next time someone imitating life of Arnold or so that would be amazing lol....like Terminator 1,2 remakes would be fun really.Thats my call. -cut-",Total Recall
214,slayerjmk95,Welcome to REKALL...,8,4 August 2012,"A loose remake of the 1990 film Total Recall (which stared Arnold Schwarzenegger), and based upon the story by Phillip K. Dick ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,"" comes a new updated version starring Colin Farrell, directed by Len Wiseman (Underworld, Live Free or Die Hard) and written by Mark Bomback and Kurt Wimmer is a pretty good effort and a worthy remake.When Douglas Quaid, a factory worker who lives in the Colony but works in the UFB (United Federation of Britain), visits a place called REKALL, his world is turned upside-down as his wife and the government begin to try and kill him. The story itself is not that different from the first film, but there are minor changes and some significant ones (one being ""The Fall""). It follows Phillip's story a little more closely by not actually having Quaid go to Mars, but does have a more significant and believable setting; the Colony is basically the ghettos of this new future world, and the UFB is where all the rich and famous live. Whenever the film goes back into the Colony, it feels like a great homage to Blade Runner, having the Asian undertones and gloomy city-scape, with structures built upon structures. The visual effects are top-notch, being almost as good as Prometheus, but definitely setting a standard for sci-fi action movies. The acting is good, with Colin Farrell and Kate Bekinsale being the leads and more important ones until Bryan Cranston shows up as Cohaagan; Ronny Cox has NOTHING on Bryan here. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams is just spectacular, blending with every scene perfectly; fast-paced and emotional at equal times (a CD version has yet to be released for those interested, i know i am).Overall, Total Recall is a great action movie and a good update of the original, but i have to say, i do prefer this one over Arnold's version (it's still a fun B-Movie). The script, visuals and score got me hooked to this one 9/10 Stars***One more thing, this film (when taking place in The Colony) looks like a Blade Runner homage, and it actually is; Phillip K. Dick wrote the stories that both films are based off of, Blade Runner's being ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" Just thought I'd put that in there!",Total Recall
215,georgep53,"""Total Recall"" Revisited",7,7 August 2012,"I think this film is good summertime entertainment and will please fans of the action sy/fy genre. It doesn't have the campy humor of the original as the earlier film was tailored to be a star vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger whose accent and outsized physique earned him the title of king of the monosyllabic, one-man wrecking machines. This new incarnation of the Philip K Dick short story is dark and dystopian. It's a great looking film thanks to the production design of Patrick Tatopoulos and the visual effects crew. I love what they did with the Lori character. It represents a significant improvement over what Sharon Stone was allowed to do in 1990 and Beckinsale delivers a knockout, bravura performance. Jessica Biel is as always one beautiful butt-kicking force to be reckoned with. Colin Farrell does a nice job with the role of Douglas Quaid, a production line worker whose search for excitement leads him to Rekall where they promise you a brain-wired, out-of-this-world vacation while strapped to a chair. Bokeem Woodbine is Douglas Quaid's friend, Harry, and Bryan Cranston is the maniacal Cohaagen.",Total Recall

But i can safely say, that he shouldn't worry at all, because this movie delivered an enjoyable movie experience.the plot is some what similar to the original film from the early 90s, where Farrel finds himself in a mistaken identity situation without knowing what is really going on, is he or is he not who he is ? and so he embarks into a journey of self discovery while being chased by the ruthless Lori Quaid played by Kate Beckinsale who plays the bad guy "" or gal in this case "", again a surprise role since i never saw her in such a role.on the other side of the coin we find Jessica Biel playing the mysterious girl who appears to be helping Farrel's character to remember who he was, or is she ?? her character wasn't that complex or difficult, and so she does a good job here.now what really made this movie a very good one, is the none stop action, it was quiet an action packed movie with street chases, futuristic car chases, fist fights and even gun fights with very impressive visuals.Of course, its no where near as good as the Dark Knight Rises, but its highly recommended and, not to be missed. i say 8 out of 10",Total Recall

219,trescia-1,It Could Have Been So Much Better. But It Wasn't.,6,8 August 2012,"This review DOES contain spoilers, so you have been warned, again.I think that Kate Beckinsale and Colin Farrell have been miscast in just about every film they have ever been in, and miscasting usually ruins films for me, if it's just bone-headed miscasting, but in THIS case I figured that casting these two goofs as the major characters would WORK. I mean... you have some pretty but dumb people who are manipulated by a ""virtual reality"" trip to be super-agents. That would be funny and it might be entertaining, and I liked the first movie so much I thought it would be worth seeing.So I settled in to watch the special effects and the stuff 'splode and I wasn't too worried, but as the film progressed I saw that there was going to be a big problem with one teensy aspect of the experience. The plot was fouled up. In the original film, the hero saves the world (Mars). In this film he saves Australia, sort of, and really, who gives a damn? Nothing against Australia but why not have him save the Earth?? Why not have some kind of, I dunno, nano-technology that can get rid of the chemical weapons poisons that make the planet uninhabitable. Why not allow the hero to literally save the planet by triggering the release of this ""stuff"" that would scrub the planet clean? Why not make the bad guys a little badder, eh? Instead of making them want to just, um, ""take over and stuff"" why not make them truly evil illuminati who want to exterminate most of the human race, then use the ""scrubber"" technology to restore the Earth so that a few (144,000 maybe) super wealthy scumbags can rule over vast kingdoms with robot slaves to make it all work? In this alternate version, the bad guys need to take over in The Colony in order to wipe it ""clean"" of human beings, removing any potential threat before they implement the ""final solution"" and kill off the people in ""The Federation"" and take over, once and for all. So when the hero (Colin Farrell, remember) lamely sabotages the invasion, he could also lamely start the scrubbers in a way to similar to how Arnold turned on the alien air generators in the first movie.Yeah, that would have been good. And at the end, Colin would lamely say ""I just had a terrible thought. That this all might be a dream."" Fade to black.But this ending was not included in the film I saw. I saw an ending that was dumb. Just think of the money they spent on those special effects!! Think of the children who could have gone to school with that money!! We need Colin to go after some other bad guys, I think.But move Kate Beckinsale to a safe location first. We need her to continue to star in ""My Mom is a Superhero"" movies.",Total Recall

She meets and exceeds Sharon Stone's bad wife. She is just relentless and so sharply homicidal you cannot fault her character for not trying (to kill her husband). The same cannot be said for Colin Farrell. His performance seems lethargic at best, liked someone dosed his script with quaaludes. One of the things I like about the original was the humor. They really played the first one as a colorful circus and it was entertaining. Except for one shining moment this film has almost no humor. I know that it more exactly matches the P.K. Dick story but common, give us some one liners! One thing that I will not fault is the special effects. They are excellent from beginning to end. If I only went to see special effects I would give this movie a 10. I was a little disappointed and I think they could have done a lot more.",Total Recall

You can read my review of the original flick, which I had written last month.Where did it all go wrong? Quaid (Farrell, whom I last saw in a sex tape) just runs and runs and surmounts every obstacle thrown in his way. However, the action is nothing new and viewers would have seen all the running, explosions, bullets ricocheting and close-combat fights in other flicks.The flick does pause for a brief moment to ruminate on Quaid's desire to find out about his past, while the rebel leader tells him that the heart wants to live in the present. What new age mumbo jumbo is this?Another problem with the flick is the casting of Farrell. In the original, Arnie looked really confused by what was happening around him and viewers would have empathized with his predicament.Farrell, on the other hand, just seems to be going through the motion.The movie's atmosphere is also nothing new. The teeming crowds amid the rain come from 'Blade Runner' and 'Fifth Element'. The car-chase scene comes from 'Minority Report' and 'Fifth Element'.The idea about robot cops getting ready for an invasion comes from 'I, Robot', and the look of the robots also comes this flick. The one good thing about this flick is Kate Beckinsale, the director's wife, who plays Quaid's wife. She's not one person viewers will want to mess with in a dark alley.

Firstly you know the general idea from the first (and far superior) movie. Secondly its bang this, special effect that; yet it doesn't draw you in.Clearly the writers really felt like pissing off Australia and Australians!In what parallel universe would England become a world power again? And in what parallel universe would Australia willingly call itself ""the colony""?If you want to get technical Australia hosted a collection of separate colonies which later became states. And no, ignorant ones, not all of the colonies/states on Australia proper hosted penal settlements, just three. Britain had just lost America so they had to hurry a slave labour force to what was then called 'New Holland' so the Dutch didn't start making settlements. They sure as hell didn't want to lose control of another continent!But where do you find enough people to do all the work? Arrest everyone, that's how! Most of the ""convicts"" were people who couldn't afford to pay their mortgages. They weren't sending mass-murderers to a sunny paradise. FYI 5% of Australia's population can trace its roots back to convict ancestors, and they are damned proud of it!Australia had Japanese troops on its soil, and its cities were being bombarded. We fought Japan off at the height of its power, and the U.S. joined us to became our closest allies when it became clear the English wanted to send our *kind of busy* soldiers to some side-battle in Burma. Bye bye England, don't call back. OKAY DONE!!So the very idea that this ridiculous speculation about the future of world politics is not only highly unlikely, it seems designed to insult a whole continent from the first few moments.United federation of Britain ... what does that even mean? Why would they dismantle the United Kingdom? Idiotic.Chemical warfare was used by Saddam Hussein against the ever-persecuted Kurds. That land is not uninhabitable. Idiotic plot device.The writers have totally written Mars out of the film. Totally. Now the ""Colony"" replaces Mars and we're all apparently expected to be thrilled by a lame 'drop-train' that goes through the centre of the earth.There is no Mars, no mutant underclass, and, there's little actual connection to the hero of the story nor the villain for that matter. There are a couple of nods at the original but I'm guessing they were more like a slap in the face reminding you of how dreary and predictable this mess actually is compared to the original.""I really thought you were a loser! Turns out I was living with the greatest intelligence agent alive.""When you've finished laughing at the wooden dialogue, does that direct quote give you a sense of the level of the writing on offer here?

229,Austin_Powers-1,Anonymous action film beautifully gift wrapped,4,12 December 2012,"First thought was ""Please God no! Not a remake of Total Recall""!I grew up with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Total Recall has always been one of my favourite action films of all time! No less. Making a remake is in my eyes blasphemy.But now it is here, let's have a look. First the positive: The visuals are stunning and beyond beautiful. Though they have copied the Blade Runner environment, it works and gives the film a much darker atmosphere than the original. Some of the acting is surprisingly good. Though Colin Farrell may sound like an odd choice comparing him with muscle man Arnold Schwarzenegger, he is awesome as the new Douglas Quaid. Kate Beckinsale gives all she has as Lori, though she never reaches Sharon Stone's sexy look.On the negative side: I was quite surprised they didn't explore the ""Total Recall"" universe more than they did. It's focus is primarily on the action. No time for any philosophy on life and who we are and why we do as we do. The humour is non-existing. I'm sure we all remember the scene in the original film where ... SPOILER TO THE ORIGINAL FILM ... Quaid is fighting Richter on the top of an elevator/lift, Richter's arms are ripped off as he is thrown off the lift and Quaid shouts ""See you at the party, Richter."" ... SPOILER END ... The film takes itself way too serious ending up almost as a parody on itself - without ever getting funny , that is. A lot of the characters feels shallow; neither Jessica Biel, Bill Nighy or Bryan Cranston hardly have anything to work with because of the shallow script, and that is a damn shame as their characters never get interesting one tiny bit.So all in all, if you are not familiar with Paul Verhoeven's little masterpiece, you will probably find much joy in ""Total Recall 2012"" with all the action and robots your heart may desire.

It had awe effects, ground breaking makeup, funny moments, very nice story telling and of course Arnie rules..In this 2012 version, there is no doubt leaps and bounds of improvement in Special Effects which is spectacular. Other than this, the story telling falls flat, artificial emotions, fast editing should have been good but here just fast-forwards with action and more action. The lead actors are dull and boring, not even one ounce of comedy, and the pathetic actor called Bokeem so frustrating to see him acting.. we get to see less than 10 minutes of the screen legend Bill Nighy which is like stabbing in the back.. Only saving grace is the perfect figure Kate B and her superwoman fights clearly accentuating her great bod.. Jessica Biel almost runs in every frame.. and astonishingly all i remember apart from those action scenes is.. Colin and Jessica vehemently denying that there are not who they are.. and bla bla.. such boring and uninspiring scenes just gets dragged on and on. As i said earlier, Visual Effects are top notch.. blends between Blade runner, Fifth Element and Minority Report...

231,Jerominator,Woeful Reballs,3,1 April 2013,"For starters I never read the Philip K Dick book so what do I know. Apparently both films have strayed quite a bit from the original, though this was closer in some aspects. Anyways I never read it so can only comment on the movies. All I know is I saw the original and was blown away by it. Something to do with what Paul Verhoevnen did stylewise back then, the fun elements, hell even Arnie's schtick, just made it a groundbreaking fun movie. So only reason I can think of making a remake is to (a) do it better and/or (b) do it more faithful to the book. Well (b) is already out the window by all accounts. So that leaves (a). Now on paper it ought to be better because of effects, and surely Farrell is a better actor than Arnie. Personally I can't stand the rat boy but Christ I've got to give him that. Biel and Beckinsale were also good, in that order. Somehow though, no, for me this was absolutely not better. It lacked all of the style and fun Verhoeven brought to it, and didn't add anything else remotely meriting a remake. I guess it could earn points for a more believable idea of a dystoopic future, but hell who goes to the movies to see an escapist fantasy action film set in THAT place? Not me sir. Give me Verhoeven's vision over that any time. Also, and maybe this is just me getting old, but is anyone else sick to the back teeth of the old just-in-the-nick-of-time bullsh#t upon bullsh#t in action movies, the choreographed Jackie Chanesque fights, the predictable slender women beating the crap out of muscly men?(not even close to ""sexist"" - just realist). This has all been done to death now and then some. The action genre needs to go have a serious rethink or shut up shop.

2/5How did they manage to mess up a remake of Total Recall? They have all the state of the art special effects and everything else yet they managed to make a boring pile of generic rubbish. It's full of watered down wonky edited fight scenes, dull characters and a half baked plot. The first film was very entertaining with exciting action scenes, twists and an interesting setting. The only draw back is it looked dated even back then. With the remake they had the chance to make it look incredible.They changed it drastically. Not to say change is bad but they changed it for the worse. The film was set on Earth instead of Mars and the henchmen were replaced with robotic androids. All in all its just a boring chase thriller with no excitement and zero character development. The music score by Marco Beltrami is not even memorable (It doesn't come close to Jerry Goldsmiths score) It references a lot the stuff from the original film but it just comes across as a desperate attempt to draw the fans in. Colin Farrell just looks bored throughout, Bryan Cranston is bland as the villain and Kate Beckinsale is just annoying as his ex-wife. The original film was an ultraviolet gore fest but this is just a 12A watered down bore fest. Although the cinematography looks good it just looks like a rip off of superior films like Blade Runner and Minority Report.",Total Recall
233,JamesMitchell451,A fun remake,7,21 September 2013,"I have to admit: Total Recall isn't really all that bad for a remake. Total Recall stars Colin Ferrel as a man whos life is down the crapper, basically. Though, personally I don't see how anyone that has hot ass Kate Beckinsale as a wife can be miserable. So he goes to this place called Rekall that messes with your mind, and suddenly a team of soldiers arrives and shoots the place up. From there, he discovers that he is a badass secret agent and now he has to find a way to escape the hostile police force. Let's get this out of the way right now:The remake of Total Recall isn't as good as the original. But it is still a fun ride nonetheless. The special effects and action scenes are awesome. You can always tell what is happening and it is thrilling and intense as hell. Overall, it is a gorgeous, well-shot, and well directed film. The acting and the characters are pretty good as well. Personally, I don't mind that the creators of the remake removed the mars aspect, as it always seemed stupid to me. But the major problem I have with the remake is how predictable it is. If you've seen the original, then you pretty much already know all the twist and turns. If you can forgive that it isn't as good as the original, the remake of Total Recall is a really entertaining, fun as hell ride.",Total Recall
234,haosstoposto,Nothing special – Paul Verhoevens movie is better,4,10 September 2012,"Having seen this newest remake from Hollywood production assembly line I must say that I am disappointed although I did not expect much. Plot in short is as follows: Population of Earth has been decimated in some chemical-warfare holocaust. The only two remaining habitable countries are Great Brittain and Australia. Not surprising, GB is military power and Australia is cheap labor source and both countries are connected via subway which goes straight through Earth core. We have some resistance/terrorist movement and oppressive regime. And amnesiac hero. Special effects are as usual flawless and the dystopian Australia looks amazing. The pacing of the first part of the film is pretty fast but things get boring after we begin to delve deeper into the story. The original movie from 1990 had very clever plot which kept the audience guessing until the end. This time we have some dubious master plan about occupation of Australia which I thought it was some ruse and false trail for the audience but soon I realized that is all there is. To make long story short, it is a very forgettable movie and watered down version of the original. Watch it if you like, you wont gain or lose anything.",Total Recall

However, the movie was such a huge disappointment. I was actually trying to prevent laughing out aloud as the movie escalated towards the Mano a Mano fighting scenes. Maybe first 30 minutes of the film were what I expected, but beyond that:The plot was thin. The movie was actually a collection of various chase sequences. Either on foot or on vehicles. Some of the action parts were actually ridiculous (man vs. machine). The funniest part is that the two leading female actresses were wearing almost identical clothes and hair styles most of time and were kind of hard to actually distinguish which of the two was on the screen at a given time.If you have the chance to choose between this remake and the original version, please do yourself a favor and watch the original.

236,markdroulston,The next unnecessary remake,4,22 August 2012,"have a very large soft spot for the original 1990 Total Recall. Somehow, director Paul Verhoeven managed to infuse a typical goofy 1980s-style action film with some legitimately clever ideas and themes. The movie had its tongue planted firmly in cheek, but achieved its iconic cult status for going beyond being just another Schwarzenegger vehicle.Fast forward to 2012, where director Len Wiseman has stripped away that great combo of intelligence and goofiness, leaving an uninspired, overly serious, and, quite frankly, boring sci-fi action romp, barely held together by solid performances and a largely unaltered core story.Wiseman's update of Total Recall remains true to the original plot (and, I assume, Philip K. Dick's novel) for the most part, with any changes an attempt to ground the film in reality as much as possible. Taking place wholly on Earth rather than travelling to Mars, Total Recall 2012 again follows Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), a production-line worker frustrated by his unremarkable life, who visits the somewhat shady company Rekall in pursuit of memory implants which will offer a more exciting history than his own. All doesn't go to plan however, when a malfunction at Rekall reveals that Quaid is in fact a secret agent whose memory has previously been replaced, kicking off a chase sequence that more or less covers the remainder of the film.The always dependable Farrell commits himself admirably to a role that really doesn't offer much development, and Wiseman surrounds him with a great supporting cast who unfortunately are given very little to do (Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy among others). Jessica Biel falls flat as love interest Melina, but Kate Beckinsale is something of a surprise, relishing her villainous role and chewing every scene she appears in.Unfortunately, Total Recall's story and action can't match the quality of the performances. Unlike the original film, there's never really any doubt about the reality of what Quaid is experiencing. Verhoeven managed an ambiguity which created tension early on, leaving audiences to speculate whether everything was taking place in Schwarzenegger's mind, but Wiseman simply spells everything out plainly. There are numerous references to the original here too, most of which are unnecessary, while some are either needlessly distracting or simply blow by so fast that you wonder why they even bothered.The most egregious flaws however are in the action sequences. Wiseman crafts the film like a platform video game, with characters running and jumping endlessly, stopping occasionally to deliver the next story beat. Perhaps it speaks to my general disinterest with modern video games, but the action sequences feel over-long and repetitive, and at the moments when the film should be at its most fast-paced, it begins to drag.So Len Wiseman's Total Recall isn't the worst remake to come along in recent years, but it's just another gritty reboot that no-one asked for. It suffers in comparison to the original, can't really stand on its own, and feels like an unsuccessful blend of Super Mario Bros. and Blade Runner. What could have been a slice of fun nostalgia is taken far too seriously by a director of questionable talent, leaving Total Recall, despite Farrell and Beckinsale's best efforts, simply the next in an ever-growing lineup of failed retreads.tinribs27.wordpress.com",Total Recall

Total Recall is a remake of Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1990′s campy sci-fi action movie. The original is beloved by some as a fun action movie that takes a neat idea(conceived by the brilliant sci-fi writer Phillip K. Dick) and puts the classic Arnold fun into the mix. This remake goes back to the original and plans to take a more serious take on the same concept and brings Len Wiseman of Underworld fame to direct.

It's not a tribute to Philip K Dick's work, it has no relationship to that whatsoever except for the name of the Recall company.It's not related to the original movie either, the original movie was closer to Philip K Dick's work and it was also slightly more consistent.The current movie is so full of plot holes (why is Hauser's 'wife' trying to kill him, since everybody seems to think that regardless of his allegiance, it's essential for everyone's plans that he remains alive? - I listed several holes in the forum) and so many unreasonable moments that disregard physics (The Fall should be traveling at over 45000 km/h, it would kill Lori if she tried to climb outside, not to mention any rupture would tear the whole thing apart - this is intrinsic to the story as presented, we're not talking explosions in space as for most part it's irrelevant whether a ship implodes or explodes).",Total Recall

242,canadian58,A major disappointment,4,28 September 2013,"As its own movie, it's average at best. As Total Recall, it's terrible. What a clusterf**k to say the least.As its 1990 predecessor is one of my favorite movies of all time, I had little hope that I would be overly impressed by the remake a mere 22 years later. First of all, Total Recall did not need a remake. The original itself is not that old. It's not like it was made back in the 70's. And the worst part? It shows almost no resemblance to the original other than a few familiar names and minor (and I mean very minor) references to the Arnold version.The storyline makes a far-fetched pathetic attempt to follow the original. Hmm, let's see. Take Mars, Kuato, the Martians, Benny the taxi driver, and anything of any importance to the plot, write them out of the script completely, oh, and drop in the three-breasted chick out of nowhere just to please the fans. If anything, that tells me that the writers knew this new script was bad, so they try desperately to add a few entertaining elements from the first film to squeeze another IMDb star out of the viewers.That's right. Mars is completely out of the picture, and in comes the story of chemical warfare on Earth, making 90% of the planet uninhabitable. Add Cohaagen, Lori, and their army of robots (stupid) to chase after Doug Quaid through this post-apocalyptic world for reasons we (the audience) don't even care about anymore.All that being said, had the new Total Recall not had a predecessor that set the bar so high (almost unreachable), it would be a decent movie on its own. Not by any means terrific, but a 6/10 on the IMDb scale. Plenty of action to stay entertaining, and the acting is not bad. I will also compliment the visual effects as being outstanding throughout the entire movie, of course, only what is to be expected of a $120 million budget. Unfortunately, the original holds its head high and crushes the high-dollar remake, proving that no matter how much money you spend, it does not necessarily make a movie good. To the makers of this movie, next time you want to do a remake, pick a movie that was just ""average"" to begin with and make it better. You can't make something better that is already perfect to begin with. Go team Arnold!",Total Recall
243,anagpal,"They lost the plot and characters in the action, sets, gizmo's",5,3 August 2012,"They lost the plot somewhat, actually almost literally, in all the frenetic action sequences, the bullets flying, the fancy gizmos and high speed chase scenes. In the future, where the world is divided into the rulers (United Federation of Britain) and the oppressed workers (The Colony), an ordinary worker (Colin), who yearns for better, decides to go to Rekall, a place which will guarantee him happy memories via a brain chemical implant. His world changes upside down as he discovers he can be a lethal killing machine, so can his hot wife (Kate) and things are definitely not what they seem to be. They kept it reasonably tight till the halfway mark but then it just descended into a cacophony of gunfire, explosions and people yelling at each other. One of the things, though, that intrigue me about futuristic movies is to have a look at the gadgets. They have a knack of becoming real in time to come. The fridge with the digital display, the 'eyeballs' into the room, the mannequins with lights and the phone implant into the palm were all fascinating in the 'I want one of that' kind of way. The sets were impressive, the actors did what they could but it was all too fast and too furious. Never got a chance to really feel for anyone, for us to really care for the characters or their cause.There is something timeless and philosophical though, about the basic premise. That of the Rulers vs the Oppressed. Masters vs Slaves. Many books and films have spoken of it and the way the have's of today are constructing walls around themselves, you do wonder sometimes, if the have-not's patience is wearing thin. Just for provoking that thought and our recall of the gentler, more amiable Arnold Schwarznegger version of 1990, this movie can be given some brownie points.

244,januaryman-1,Good movie gone frenetic,6,25 August 2013,"This movie was hyped relentlessly in the run up to its release. That is usually a bad sign with hype used as a substitute for quality. Total Recall, though, wasn't bad.In fact, Total Recall would have been delightful and engaging were it not for several over the top action scenes in which about a zillion people get gunned down or blown up. These overly long sequences with amazingly quick cuts made me tune out. I watched TR over and over, trying to concentrate on important plot elements. And over and over, I tuned out during the sensory overload scenes. Turn the energy of these scenes back a couple of notches and I might have loved the film.Total Recall is one of those movies that messes with your mind. You're never really sure what it reality and what is imagined or false memory. You have to pay attention if you want the full benefit of this story and it is worth it. The sets are grand, the special effects very nice when the governor was on. The cast does a fine job. The villains are villainous and the heroes heroic.Odd, I thought, was the advanced level of technology, particularly consumer technology, in a post-apocalyptic world. I guess the people of Earth sucked it up and moved on with their lives. And the Brits inheriting the world seemed odd considering I can't remember one British accent in the entire movie, even the part set in the UK.Total Recall is a good little action film.",Total Recall
245,AGood,Very Poor - 4/10,4,4 September 2012,"First of all I rarely rate films as low as 4/10. I can count on one hand the amount I have rated this low. And maybe it is being overly harsh giving this one such a low score. But I am annoyed by this movie as it was such a missed opportunity.Firstly I have never been a major Colin Farrell fan; there is nothing especially wrong with the guy. I just find him a tad condescending, smug and pretty boy acting in every single role he plays. In this movie he was OK, but the weakest link in this movie by far.I mainly went to see this movie as I was interested in another take on the 1990 Paul Verhoeven imaging. With regards to that film. I always thought it was good. But was always confused when people claim it is a classic and one of the greatest sci-fi flicks ever made. Personally I think Robocop is infinitely better film by that very same Director.But I was interested in this film also as Bryan Cranston was playing the Ronny Cox character. I love Breaking Bad and wanted to see anything with him in; I was disappointed to find he was only in this movie for literally 10mins screen time (possibly even less than this). He only says a few sentences in the entire movie.The film I found quite boring and a chore to get through. There was no humour. No get up and go. It was literally Colin Farrell running over drab depressing film sets most of the time.The way they handled the ""come out of the dream"" sequence was poor too. But on saying that I did feel Bokeem Woodbine was the standout performance of the entire film. I just felt it should not be him dealing with this particular scene as it was odd and ill fitting. But he should have been in this movie much more than this.The ending was dreadful. I also found the answer of was it a dream was it real which they went for giving a definitive answer this time round. I felt they took the wrong choice - Spoilers below - I feel a much better ending would have been it being all a dream and the ending being Hauser (Farrell) waking up from the Recall machine experience and going home now completely hesitant and mistrusting of his wife and friends from this experience he had from Recall would have been a much better and memorable ending with a good psychological twist to the story and if they had of done this would have elevated they story somewhat.Overall do not see this movie. Wait till it comes on DVD. Movies need to earn their cinema fee's and this does not. It is just a poor chase movie nothing more, nothing less. And better chase movies currently exist on DVD e.g Minority Report. The Terminator. The Island. See them instead.",Total Recall

Why The Hate?,9,21 June 2017,"Before i start this review i must say i never knew about the 1990 original before watching this version & i do not wish to watch the original as I personally struggle to watch old films due to resolution... So this review is based on me only watching the modern 2012 version :) I found this movie by rummaging around in Poundland's Blu-Ray section, saw the front cover with some guy in a like a head-set type thing, thought it could be to do with the future / Sci-Fi, read the back bio & boom, here i am reviewing a awesome £1 Blu-Ray movie. Okay so I'm a sucker for anything Sci-Fi / Future type movies, the CGI in this movie is top notch, its looks clean, smart & real. When starting to watch the movie & realise it was almost 2 hours long (Extended Cut) i almost knew it would be good! The film is set in the future where chemical warfare has left most of the world uninhabitable & only 2 ""areas"" are safe, one in Britain & the other in Australia, the only way to get to either is through a train like thing straight through the middle of the earth. The film starts off with good decent action so it doesn't bore you with loads of story before hand, speaking of the story & plot it was very easy to understand & follow which was easy on the mind while watching. Through a lot of the film there is quite a bit of action which the scenes are decent & well played & acted. I grew to like the main good side characters & hate the bad side, the actors where good, they all suited their role & clothing was well thought out to, not to mention the awesome future / Sci-Fi robots police that looked awesome. Bad points; I'm not sure of any of the top of my head, I didn't have any complaints about the story, or what happened then or where etc. I felt like i was informed of everything that i needed to know. You may all be reading this thinking am i mad, this movie is rubbish, nope i loved it.

Looks like the new director is following the new protocol with women in movies today: make them as tough as the guys. So it appears hes eliminated Richtor and put his muscles into Laurie. Whatever! Im sick of Hollywood trying to convince us women are just as tough as men. Its getting embarrassing how almost every action movie these days try to re-write genetics.

Yeah, they thrown in the head change device (though most think the first Recall was even more elaborate), the wife's role, etc...to mirror the original, but I liked the storyline much better than the original. The whole Mars thing was just silly to me, which many liked in the original. I though it provided comedic relief in the first, and threw the film a little off balance. No such luck in this sequel. The ""good"" wife is like what the comedian Bill Burr describes a woman as a ""psycho robot...relentless."" Oh, yeah, Kate Beckinsale lived up to the relentless part just fine, and there was NO, let me repeat NO, comedic relief. Biel and Beckinsale were both excellent with Beckinsale, I think, having a slight edge in prowess and intensity. 40% of voters so far have given the film a 10, which is more than most movies averaging 7-8.

It's so obvious Hollywood focus-grouped the screenplay to death in order to pander to the teen and pre-teen boy segment of the movie going public! Too bad Philip K.

First of all, everyone knows it won't be able to top the original. It's not like with remakes like The Thing (1982) or King Kong (2005), where it's a modern re-telling of an old sci-fi movie that used to look great, but now doesn't. That's when remakes succeed. But when some idiots decide to remake something like Total Recall, a movie that's only 22 years old, that's when you know why people don't respond positively when they hear about remakes. The original Total Recall is not really outdated. It's got practical effects that look great, and that don't need a CGI-makeover. It's like if they would remake Return of the Jedi. It's a movie that looks great even today, and won't be saved by a bunch of CGI objects that look just as unrealistic as the practical effects of the original film.But the new Total Recall takes dull remake to a whole new level. First off, it drops all the monsters and potential for effects from the original film, and keeps the same story going on on Earth. This makes the movie bland.There are four key elements that make the original Total Recall enjoyable: The humor, the mystery, the practical effects and Arnold Schwarznegger. Let's see how the remake translates these elements: 1. The new Total Recall has very little sense of humor. It's a dark and gritty movie. It's only gags are small references to the original film that don't make sense or just plain fall flat. 2. The mystery aspect of the original was an enjoyable part of the original, because you were unsure if ""it was real, or if it was Recall"". But in the remake, it's now turned into a cryptic mess with bad writing and no interesting characters. 3. The potential for effects is gone and the rest is just CGI. 4. The actor for this movie can't beat Arnold Schwarznegger! No one can for this role!I'm not gonna say it totally sucks. I gave it a 5/10, because at the start, it does establish a fine universe with a sympathetic friend-character and a cool-looking take on the future of Earth.

Total Recall entertains to a certain extent, but fails to deliver the wow factor one might expect for a big budget futuristic gloom & doom film. It comes off feeling like a retread of something we've all seen before. Almost like a little brother trying to hard to be like Steven Spielberg's Minority Report.Director, Len Wiseman, best known for his Underworld films, leans too much on the slow-mo action effect. The technique comes off as cheesy when used too much, and was the downfall of Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes films, and everything Michael Bay gets his hands on.Writers Kurt Wimmer (Salt, Law Abiding Citizen) & Mark Bomback (Live Free or Die Hard, Race to Witch Mountain) fail to truly develop the characters enough to make you really care about any of them. Lots of action scenes are always nice, but if you don't give your audience a reason to root for the hero or hate the villains (especially the highly underused Bryan Cranston) then what's the point.Total Recall is not a bad film, but isn't a good one either.

An have a breather.You know what I mean if you already seen it.I have to admit the beginning of the movie had potential it was as if it was going somewhere, sci-fi or cyberpunk related theme or matrix innuendo with mind games etc with maybe a bit of philosophy, science or corporate greed whatever. Unfortunately it doesn't go in any direction its vacuous.There is literally 'no pacing' in this movie except the first few mins and the piano scene, if you decided you wanted to take a leak, by the time you get back the action is still going. ""Did I miss anything of the story?"" No, because there is no story, I thought he was trying to get to Mars at one stage, but then it got weird like Bourne Identity, Minority Report, I Robot, Stormtrooper weird. And Douglas Quaid is still stuck at the airport and on Earth.I give this movie good points for the graphics and the action but only to an extent, I actually thought there would be a sequel to explain more in detail because I knew the movie was going to end without explaining anything. No main villain (played by Bryan Cranston) would show up in person infront of the main hero unless it was strictly of importance, his got no hierarchy of henchmen or subordinates doing his ill will except for Kate Beckinsale's character and even she was acting alone, being all terminator throughout the whole movie. You exactly feel the villains are going to die abruptly just because there was too much running around and explosions throughout the movie.There's no room for dialogue. Wished they actually gave character development.All I can say is, if you have already seen the original Total Recall, and was hoping it would have better graphics but still retain some of the story, you will end up having mixed feelings.For people who haven't seen the original you're lucky because you can see this Colin Farrell version as a prequel and then watch the Arnold version afterwards.

Total Recall was a good candidate for a remake.Dan O'Bannon and Ron Shusett had delivered a clever expansion of Dick's short story, but the movie was weakened by poor production design, Verhoeven's taste for unnecessary gore and a typically hopeless performance by Schwarzenegger.This version has tackled all three weaknesses. The design is good (although too derivative of films like Blade Runner and The Fifth Element), the gore has largely disappeared and Colin Farrell is at least some kind of actor. I ought to be more enthusiastic than I am.The problem is that the remake has weaknesses of its own.The design gives us a world and a technology that looks good but doesn't convince. I couldn't help asking why the highly-developed economy and technology that allowed the construction and maintenance of the floating cities, and could drive a lift shaft right through the centre of the Earth, was unable to reclaim the wilderness that covered most of the planet.The excessive gore of the original has been replaced by excessive action. Fights and chases are all over-choreographed, over-long and over-elaborate. I suspect this picture would be significantly improved if it was re-cut to remove at least 10 or 15 minutes of the repetitive action.The actual story hasn't changed much which makes it all the more frustrating that the changes that have been made are both marginal and ill-conceived. Why introduce the unconvincing technology and the 'blasted Earth' scenario if they will play no part in the story? Why eliminate Mars and replace it with that elevator to Australia nonsense? It feels like change for its own sake.Rather than alleviating the frustration of the first version, this Total Recall has doubled it.Instead of one botched attempt to tell a potentially good story, we now have two.",Total Recall
255,BharatSamra,You will not Totally Recall it after a month or so,6,14 September 2012,"Having not seen the 1990 original, nor read the 1966 short story by Philip K. Dick, I had an objective approach to 'Total Recall', despite perhaps being exposed to too much of the narrative in the over marketed trailers.To parallel with football, 'Total Recall' is only highly enjoyable when in one third of its surface. The initial 40 minutes deploy a well structured pace that embodies a fascinating plot, interesting character interactions as well as the astonishing aesthetics via advanced technology and the overall mise en scene. The only other 2012 blockbuster to surpass 'Total Recall' visually so far is 'Prometheus'. Following some inevitable product placement on a Yamaha piano, the film begins to exacerbate in quality, and becomes the foreseen overindulgent chaotic action film that it was destined to be. More bullets are fired than the amount of dollars used to create the science fiction picture, and you become disengaged from an otherwise engaging concept, spoiled as the action genre overtakes the sci-fi in a race for increased viewership.There isn't actually all that much one can say about 'Total Recall', it touches on futuristic political tension quite poorly and like the British weather, amends itself back to generic dullness after its enjoyable, yet brief time in the sun. There are no highly memorable moments or scenes, partly because the dialogue is quite standard, with of course the odd drop of tasteless humour, though the acting can be admired throughout, especially our protagonist played by Colin Farrell, whom convincingly expresses this ambiguous sense of a lost identity, and searches for it as you believe there is something large missing from him, immediately as he is introduced in his establishing shot. It feels the extended plot line of political unrest is incorporated in order to appeal to a wider audience and include what becomes mindless incessant action, though some sequences can be applauded for their cinematography via tracking camera shots and smooth choreography.'Total Recall' is something you will not totally be able to recall probably in a month, it is a rather forgettable film that had great potential to further develop its key unique component of, well, REKALL, though it failed to do this. I found the Len Wiseman project to be surprisingly enjoyable, via theatricality due to the visual setups and sophisticated use of the revolutionary technology that was to me, one of the only aspects of the film which kept it watchable as we progressed through the middle and final third of the playing field. Unfortunately however, what would a plot hole filled film be without its predestined decadency?",Total Recall
256,richy1024,Futuristic remake makes a buyout impression!,7,27 September 2012,"The definition of the word 'remake' in film is generally accompanied with 'disappointment', 'too much change' and 'not following the virtues of the original story'. Paul Verhoeven's 1990 Mars epic Total Recall can be deemed to be one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's booming and exultant projects outside the Terminator succession. The wonderful eye popping sequences, the lady with three breasts and a few mane-haul tussles between Rachel Ticotin and Sharon Stone rallied it as an unconditional classic, apart now from being summoned to repetitive screenings on broadcast television every year.Len Wiseman's efforts with his adaptation are far less exuberant by means of eye popping motions. Yes we do have the woman with the talented chest and several fracases between two fierce and unaffected women (Kate Beckinsale as Lori Quaid and Jessica Biel as Melina), but this account only provides us with a mere mention of Mars and no aliens. Instead, Wiseman's showpiece is swift from the off. This is a darker edition that maximises the meaning of a secret as Colin Farrell's Douglas Quaid seems far more proletarian than Schwarzenegger's, excavating his grassroots without even completely understanding who he is or why Rekall eradicated all sense of his undercover agent role. In place of reality Quaid (or Hauser as he is also to be known) is an ambitious factory worker, dreaming of dissimilar outcomes in life rather than effectively producing the bots that endeavour to take his life. Farrell spends a bulk of the narrative running in all directions to stay animate whilst pealing off the resistance to discontinue Chancellor Cohaagen and his Colony's efforts for dominance.The aesthetics of this Recall are principally beautiful, reminding us of balcony scenes in The Matrix sagas with Keanu Reeves. Farrell has the exquisiteness of leaning over a futuristic Australia that evokes life in Hong Kong and Bangkok. The city of London is rather picturesque in also with floating constructs and enabling cars to hover over those still on wheels. This undeniably catches our gaze but fails to blemish the vast sum of information passed onto its audience. There is a lot of it and delivered with distinct briskness due to the film's unremitting need to be in motion. Therefore, the characters do suffer from any profound development, noticeably in Beckinsale's and Biel's case, perceptibly being scripted to learn how to clutch a firearm and to do ample amounts of cardio.Wiseman's 2012 dynamic and suspenseful thriller has had to bear a luggage full of anticipation and contrast from its pre-packed original twenty-two years ago. Apart from visual similes it does boast its own premise by plotting an altered set-up at an accelerated tempo which is forever accompanied with sensual disappointment due to a deficiency in story development. Another fateful facet is that of the variation in acting qualities. Despite Farrell's divergent acting merits being far superior than those of the Schwarzenegger, forlornly the big man himself will wrongly be remembered over the Irish fellow himself.",Total Recall

That means the mutants are replaced with poor people, the cool dusk-red settings replaced with bleak ruined or clean white cities, original interesting ideas replaced with stale overdone tropes.Other than the major plot beats, nothing is endearing about this film. Not the characters, not the dialogue and not the humour. No 'start the reactor', no 'I've got five kids to feed', no 'consider it a divorce'. Instead we get endless barrage of faceless white security robots, unengaging CGI, incomprehensible fight scenes, a rushed bolted-on ending and SO MUCH LENS FLARE!Worst of all, they cast Bill Nighy, the most British man other than Patrick Stewart, as an American leader of an underground resistance based in London.

This is where assembly-line worker Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) works. Residents are transported daily half way around the globe to and from their jobs in Columbia Pictures reinvention of ""Total Recall"".After strange dreams of unexplainable action sequences invade his sleep, Quaid begins to feel his life with wife of seven years Lori Quaid (played by Kate Beckinsale) is inadequate and that there is a greater calling for him. He decides to take a visit to Total Rekall where better memories can be implanted and undertakers of the Total ReKall transplants can allow them to experience their most sought-after desires. Most, of which are men's fantasies of having a mistress,even if they already have one. That's a no, no that cancels each other out. When Quaid gets strapped up to the Total Rekall machine, he learns his true identity in a very unexpected way.Soon, many revelations are laid in front of him. And his life isn't so dull after all. In fact, it's being threatened by the very hidden agency he works for and in the process helping his cohort, Melina (Jessica Biel) set out to save the world from tyranny.Directed by Len Wiseman and screenplay by Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback,""Total Recall"" is inspired by a famous short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"" by Philip K. Dick, which sounds much better than this movie is. Of course, in it's third generation, the second being the 1990 version of ""Total Recall"" starring Sharon Stone and Arnold Schwarzenegger some things have definitely been lost in translation. Going from a well-balanced lit environment in the 1990 ""Total Recall"" to one that is dark, dingy, cold, wet and very similar to ""The Blade Runner's atmosphere it was begging for a comparison. ""The Blade Runner"" wins hands down.Two of the strongest leads are played by Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale. The other female co-star that took-on a starring role all on its own is Kate Beckinsale's hair! While watching the choreographed fighting scenes, it only made me wish I was watching ""The Expendables"" again. If a movie is going to rely so heavily on fighting scenes, then no movie does this better than ""The Expendables"".If you want to see ""Total Recall"" the original, then rent ""Total Recall"" the 1990 version.

260,faisal_khatib,I'd put this down as a huge disappointment and honestly I think I would have preferred watching the original again instead.,4,25 October 2012,"If it's not broken, don't fix it. Unfortunately Director Len Wiseman has done just that by removing and replacing what was good in the original 'Total Recall' (1990) by a lot of 'mediocre'.By the end of the 21st century, earth has been devastated from chemical warfare leaving only two habitable territories, i.e. the United Federation of Britain (UFB) and the Colony (Australia). A factory worker named Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) along with thousands of others travels every day from the Colony to UFB via ""The Fall""; an elevator that travels through the earth's core. Happily married to Lori (Kate Beckinsale), Quaid dreams are marred by a single memory that he doesn't remember having. Tempted to figure things out, he visits a company that implants artificial memories called 'Rekall' that flicks a switch in his head pushing him into the life he was made to forget.Colin Ferrell as Quaid is trying to fill shoes too big for him. Even though Arnold Schwarzenegger was never known for his acting prowess; his larger-than-life screen presence, odd funny one-liners and to an extent his accent brought more soul to the role than Ferrell manages. Instead, chooses to go through the places with a dead-serious attitude while sporting a frown. Also, Ferrell fails to relay to the viewers the sense of confusion Quaid must be feeling. Where he does shine is in the action sequences, from knocking out a SWAT team to free-running across rooftops.Kate Beckinsale as UFB agent Lori is like the terminator that refuses to die. Apart from constantly chasing and beating up Quaid throughout the film, Kate has little else to do so she trolls through the film with just a few expressions and not much acting. Jessica Biel (as Melina) wasn't any better with zero chemistry and role curve.When Bryan Cranston (as Cohaagen) first appeared on the screen, hopes were raised for a brilliant showdown between good and bad. Some intelligent argument was expected, but instead we got the 'done to death' old-man-fist-fights-with-young-man climax. John Cho's (McClane) acting skills were wasted while Bokeem Woodbine as Harry was quite convincing in his short role.Coming from the Underworld films, Len Wiseman shows great understanding of how an action scene should be shot. Sensational CGI, sleek editing and brilliant cinematography add great finesse to the film. Unfortunately, a spoon-fed screenplay results in a toned-down sci-fi film that becomes a bore-fest of pointless subplots, awkward chemistry and unwanted action sequences. The soundtrack by Harry Gregson-Williams is mediocre and how ever beautiful the cinematography is, the content doesn't always make sense.I honestly didn't enjoy it.

261,rbstern,Disappointing remake,4,15 May 2013,"A good cast, unfortunately matched up with a script that falls woefully short of the star quality. As is too often the case, over-the-top, hard-to-believe action scenes are added in place of story substance, which detracts from a plot that has more potential.I found ""the fall"" concept to be a reasonable substitute for the Mars colony in the original movie. But the dichotomy between the two ""worlds"" isn't as naturally apparent as the original movie, and the filmmakers didn't work hard enough to create a compelling story for why the invasion was necessary.Kate Beckinsale's performance topped the rest of the cast, but even her role was worn out by the end of the movie, having survived dozens of certain-death scenes. Just too hard to believe.Colin Farrel can be great in the right role, and this role wasn't that. Not his fault. Jessica Beal was there for eye-candy impact. Her uninspired performance added little. Last but not least, when Bryan Cranston manages to give an unmemorable performance, you know the film has problems.This movie banked on the title appeal of the original. Yet, they still spent money for top-shelf stars. The potential for modern special effects to make a good story even better, actually made it worse.No matter who the stars are or how big the explosions, movie-making is still, first and foremost, about storytelling.Total Recall fails in this regard.",Total Recall
262,ajrcvr,"Illogical, with Holes!",3,13 January 2014,"There are so many things wrong with this film, it's truly amazing. First, if Lori (wife) doesn't think he's Hauser, who does she think he is? We don't know. Later, if Cohaagen wants to return Quaid to Hauser, he's going to get the same person, since Hauser had already decided to defect from Cohaagen and bond himself to Melina. Next, when Quaid & Melina meet up with Matthia and they use a machine to look into his mind (which happens to look exactly at the thing they want to see, instead of the trillions of other things one would have in his mind), they do this only a couple of minutes after arriving. Quaid & Melina have been travelling a long while to get to Matthias, perhaps an hour or so (we don't know, but it's long), and so they are a long way away from Cohaagen and Lori, yet as soon as they begin to look at Quaid's mind, they are instantly linked up with Cohaagen (by magic it would seem, since there is no scientific mechanism for this), COhaagen,Lori and a whole bunch of their mechanical amazons are immediately right outside their door and burst in! Not believable. And ""The Fall"" apparently goes through the Earth, where the ""gravity is reversed"" as they come out the other side? Sure. The center of the Earth would melt any metal trying to go through it at some 10,000 degrees. And then there is this fairly scrawny Lori being this top fighter who can stay even with Hauser in a fight, a man who is the best agent they ever had: she's totally not believable and it becomes a joke to watch. I suppose they picked her because of her role in the ""Underworld"" series, but that was pure fantasy and anything can happen; in sci-fi, things have to be more factual and believable. She's not. Pretty much the same for Colin Ferrel, who is certainly no Schwartzenegger. These are just a few of the many constructs, from the elevators to the cars, all of which are pure fantasy (eg., What propels the magnetic cars forward?), not science fiction, which makes the movie become a cartoon that you can't take seriously on any level. It does not have the science or believability of the first ""Total Recall"" nor the cohesiveness that film maintained all the way through.

265,darkraven_109,Mediocre at Best,4,4 November 2012,"Due to a busy schedule, I was only able to catch TOTAL RECALL (2012) long after its release date and I was a bit surprised that the remake to one of my favorite Schwarzenegger movies wasn't the total failure I was expecting. But just because it managed to redeem itself doesn't mean that the movie was any good; rather, TOTAL RECALL the remake is one of the most mediocre films I've seen this year.I wasn't expecting the most original Ridley Scott level sci-fi story from the remake but to call the storyline of the new RECALL as ""cliched"" is an understatement. The whole movie is a cliché-ridden mess; if you've seen enough sci-fi and action movies, you'll lose track of the number of clichés and tropes you could find if you were to try listing every single one of them down. TOTAL RECALL has every cliché you could think off, from the evil inhuman corporate executive right down to the bomb with a timer. Aside from that, the remake managed to turn the original simple but very entertaining action movie into a flat, cliché-ridden piece that made the fatal mistake of taking itself too seriously (the socio-political themes didn't work out one bit in this movie for me).The action isn't even worth the price of admission; it feels too watered down(even for a PG-13 movie)to be impressive or even thrilling at the least. Bullets and punches may have been fired and thrown all over the place and car chases are abundant in the movie but never is the adrenaline of any good action movie felt.The acting, on the other hand, was actually good for an action movie. Colin Ferell plays a believable worker thrown into a complicated situation and for this, TOTAL RECALL gets some points from me. But even if he and the rest of the cast were fairly competent in their acting, the lines that came out of their mouths were anything but that. Good actors can only show their skills well if the script they're working with is good but in this case, good actors were given a mediocre by-the-numbers action movie script. The lines came out as cheesy and forced most of the time (especially the ones that are supposed to make you ""think"") and almost all of the plot is spoonfed to the audience. You could see the twists coming a mile away since the movie wasn't even intent on keeping them secret; they were just told right off the bat.Another positive element in the movie was its visualization of the future. While not the most original since almost every future looks like a BLADE RUNNER knock-off these days, at least some of the imagery was striking enough to be remembered. Problem is, though, not all of the scenes were impressive due to the lackluster CGI used. Despite a large budget, most of the scenes looked obviously and painfully fake due to the over-reliance on green-screen effects and the like. Thanks to this, the admittedly interesting future cities aren't engaging at all.TOTAL RECALL is far from being a total failure but it isn't anything interesting. There are plenty of good sci-fi action movies out there that engage you in their respective universes and make you think/ reflect on certain things while at the same time entertain you with impressive action scenes; this rendition of TOTAL RECALL is not one of those. Watching the new TOTAL RECALL is the equivalent of watching your friend play a video game; it's fun too look at, it looks cool but you don't really care since you're not immersed in the world anyway. It's just eye candy, and not even good or entertaining eye candy at that.",Total Recall

Total Recall is a very well done movie and it does not deserve these destructive reviews. A person that rates this film with 1 out 10 stars doesn't deserve to be heard because it is not an opinion it is an attack. The level of detail in the costumes, the props, the weapons, the locations, the CGI was simply outstanding compared to other projects. Some argue that the old movie was better... isn't it always? When did a remake ever get better reviews as the original? It's just how people click.An objective person would tell you that both movies been great for their time, Total Recall 2012 was a fantastic remake, I was afraid the story would follow exactly after the original but it didn't and after the first 25 minutes you get to see a whole new movie and cannot be certain of the outcome.This was one of Colin Farrel's better performances since ""Phone Booth"" and Kate Beckinsale must have a cosmetic secret because she looks better every year.Total Recall is a mix of MATRIX meets STAR WARS meets TRON LEGACY, rounded up with brilliant locations and a very decent cast.This is most definitely the most under-appreciated movie of the year and you should not listen to haters giving a spectacle like this only 1 star because these reviews aren't fair or objective.",Total Recall

Only a couple of devices from the original made it to this version; the fantasy sim company called Rekall (sic) and a few character names. Oh, and a black guy named Benny.The original was so much more mysterious; ancient alien technology, aliens, and mutants. This version had none of the above.It had some easter eggs for fans of the original, but A) there was no need for the triple breasted woman, we are not told that there are mutants, and there is no story behind any body being mutated, so it was stupid and didn't have the comic impact of the original. The other easter egg was B) the disguise Arnold wears in the original- the red- headed woman... you'll see her in the new version. But it's just a shout out to the original, and it's basically where similarities stopped.I enjoyed that it wasn't a carbon copy and thought the espionage part was done well and the action sequences were OK.I was able to shrug off the ""Fall"" and its defiance of physics until it became a major plot point:SPOILERSFor one, I don't need science (as others have already used) to know that GB is not directly on the other side of the world from Australia, which is fine, but the Fall goes strait through the core in the movie. I also don't need science to know that the pressure would be crushing for anything to move through the core, and that it would also be too hot for anything to be near without melting (ie the shaft that the fall elevator goes through and the actual elevator). Also, I'm pretty sure building a super structure that spans the entire globe would collapse under pressure or change the magnetic characteristics of the planet.I also don't need science to know that it is highly improbable for a person to set a 30-minute bomb before reaching the core, and it not go off until 4 minutes after reaching the surface... there are vehicles that fast, but our elevator in this movie was going slow enough for people to WALK ON ITS SURFACE WHILE IN MOTION. That's when this guy dropped from a 7 to a 4 for me, there has to be some realism in sci-fi or the movie loses its suspension of reality and becomes nonsense. The Fall elevator also led to the worst part of the plot: ""Let's put our entire militia and leader/president on one vehicle with one entry point and try to invade a city"".

It was a typically overblown affair as you would expect from Dutch OTT artist Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger pretending to look like he's a construction worker. It came at a time before CGI would become a large part of films (T2 came out in 1991) and as such, it used miniatures as well as cunning practical effects. The only fully CGI sequence in the film is the visually arresting x-ray scanner fight scene.Enter 2012's version and what you have a fully integrated CGI world in the style of The Fifth Element and Blade Runner with a few nice addition touches. It seems that a large amount of the $125 million budget went on CGI because the film looks great. Both the world that the film takes place in as well as the larger scale action scenes look utterly convincing. The production design in the sets is also really good, the Chinese/Russian influences on the world, architecture and objects really helps create this future. The cast are all attractive (seriously, Kate Beckinsale = very attractive) and when they get hurt, it's bruises and cuts in that 'movie/sexy' way that never happens. In terms of visual appeal, it is stunning to look at. No doubt.Then there is the story. Based on a Philip K. Dick novel, the set-up is identical to the 1990 version, worked unhappy with his life dreams of something bigger, hears of Rekall (as it is in the 2012 version), where they implant you with the memory of an event that never actually happened but you can't tell the difference. At this point, Colin Farrell suddenly becomes philosophical master, debating with John Cho's salesman about the authenticity of illusions. However, it would be a quick film is Farrell left the building then and there but unfortunately for his character, Douglas Quaid, he agrees to have the memories of a secret agent implanted (a nice touch earlier is Quaid reading The Spy Who Loved Me on his way to work). Turns out Farrell is ALREADY a secret agent and was Rekalled as a lowly construction worker.The chase begins.There are so many elements that are identical to the 1990 film, the double agent wife (spoiler?), the guy who tries to convince Quaid that he's still at Rekall (although this version is worse at that scene), the three breasted prostitute makes an appearance for no reason at all apart to remind people of the original, which seems odd because the overall style and attitude of the 2012 version is utterly different from the ultra-violent and camp 1990 version. There are a few other nods to the original film that you would need binoculars to spot, luckily I had my theatre pair so I caught them good. So you end up with many of the main plot elements of the original being excised, Mars being the main one. The bad guy, Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston) is trying to get hold of one important amenity instead of the 'ultimate power source' of the original film.I guess I didn't have many problems with the new film in theory. It is well directed, it looks fantastic and the action is well done. The script verges violently from pretty good (mainly Colin Farrell) to downright terrible (Bill Nighy says some pure rubbish) with some cliché in between. The last scene is totally not needed, in fact, there is a bit when it fades to black before the last scene and that would have been the PERFECT mind messing ending. But no, they need the guy to get the girl. All in all, I was expecting this film to be bad and whilst it doesn't hold a candle to the 1990 version, it is by all rights a reasonable, yet flawed, film.",Total Recall

But I try not to give too much away, because frankly, if you want to know what's in the movie, go see the movie. But had been looking forward to this for some time, and it was not disappointing. Remakes generally suck, of course. I think this was a better movie than the original as far as production and cinematography, but there were some problems. In the original Arnie seemed to have some trouble with the idea that his memory might have been altered; in the original, Colin questioned it once and then sort of said ""Fuck it, okay."" But the action scenes were well put together. Some a little too long for no apparent reason, but still good. Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel were awesome, Kate even more so. I know I've spent too much time watching Soap Net when I was waiting for the two of them to fall into a swimming pool while fighting. Much like the first, of course (and rightly so) we never know if it all really happened or if it was just an implanted memory. But still, it was fun.",Total Recall
275,houghtonetet,Stylish remake,7,12 September 2012,"This is a handsome and entertaining chase movie through a dystopian future set about a century from now. It is a darker and less humorous version of the 1990 original with a thinner plot and script but superior SFX. Comparisons with Verhoeven's original are inevitable but this film stands on its own merits and is an enjoyable two hours of mayhem.Colin Farrell takes the part of Quaid/Hauser this time round and though he has the ability to carry the film, doesn't have much acting to do other than look confused at his character's identity and concerned at the role he plays in the conflict between the UFB and the Colony. He brought the same quality of gloomy angst that Christian Bale brought to Terminator Salvation. He and Jessica Biel are competent in their roles, while Bryan Cranston is a little colourless as Cohaagen, and a highly unlikely hand-to-hand fighter. Kate Beckinsale, however, is superb as Lori and steals the movie. She injects nearly all its energy and purpose and shows the greatest acting range, besides looking great throughout.The CGI was excellent and I enjoyed the ""Bladerunner"" look of the Colony. There was an exhilarating car chase in the same sort of vein as in the ""Fifth Element"". I liked the robot police, although they must have trained with the Imperial Stormtroopers.I was disappointed at the lack of screen time Bill Nighy had as Matthias, the Resistance leader. Such an important character deserved more of a part.It seemed a very expensive commute for lowly factory workers from the Colony to the UFB just to make robots, I didn't quite get the logic of this.There was little humour, but wise-cracking one-liners would have been at odds with the dark tone of the film. I felt the sense of what was real and what was a dream was not made the most of. The only time this was explored satisfactorily was the scene in the condo foyer between Quaid, Melina and Harry, and this scene at least worked rather well.A good afternoon's entertainment and I will probably buy the DVD.7/10",Total Recall
276,ericzillazillo,A total blast I will not recall,8,13 November 2012,"I have not seen the original Total Recall, so I went in the theater unbiased, thus will be my review. Frankly, I loved it. Total Recall (2012) is good entertainment- a brilliant action film with (I presume) stunning visual effects, an interesting idea and (thank god) a decent story-line. Total Recall tells the story of Colin Farrell finding out that he is not Arnold Swasticanagger, and in a un-inceptiony dream that is not a dream, does a lot of cool action stuff, meets a 3-boobed prostitute and finds out who he really is- a good actor... I thought the acting was decent. As for all that futuristic car driving, frankly, I personally think the action involved is much better than Inception, but then again nobody compares Inception with the remake of Total Recall. There is in whole not a lot to complain about in this film, although I would have liked the intense tension-filled scenes to be replaced by swift decisive action, but no director ever does that. A underrated gem in today's dark age of bad films, Total Recall is a great film to see if you haven't seen the original (statement based on mediocre reviews from those who have seen the original), and whatever the ticket price is, it's worth it. Of course, it's not awesome enough to make you see it again and again, but you will enjoy it throughout the brief 2 hours you watch it.",Total Recall
277,johnnyrj,Shampoo Commercial/Movie,5,15 December 2012,"I honestly have nothing against any of the actors in this movie. Farrell is a lucky guy to be working with Beckinsale and Biel who are both quite delicious, and Bryon Cranston is an absolutely amazing actor, however, it felt like it was too soon for Mr. White to be making an appearance in a movie. As of writing this review Breaking Bad hasn't finished yet so it just seems weird to have Heisenberg doing anything else right now. I kept waiting for Jesse to appear.It's not that Beckinsale isn't lacking beauty, but it seemed like the director was all too focused on her look the entire time. She looks great, her makeup looks great, her hair looks perfect, but it started to feel like a shampoo or hair color commercial after a while. There were numerous slow motion or still shots of her that felt contrived and geared towards showing off her look instead of her acting. Not that she's ever done anything that epic. She does the action thing just fine but sometimes I think they're making her character tougher than her frame would actually support because she's such a tiny little thing.Colin Farrell is just, you know, Colin Farrell. I can't rip on the guy too much because he stays busy, he stays in shape and he's working with some great people and beautiful women, it's just that I keep waiting for him to do something really epic that really digs into his acting skills. I mean something that really grabs you, and in turn, nabs him an Oscar. I think he's got it in him, but it definitely wasn't in this movie.Biel is really starting to grow on me. I'm believing her characters and I just like her overall because something about her just seems REAL. There wasn't anything spectacular about her in this movie, but she didn't kill it either. Much like Collin, I'm waiting for Jessica to do something so epic that it gets her at least a Golden Globe if not an Oscar. I loved her in The Illusionist. Absolutely LOVED that movie and her character specifically. Eventually a director will come along that can see through the action and obvious beauty and really bring out what I believe to be some serious acting skills which haven't quite been fully tapped yet.Aside from the actors and acting, the movie is a festival of eye candy. Lovers of the sci-fi visuals will not be disappointed, however, that's about all you are going to get. Although this one had a decent story which didn't try to copy the original scene for scene, the original story was far more interesting.Not an unpleasant experience and a decent way to kill 2 hours.",Total Recall

Blade Runner / 5th Element style cities but without the rain.5. Dialogue is weak. Quite a few pointless conversations about the meaning of life and the past.6.

280,nyshrink,Fun; Not as Good as Original,8,3 August 2012,"Although I recognize the outlines of the plot, this is a very different movie from Paul Verhoeven's 1990 classic. The humor and the wacky scenes are gone. The fast pace and the characters remain. There are far more explosions in this version; sadly they don't add that much to the suspense. Basically, this is a hard story to ruin, so it's still pretty good. In addition, Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel do good work and the movie clearly cost a lot of money, with a lot of attention to detail in the production design.What I missed the most from the original were Sharon Stone and Michael Ironside. I'm not very familiar with Kate Beckinsale's work; I wonder if she is an awful actress all the time or just in this movie. I had thought from photos that she was quite beautiful, but for some reason Sharon Stone was much sexier. Or maybe it's just that Stone is a much better actress. In retrospect the scenes with Stone in the original seem classic. There is nothing memorable about the scenes with Beckinsale, yet strangely she has many more scenes that Stone did in the original. Oh wait, it's because Beckinsale is married to the director. There should be a rule in Hollywood; nobody should be allowed to cast their spouse unless the spouse has won at least one Academy Award.If you are trying to choose between seeing ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and this film, I recommend this film. The story is a classic, and the allusions to current events have a meaning and morality that is missing from the Batman movie. In fact, the Batman movie's message, that a billionaire can save humanity and that ordinary people are rabble, was offensive to me. You can tell ""Total Recall"" was taken from a real science fiction story by a writer who has stood the test of time. Science fiction is a way of talking to us about today through setting the story in tomorrow.",Total Recall
281,trepessa,"Reoccuring dreams, memory loss, reality check and action packed",9,1 February 2015,"Total Recall with Colin Farrell is not a remake, it is another interpretation of the short story that Philip K. Dick wrote. There is no harm in making another version later down the line. The first movie was geared for Arnold. It follows the short story very loosely. I wish they had used the original title for this one but it is sort of hokey.The acting was fine and being that it stems from a short story the writers or writer of the screenplay has to extend the story in some direction. One thing this movie did was follow the fact that the main character wants to go to Mars and that is why he goes to Rekal, pronounced Recall, where they find out he has been there but they don't take him to Mars because in the original story it doesn't go that direction. It is merely a memory. It is futuristic as both movies. The Jimmy car is similar to something in the story and they eliminate it in the second movie but over all it follows the story much better. The short story does have humor but not the stuff that was tailor made for Schwarzenegger. This adaptation was geared to hardcore science fiction which was appealing to me.Neither film brought in the element of aliens. I was hoping when I watched this version of the story, not a remake but another adaptation, they would bring that into the mix. It is something included in the short story. They did certain things as tokens to the fans of the first movie but people need to understand the first one didn't follow the story that much. I wonder why a writer writes when someone takes their story and makes it so extremely different. This film seemed closer to me and did make one, by the ending, wonder if he was still at Recall. I think it flopped due to expectations of how the movie should be. At least there was more background information in this one. Beckinsale's part encompassed two characters from the first movie and that is why she was chasing after him so frequently. If you saw the movie you know why. I really like the movie and I think it was doomed by the first one and people assuming it was a remake rather than just another adaptation of the short story instead. I noticed they continued with the name Douglas Quaid name instead of the original Douglas Quail. The special effects were great and the action. If you don't like action movies then I guess it's not for you but considering how many action movies do well at the box office I have to assume that people didn't want this movie to succeed even though it was really good. I saw no one stumbling over dialog or what I would consider bad dialog considering the nature of the storyline. I personally like the movie even though I am not a big fan of Colin Farrell, I think he did well in this interpretation of ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale.""",Total Recall
282,danren121,Plot spoilers....,4,16 July 2016,"The film is bad for the following reasons:Cohaagan explicitly wants Quaid brought in alive. Melina explicitly want's to kill him. That's just annoying. When Quaid is revealed as a double agent Cohaagan demonstrates no masterplan vibe. Why not? It's the bit where the audience get to see it's a win win for his old boss. The Melina was Quaid's wife joke... just ****ing drop it, the whole ****ing movie that joke keeps getting used...It's funny maybe once.There's twenty people pointing a gun a one person running away and none of them can hit the target.Melina struts around like a petulant teenager.In the original movie they bothered to choose two female leads with different complexions.Robots can't shoot at people who stand next to walls and look round to see how far they are from approaching with no cover.Quaid and Lori are pursued through the city and are finally caught in public by people who have been trying to kill them. Harry then tries to convince Quaid to shoot Lori. When he refuses he escapes with Lori. Then they are chased again. **** off. That makes no sense. It only makes sense if it is done privately to get rid of one of them. They are in public surrounded by guns. Cohaagan fights. What happened to a f****** gang. Take the original. The ending, Cohagaan and Arnie start fighting, thats' what Homer Simpson would write. The bad guys and the rebels don't demonstrate any character, **** all.

283,adhipar,Total....ly Different,7,11 November 2012,"I expect a ""Total Recall"" remake but this film is (almost) totally different. The only thing that links both is the Rekall services but it ends also in a different way. So this is actually a different film which based on the same short story. The title is just a marketing trick to lure people into the cinema.The film itself as an action film is not a let down, if you don't constantly looking for any homage to the original. Yes, there are some homage, probably put there so they could use the hype. I always love Kate and Jessica, seeing them fight giving more pleasure than the Expendables and I wish both get more action and drama, not just as supporting role. I'll be very happy if Selene, the vampire from Underworld series meet Abigail Whistler,the female archer from the Blade series. Especially Kate, she knows how to look good when doing action. Unfortunately Jessica doesn't have the same chance in her role. They even outshine Collin Farrel who IMO is not convincing as Quaid here.One of the advantage of his role as an amnesia secret agent, while he could kill all his opponents in very creative way, he could also show feelings, become dramatic and fragile just like ordinary person. Colin here just shows how surprise he was when first finding out his hidden skill, But that's all. No regrets for killing lots of people, no fears, no shocked, nothing. I failed to connect with his role.In the end, you get a good and fun action movie which happens to have the same title with one of Arnold's movie. 7/10 When going home, I can't stop thinking that what if Kate plays Quaid/Hauser similar to how Jolie play her role in ""Salt"" and she killed Collin in the similar way Arnold did to Sharon Stone. And Jessica is her nemesis who wants revenge because Hauser kill her family. Then everything else loosely stick to the original. I think that could be a better ""Total Recall"" remake.",Total Recall

When I first heard that Total Recall was being remade, I thought, how can they remake a film that was so perfectly done already. When the 1990 version hit the screen, it was cutting edge and it blew your mind. You weren't sure what reality was real all the way to the end. The film is now a classic. Why anyone thought they could out do what had been crafted so well is beyond me. The fact is that this latest release comes up as a complete mess. As with so many recent movies, I couldn't wait for the end. Not only does the film fail to deliver anything close to its original, it seems to steal a lot from so many other films. Nothing is original here, and nothing is very impressive. This film feels like a mash up of Blade Runner, Star Wars, I-Robot, The Matrix, and a few others, and of course, Total Recall (1990). Acting is little more than fair, the script is weak, and as usual, the CGI and special effects appear to be the main focus and are way overdone. Don't even waste your money on the DVD.

This incoherent mess is so full of corny C-grade acting, and terrible mis-cast from both Britain and America. Bryan Cranston is truly awful as the evil chancellor Cohaagen. He is more like the doofus father in Malcolm in the Middle. Kate Beckinsale tried hard to be the ""queen bitch"" but she simply just doesn't have the menace and edge that Sharon Stone had. Jessica Biel felt like the third wheel in the movie, reprising her role as the female interest like in ALL her other movie - completely uninspiring acting. Colin Farrell on the other hand as Douglas Quaid / Hauser is terrible in this movie. I can't believe I am saying this but he is even worst actor than Arnold Schwarzenegger!! At least Arnold acted like a happy-go-lucky worker looking for adventure, while Colin here is a moody-for-no-reason wooden pinocchio who has no other expression except to act moody. Another thing about this movie is the pacing, it is completely wrong. The car chase scene was dragging on for far too long while other parkour inspired chase scene looks very unconvincing with multiple plot holes throughout the story.The only saving grace for this sorry mess is the CG effects - even then there were some ""mistakes"" or visual glitch like the panning shots that showed the moving matt background that did not match with the foreground.

287,Zulu42,Not worth it,4,6 August 2012,"I do enjoy a good scifi movie and I was willing to give this remake of the very enjoyable Schwarsengegger-helmed 1990 version a whirl because of that. Well, it turned out to be one clunkers of the year (to me at least).Instead of going to Mars, where a stranglehold on a precious mined mineral makes Cohaagen (the big cheese) create a tyrannical rule over the inhabitants of that planet by rationing air, the deal here never leaves Earth. How boring. We are supposed to believe that some chemical war wiped out pretty much every country on the planet except for Britain and the continent of Australia (though neighboring places like New Zealand or France got whacked and far more distant land masses like Hawaii in the center of the Pacific are unlivable...it's so absurd it's asinine). The Cohaagen in this movie (played by Bryan Cranston) wants to take over what's left of the livable space by doing some major housecleaning of the existing population of ""the colony"" (Australia) because things have gotten packed pretty tight in Britain. There's a whole lot of gunfire throughout this flick and things getting blown to hell and those bits seem to serve the purpose of covering up the severe lack of interesting plot. Colin Farrell is the Quaid/Hauser character, and while he's a great actor, he just didn't do justice to this role. A tougher dude would've been more believable in the role of a sleeper agent like Hauser. The awesome Bill Nighy is in this movie but his character is sadly underused.What IS good is the casting of Cranston as Cohaagen (he plays him as such a scumbag that it's hard to connect Bryan with his other roles like the comedic Hal in Malcolm in the Middle, where he was hilarious). A truly talented man. Also good were Kate Beckinsale as cunning viper Lori, and Jessica Biel, who as good gal Melina, is really making a nice niche for herself as a kick ass heroine type.So, while there are several remakes which are pretty decent (The Italian Job or Ocean's Eleven, for instance), there are crappy ones too, like Escape From Witch Mountain or this silly movie.

This version has excellent futuristic biscuits, pseudo Blade Runner claustrophobia, and an excellently played pair in Colin Farrell and Kate Beckinsale. Their faux-marriage works tidily, although if you didn't know the story from Dick, you might find that her reversal is hasty and without wicked conviction. So the story is already knows: Quaid is, or is he not, a highly trained killer agent who has had his memory wiped, only to be sparked by a computer implanted vacation firm called Rekall. How he would be let near such a potentially subversive catalyst is beyond the story, and yes, he goes in for a memory vacation, just like Arnold did. The remainder of the story follows the same path, but better, and Beckinsale is truly an ass kicker. Still, Quaid follows the storybook path laid out in 1990, although with finer CGI effects and decidedly better action sequences. Yet, one waits for Quaid to awake from what we are led to believe is the Rekall spy fantasy, and you know what? He never does. It plays expectantly into the twist of the story, which is that perhaps he has never left his mind trip headset. Is the iconic end, the common factory worker Quaid winds up lost in a purchased fantasy forever, a good end? Well, that is the whole damn story, but it is an exciting journey to get to the matrix for what it is worth. Enjoy.",Total Recall

The concept of the Fall, a tunnel connecting Britain to Australia (the colony) was interesting, though probably impossible in real life. The original film had Mars. The two lovely female leads looked quite similar which was a bit confusing. Apart from that there was lots of shooting. The hero Quaid has only a T-shirt for protection but luckily the enemy synthetics couldn't hit the side of a barn door.

A tunnel that connects the two locations.All of the original story of confusion of what is real and not, that was captured well by Verhoven, but not is this version. All of the characters are there is the plot is essentially the same of the short story, but were is it fails is the delicious confusion of what is real and what is a dream, the epicness and the sense of adventure that is sorely lacking in this version.It is one big chase movie of which they tried to invoke ""Blade Runner"" set design, but even that fails also! At the end of the movie I was left scratching my head, saying what happened? And on the screen when the credits are rolling it states ""Inspired by the . . .""

This film is the shadow of a shadow.While there are several nods to, and in-jokes about, the 1990 film, by and large this is simply a rehash of that film with little to impress.It did not hold this viewer's attention despite (or perhaps because of) an overabundance of chases, fights, and slam-bang action scenes. There is little exposition and virtually no opportunities to become attached to the protagonist. Indeed, it was as if director Len Wiseman took all his film cues from Transformers director Michael Bay and did so rather poorly.Watch it if you must, but don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.",Total Recall

And I missed Schwarzie :pBeckinsale kept showing up like an annoying mosquito on a summer night. Colin I like. Expressive face. But I always feel like he's just playing a part, robotic like.

297,ryansassy1,"Good looking and plenty o' action, but only Cranston gave it any character.",6,31 December 2012,"It's been about 2 decades since I'd seen the 1990 Total Recall which starred (the Governator) Arnold S, and Sharon Stone. I was entertained by it then for the cool fx (for its time..), as well as the campy charm brought in by the leads. This time around, the fx are even better thanks to many advances in movie tech, and the cinematography and set design would blow away any SF from the '90s: but the leads have ZERO charm, heart, or humor. Unless of course, you count Kate Beckinsale's hair--IMO, they should have given her hair top billing, because it made more of an impression than any of her acting in this film.In director Len Wiseman's take on this classic futuristic SF story, Doug Quaid (Farrell)is an assembly-line worker at a robotics factory. There are only 2 countries left habitable on the Earth; Australia, aka the Colony, and Britain. Of course the poor working stiffs like Quaid live in the dilapidated Colony, and since the jobs are all in Britain, they commute..by falling through the center of the Earth every day. Yup, Wiseman loves to come up with cool ideas which make no scientific sense outside of his bhole, but hey...what an awesome idea! Anyway, Quaid has it good, all things considered, for a working-class guy: hot wife, relaxing commute to catch up on his reading, and apparently plenty of time to work out for that sculpted bod; but he's dissatisfied with his life. He longs for adventure, excitement, better scenery! So a co-worker refers him to Total Recall, a company that can manufacture such memories for him chemically. So the high-octane roller-coaster part of the plot begins.The action begins when Quaid's ""session"" at Total Recall goes awry, and it doesn't let up for the rest of the film. Quaid's chemical fantasy actually comes true...or does it..? That's part of the mind-bend, we can't actually tell whether what we see happening to him is reality or his TR dream. Quaid is a secret double agent trying to save the world from a hostile takeover by his robot mogul boss (played by Bryan Cranston with his typical grit and relish). Quaid's hot ""wife"" is actually an agent assigned to keep tabs on him, but she has sibling rivalry issues of a sort, so instead she attempts to murder him. While trying to uncover the clues to ""remember"" his mission, Quaid has constant high-speed chases on foot, in hover cars, through psychedelic elevator shafts, etc...such lovely SF eye candy making this a highly enjoyable ride for the audience.Wiseman's vision of the Total Recall world is a gorgeously dim dystopia in the vein of Blade Runner. That's the part of the film which I enjoyed the most, this loving visual tribute to a better SF film. The characters however, even Quaid, are thinly acted and unsympathetic; I couldn't care less what happened to any of them, which is problematic for a plot in which the hero's psychological dilemma is supposed to be the driving force. Instead, I enjoyed the scenery and the derring-do escapes from the evil rival agents played by Beckinsale and her host of robot cronies.At the end of the day, I think TR deserved a higher tomatometer rating than it got, but I'll probably never go back for a rewatch. On the other hand, the 1990 version is calling my name...it's been too long, old friend. Too long by far.",Total Recall
298,devileye03,Total Recall- One of the best sci-fi genre movies!,6,26 January 2013,"This review of mine is more like my voice of disagreement with people who didn't like the 2012 version of Total Recall. But first I'll point out what I liked about both the versions.Total Recall(1990)- Of course Arnold. I felt a certain rawness in his act which I liked. He actually looked unaware of things going around, as his character required. For Sharon Stone,she was simply stunning! Enough said. The story was far ahead of it times and stands the same even today thats why it deserved a remake. This is the 2nd movie of Paul Verhoeven's direction that I have seen.(I have seen Hollowman), and his amazing work in Total Recall and Sharon Stone are the 2 reasons, I want to see Basic Instinct now. Also I liked the fact that this was one of the last movies which used miniatures,like for showing Mars planet. Bravo to the team, amazing work. Overall, an entertaining concept, performance and movie.Total Recall(2012)- I liked the major change in the original screenplay and not using idea of Mars and still keeping the same concept of the original Total Recall. Requires a lot of creativity to bring out and create something new from something which is already a blockbuster. Thats the most exciting part of this version. Of course there are scenes which are more of a tribute to the original and shot with new technology and effects. Colin Farrell is an amazing actor. I liked him in the flick 'The Recruit'(2003) and for me he was equally good in this one. Also in this movie, Colin Farrel doing a smooch scene with the director's wife(Kate Beckinsale) in front of him, requires a lot of confidence and professionalism. But Kate comes nowhere close to the charisma of Sharon Stone. Jessica Biel here stole the show. She did a good act. Len Wiseman as a director did take a risk of choosing this remake and I appreciate he came up with something like this. I liked his work in 'Die Hard 4'. This movie is not as huge hit as its predecessor, but its neither a complete washout. But personally I liked the remake and it was entertaining for me.Comparisions- I don't care why critics panned the 2012 version. Both versions were quite different in terms of execution of the same concept. Also I equally liked the sets and the ambiance created in both the movies. In the end, either ways I enjoyed the experience of Total Recall(just like Inception). But still if I had to pickup one thing better from another, then I would say, Total Recall(2012) missed out a point because it didn't have Sharon Stone! Must watch both of them!",Total Recall
299,chewbaccawakka,"Better than I expected, don't think of it as a remake of the 1990 classic.",6,29 March 2013,"When I heard the news of a Total Recall reboot, I thought that this is going to be terrible and like all remakes of today, not going to live up to the original. There was a time when remakes can be better than the original film (The Thing, The Fly) but filmmakers do not seem to improve them.As expected, it's terrible as a remake of the 1990 Arnie classic BUT as a stand alone film (or a new adaption of the book, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale), it's an entertaining little sci-fi action thriller.This is more like what Philip K Dick made it out to be in the original book, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale. They should of changed this movie's title though because Total Recall is too much known for the 1990 film. Also, there are some references to the 1990 film (I mean by the woman with 3 boobs, the lady that says ""2 weeks"", etc.) that ruined it slightly, because it just makes it a constant reminder of the original film. Not that it's a bad thing, but it ruins this from being a stand alone film. Even some of the lines are the same as the 1990 film, they could of at least had different dialogue. At least it wasn't constant like Rob Zombie's Halloween, which makes you want to watch the John Carpenter classic instead from the first 5 minutes. The acting was actually pretty good, Colin Farrell seems more convincing than Arnie as the character has always meant to be a normal average guy, not Mr Universe. But Colin can never be as entertaining as Arnie.",Total Recall
300,vicarious_tool,Entertaining.,7,4 August 2012,"If you have a thing for technical details (not in the plot but relating to the futuristic technology and vision in a sci-fi movie) then you should surely watch the movie. It doesn't have a strong or complex plot, no deep character development, not much scope for emotional connections but it probably wasn't meant to, and it does have some good action scenes and great effects and is thus entertaining in the simplest form, which I believe was the intention.Instead of comparing it with the original version, I would say that it has its share of nice concepts absent in the original, for eg, they show a future metropolis in which the old(cement based?) skyscrapers are retained but using MAGLEV like technology people have created new structures and roads/tracks that run in between everything. In fact there's a stunt scene where the sole intention is to stress on the fact that the vehicles work based on superconductivity(magnetism). And in case you do go out to watch it, and happen to wonder how a vehicle meant to glide on top of a track (suspended in mid air) glides beneath it without being upside down and with nothing below the vehicle itself, look closely for you'll find the answer on the vehicle itself(like I said attention to technical details). Also there is no Mars(planet) in this movie(unlike the original), instead they treat one half of the globe as 'The Colony'(oppressed half) and cook up a nice futuristic method of transportation between the two parts.",Total Recall

His wife played by Wiseman's wife Kate Beckinsdale is a little edgy and replaces both Michael ""Richter"" Ironside's and Sharon Stone's characters. I was surprised to see Bryan Cranston in it and perked it up a little knowing that he plays Cohagen but he should've swapped this one for a better film.As for plot, no Mars. Instead you've got droids that Cohagen's using to take over the planet and rule over ""The Colony."" There's no Quato instead you have a resistance leader named Mathias.

Why wasn't his girlfriend in the room? Etc.A predictable and lame shoot'em-up. In fact, the only thing that wasn't predictable was that they didn't go to Mars!

306,octagonproplex,We Can Remember It For You At Cost,8,11 August 2019,"Director Len Wiseman's under appreciated 2012 Colin Ferrell lead remake of Total Recall should have distinguished itself from Paul Verhoeven's lurid 1990 Schwarzenegger action vehicle by simply titling itself ""Rekal"" (as is the company name in the original Philip K. Dick short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale""). Also change back to the source novela's lead character name being Douglas Quail instead of Doug Quaid.Because even though this movie clearly recycles broad strokes from the screenplay of its 1990 film predecessor, I do think this version has its own merits and stands as its own cinematic entity. This one is grounded better in a plausiblity which makes the question of whether the whole story is dream or reality more enigmatic.Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback set their screenplay in a post chemical warefare earth where the only two inhabitable places left for humans are the metropolis of Britain and the colony of Australia, with a rapid communter gravity elevator/train called ""The Fall"" burrowing through the earth's core to transport between the two surving safe zones. The United Federation Of Britain (or UFB) is the supreme metropolitan mecca for higher culture, governement, business, and industustry - with a massively layered maze infrastructure system of intertwining magnetic interchange freeways to accommodate the everyday hustle and bustle parading storm of hover-vehicle traffic. While The Colony serves as residency for the lower caste and where the more dingy base elements of society are partitioned.Everyday Colonist laborers cummute by way of The Fall to the UFB for medial work in its various production and manufacturing complexes. The Fall is an ingenuis design - a massive skyscraper sized heat shielded elevator with commuter train-like rows of rollercoaster-like security harnessed seating on gimbals which vertically rotate 180° as the shuttle comfortably plows through the earth's core and gravity ceases, so that it arrived upright at its polar opposite gravitational destination. Just as the Terraforming Reactor of Mars served as central ""mcguffin"" plot device of contention for the 1990 iteration of Total Recall, so here serves The Fall as hub for controlling the literal ascending or descending fate of a people.With the supplanting of the Martian reactor with the earth elevator, so also goes any mention of a terraforming Mars, let alone a mission to get there and rescue its bizarre mutant inhabitants from being slowly suffocated. This one is decidedly more cyberpunk, and deals with government corruption to oppress and ultimately eliminate the lower class waste-of-space-and-precious-resources Colonial civilians of earth in rendering them obsolete by way of a robotic workforce and enforcement army, manufactured obedient to the elitist Cohaagen - here upgraded from Governor of Mars to Chancellor of The United Federation Of Britian (which essentially means the whole remaining world) - as deviously portrayed by Brian Cranston coming off his Breaking Bad height of zeitgeist popularity.Colin Ferrell plays average guy Douglas Quaid who is haunted with dreams of a phantom perilous mission gone array with another woman he's never met (Jessica Biel's ""Melina""), and an all around restless ennui with his mundan lot in life (even though he scored Kate Beckindale's seemingly stalwart ""Lori"" for a most enviable wife). Here, instead of a construction worker, Quaid toils his workdays off-colony with best pal Harry (Bokeem Woodbine) on a factory plant assembly line for robotic police troopers.The headline news focuses on a wanted rogue traitor agent named Hauser, and the terrorist turmoil rising from a rebel outfit lead by Bill Nighy's ""Mathius"" (doing the non-mutant variation of the original film's Kuato character). And newly tying his resistance leader by relation to another key figure of the story.Just as before, there is a company called ""Rekall"" which can transplant synthetic vacation memories and roleplay fantasies to affordably supplant the unfulfilled discontentment derived from the monotony of the common everyday grind. And as before, Quiad is drawn to this place to aquire its memory implant proceedure, which he hopes will alleviate his unqualified angst. He chooses a semi personalized espionage adventure package similar to his reoccuring dream, but before the proceedure can commence that is precisely what he finds himself in the middle of... but does it really transpire, or is it all just the memory transplant while he lay unconscious in Rekall's facility?Len Wiseman's director's cut adds some interesting complications to the secret agent identity angle and a slightly harder edge. But it is sort of humorless, and has no glimmer of the excessively gaudy glee found in Verhoeven's satirical kitsche. It is a bit of a shame that this updated version was produced with a more family friendly rating in mind, but at least the unrated director's cut manages a soft R-rating equivelant. Certainly it feels restrained in places though. But hey, Verhoeven's farcical audacity had its fair enough share of embarrassing atrocity to undermine it too - so it's not like Citizen Kane is being tinkered with here!The 80's Paul Verhoeven movie has more tasty cheese for sure, but I really enjoy and prefer Wiseman's visual production design, camera aesthetic, action choreography, and future tech imagineering for his remake (which harken's closer to Spielberg's other Phillip K. Dick world adaptation ""Minority Report"").Yet it's still definitely more a remake of the Verhoeven movie's original character aspects, rather than a more-or-less faithful adaptation of Phillip K. Dick's short story from which both film version's are loosely inspired in general premise setup.Kate Beckinsale was great as an amalgum of the Sharon Stone wife/Michael Ironside soldier characters from the Verhoeven original. And I enjoyed Bokeem Woodbine as Quaid's workmate/best friend Harry also serving the psychiatrist role of the first film's Dr. Edgemar, and trying to convince Quaid he's in a fragile mental breaking point within his Rekall fantasy, while set in a facility lockdown police hostage negotiation scene, with bewildered wife Lori outside in police escort wrapped in obligatory trauma planket.Colin Ferrell does seem kinda miscast. He functions, but is quite bland in the role. In a perfect world they'd have gotten Jason Statham to add some working class charm and world wery wit while kicking people's throats in - and gotten Jude Law to play his former secret agent counterpart self Hauser before facial augmentation surgery (Ethan Hawk plays this additional aspect to Colin Ferrell in Wiseman's director's cut - which is a smarter idea rather than Hauser just retaining the same identifiable face in the midst of this hidden Quaid persona).But I mean c'mon, this remake has cool droid troopers, surface projecting smart communicators implanted into the hand, holographic masks collars, insane hover car freeway chases, a truly enticing three breasted solicitor callback, and weightless action sequences inside an inverted shuttle train bulleting through the earth's core - all wrapped in cinematographer Paul Cameron's anamorphic lens flares!I did miss Rob Bottin's Kuato mutant fx and Jerry Goldsmith's magnificent music score though. In particular, I do wish remake composer Harry Gregson-Williams could have retained some of Goldsmith's awesomely bombastic thematics, because his new score is quite generic and instantly forgettable.The good news is, for different reasons we can enjoy the disparate virtues of both incarnations on the same sourced premise! No reason to get resentful about it.",Total Recall
307,Deep-Thought,Nonstop action that wears mighty thin,4,2 November 2021,"This is the second film adaptation of Philip K. Dick's story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,"" and it owes more to the first ""Total Recall"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger than the original story, which has no violence, only the threat of violence, and that is brief and understated; the story is all dialogue. Both movies (loosely - very loosely) follow the plot until about two-thirds in, when Quaid goes to Rekall, Incorporated, to be implanted with false memories of a trip to Mars. From there on, the violence-drenched plots are a complete departure from the story: they are wholly the inventions of the filmmakers. The original story really does explore the question of true and false memories. Most of that doesn't make it into the films, which are rock-'em, sock-'em, hyperkinetic shoot-'em-ups. As Quaid/Hauser, when Colin Farrell is not shooting, dodging bullets, or engaging in hand-to-hand combat, he is jumping from things and landing on other things, more often than not glass ceilings or windows that shatter. That's the problem with this film, and it's the filmmakers' fault, especially director Len Wiseman: The nonstop action quickly wears thin and becomes drearily monotonous. The film would have been much better with maybe half as much violence as it contains, if not less; that would have made the violence and the nonviolent interludes much more meaningful, and the fight choreographers would not have run out of invention before the end, which they obviously do. But I guess a thoughtful movie was not what the filmmakers were after.Quaid's name is Quail in the original story. His wife's name is Kirsten, which was not a popular girl's name when the story was written. Her name is Lori in both films. It's not clear whether Kirsten is in on the deception or not; she doesn't try to kill Quail, she just dumps him. The character of Melina was created for the 1990 Total Recall. In the 2012 version, you wonder why the two roles were cast with two actresses (Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel) who bear more than a passing resemblance to each other, down to their hair and clothing. In the Arnold version, it was easy to tell the difference between blonde bombshell Sharon Stone and black-haired, fiery sex goddess Rachel Ticotin, and in any case, the two characters lived on different planets, unlike here (and the original story), where Mars is only talked about, not shown.",Total Recall
308,Staffenburgen,An Unfortunate Misuse of Potential,6,4 August 2012,"Just a quick thing before I begin, I have not seen the original Total Recall, nor am I familiar with it's story in any way; I am reviewing this movie based solely on this adaptation and am making no attempt to compare it to its predecessor. Total Recall is an interesting movie. With talented actors like Colin Farrell and Bryan Cranston leading the way, and a fairly intriguing plot, this film had a ton of potential. There are plenty of positive and negative things to look at, but it ultimately comes off as a fairly typical action movie. The film opens by introducing Doug Quaid, a factory worker in a post- nuclear war version of the future. In this future, only two nations exist, the United Federation of Britain (modern day Europe), and The Colony (modern day Australia). All other parts of the world are afflicted with deadly amounts of radiation, and are not capable of supporting human life. These two nations are connected by The Fall, which is essentially an elevator that descends through the core of the Earth and emerges on the other side of the world. The movie does a great job of immediately immersing the viewer in this world, and the well- crafted visuals are quite pleasing. The first 20 minutes are probably the best part of the movie. As the story progresses, there's an unfortunate shift in the film's direction. At heart, this is an action movie, and as a result, the story suffers. The film constantly shifts from dialogue scenes, which move the plot forward, to prolonged action sequences, which are nothing particularly special and really bog down what could have been a fantastic story. Over the course of the movie, just about every cliché you could think of is somehow written in, and this exposes an unfortunate lack of originality. This eventually leads to a somewhat rushed climax, which is easily one of the film's weakest points. As far as acting is concerned, Colin Farrell does a pretty good job with the lead role; it's really easy to identify with him right from the beginning. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for most of the supporting cast. None of the other characters really add any substance to the movie, and while that's largely due to the writing, much of the blame also goes to the actors. To put it simply, Kate Beckinsdale, Jessica Biel, and Bill Nighy just aren't that strong in this film. As the main villain, Bryan Cranston does about a good of a job as he possibly could have with the role, but it still isn't enough. Aside from Farrell, it's pretty much impossible to care for any of the characters in this movie, which is one of the film's largest flaws. All in all, this is a typical, very forgettable action movie. If you're looking for a good way to kill a few hours, it will keep you entertained, but don't expect anything more than that.

309,dmhughes-448-695102,I RECALL Seeing This Movie Before...Except That One Was Terrible,9,13 August 2012,"I hated the original Total Recall. Absolutely HATED It. It had one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's worst performances, a bunch of really bad performances from other actors who later starred in more of Paul Verhoeven's films (Sharon Stone, Michael Ironside), some of the worst special effects in a big budget action film I've ever seen, and was just so over-the-top and goofy that I can't help but hate it. This film on the other hand, is a masterpiece by comparison. That still doesn't mean it's perfect. The film follows the same basic storyline. The Earth has been torn apart by war. Only two nations remain (one is bad, the other is good). Douglas Quaid, played by a great Colin Farrell, is a normal working stiff who feels unhappy with his life. He goes to Rekall, a place that implants artificial memories into the consumer. Quaid gets strapped in, and as soon as the chemicals start going in, Quaid is attacked by cops and evil robots (they look a lot like Sonny from I'Robot), gets hunted down by his wife Lori (a fantastic Kate Beckinsale), and runs into the girl from his nightmares, Melina (Jessica Biel), and finds out he's a rogue agent working for the good guys. Or is he?This film is directed by Len Wiseman, who's pretty much spent his career making the cheap Underworld movies. He's married to Beckinsale by the way, go figure. This time around however, he actually had a big budget, and created a beautifully crafted action film. The action scenes are adrenaline-pumping, the visuals are topnotch, and the performances are great. The film doesn't take place on Mars (there are subtle references though). The three-breasted woman shows up, in a PG-13 movie! The film has a darker, more serious, and less comedic tone to it, and I loved it. I understand the film hasn't done well in the U.S., and it's shaping up to be another Battleship and John Carter sized flop. It's a shame, because this is one of the best films of the summer. I really recommend it.Final Verdict: 9/10",Total Recall

Still, no one goes to a movie for Art Direction! And even at that its all just serviceable. Performance wise, Jessica Biel does some good work here. Farrel is fine, with not much to work with. Extremely uninteresting over-all. Very corporate committee-driven type thing. No signature stamp on it like Verhoven's original. In hindsight, I'd probably be better entertained simply seeing Batman Rises again.Speaking of Art Direction, Prometheus is far superior to this, with incredible visuals and production design and some truly heart-stopping scenes.Total Recall is mostly a total regret. Just feel like an idiot talking about it at work the following days, cause nobody gives a crap. People have mostly smelled out a dud here. Sadly, it's true. Think I'll re-watch the original on DVD. Just to wipe the palate of blandness.Would have felt much cooler if I'd seen one of the more fun looking indie movies that came out this past weekend. Consider yourself warned.

311,ClintWardley1,Grown up on mediocre television.,6,22 August 2012,"I have always wondered how studios can spend so much money on a film yet come up with average. I have pondered this for a while and I think it all relates back to the script writers and the studio executives who have grown up on mediocre television, devoid of a artistic soul and who never read a book in their lives.OK, Total Recall is an Actioner. I understand that its not meant to be Shakespeare. The cast was good, the director great, the special effects top notch, the script?? The script was paint by the numbers. I bet you, the script writers watched the Arnie movie and didn't bother to read the short story by Philip K Dick. In fact,considering the level of sophistication of the movie, they probably looked at the cover and giggled at the authors name and that was it.If they had read the original story, the whole premise is that Quaid is unsure what is reality and what is not. AND in fact the Movie's poster infers this is the central issue. ""IS IT REAL IS IT RECALL"" Well straight of the bat, the dream at the start blows that idea out of the water. The only time Quaid questions reality is when his friend Harry turns up at the standoff and he pretty much decides which was which. At the end he glances at the REKALL sign, but again shakes it off.Look I enjoyed it for shallow actioner it was. But it could have been another INCEPTION, where at the end the audience has to decide ""IS IT REAL IS IT RECALL"" . It would have lifted the movie from mediocrity to interesting. Maybe the studios are really aiming to the lowest common denominator and have no faith in the sophistication of their audience.",Total Recall

Regarding the 3 boobed woman: In the original, a 3 boobed woman made sense. On Mars there were a colony of deformed mutants, and she was a mutant prostitute. In this version it doesn't make any sense. Am I to believe that in the future there is actually a demand for a ho who is surgically altered to have 3 tits? Why? And why isn't she with a bunch of other surgically altered prostitutes? Would have been better if it all turned out to be part of his fantasy.",Total Recall

If you are a huge fan of the original, you will not like it. There is probably only 3 references to the movie. If this was the first one to come out I think people would have liked it. The story line was good and the acting wasn't bad either. I though Colin Ferrel would do horrible but this was one of his good ones. I'm not gonna lie Kate Hudson made the movie. She was hardcore the whole time. She can take a hit and dish them even worst. She was definitely more hardcore than Sharon Stone. I would recommend watching it if you are looking for a good movie.

314,lekavalio,what happened to the art of story telling?,5,25 December 2014,"I suspect something rotten lies underneath all recent sic-fi and fantasy films and the remake of total recall is not making a good job at convincing me otherwise. An original story by none other than the grand master of fictional narrative Philip K.Dick already made into a great movie once with great director and cast and full of suspense is reinterpreted into a lukewarm film, too long for its own good and laden with twist and turns that in an attempt to keep the viewer interested they manage to exhaust. The book and the original movie adaptation are very good to begin with so the new interpretation already starts with a handicap, having them to compete against. Sadly this is where it falls short as what it has to offer is devoid of novelty and lacks terribly in both content and style. An anaemic protagonist making a sad attempt to present his character likable and moving is on the run for almost the whole duration of the film. The pace is monotonous and frankly very cartoony. Every surreal charm the first movie had is gone and all colour and humour where lost along with it. The new interpretation instead feels sonorous and quite full of itself, like it has some important political message to convey. Gone are the mutants and now the three breasted woman is here only as a reference to the original film along with the fat woman in the airport. Also in an attempt to make the story more believable they felt it was necessary to fill it with pseudo-scientific ""facts"" and swap Mars for Australia (what a let down). Too much shooting, too many explosions and the frantic running and dodging of bullets don't make up for the lack of character and the main ideas that are used as an excuse for all the ruse have been already debated in other films with a whole lot more charm.In the end the film was a bit of a drag for me but I suppose it can be much more entertaining for others, especially if they don't compare it to the original as I did. Unfortunately I feel compelled to compare this to much better examples and I cannot find it in my heart to forgive this flick for its fear to dream big, the common element of most recent attempts in sci-fi and fantasy genre. A sign of our times I guess, even cinema suffers from depression and a lack of inspiration. I can only hope that the art of captivating audiences with story telling and the occasional ""smoke and mirrors"" will make a come back at some point.",Total Recall

Even so the special effects, how the cities are set and an improved story, the initial film has an extra because the humor.A few differences and references of both films. This second film happens entirely in this planet. The first one was between Earth and Mars. Just a Mars reference happens when Douglas is going to be implanted the holiday memory and he states that he would love to visit the planet. The road with levitating vehicles is excellent, a real vehicle where the pilot is a ridiculous dummy.Mars is full of mutants, and this includes a prostitute with three breast. The Colony, in the recent film, has a interesting night life also, and the scene repeats when a girl shows her three breast to Douglas.I suppose there are a few more hidden references, but it's kind of a game to find them, let's try for yourself.Enjoy.",Total Recall

I mean honestly this remake is a cut and paste of all the least interesting parts of the original with a whole lot of predictable bland action thrown in, plus all the really interesting stuff taken out of the original, like mars, corporate greed and corruption, mutants, geoengineering mars and ancient alien technology.. all gone. I feel this script was butchered deliberately to keep all references to rebellion and anti-government behaviour out of the public mind.. blandness and conformity seem to be the message of all Hollywood blockbusters of late. Just as ""Hunger Games"" teaches everyone that no matter what happens the corrupt elite win in the end, Total recall just turns out to be an action flick with no heart and no direction of interest. ""hunger Games"" could have been so much more than it was (it didn't need to stick to the books) and had some interesting ideas that could have been taken in a direction that would have created a great deal of desire in the viewer to see Justice prevail and some kind of mass rebellion happen from the servants of the elite... instead we see a boring ending with the status quo remaining. Total recall is equally disappointing in that so much more could have been included in this remake updated to include references to the current world situation.. BUT that would not suit the elites goals to push conformity and apathy onto the masses as they have done so with this film.",Total Recall
317,themusgrat,"God yes, but...",7,3 August 2012,"First, I enjoyed this flick. I love sci-fi, and this delivered. Visually it's good, the action is good, the plot is even decent, but where did it go wrong? I'm not sure what was at fault; the directing, the screen writing, who knows. But at some point, you hear the ""he wants to see him alone"" line and you just lose all hope. The story was never fleshed out, the characters were never fleshed out, and in turn it cheapened the visuals, the endless robot army, the occasionally-incredibly-cliché lines. It felt much like an Underworld flick, but instead of having vampires and werewolves to fall in love with, we're left with bad humans, good humans, and the central theme of the story; a guy who's lost. Regardless of how many times it's been done, I still think it's possible to do it.This reminds me of a recent woody allen film, which my brother described as ""the most entertaining terrible film ever."" That's sort of how I feel about Total Recall, though it's not terrible. There's so much going for it. Colin Farrell really does about the best job he could possibly do, Kate Beckinsale is about the greatest female villain ever, Jessica Biel gives an incredible performance, I really respect how understated she played the role. But it seems like the director/writers decided to make a film with very little time devoted to plot, but do everything you can do with that little time. The problem is that none of it was done well; none of the characters were fleshed out, the story was actually probably explained too much, certain points were hammered home over and over, then the juicy things never got explained.Such a shame, it could have been so much better, and I wish I could say with just a few changes, but in reality, almost the whole concept of the movie was doomed to summer action flick status. That's not horrible, but my mind just couldn't accept this reality. There were too many cliché lines, a scene with at least 50 bad guys with automatics unloading on 2 people 50 feet away (spoiler:!!! they all missed), no way to feel for any of the characters, and anytime we finally arrived anywhere, feeling that a situation had some sort of gravity, we were promptly whisked away meaninglessly.Ladies can stop reading. On a lighter note, I feel compelled to say that both Kate and Jessica (yeah we're totally on a first name basis) have my deep and abiding love. They were so incredibly hot. I went with 2 expectations; to see Kate Beckinsale, and to see Jessica Biel. Both were very fulfilled, so for me, great success.Anyways to close it out, it's worth seeing if you have the time, not if you'd have to make the time. Good film, but the worst part is knowing what could have been.",Total Recall

They changed so much in this movie leaving out the main part of the plot entirely which was the Mars story and freeing the people of Mars. Many of the characters you became attached to in the original, not so in this one. In addition Lori's character was turned into a terminator bent on getting Hauser no matter what. They didn't even include the character Richter played by Michael Ironsides from the original who was Lori's partner and lover and Cohaggen's main thug and important to the movie. Even when the movie tried to vaguely follow the plot from the first movie it turned things around or mixed things up and got it wrong. Such as when Quaid first goes to Recall, they didn't have him invent his dream girl who was the girl literally in his dreams, Melina. Farrell was okay in the part of Hauser/Quaid but Schwarzenegger was superior in the role. He may not be the caliber of actor that Farrell is but he sure was more human and believable in his bewilderment of what was happening to him then Farrell who simply seemed swept up in the events.

Honestly, I don't quite remember of the original, except that the leading role was played by Arnold Schwarzenegger (this guy created his own genre of films). And in the remake, my opinion is that Colin Farrell was not the best choice to play the role again. So there were the bad sides of the film, now the good ones... Holy crap! The special effects! Visually speaking, the old Total recall can go hide himself in some garbage bin...I don't remember having seen the city like that in the old one. I think the city was better made in the remake and you can see also a lot more details, especially during the action scenes, which are AWE-SOME!! I don't remember having seen a movie with so much action in it. All the pursuit, fighting and shooting scenes have been holding my breath every second. I kinda like those sci- F films with a lot of destruction and action in it and personally Total recall made myself think of the movie The Island, by Michael Bay, which I loved. Yes, they are totally unrealistic and the characters get so close to die a millions times in the movie, but I don't care. I had enough fun watching those action scenes happening in the future and I think that everyone who enjoy sci-F movies are gonna like it. Plus, two of my favourites actress play a role in it, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel. It's pleasant to see women some more in sci-F movies.

They couldn't even hire a decent musician to write a score? Dorothy Parker once said about a Katherine Hepburn performance, ""her emotions ran the gamut from A to B.""

The buildings, the gadgets, the transportation devices, the shapes that look great but mostly serve no real purpose? And I'm not talking about the set designers, I mean the people within the story. Have you? Well, this is the right film for you. And I mean that in a positive way. Len Wiseman has made some great decisions in this regard, as the visuals of this film are stunning. The sheer amount of ... stuff in each and every frame and the way everything looks is amazing. Yeah, most of it is lifted from various other films, but so is almost all the 'fresh'' creative stuff that reaches your brain. Culture is the result of millenniums of mental inheritance. Get over it. Even Mozart didn't start from nothing. And there are a few fresh ideas in the film: The phones that can project an image onto a glass surface - illogical as that may be - come to mind. Or the concept of 'The Fall' in general. The transportation cubes, a slightly more logical, high-end version of the stupid steeplechase enabling device in 'Galaxy Quest'. And so on. So, dismissing the film in general is wrong. A lot of work went into this one.And thus endeth the objective part of my review, because I found that something with this flick was missing. And I can't even put my finger on it. Somehow I lost interest about halfway through the movie. Is it because I know and like Verheuven's original? I don't think so. I have seen plenty of remakes that have held my attention, and I din't even think too much of the original. Maybe I was distracted by the sheerness of the visualization. Maybe by the (overly electronic) score, that I could have done without during quite a few moments. Was it the blandness of the whole world the film takes place in, something that seems to be in vogue since a few years? Was even I, a great fan of the J.J. Abrams anamorphic memorial lens flare, distracted by too many of them? I was glad when Bryan Cranston made his entrance, because he is at his best here - he's one of the few guys that I can watch as a villain and as a goodie (still haven't decided which one I like best with him).Anyway, if you're a scifi buff and like visually compelling films, then you're in for a ride with this one.

While comparisons to the original film is unavoidable, I still think that Arnie did exceptionally great in the role of Quaid / Hauser. Farrell, in his first action role in years, could not do justice to the role as there was no fun &/ humor that he could bring on with the role (Unlike Arnie who made us laugh with the jokes &/ one liners in the movie in spite of looking seriously confused as demanded by the role).That being said, Farrell still did well in the role especially in the action scenes. Special mention to both the ladies, Beckinsale and Biel for having seriously kicked ass in the movie. The special effects with the CGI in the movie also enhanced a great work done by the Cinematography director.Here's my guidance for the film.

326,darthmatthew-442-606491,The prime example of a lazy action movie,3,5 August 2012,"I cannot comprehend on where to start about Total Recall. Oh, I know. IT SUCKED! It reached the point that it made me feel insulted. This movie is a prime example of a lazy action movie. How the makers of this garbage can still manage to get jobs is a mystery to me. This is the type of movie that makes me lose more of what little faith I have left in Hollywood.The premise was interesting with Doug Quaid struggling to discern what is real and what is a figment of his mind. Problem: They didn't explore it! Though touched on at the start, it was dropped and replaced by a cliché and predictable story. There was such room for potential; however it fell into just a series of ""plot twists"" that I guess were supposed to make me say, ""Ooh, you're so clever!"", but ended with me saying, ""Well, at least they're recycling."" Too bad in doing so, the plot went into the trash. There were also several obvious plot holes and continuity errors that caused me to question if the director really even cared anymore.So instead of a thought provoking thriller we were rewarded with another CGI fest. Don't get me wrong, the action sequences were cool; nevertheless they were uninspired and became boring by the end.This movie committed one of the cardinal sins of film making by injecting characters that nobody cared about. The characters were so flat and poorly developed that I honestly wanted them to die. Maybe it would break the monotony and insert one bit of originality to this. Adding upon the horridness of the characters was the cast, which had as much grace and talent as a drunk attempting to jump over a table. Many moments I wanted to ask the actor, ""why did you just make that face?"" The female actors made me want to cry, or laugh, maybe both. The director probably told them to bare their teeth, yell obscenities, and hold the gun and wave it around like a toilet plunger, yet they managed to fail at that too, looking constipated or something. Oh, and not to mention the dialogue, which sounded like it was written by a high school dropout, bumbling along with such a surprising amount of obscenities that it made me feel like I was back in high school again.The music was decent, not bad, but nothing special. It basically felt like something that all the other action movies have. The cinematography for the most part was okay, except for the excessive use of fake lens flares that popped up all over the screen constantly in scenes that didn't need it. I suppose it was just for the heck of it - just like the rest of the movie.There were very few redeeming qualities in this movie. The special effects were good, and did a good job of creating a believable and occasionally ""woah"" moment. I suppose we can all be thankful that it wasn't 3D. WIth that, they were able to put together some pretty awesome fight scenes, that although they felt familiar, managed to shove some fun into this mostly joyless chore of an experience.This movie was a slap in the face to me as a movie goer. They took my $10 and said, ""Here's some CGI, now let's throw it in your face. Now go home and say what you want cause we don't care about our product and we got your money."" Total Recall was the easiest and laziest way to make as much money as they could. This was evident through the total disregard to the story and characters. Their casting made their lack of imagination evident by choosing a couple of women who looked as if they were ripped out of a celebrity magazine and thrown into a world that they didn't belong in. Are these women supposed to be attractive or are they just trolling the audience? Probably the latter. But the most heinous crime was actually the rating. PG-13?! This was a blatant R rated movie. Profanity was thrown willy nilly and dropped for no reason. I say that if you're going to swear in a movie, they'd better earn it. But no, this was swearing for the sake of swearing. On top of this was a couple moments that just made me (almost) cry, ""Ah man, seriously?"" There was content that simply wasn't needed and made me feel ashamed to be in that theater.

331,Paradox-Warrior,Don't Worry About Comparing To The Original,7,28 December 2012,"A lot of people here have already summarized the plot, so I'll forgo that. What I will say is that I found this re-imagining of Total Recall to be rather enjoyable. If you're planning to watch this movie with the express purpose of seeing a nearly shot-for-shot remake of the 1990 original film, don't. Go rent the current remake of The Karate Kid with Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan instead since that film was practically a shot-for-shot remake of the original.This version of Total Recall, while sharing the bare bones of its plot with the original film, is a movie that can and probably should stand on it's own. If the writers had come up with some other means of bringing the lead character into the plot without use of Rekall, this movie would undoubtedly be considered an original one instead of a remake/reboot.Most reviewers here continually malign the film because it doesn't have Mars, it isn't as colorful, and it doesn't have Arnie quipping away at any given opportunity. Well, why the heck should it have all that? The creative team behind the movie decided to make the world, and by extension of the film itself, much darker and grittier despite the flashy technology. One thing to keep in mind, most action films in the 90's catered to audiences who preferred the bright and almost happy action films that involved a nearly superhuman protagonist who literally laughed in the face of danger, a corny villain who you were happy to hate, and a host of minions that you just knew were going to be slaughtered in cool, fun, and graphically violent ways. The original Total Recall was a product of its time, and Arnie quipped and offered so many one liners after his kills because, frankly, while he had a lot of muscles, there really wasn't much athleticism to him other than throwing a punch or throwing a bad guy.The new Total Recall is, once again, a product of its audiences given the direction movies have taken. Yes, there are next to no one-liners, the main protagonist is deadly serious the entire time, most of the rest of the characters have been re-imagined, and the plot is completely different by and large. What is wrong with that? Colin Ferrell has the kind of physique and athletic ability that Arnold never possessed, and thus is able to portray a very different version of the character, i.e lots more action and no need for one-liners to make up for the fact that his athletic prowess was limited.If you had gone into this movie expecting either a shot-for-shot remake or even one with a very close resemblance to the original, then you have only yourself to blame. This movie was never advertised as a direct remake, so it was your own personal expectations that caused the movie to be less than what it was in your eyes, not the the actors, directors, and writers. All they did was try to re-imagine the movie in an original way.",Total Recall

Dick story, ""We Can Remember it for You Wholesale"". Either way, Total Recall 2012 is terrible. This film tries to update a lot from the 1990 version. Up to date special effects, new actors and a change in setting. Sounds good right? Nope. As cheesy as the original was, it was far more entertaining than this version. Not only that, the original tells the plot better than the remake. Everything was coherent in the old movie than this. The remake told the story in confusingly. I felt like turning off the movie after being clueless. The action wasn't good enough to keep me entertained because it was generic and not engaging. And as much as I like actor Colin Farrel, he isn't great as Douglas Quaid/Carl Houser. The remake also changes the Mars setting to a post-apocalyptic Earth where a nation called the United Federation of Britain exists but exploits The Colony which is present on the Australian continent. The two nations are connected by an underground transportation system called the Fall which can transport human across the planet underground in 30 minutes. This is all an interesting change but I personally preferred Mars over this.Totall Recall 2012 is a failure of a remake and is an example of why remakes of good movies are undesirable.",Total Recall
333,johnkampouropoulos,It's a remake - not the original version.,8,8 April 2021,"I enjoyed this film a lot. Super contemporary, using -and relating to- the scenery and futuristic ideas we all know and respect, in its own way telling an already published story.If we look at it the way it is -not the way we would liked it to be- it's the same like the original greek myth of the Titans and the ""Clash of the Titans""; they are not and will never-ever be the same. Same goes with the true greek myth of Amazons, and ""Wonder Woman"" successful character in the relevant movie. And so on and so forth. I don't agree with these kinds of comparisons. I liked ""Total Recall"" remake; it's an honest, fast, and entertaining movie.Despite what other viewers have suggested, I find all actors completely ""into"" the film's concept; no one knows who to trust, in an era of loss, human exploitation, super-duper technology which both serves and undermines humanity. Why do we expect experienced professionals to act like they're reciting Shakespeare? Is it possible to connect an agent to hearty-tied emotions, while shooting the chips out of a droid, or dangling over a chaotic tunnel in the guts of the Earth's core? Don't think so.Liked the direction of the film, was fast, straight forward, with no unnecessary ornaments and to the point. I even noticed all small tricks regarding other movies and elements - a style so common between directors of Hollywood. And I liked that.There are some plot holes, though. The three-breasted woman cannot be justified in this version: it is not possible to have abandoned the contaminated areas, and at the same time, a contaminated/genetically inflicted person walking around in the crowd just like that. And all the resistance members are fine in shape and wear masks. Plus, the film does not make any direct-indirect 'eye-sign' about the differences between reality and dream, so Melina's tears are not justified to have alerted Doug/Hauser to make a choice accordingly.Other than that, ""T. R."" is a nice film to watch. I had a great time. Kudos to Farrell and Biel and Beckinsale; their counter-matching is perfect in this version.",Total Recall
334,roujin_d,For when your parents won't let you watch the original.,7,25 October 2021,"I watched this movie straight after watching Total Recall (1990). And in all honesty, I don't understand why this movie was made the way it is. It's basically the same main storyline but set in a more futuristic cityscape. The city looked great in certain aspects, I also like the dark, rainy, Blade runner-esque atmosphere. But because there's no Mars sub-plot and no mutants the sets and setting tend to get boring after a while. What I don't understand is, if you're a movie-studio with $M125 burning a hole in your pockets, why not spend some of that money on a fresh story idea? To make an analogy, it's like making a cup of coffee and reusing the filter to make a second cup, it's a watered down version of the original poured in a more expensive beaker.If they had made an original sci-fi movie it could have been fairly decent. But as it is right now I see no reason why you would spend your time and/or money on it.The 7 rating is me being generous, technically it's not bad, the SFX are good, the cinematography is good, there were a few moments where I didn't believe the acting performances, editing could have been better and I had an issue with pacing as well. If I weren't in such a good mood I might have given it a 6/10 rating.",Total Recall
335,unrealmuscat,Good start but fall slowly and lose everything good half way.,4,4 May 2019,"The beginning looks very promising but the movie turn to be only a cat and mouse scenario. Almost all scenes after the action start at about 1/3 of the movie are just chasing to find the main character. Everything around that is not well executed. You have many scenes you don't believe they preserved and not tried to do better. The essence of the original idea of Total Recall is totally lost. The end looks like a patch to try to escape the disaster but that ending is far from something fitting the Total Recall concept. In short: Many nice visual effects, some interresting chasing scenes that looks like moving in a modern video games. Other than that many not well executed scenes, boring repetitives chassing scenes where the enemies just want to kill the hero right at the start, have no apparent reason to kill or keep him alive and of course never kill him when they have the opportunity. Believe me that happens so many times that looks totally ridiculous.
So we can say really poor scenario. No worth 120 millions in my book. That not even deserve to be called Total Recall. You change the title for anything else and it is a flop on the box office and fit better what is supposed to be. :D",Total Recall
336,alex_serious,Totally Rekall the original being better.,5,11 September 2012,"Did you know there was an original Total Recall? Yes...you do. And this movie likes to let you know that it it also knows this by putting in many references to the original film. Which was a lot better.Colin Ferral does a great job in this movie and the CGI is rather outstanding. It is a high budget movie. However, it is soulless, meaningless and something I chose not to recall as it taints my memory of the better Arnie film. Thats right, they remade a movie with Arnie in it. There should be a law against that.The story is much the same as in the original with small aspects being changed that don't really effect the overall character mission. It is obviously no longer set on Mars and does not involve aliens or mutants like the original. Some would say that they have ""modernised"" the story and film but I don't think that it holds up.Watch this movie.

Verhoeven's peace was a classic in it's own way and his movies are best left alone, as remake of Robocop confirmed as well.If this movie was not a remake, it could be viewed as quite decent. Even as a remake, it is not bad, though there is way too much action and CGI for my taste and the story was not as developed as well as it could be, though the original movie was not that much better in that department either. The male major roles are decently acted, but two leading female roles are somewhat lacking, though they are not horrible by any means.I did like the brushes with the original here and there, mentioning of Mars, a familiar lady at the police checkpoint, etc. And I also liked that in this movie it is suggested stronger that everything is fantasy, while in the original it was suggested that it was reality.

It's got a great cast (including the multi-talented Colin Farrell and the beautiful Kate Beckinsale), the action sequences are insanely well choreographed and the effect top-notch... it's just that none of it is memorable (ironic, given the title of the movie). For some guaranteed, quick, si-fi entertainment though, this movie is top notch. If you like Minority Report (also with Colin Farrell) and other similar movies, you'll enjoy this one. It's definitely WAY better than Robocop and a bunch of other remakes that were made recently, mainly because they changed the story around instead of trying to to a frame per frame (but family friendly) remake of an classic.",Total Recall
339,UberGoober1411,"The 90′s film receives a facelift, but with little meaning",6,16 August 2012,"I have never seen the original version of this film but I had a friend silently whisper me the details and differences of it throughout my watching of this 2012 version. The story revolves around the main character, Douglas Quaid (or so we think is his name), played by Colin Farrell, who is tired of his boring simple life and decides to go to a program called Rekall, a memory-altering procedure that implants illusions into one's mind convincing the human psyche that it has actually experienced the said memories. As one can denote from the preview, something goes wrong with the machine and Quaid is forced to defend himself against the horde of enemy soldiers that busts through the wall – to the surprise of the intruders, and Quaid himself, he does this rather well. And so begins the drawn out plot-line where Quaid has to run from, shoot at and avoid nearly every thing that moves while keeping his female companion, played by Jessica Biel, alive.The story itself was rather weak. A rather large amount of video games implement the same style store, Far Cry 2 serves as a good example, so therefore the plot and storytelling is nothing new. Basically mirroring the 90′s movie of the same name, it is there simply to defend the actions of everyone in the film and move the story and characters along.The graphics, on the other hand, were quite good. I'd even go as far as to say exceptional. What I was truly in awe of was the architecture of the film: the way the buildings formed during chase scenes, the way they floated above ground, and the futuristic outlay of the whole Total Recall world. Everything was fit together perfectly, like a jigsaw puzzle without any missing pieces. The textures and the CGI used for the ""car"" chase scenes are both breathtaking, often moving from one scene into another fluidly and without miscues or missteps. This, along with the seemingly never endless bevy of cool and visionary electronics, make this movie a marvel to watch. Everything that you can possibly think of (well, almost everything) is present in the Total Recall world, face changers and hand phones to name a few. These little wonders make the movie fun to watch and will have you saying ""Wow, that's cool!"" more than once or twice.Casting gets a solid B+ from me. No amazing actors/actresses and certainly not ones worthy of an Oscar-nominating performance. Kate Beckinsale holds her own with her sexy English accent, Jessica Biel plays a good yang to Farrell's ying, and the terminal one mentioned does a good job as Douglas Quaid, making a good, albeit sudden, transition from factory worker to historic badass. The supporting cast is simply okay, with Davey Jones making a brief appearance.For anyone who hasn't seen the previews for this film, it's an actions packed sci-fi flick, with plenty of fighting and shooting throughout. Although this may be a fun outing to the average movie-goer, the ending of the film leaves you with nothing to take forward and nothing to learn from. It's essentially empty. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, considering Total Recall wasn't trying to be something more than an action sci-fi; if, on the other hand, it masked its true nature with the desire to be ""something more"", then that's where we would have a problem. Alas, we do not so therefore the empty feeling as you walk out of the theater is easier to deal with.Overall this movie is a good watch for fans of the 90′s flick, as well as for fans of Farrell. Aside from Fright Night, this is one of his best movies of the last decade, and rightfully so.+2 for Farrell +1 for rest of cast +1 for action sequences +2 for graphics and architectural prowess",Total Recall
340,ijozic,Total Eclipse of the Mind,2,6 February 2013,"I don't mind the basic idea of a remake. Often, you'd see some older acclaimed movies and appreciate some of the ideas they had, but also find them underused or undeveloped enough as they fell victim to the cinema standards of the time. The more recent remakes tend to be garbage, though, as they seem more as an attempt to cash in on some previous success story rather then an attempt at a different creative take on the basic idea. One exemption would be the recent ""remake"" of The Thing (itself a very welcome remake of a ""classic"" movie from the 50s), but as it was unpretentious and actually a prequel, I was rather pleasantly surprised. Not so much with the Total Recall, though - when you expect a movie to be bad based on the reviews and still end up surprised, that ought to say something. Although I have fond memories of the original, it was also a weird mixture of a serious sci-fi movie and a trashy B-movie, so I always thought it would have developed more of its potential if it was done in a more serious way, e.g. like Verhoeven's Robocop. Hence why I was somewhat curious at the remake, but, sadly, it doesn't compare at all.It gets tedious quickly with all too many action scenes, it's utterly soulless and frankly just boring. The dialogue is terrible, the acting is bad and the direction is confusing and uninspired. The script seems just like a bunch of overlong dumb-dialog scene reenactments of the original with a lot of mindless action in-between. Colin Farrell has no charisma to lead this movie and with his typical act of a semi-lost, confused and burned-out guy is totally miscast. The rest of the actors (mostly bad) manage to read out their lines of the poorly written text, too, but that's about it. The bad guy is not even worth mentioning.After more than half the movie is spent on the introductory part, the plot reaches the climax too soon and is then patched up by a very unnecessarily long resolution. And lets not get carried away by the word, as its more of an anti-climax compared to it being a very strong part of the original. And then it's patched up by a lot more of tiring action scenes of ever increasing length and pointlessness. It's a shame how much money actually got wasted on this thing - if more money was spent on some decent actors and a half-decent script, the money could have been saved from all the action scenes which wouldn't have been necessary anymore. But, I guess it's easier for the Hollywood producers to bet on the typical action garbage hoping that the formula will work again for the umpteenth time rather than to create something refreshing.Thankfully, I haven't watched in cinemas as I'd have felt embarrassed. Don't watch it even if you think there's nothing better to do at the time as you can't do worse than this..",Total Recall

I sat in the theater pushing my imaginary rewind button just so I could go back to figure out ""who's that guy again"" not that it would have made a difference because the reason for their inclusion in the story was so convoluted that knowing who they were would only have made the movie even thicker and more mired in clay.

345,mrdestroyer2001,Will the dude from the phone booth save the world?,4,23 April 2019,"So, we have another re-filming of a very popular film of the 1990s, created in the wake of the beginning of the 10th year of rework / copying of old films and ideas.With the budget for a hundred million dollars, the picture was a complete failure. And the main reason is not even that it is difficult to outdo the classic action movie with Schwarzenegger, but in the choice of an actor for the main role. Colin Farrell is a man, it is not clear how he got into modern cinema, very weak as an actor, and very weak as a person. He succeeds well in supporting roles (""Dissenting Opinion"", ""Psychics""), but it's good to choose a suitable role for him very hard. The only film where he fit perfectly is ""Telephone Booth"", where his ever-scared face expression and very sluggish energy were Remains a mystery as to why Farrell is vigorously promoting roles in action movies. In Recall Everything, 2012, despite the combined shooting, melee fights with his participation look very, very sad. Can be compared with the battles in the same Born trilogy, where Damon, who owns any technique, looks impressive. There is no rod actor that will make him believe that he is the leader who will change the world. What to say, against the background of superman seven times, Mr. Olympia Schwarzenegger looks more than depressing. advanced by the Italian mafia such actors as DiCaprio, Pacino and De Niro became first-class actors, then Farrell (also, apparently, caught in the cinema for a lot of money) remained a gray mouse.Separately, it is worth mentioning the development of the plot, which gradually slides into something between the scenes of the chases from the Fifth Element, the first part of Star Wars, I, the Robot, Dissenting Opinion, etc. Up to the visual similarity of flying cars. In this film there are no colorful mutants, Mars as such, a more detailed acquaintance with the colony and resistance, as it was in the film by Paul Verhoeven. Also strained gamma, which is dominated by dark tones. If the old film was very bright and saturated, then when watching the version of the 12th year I often had to increase the brightness on the monitor.To the minuses, I would also take not very thoughtful moments with access to high-tech technology of the future. Do you want to sit in any attack aircraft and just hijack it? You are welcome! Do you want to tear off the front plate with your bare hands from a combat robot and disable it? No problem! It can be a consolation that, against the background of other problems, these shortcomings almost do not strain.The only thing you can praise the film for is special effects. That with such a budget is not surprising. Although personally it seemed to me that in the old film the special effects were more original, take at least the same mask of a woman who exploded in the hands of a soldier in a spaceport, or a hologram that repeats the movements of the main character.As a result, the viewer appeared next high-budget, but barely reaching the average action fighter, where the actor for the main role was chosen very poorly, and the development of the plot consists mainly of shootings and races on various mechanisms, whether cars or elevators. By the way, if Ethan Hawke (played Hauser supposedly before the plastic surgery, is also an incomprehensible plot moment) on the main role, this could, in my opinion, save this mediocre film.",Total Recall
346,stuartkpark,Actually not bad,8,4 January 2013,"As with most remakes I expected to be disappointed (except for the truly amazing Dawn Of The Dead remake which is very close to being even better than the also amazing original DOTD), then again I expect to be disappointed by most Hollywood output whether this is a remake or the rare ""original"". I'm a fan of the original Arnie action caper which is why I didn't hold out much hope for this, but the more I watched the more I grew into it and accepted it for its own merits. The first thing that captured me is that it's visually stunning, you get a real sense of this futuristic world without spotting where hand-built sets meet CGI, long gone are the days of annoying cartoon rabbits jumping around in cartoon worlds with equally annoying cartoon robots (roger, roger). The amount of detail is immense where everything is dense and has substance like it belongs there.Colin Farrell makes a better Arnie (no one-liners!) and Kate Beckinsale is a tougher and more relentless Sharon Stone (given a choice it would have to be Kate - sorry Shaz).I get the impression the script was written by someone who liked the original film. For fans of the 1990 version there are a few nods to some of the more memorable parts. In addition to the source material there is enough to keep sci-fi fanboys happy as some scenes and references are lifted directly from Blade Runner, Star Wars and Minority Report. This is in no way a bad thing. I've always felt the Total Recall and Blade Runner stories could be part of the same universe, especially with themes of over-population and off-world colonies.The action is gritty and believable enough (ala Bourne) without being too OTT (ala Transformers). The basic story is pretty much the same as the original so some of the twists don't have the same impact as before, but makes good use of similar plot devices. This is a Hollywood film so plot holes are mandatory, but these don't detract *too much* from the films enjoyment. The one thing that let me down was the last ten minutes. It ended the same way all action films have been ending since I've been watching action films and even before that. It was box ticking at best, since the film impressed me I expected a little more considering how the original ended. So apart from the end a worthy watch without anything too taxing.*** spoilers *** rant *** spoilers *** rant *** What happened to Mars? Surely this was a major part of the original. I was waiting the entire film for Mars and it never happened. Instead of Mars we had a big drill (The Fall) which represented oppression. To me this is like SW:TPM and their tax disputes.How long does this thing take to go through the centre of the Earth? It must be pretty quick (I guess someone somewhere has done the maths). OK, this is the future so I can accept that this is possible. However, can our heroes really crawl outside without being sucked into oblivion. This was certainly a 'what the?!' moment.We had the 'let's tell everyone the plot' trope which gets old, there must be a better way to do this - writers, please! Unless they made a point of doing it because of what it was.We didn't get a sense that the populous was in danger as we never met anyone other than the main characters. The original made you care about the mutants on Mars, ""they turned off the air"". We actually felt sorry for the freaky mutant girl with the forlorn look and melting face. It's what Arnie was fighting for.The ending! No Mars, no mutants, no aliens, no ice core. The original ending was very grand, if you're not making the original ending, then make it better! Blowing up a drill is a bit lackluster in comparison to, melting an ice core, almost turning Arnie and Shaz into mutants and terraforming an entire planet.",Total Recall

Or the evil psycho billionaire tyrant with all the jobs and an army of countless gazillion Robo-Gestapo on the other?Although, really, when one wields an infinite horde of Robo-Gestapo, the entire rest of the plot—what little there is of it—is unnecessary.

This is a very solid, slick, great looking sci-fi action flick. It's only problem is that it carries the same name as a classic from the 80s.It's unfair to compare the two films as they really don't have that much in common. While the Arnold film has mutants and Mars and great, over-the-top 80s style action, this new film is a more direct take; it almost has a 'Minority Report' vibe.I've never been a fan of Colin Farrell, but he works well in this for some reason. Of course I'm always happy to see Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel, both of whom are right at home in action heavy scenes. Bryan Cranston as the villain lends even more authenticity to an already decent cast.What I noticed first was that this film looks great. It's well directed and well designed, from the sets to the costumes and the synthetic police robots look amazing. I'm not sure if they were puppets or mo-cap or a combination, but they don't look like CGI, they are right in the scene. There are no hard-cut, fast-edit, shaky-cam fight scenes, the action flows and allows you to soak in what's happening; a refreshing change from what is ruining so many action films today.Overall, if you like sci-fi and action, you should enjoy this film.

We all know there are certain films that don't need to be remade, I mean what's the point? The Original had the right combination of writing, directing, actors, and imagination that made it a classic. Still I was curious about this new film cause I've heard mixed reactions to it. After Watching Total Recall (2012), I don't think it was a bad movie, not by a long shot. But here's the thing... Change the title, and you have a film completely unrelated from the Original.In the remake the Character's inherit the same names as the characters from the Original. But change that, and drop any references to Rekall and this film has nothing in common with the Original and can be a completely different movie that could stand on it's own with out trying to compare it to the Original. This really didn't have to be a remake, it could have been it's own film that could have focused on its own unique storyline without any ties to the Original. Both films have only few things in common. Then again if it wasn't a Total Recall Remake it wouldn't get any attention at all. Sadly from what I can see that didn't help at all.To sum it up, This movie is OK. Just OK. Really nothing that special. The action sequences are cool, the special effects are cool, and the leading ladies are not only kick ass! but so hot!!! However there is nothing memorable about this film cause we've seen it all in so many futuristic action films before (Minority Report, Equilibrium, The Fifth Element, Ultraviolet, Aeon Flux, I Robot, Etc). Actually when you think about it, this film is basically The Bourne Idenity in the future. As far as Im concerned, Total Recall (1990) is the only Total Recall. Colin Farrell just doesn't have the commanding presence & Charisma Arnold Schwarzenegger Had. Kate Beckinsale as kick ass as she was doesn't have intimidation factor to be the main antagonist where as Michael Ironside was far more intimidating & memorable in the Original. Not to mention This film takes itself much more seriously in its tone, where as the Original had this silliness that made it much more fun & memorable.

In the new movie does the same thing Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale captivated at first, and then charmed by Jessica Biel. Going to the gym, I decided for myself to avoid comparisons with the original film, but at first look, everything else later. And anyway, I do not regret the money and time. If we compare the films themselves, they are different, the old wins in the story and dialogs, the new leaves no chance visuals.

Colin Farrell on his charisma is clearly inferior to Arnold, but takes his ""unassumingly appearance of the people,"" it more believe he works in a factory and lives in a poor neighborhood. His attempts to ""remember"" get natural, the way Schwarzenegger was also convincing in his doubts about the split personality. Arnold, if Farrell wins then only on points, and then with a slight advantage (using boxing terminology). Kate Beckinsale vs. Sharon Stone, as if the choice is obvious in favor of the Stone, but giving her all sexual rounds (in this respect, it looked better than at the time), is forced to a passion for the alleged murder of a victory to give hubby Keith. Her obsession to the point of disobedience of the order in any way to kill the hero Farrell can not go unappreciated. I give it as a victory by a whisker. But Rachel and Jessica Biel Tikotin world apart - a draw, both in the roles of bridesmaids second resistance looked good. Like the films themselves, playing the main roles played by different characters, well then a matter of taste, so, at the end it turns total draw, in my opinion, rightly, the actors looked good.Perhaps, I would level the movies, but if not, first - action sometimes freezes and forms a sort of ""slack"" in the second - in the film Wiseman ending seemed to me, ""plush"" and illogical. Save the world is good, but it is desirable that it did not cause confusion among viewers.The result, films can be compared, looking for the pros / cons, where the ""Total Recall 1990"" better where the new score points. You can watch a movie, do not spoil the mood, I liked, but not a masterpiece, but a nice, above shortcomings have, who will go to a nice view, those who abstain, probably will not lose anything.",Total Recall
354,ThePadraigMoista,"If you're looking for a good action film, see this.",7,5 September 2012,"Colin Farrell stars as Douglas Quaid in this remake of a 90's classic with the same name. Set in a futuristic society where only two parts of the Earth remain. It is about a factory worker, who visits a place called Rekall which is a company who implant fake memories in a person's mind so he can believe he experienced them. While in the process of doing so, something goes wrong and Douglas must find the answer before it's too late. Nobody is who they seem.Let me start off by saying, I have not had the ""pleasure"" of watching the original Total Recall so I will not be able to contrast and compare the two. So I thought that this remake was actually somewhat good. I'm not sure how true it keeps to the storyline of the original but here goes. Colin Farrell was good in it, although action films really aren't the best films to show off your acting abilities. I'm not a great fan of action and so I wouldn't rate this as highly as other people would, but I thought it was still good but for an action film it was pretty good. There was a lot of bits where people kept on missing him with the bullets and where they would aim, then something would happen and miraculously they wouldn't shoot, which is expected from these films. But it was still good.So basically, if you're looking for a good action film, see this. However, as I said, I do not know how true it stays to the original although I know the three-boobed-woman is in it, and you see it all, in a 12A film.

Done with modern cinematography, and maybe even some direction refinements, etc. Hopefully by a true fan. Of the trippin' original film, the unmatched sci-fi story, and of Schwarzenegger. Even if it ditched the witty script, I was open to endless possibilities. So much potential...And when I watched it I was thrilled that it started out true to the original. Then after about 30 minutes it seemed like it turned into The Bourne Identity. And so it became an action adventure with lots of soulless fight scenes (with very skinny women).I feel like this movie totally ripped off the sci-fi genre.",Total Recall

This is a bad movie. A bad bad movie. It's worse than that. It's appalling. 
It's got all the elements of a good sy-fy flick, in fact it's copied all the elements of good sy-fy flicks from other sy-fy flicks, but then forgets to add that sprinkle of fairy dust. Or script. Or acting.
Great films seem to give you time to have dialogue that brings characters to life. Arnie's total recall was full of it. 
Bad films have the same time period but somehow avoid all the character development. Take the three breasted lady in this film - iconic moment? No. Just another 10 seconds killed. If this film had just been the three breasted lady,

359,Convictions,Totally Mediocre,5,31 January 2013,"With each year the amount of remakes being dumped into theaters is growing at an alarming rate. Sometimes I don't mind remakes, especially if it's a remake of a terrible movie because then it provides a window of opportunity for the film makers to correct the problems of the original and to actually get it right this time. However, most remakes are remakes of great movies that don't need to be remade. Over the past few years, there have been great and fun remakes that managed to surpass the original. Unfortunately, that's only a small portion of the remakes that come out every year. As for the others, they're either complete garbage or they're just mediocre. Total Recall belongs in the latter.I don't remember the original Total Recall too well, the last time I saw it was a couple of years ago on TV so I'm not going to compare this film with the original too much. Even if you haven't seen the original this is just a run-of-the-mill action Sci-Fi flick. Since the pros and cons of this movie are about equal I'll start with the problems that this movie had. For starters, not only could this have maybe been better than the original but, this could have also been a great ""screw with your mind"" kind of movie with Colin Farrell's performance. Clearly that was not the film maker's intentions though, so we get this film. The next thing is the chemistry. There is no chemistry between Farrell and Biel, and even less between Farrell and Beckinsale. This is a problem because it made me not care if Biel and Farrell end up together or not.The only good performance in this movie is Colin Farrell, he doesn't have the screen presence like Arnold but, for a movie like this it's good. As for everyone else, the same cannot be said. Kate Beckinsale still acts like she's in the Underworld movies, and Biel just phones-in her performance. Her character serves no purpose other than to be a love interest and to take Farrell to some guy.There are some moments that do manage to toy with your mind and that's when Farrell has to either believe Biel or not or when he's confronted by Beckinsale who tries to confuse him. The script doesn't dive any further to actually challenge our minds and take daring turns because like I said, that is not the film makers intentions.What ultimately saves this movie partially are the action and effects. The special effects are some of the best I've seen in the last couple of years. This didn't get nominated for best special effects but, I have to say they're more impressive than anything that's on that list of nominees(except maybe Prometheus now that I think about it). The action is plentiful and will sure get the pulse pounding. The action sequences are also well shot, there's no shaky-cam and it's pretty well-choreographed.Overall, this would have been a TV movie had it not been for the impressive special effects, impressive action sequences, and a nice performance from Farrell. However, this movie wastes an opportunity to take daring moves, and challenge our minds on a by-the-numbers script. The lack of committed performances from the rest of the cast didn't help either, as well as the lack of chemistry between Farrell and his two female co-stars. As remakes go this isn't bad but, it fails to correct and of the problems of the original and instead just ends up not only having the same problems as the original, but creating new ones for itself as well. I would say see this if you have nothing better to do on a Friday night, otherwise you're not missing much. Plus, when you do see it, like me, you won't be doing what the title suggests. I won't be remembering, or recalling this movie anymore as it's already starting to slowly fade from my memory after I just watched it yesterday.",Total Recall

I'm sure a lot will agree with me - the awesome-ness of Total Recall 1990 was that it took place on Mars and when Arnie activated the alien tech to transform Mars into Earth 2.0. Crazy cool, eh? Especially when its 1990. Its sad this was left out in 2012. Did some rich geek like Zuckerberg bought out the rights to Mars or something? Huh??? Naah. Apparently Mars wasn't really important in Philip K Dick's original story. But screw that, we want Mars. It was the whole appeal to Total Recall 1990. Original or not from the novel. Why make this re-make? Did Wiseman & Co made too much $$$ from the Underworld franchise??? Remaking a film to make it 'prettier' doesn't make it a good watch..... BOOOOOOooooo",Total Recall
363,jamestheklein,Pleasantly surprised,5,5 January 2013,"I enjoyed this film more than I thought I would. I actually enjoyed it more than the Arnie original.The Colony being Australia, instead of Mars, made the concept of this film much more believable, in my opinion. The premise was just something that I could really get into, as opposed to a rebellious Mars. I always felt that if we ever colonised Mars, and they rebelled, people on Earth would just be like ""whatever"" and move on. The twist at the end was great. I can't remember if they had something like that in the original, I blotted most of that film from my memory. Bryan Cranston is always great, as is Kate Beckinsale. Jessica Biel was decent too, although I am not usually a fan of her work. The special effects were good enough to keep me visually entertained too.Where this film falls down are a few common mistakes made by many films. The first is what I call the ""Stormtrooper Aim."" There were a few moments when Colin and Jessica didn't get shot, when they clearly should have been riddled by bullets. I do try and suspend belief with films, but this is one thing that annoys me. The second is the Arch-Villain newbie mistake of taking care of business personally. Cranston didn't need to travel to The Colony. And then there was the inevitable show down between him and Colin. Such show downs always annoy me.Those few things let me down enough that I will only give this a 5/10. Better than the original, but the films against which I judge others set the bar very, very high. I would watch it again.",Total Recall
364,The_Film_Anorak,The Blade Minority,2,28 January 2013,"I watched the 2012 remake of Total Recall on a kind of double bill with Rock of Ages, an event which I like to call ""Bryan Cranston Is Better Than This"" night. I'm a fan of the Schwarzenegger version, but as a fan also of source author Philip K Dick I was more than happy to see someone do another version bringing more of the original twisty paranoia to the screen. This is not that version.Arnie did a perfectly good version of this story, taking the basic mind- bending, identity crisis story and fashioning a vehicle for the big Austrian to crack heads and director Paul Verhoeven to mix bloody violence with sly satire. With the modern fashion for straight-ahead action films to stick to PG-13 rated run-jump-shoot, a minimum of story and character and absolutely no sex or swearing, it seems unlikely that another action movie version of this story would improve on the original. To be successful you're looking at either going back to the hard sci-fi roots of the original novella on a lower budget, or putting it in the hands of someone who makes big budget blockbusters with substance. In other words, you want to give Duncan Jones forty million dollars to make this, or give Christopher Nolan or Peter Jackson two hundred million dollars to make this. What we get instead is Len Wiseman at the helm of a $125 million popcorn movie, doing exactly what the executives tell him to do.Evidently, what the executives wanted was to pillage better films for the sets, costumes, style, action and ideas of the film. Ridley Scott's peerless Dick adaptation Blade Runner is predictably stolen from on an industrial scale to portray a grungy dystopian future. But that's a bit 1982, so they give it a CGI effects airbrushing stolen from Spielberg's Minority Report (another superior version of a Dick story). And now I know what you're thinking. It's about a man who can't remember his past, with people out to kill him, who keeps showing flashes of his lethal spy abilities while running at full pelt and trying to find the truth as he goes. Only an idiot wouldn't try and distance himself from The Bourne.... Well, you'd be wrong. The fight scenes, breathless running in and out of windows and wide-eyed who am I acting scream ""Matt Daaaaamon"" like the director's cut of Team America. They could of course have got Matt Damon to play this role, so similar is it to Jason Bourne. Of course, Matt Damon also has a pretty decent Philip K Dick film under his belt, so he might have seen doing this film as treading over familiar ground. Which is what watching the film feels like.So it's derivative and over-familiar in the way it looks. It still has the opportunity to do something with the story, an opportunity it completely spurns. The world is divided into the haves in an overcrowded future version of Britain, and have nots The Colony, formerly Australia, a giant ghetto inexplicably shrouded in gloomy rainclouds for no other reason than the film's desire to be Ridley Scott lite. They are joined by an improbably high speed transport link through the centre of the earth, and closed in with the rest of the earth more or less uninhabitable. Plenty of opportunities to crank up some Dickian confusion and paranoia, maybe even throw in some echoes of Britain's colonial past or even the murky present day issues of immigration and Western exploitation. Nope. It's all just a perfunctory setup for the moment Colin Farrell goes to Rekall, there's a problem with his memory and now he has to run and jump through a lot of windows. He can't trust his wife and friends, the authorities are after him, he has to make common cause with rebels he only half remembers... But it's all been done miles better a hundred times before.It becomes an object lesson in how to make an inferior version of other films. The bits that are left over from the original Total Recall pale next to the 1990 version – Arnie (not exactly Farrell's match as an actor) was genuinely scared and confused, and when his memory was being messed with you saw his struggle through the veins throbbing in his forehead. Here it's just a few slick nods to the original and then another run-jump-shoot sequence. Other actors like Cranston and Jessica Biel are just as underused. The grim Blade Runner sequences just look like a reasonably good night out in Tokyo – you certainly can't taste the acid rain or feel the despair of the people, and the part where Farrell dolefully plays the piano and tries to make sense of his past is just an insult. The scenes with the resistance are just thrown in for five minutes before the next helping of run-jump-shoot, and aren't even as good as their equivalent scenes in the Running Man.In the end what you get is a really routine version of much better films, for people who for some reason don't want to be properly engaged or excited by films and would rather just zone out for a couple of hours. I ended up just trying to think of witty alternative titles that reference all the films they've stolen from – The Blade Minority, Bourne Runner – but I could just as easily have done some paperwork or caught up on some emails while this was on and got just as much out of it.My advice is to watch the science fiction films the makers of this movie have borrowed from wholesale, from the original film. Otherwise if you happen to know a real Rekall centre, and can have your memory wiped, you could then watch this film and it might seem fresh. Then again you might still feel a nagging sensation of deja vu...",Total Recall

Great special effect, action and acting",9,11 November 2012,"A lot of people watch this movie to see mutated human and mars, but to be honest, forget about the first film, it was great but this movie did a really good job using an old name but making a great action flick. The action and acting was great (even though as a martial art practitioner i didn't think some of the fight scene was realistic, but im not expecting it to be a fighting film anyway). The highlight is really the twists of the storyline, and the futuristic landscape and taste - as a die hard science fiction movie fan, I was incredibly impressed with that. All the acting was superb, Colin and Bryan did a fantastic job, as well as Kate and Jessica (they both are my favorite Hollywood actress).Anyway, this film is a must watch for any Sci-fi fans, and remember try not to expect any old 1990 version before watching it - this film stand solid on its own as a great sci-fi + action film!",Total Recall
366,stephen-humphries,"Floating cars, Robots and Futuristic Cities.",4,23 September 2012,"When I was a kid I had about 20 VHS videos and one of my favorites was Total Recall. Along with the Terminator and Rambo I must have watched it 300 bloody times. The story is ingrained in the neural pathways of my brain. So, as you can imagine, it was with great excitement that I sat down to watch the remake. The story remains somewhat loyal to the Schwarzenegger version and even has a few cult tributes to the original; like when Quaid gets propositioned by a prostitute with three breasts. However it lacks that certain level of fantasy fun that ran through the first one. It's missing that freaky factor that the first one had. It needs something weird like a giant mutant or some monsters or maybe even an Arnie. I'm just not sure that Farrell was the man for the job, in fact looking at Farrell's career I can see that whenever he tries to play the action hero he seems to fall short. This movie is more of a Vin Diesel, Jason Statham or maybe even Mark Wahlberg affair. Farrel is too good of an actor. However this movie is worth watching just for the set design. The first time I saw blade runner it seemed huge to me, it was like a whole alternate universe existed in that film. This was because of the set designs and the fact that the streets and buildings seemed to go on forever; all with their own unique style and feel. The new Total Recall definitely accomplishes the same effect. The amount of detail in the city scenes is phenomenal. The cityscapes and the futuristic ideas are fascinating and as good as any sci-fi movie I have seen. With multi layered city views at death defying heights, hovering cars, robot police, and a whole new line of communications technologies, it certainly gets the imagination going.The world that director Len Wiseman has created here is very believable. I think this has something to do with the amount of people in the street scenes. The more people there are in an imaginary universe the more realistic it looks. Also the troops and Robot police are in droves and at times the film reaches epic death star proportions. An interesting thing that struck me was the proof that feminism really has made a lot of headway since the 8o's and early 90's. In the first movie Quaid's wife has a great go at trying to kill him, I remember being impressed by the scene were Sharon Stone has a full on knife fight with Schwarzenegger. It seems that since then and after tomb raider, underworld and hundreds of other movies women's ass kicking skills have seriously improved. Quaid's wife has a massive role and is a relentless, psychotic ass kicker. She's a cross between a female terminator and that crazy woman in fatal attraction. Kate Beckinsale really gives this role her all. In fact Beckinsale makes the movie and it's probably because of her that the action scenes are very watchable. I so wanted to love this film but even with its super cool CGI it just doesn't cut it. The truth is the film has been very poorly cast, yes OK Colin Farrell is always going to be a good front man, but I have always thought of Farrell as more of an actor than an action hero, and this film really is, or should be, a balls out action film. But Farrell isn't the problem, nor is Kate Beckinsale or even Jessica Biel in her role as the sane beautiful heroine; it's the smaller roles that let the film down. It's like everyone got to do a role that they just weren't suited to. Bill Nighy has a tiny part and isn't utilized to his full potential and then Bryan Cranston plays a role that doesn't suite him at all and it really feels like his acting skills have been stretched across this movie to breaking point. Why get the casting so wrong when you get the atmosphere and CGI so right? It seems like a waste.The film is important because it feeds our imagination. I love watching old 60's movies set in futuristic space age environments, a lot of the stuff in those movies have helped shape what actually came about in the real world. I hope that at some point in the future some of the things in this movie come true; I hope there is a tube train that cuts through the center of the earth, phones that are implanted in our hands, floating cars and visual glass technology. I am a great believer in reality mimicking art and that is why we need movies like this that show cool stuff that we might possibly have in the future. However Despite the fancy future tech, the ambiance, some satisfying action scenes and the good CGI the film was boring and had a horrible ending. Should you go and see it? Definitely there are floating cars, robots and futuristic cities in it!",Total Recall

Not being an action movie buff I will not comment on the qualities of the CGI and action sequences. I also am not one of those who apparently consider Arnold a great actor. I found Farrell passable, but Beckinsale was excellent. This version is closer to Dick's libertarian tendencies which offends some of the reviewers. For example it's an oppressive government versus the clichéd idea of an oppressive corporation. There are other examples throughout the film. This is a rather brave attempt to make comment on a number of issues relevant to today.",Total Recall
369,rockchester,Remaking Recall,8,16 February 2013,"There are some movies that just shouldn't have been remade. 2011's The Thing, for one, which was actually a remake of a remake. But Total Recall is clearly a huge improvement over the 1990 movie of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ronny Cox.Now, don't get me wrong, I actually liked Arnold's movie. Ronny Cox, as Cohaagen really stole the show and was far and away the real star of the movie. Michael Ironside and Sharon Stone put in very dependable performances. Arnold was entertaining, certainly, I don't dislike him. Overall, it's a movie that I don't mind seeing again, and I will.Taking in to account that the special effects of the remake are, of course, much better than the original. And, aside from the fact that the 2012 remake cost twice as much as it made (so far) while the original made twice as much as it cost (to date) and the ending of the 2012 movie was a bit lame, it's still a better movie than the 1990 original.In the first place, Colin Farrell is an actual actor, unlike Arnold who is a movie star who became one Ala Johnny Weissmueller. It's great to see someone playing Douglas Quaid who can make the character believable and can actually act without looking like a cartoon character.Secondly, the remake also stars Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel, who are unquestionably, two of the most beautiful women ever to grace the silver screen. They are also both excellent actors who I never get tired of watching (and not just for their beauty either, that would get boring very fast if that was all they had).The remake cleaned up and improved upon some of the, shall we say, less efficient aspects of the original. For example, they combined the woman who pretends to be Quaid's wife with Cohaagen's lieutenant (played by Sharon Stone and Michael Ironside) and the result was Kate Beckinsale's riveting bad girl.Another change that the remake did was rather elegant. In the original, Quaid starts out as a really bad guy. He's so bad that he's second only to the king of bad, Cohaagan. So, Arnold, you're a really bad guy who goes undercover to be a good guy. When they erased your memory, they also erased your badness? Are morals, or in your case, a lack of morals erased too? And when you're let in on the fact that you're really a bad guy, what makes you decide to be good? Arnold's Quaid almost makes the transition for no particular reason. Maybe it's hanging out with mutants, whatever. But, in the remake, Quaid fell in love with a woman who changed his mind and he became good over time. This was an improvement, certainly, not only of the script but the acting as well.Also, they did away with Mars and instead kept everything on an Earth that had seen better days. In place of the red planet is The Fall which is a HUGE elevator-type contraption that travels through the earth and connects the United Federation of Britain with The Colony (the last two habitable places left on earth). Really stunning effects make it almost an uncredited star of the movie.The synthetic police officers were a nice touch and very slick.But wait, there's more. The remake sprinkles homages to the original throughout the movie (three-breasted woman, the checkpoint that Quaid attempts to slip though, that Quaid says he always wanted to go to Mars, et al).Perhaps surprisingly, there are some aspects of the remake that just aren't up to the standards of the original (gasp!). The one that stands out the most is that Ronny Cox's Cohaagen was a spectacular testament to the actor's abilities. He was the best part of the original. In the remake, Bryan Cranston's Cohaagen is rather two-dimensional and bland; a cookie cutter head cheese bad guy.Another bit of atrociousness is that Bill Nighy's appearance is almost a cameo. This is another actor who I just love to watch and can really carry any scene he's in. But in this movie, he's gone before he even gets a chance to warm up much. A real waste. Perhaps there's more to these characters and their obscure connection that is sitting on the cutting room floor. I'll have to check that out on the super deluxe blue ray edition that's bound to come out in the near future.One thing that was annoying, and this is nitpicking, is that couldn't we just once see Jessica or Kate in a bikini? Come on now. As it is, all we see of them in this movie is what you'd probably see anywhere in public.Overall, if you loved the original, unless Arnold is a god that you worship, you'll love this remake. Definitely worth the price and worth a look.",Total Recall
370,Taylor_Gillen,"Nice CGI, but very Hollywood",6,17 March 2013,"Like most modern action movies set in the future, ""Total Recall"" places special effects and long, drawn-out action scenes above story, lessons, and character development. While the setting is clever, the idea of living space being the most valuable resource is not explored much in the movie. As with most average high-budget movies, the main characters are gorgeous and are pretty easy to understand. Indeed, they have just enough depth to make the average viewer interested but not enough to make the characters live in the thoughts of moviegoers past the credits. This movie also lacks a good message. In fact, though it was supposed to keep people guessing (hence the tag line, ""what is real?""), it is easy to predict how the movie ends.The concepts of overpopulation and paying to be given memories of a life never lived are brought up in the beginning. They made me interested, but unfortunately were quickly abandoned in exchange for lengthy shootouts and on-foot chases. Despite the need for action movies to have action (hence the name of the genre), it should not be incongruous. Unfortunately for ""Total Recall"", lots of the fight sequences could have been shortened or eliminated without the plot being damaged.I award this movie 6 out of 10 for good setting and excellent CGI.

Total Recall was an excellent & engaging ride through a decayed but recognizable futuristic world where what you see may or may not be what you get! It is an admirably creative story including unique gadgets, captivating plot twists, awesome fight scenes, and excellent visual effects! This film was everything I think it should have been! I don't care what everyone else says, I loved it.",Total Recall
372,stevenaaus,Pointless remake,4,11 September 2021,"Fairly standard Hollywood cash grab doesn't add enough to Arnie's classic to justify being made.I've given it 4/10 solely for the actors' commitment, and it's dark futuristic settings/cgi. But the problems are many - No Mars, freaks or humour. Too much drawn-out navel gazing and talk. The machine guns... please!? The boring clone-like minions. Then, the plot - where it does occasionally deviate from the original - just makes the mess worse.On the whole it's just a slick, soulless, Hollywood smash and mash.",Total Recall
373,finraziel,Couldn't believe how bad this is...,2,16 September 2012,"So, I didn't expect this movie to be great because I read the reviews on here, but I suspected that it was being judged harshly by fans of the original (and who over the age of 25 isn't?). It's not. If anything, I don't understand how it is still getting a passing grade. The only explanation I can find is many people like the overload of CGI it serves up. The most fun I've gotten out of this movie though, was at the start watching Kate Beckinsale in tight panties and in the car ride home bitching about the movie with my friends. The two hours in between were a total waste of time. There's the story, which is different in what the bad guys are trying to do and it not being on mars but otherwise so alike to the original that there is absolutely not a single surprise. The only surprise to me was that they didn't go with the obvious parallel ending to the original, which sounds like it would be good, but it's not because the way Cohaagen tries to go about achieving his goal is so unbelievable that when his plan is foiled there's really no sense of relief or grandeur, going with the obvious would have been better. Then what makes it worse is that at every turn they seem to want to remind you of the original movie, by rehashing lots of details from the original (the three breasted hooker walks by without any explanation or logical reason for her being there, including the cheesy you'll wish you had three hands quote, someone gets their hand cut off by an elevator, Quaid/Hauser getting caught by customs because he only has three lines prepared, etc.). Also, the music is ripped from the first movie, which could have been good but isn't because the movie sucks so badly. At the ending when the music starts in in the same way as when the original had just given Mars an atmosphere, it's just a slap in the face because you're reminded how the new ending is so totally inconsequential, it's just not deserving of such dramatic music, it doesn't work. The action and CGI is OK, but it seems to me like it's going through the motions. They threw a lot of money at it, but it doesn't work. The first half of the movie seems to be one big chase and I was bored out of my mind. Then there's the blatant disregard of physics... I can usually ignore this, but this movie is so bad about it, and with the absence of a plot to distract me, it really bugged me. There's a fast travel line through the earth from the UK to Australia, called the fall, which basically works by letting you fall through the earth to the other side. Now, I can see how that would be possible, in movie logic, so I'd be OK with that. What really bugs me, is how they cope with gravity. If you would do this, gravity would slowly decrease as you approach the earth's core, then start to build up in the opposite direction. Not so in this movie, gravity seems to be totally unaffected while you're falling (you should be weightless already while falling), then around the core, gravity just disappears as if someone threw a switch, and a minute later it comes crashing back with a bang in the opposite direction. That makes absolutely no sense at all. Then, I believe at the beginning of the movie they say the journey takes only a few minutes, but let's say I misunderstood that and it takes 30 minutes. At half an hour, you would still need to have an average speed of 25.000 kph (about 16.000 mph). That's average, you'd be going faster in the middle of your journey. So what do they do during the final scenes of the movie? They open a window and climb along the outside of the craft... If the story would be good, but it's just another thing to show the absolute lack of attention to detail that was put in this movie.Then there's things like Doug fighting a robot in hand to hand combat and pulling a phone out of his hand without any blood or his hand being mangled for the rest of the movie (seriously, the through-the-nose-brain-surgery device from the original was more believable), it just tests how gullible you are at every turn. As for the actors, I'm not really good at judging how good someone's acting, but Colin is no Arnie. Kate and Jessica succeed in being pretty and that seems to be their purpose. Then, Bill Nighy as the resistance leader??? Don't get me wrong, I love the guy, but you can't take him seriously and he's a very bad fit for this role (however small it is). They would have been better off casting someone no one knew yet. So to summarize, if you want to watch Kate in tight panties and you enjoy loads and loads of CGI and don't care about such things as plot and believability, then you may enjoy this movie. For anyone with half a brain though, don't bother, just watch the original again.",Total Recall
374,atreus_4971,Not what I hoped,3,17 December 2012,"There comes a point when too much action in a film becomes boring. At the moment I can think of no better film than this to justify the argument. That being said there are many people who love full throttle non-stop gut-wrenching action with no story, plot or character development, so this may well be for you. Another simple argument, albeit a male one, is that Kate Beckinsale in a pair of white undies is definitely lovely, but not necessarily worth wading through sewage to see.It's a real shame. This could have been a great film. Colin Farrell is amazing in 'In Bruges', the guy can handle dialogue, but in this film he had none. I did like the little homages to Blade runner, although I do hope this is not an indication that Hollywood intends to remake that!Overall, if you like action it's OK. If you like real sci-fi, don't bother. Too much was sacrificed to make one long endless eternal on-going never ending action sequence. It was just background noise by the third quarter of the movie. I couldn't wait for it to end.Philip K Dick would be shaking his head at this.",Total Recall
375,TypedbyTara,An Oreo without the Filling,5,25 August 2012,"First let me start by saying that if you haven't already guessed, this movie is a remake. The original Total Recall featured good ole' Arnold, the Moon, and Mutants. None of which were found in this flick. Oh but don't worry, even though all the other mutants were scrapped, three- boob woman made an appearance, thank god!!! (please note my sarcasm). It was clear that the sole purpose of this tri-breasted maiden was to entertain the male viewers for a few moments. However, since the rest of the movie was void of any other mutants, her presence was random and awkward to say the least. The moon's absence did to go unnoticed either. It was briefly mentioned, but the viewers never got to see it, and the main character never actually went there. The producers basically used the ""shell"" of the original plot line to make this movie, and they used intense action sequences to fill in the rest. For those of you who don't know the original plot, it goes something like this. Douglas Quaid is haunted by a recurring dream about a journey to Mars. He hopes to find out more about this dream and buys a holiday at Rekall Inc. where they sell implanted memories. But something goes wrong with the memory implantation and he remembers being a secret agent fighting against the evil Mars administrator Cohaagen. Thats the original plot anyway.The acting was well done, Kate Beckinsale's performance sanding out in particular. She did a nice job of playing the sultry yet intense and determined Lori. Colin Farrell also did a nice job of playing Quaid.The movie was great on special effects and action sequences, but those only severed to cover up the revamped and slightly botched plot line. If you have never seen the original movie then you might like this movie. But if you were expecting this movie to be like the original then you will sadly be let down, because Total Recall 2012 didn't do Total Recall 1990 justice. Guess the produces didn't ""recall"" the entire plot/ details of the original.",Total Recall
376,ani-for-prez,Expected far worse after all the reviews,6,11 November 2012,"Frankly, this movie has been getting a ton of flak for how it's not that great, especially because it had the original to live up to. But having not seen the original before watching this one here's how I felt about this.There's a lot of good stuff in here. Forget the visuals (even though they're fantastic) the world looks like a very believable future. This vision of how 2 massive cities could be in the future, one a crowded, multi-storey slum, the other a high-tech utopia, both look and behave very realistically. The attention to details and the grounded imagination impressed me. The obvious inspirations from Bladerunner is a nice touch. The acting is pretty good with most of the lead cast playing their parts well enough with Jessica Biel being the only one who disappointed me a bit. Action is choreographed and filmed very well with minimal reliance on shakycam.The bad parts are all within the plot being incoherences, weak science and almost zero signs of the first movie except for the names, the memory theme and the tri-mammaried hooker (I know enough about the movie to know what it was famous for). The intentions of the antagonist are weak; you don't really want to invade the only other country that exists just because you ran out of space. We are never shown enough of the good guys to actually care about whether they succeed and the flow of the plot seemed to certainly suggest they would win by the end which leaves us with no emotional bond with them. This also meant the awesome Bill Nighy was grievously underused. There were parts were the robots were taken down with ease and others where they would almost refuse to die.I would have taken everything bad about the plot as a given since the possibility exists that the protagonist is simply creating this fantasy for himself but the reason people don't really want consider line of thought is because that confusion was never focused. A few scenes, one of them unnecessarily long and others unnecessarily brief, didn't lend much more thought to this issue. This was a crying shame because actually making the movie about his confusion and all those things meta would have made this gorgeous movie fantastic. As it stands, the movie is quite average though not as bad as people are making it out to be.If you're watching a remake, base the movie on the strength of it's own merits instead of comparing it to the original. Far too many people want to compare these types of movies and end up being disappointed.",Total Recall

Good actors and a lot of SFX don't necessarily mean success.There was this one time when after the first fistfight i was looking at the ceiling waiting for it to end(both the fight and the film).Why do it?I mean sure SFX and the movie industry has advanced from the 90s but why do it?Why put a 2 minute of excellent choreographed fight?OK i know you can do it now days better than in the 90's.So make another film and call it ""total fight"" or whatever.You got your class A actors and make them struggle to give another impression of Doug Quaid and Melina.Again:why do it?Its like remaking The Thing or Star Wars.It don't make a damn sense.And then you got Cohagen.He is the big honcho ,the main man and you put him in the first line of fight to be killed like a simple lackey?Its like sending Barrack Obama to fight in Afghanistan.Come on people.You do this so the script is different from the Verhoffen one?Where's Mars?Whats with the ""colonies"" stuff?And the androids?Wow.Every time Quaid was captured the droids became awfully slow and weak.I mean try escaping the grip of a wrench-hand droid or whatever you call it.You put these super vfx and then you get lame excuses for suspense and action.I could write endless ""i didn't like this or that"",but that is not the point. Don't get me wrong.I don't diminish the efforts of all the people behind this film.Visually the film is flawless.You got your class A actors and big budget effects.Its impressive for about the first 10 minutes.Then its boring.It has no soul.I am just angry at the studios and producers that Okayed this project.

378,gaborzeller,Hey that actually wasn't bad,6,19 December 2012,"Since its a remake Ill cut my review into two parts, one for those who actually did see the original one and one for the others who didn't.If you did see the original:Well they were basically using the same plot, but the execution was different. The tone was different too. The original was a kinda interesting mix of thriller, action, gore and comedy elements. This one was an all-in action movie. Problem is that I just couldn't shut my mind and was constantly comparing the two. If you know how the story plays out there is just no real tension. Which is sad since the remake has just the right amount of mystery (like its predecessor) to be more than just an action-schluck.If you didn't see the original:Since I like my action movies action packed then Total Recall certainly delivers. The whole movie was a huge action scene so some people might find it tiring. One other thing - since I am much more of a fan of practical effects the overuse of video game stunts were just too much for my taste.So in the end I would say I liked the remake. Different movie for sure but likable. Sadly Kate Beckinsale had to play a really badly-written character without any depth while on the other hand I was surprised how good Jessica Biel was. Collin Farrel wasn't bad either. Nothing memorable but a decent performance.",Total Recall

380,mac_martino,Utterly disappointing,4,19 November 2012,"As to say, this movie was one I was hoping for since 1990 , after the original movie Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger. We were as teens hoping for number 2 to get explanation on how it all began and to know whether or not it was real or actually a dream. I therefore was hoping that this Rekall 2012 would be it. But unfortunately they made it a plain basic action movie instead off a well thought of concept. In all honesty I watched this movie and the day after I watched the original. You have to love the original, better tension, more compelling story. and suspense. the 2012 version is set in a different setting, it's not on mars but some colony on the other side of the earth, as if you can go straight through the earths core right. secondly it seems at the end to be all over when 1 transport system is broken down, as if they don't have any means of flight and fast transportation.. bull..Anyways, If you still want to see a good movie, go and see the version of 1990. because that gives you a much more psychological background to the whole idea of Rekall..",Total Recall
381,Knowmansoul,Mr. Wiseman took the story too seriously,6,27 October 2014,"That's it! The original movie was fun and funny. Wiseman's remake removed the funny and thereby lessened the fun. The only humor that made it into the movie, was the brief clip of Quaid opening up his safety deposit box and pulling out his stash of ""Obama Bucks"". I wonder if this was political commentary, it probably was a commentary, but, I haven't read of Wiseman's political views, so, it's only my speculation. Colin Farrell & Jessica Biel had no chemistry as their characters were supposed to have been romantically connected. I understand that Hauser couldn't totally recall his romance, and that may impact affections, but, in a fantasy such as this, I'm expecting that the leading man and leading lady will hit it off in the story, but, this relationship didn't feel like romance. One outstanding thing about the movie was the setting. Wiseman's future Australia was super slick, the feel of the colony was an excellent remake of Ridley Scott's 2019 Los Angeles, in the 1982 film, Blade Runner. I think that Mr. Scott can be very proud that his work, from thirty years ago, still holds so much allure for young guns like Wiseman. It's cool to see a young director, such as Len Wiseman pay homage to the ground breaking work done by Scott, in Blade Runner.",Total Recall

Movie starts off with a strong scene but i think it pretty much spoils the surprise / twist element. The movie is high on action (plenty of it) but not so high on story and logic, but who goes to watch such movie for logic. Personal review on acting:- Colin Farrell - not bad i did say, looked suitable and apt for the role. Jessica Biel - strong performance, delivered what she had.

Total Recall is not a remake, it's a revisit of the original short story by Philip K. Dick (who has inspired some of the greatest sci-fi films of all time), but it takes on it's own story and fails to do either the short story or the Schwarzenegger version any justice. The film looks magnificent and the action is great, but the story/plot falls on it's face like a giant game of jenga.

I really did try watching this -- I used to like Kate Beckinsale, she has done some wonderful stuff but this isn't any of it. It's difficult to come up with 10 lines to say how bad this is. After only fifteen minutes I found myself bored, I didn't care about any of the characters and if they'd all been assassinated by a heartless sadistic psychopath I would probably have been heartily relieved. Why the producers thought they could improve on the 1990 version I don't know. This is a prime example of special effects substituting for real substance in a movie which seems to be more and more prevalent in Hollywood. Perhaps they should remake Gone With The Wind with a happy ending casting Kate Beckinsale as Scarlett, Matthew McConaughey as Rhett Butler and set in a NY disco called Twelve Trees.",Total Recall
387,Benton_Phillips,Partial Recall - Not as I remembered it,4,19 August 2012,"Film making is a tricky business, idea development, creative vision and connecting with a contemporary audience, all can be difficult so why not take the easy route and rehash something that has already been made, - what a good idea as we have no of our own. Total Recall (1990) was a interpretation of a Philip k. Dick short story, from Paul Verhoeven who is not someone I consider to be a great director by any means, but what I can say is that he read ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"" and then endeavoured to create a vision of the way he saw and understand the vivid world Philip k. Dick had created - (This is otherwise known as the film making process).Total Recall (2012) is an interpretation of a 1990's film keeping the names including a few not so subtle wink-wink moments to the original and zero character development - ('Well you've seen the original so we don't have to tell you a story you already know' - ...) You are left with a triple distilled story that needs some kind of magician in terms of a visionary director to compile any sort of coherent narrative ""call Len Wiseman"". (Len Wiseman, a history, esteemed graduate of the 'Michael Bay Ethos Academy' - their mantra of the three E's; Expansive, Explosive and Empty.)My question marks over the narrative can be summarised with one simple and often utter phrase 'A chick with three boobs, awesome' - awesome? yes, but wait, why? there's no narrative tool in place for it, this is merely a random event that has been has been lost in translation. Oh, and a final point Len I know you married her (and fair play on that one) but your wife can't play 'bad girl' no matter how much you want her to.So when you feel the need make a film but don't have the time and energy to make something original don't deface a cult classic or any film for that matter, just don't make anything and you know why because I can watch Total Recall on DVD, its sitting right there, and has been entertaining me for 15 years.",Total Recall

How about we stop living in the past for a second and start living in the present/future.Of course this movie was not so good. But you cannot judge something, using the past as comparison items. It's like trying to compare The Dark Knight series to William Shakespeare's books. There are just terms that cannot be placed one against each other.The old one was great. Of course.. I was born in that same age of movies. However, this remake gives us a great attempt to successfully recreate a story, but with some of the modern time elements. You cannot compare Greed motive from the old movie, with the Slavery motive presented in this one, even though they are somewhat related. Here's why:Chemical war raged, Earth went boo boo, not many places to live in except part of Europe and (United Federation of Blabla) and The Colony (Former Australia) Current UFB president (or something like that) is some-what a dictator There is a ""resistance"" led by a man who tries to inspire but is not present much in the film (nor his objectives .. at least at first) UFB president is faced with overpopulation and wants to conquest/annihilate/enslave The Colony, and so he uses his best agent to do that Best agent (Colin) has his memories stored in a green goo syringe, then gets thrown as an undercover agent in the resistance, however he falls in love with a chick and becomes corrupted (actually, his eyes open and he sees the evil in his leader, so he switches sides) UFB captures him and blow his minds... and offs him with am memory inhibitor chip and fake memories, fake wife etc (discrepancy here, why not restore his old memory before he got corrupted... this is a plot key triggering the action and showing us the reason: not knowing who he is would send him on a wild nut-job chase into finding the Resistance leader so UFB can kill him) Unexpected side effects (nightmares and stuff) force Colin to go to a Rekall agency (they put you to sleep for a while and you can dream whatever you want). However, the machine destroys a memory inhibitor chip UFB placed in his head. He goes crazy and starts killing people who are trying to kill him for no reason - He gets together with his chick and he starts remembering stuff, like how to play the piano etc.Lots of shooting, lots of cgi chasing... they finally figure out the UFB plan, they meat up with the resistance boss but they get busted because the only way to stop the UFB was actually a memory trap implanted in Colin. Resistance leader goes to heaven, invasion almost begins, Colin gets angry, robots die, UFB president dies, invasion stopped.The acting was not so bad. Of course there were some bad moments.. but don't tell me Arnold was the best actor of his time. IT WOULD BE A LOAD OF CRAP.CGI was off the charts. Considering this is a 2012 film, CGI is accepted but somewhat overrated these days. That doesn't mean I agree with it, but it's better than watching Harry Potter! The characters don't see much development, but the main one sure suffers a lot of switches, which is kind of intense.In a nutshell, the purpose of this movie was its CGI, its action scenes, and the plot about one man ,not knowing who he is, that can save 2 worlds casted aside. This was the intended and only goal, and should be treated/rated/judged as such. Just like you cannot criticize a random magazine for being a bad book!!Even though this film was not one of the best, I will give it an 8, based on its achievements regarding its goal: an action CGI movie.",Total Recall
395,lnyron,"If you're looking for something to watch, just stick with the original.",3,29 August 2020,"No style, no substance. This is a movie with none of it's own identity; while lazily lifting the bare bones of the original (movie, that is) it rather shamelessly lifts plots and settings from other better movies; it's Bourne Identity set in Minority Report-land (also K. Dick. There's even some Star Wars thrown in there toward the end.The first movie, while not perfect by any stretch, is not done any service by this lazy retelling. The one-liners are even lamer, sparse and poorly timed. Fans of the original, or the story won't be happy. I don't think the network executives knew who they were catering to, and unless you like nothing but the most basic of action movies with predictable plots, you won't be happy.

396,lauluisa,A sad and pointless remake of a great movie,4,14 August 2012,"As somebody already mentioned here - this new movie has no soul. And - given - it has so much potential, this is very, very sad. Its as if you watch some truly great play and then proceed to watching ""even the rich weep/Veronica/Maria"" crap. One thing is good though: I learned to really appreciate Arnie. His presence is something to truly enjoy, whereas Farrell... well, I didn't like him in Alexander and I didn't like him here. Its just not his place. All the nuances, intrigue and fun of the original are gone here, replaced by mindless action sequences, that bore you to death after 2.3 minutes. There were some tributes (with a twist) to the original - like the scene in the customs, where Farrell gets caught, and, of course, the triple-boobed hooker - but they only direct you back to the original. Yes, the SCI was good, but it would be more enjoyable as a stand-alone feature - without the stupefying action. For years I have been longing (and dreading) to see things like K.S.Robinson's Mars Trilogy and D.Simmons' Hyperion Saga on a big screen, but now I think - better not. I am not willing to trade poetry for poorly-made pottery. If you want some good action, go for Streets of Fire and the original TR :)",Total Recall

If you haven't seen any sci-fi movie before, watch ""Blade Runner"" or the original ""Total Recall"". This version has some pretty nice action scenes, some famous actors and copies all the nice ideas from the original only to change the funniest, smartest scenes from the original. I'd give it to the creator, that it is not very easy to copy a classic like the original one, and I even get the idea of trying to copy it, because it has been a while since the original has been aired and so younger audience might not know the title, but I'd prefer it, if this attempt was anything but boring, monotone and very slow in the way the story evolves.

If they gave this film a different title and just slightly changed the beginning then you would think its not a bad film. Its fast faced and there is some good SFX but Farrell shows himself up taking on a role that was owned by Schwarzenegger. There are thousands of rounds of bullets just whistling by and the two lead females that fight, shoot, escape near death time and again but both still looking like they just stepped out of a beauty salon throughout the movie.

400,ManicMovieMan,Total...Waste of My Time,1,11 November 2021,"In the past I have thoroughly enjoyed Len Wiseman's movies. The first 4 Underworld movies are some of my most favorite films ever. Though, I'm not sure he directed the fourth one, can't remember.Yet, despite really enjoying this director I made the stupid mistake again of watching another reboot, remake, re-imagining, etc, etc, ad naseum. In the past 15 years I have not seen a reboot or remake that has had even passable quality and they all spit upon the greatness of the film's they are so poorly mimicking in my opinion.Not a single one of these soulless cash grabs has been made anywhere near good. Yet, again, I made the same miserable mistake and watched another one, only to be left feeling duped and annoyed again.I never need to ask why they continue to rehash classics. It's simple to answer actually. These uncreative hacks know that they can trick fans who have loyalty and immensely fond memories of actual good, past movies. And sucker them in with those feelings to watch another pathetic remake made by people who almost always don't appreciate, respect or even like the original movies that they are remaking. Sometimes these hacks making the reboots and remakes even publicly state that they are trying to destroy they legacy of the original movie on purpose. See - Star Wars series, the Star Trek series.So, in trying to watch this soulless and creatively inept remake of the classic, Total Recall. All I really felt while watching this was that it was another creative team behind the wheel that vehemently hated the real Total Recall property.They didn't even include the whole subplot of Mars in this re-crap of a movie. There was also no humor, no out there vibe, no characters that I connected to or cared about, just nothing here that made me feel I had spent my time wisely. Plus, as much as I have enjoyed past acting by Colin Farrell. Well, he didn't feel like the actor to fill this role to me. But it didn't really matter in the end because this wasn't even Total Recall except in name alone.I found some of the action sequences to be interesting and I can always appreciate a gritty ambience in a film and on the whole I love sci-fi. Yet, because they chose to use the title of Total Recall, all I can think while watching this pathetic reboot is just how much more amazing the real Total Recall was. I actually plan to go and watch it again for the umpteenth time just to clean my palette of this lame attempt to cash in on the fond memories of myself and other fans.I will always believe that rating-wise this movie deserves a solid ""1"" or even less for my rating. But, if I had to pick out one tiny plus in this mimicry. I would have to say that I love to see Kate Beckinsale in just about anything. Man, she is so hot in my opinion and her husband/director, Len Wiseman, is a lucky man indeed I think. Though, I always believed she looked better with a little more meat on her. Also, I just think that she is a great actor too. I thoroughly enjoyed her performances in the Underworld movies, in Click and in pretty much anything I've seen her act in.In conclusion, if you enjoyed the real Total Recall, avoid this lame copy at all costs. No pathetic remake will ever tarnish my love for the real original movies. It only ever makes me appreciate the original movies even more when I'm foolish enough to give another remake or reboot a chance. They never deserve a chance in my opinion.But, despite that, I'm still always annoyed I wasted my time when I forget how dumb it is to watch these pathetic and manipulative copies of great movies. My time would have been better spent sleeping or staring at the floor instead of watching 2012s failed attempt at making Total Recall fans enjoy this cinematic slop.",Total Recall
401,vivietta5,"""Total Recall"" Provides Action, Little Else",6,14 August 2012,"In 1990, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone starred in the sci-fi thriller ""Total Recall"" directed by Paul Verhoeven. It was full of substance and clever gadgets. Fast-forward to 2012 and now we have the remake of that classic starring Colin Farrell and Kate Beckinsale. I will admit, the 2012 remake of the picture is a high-octane thrill-ride from start to finish. Once the action begins, it never lets up until the finale. But there's the problem: not much else happens beyond that.The story follows Douglass Quaid (Farrell), a factory worker who is not happy with the way his life has turned out. He's suffering from repeated nightmares where he envisions himself being someone else. Quaid lives in a tumultuous time period where the planet is at odds with two superpowers: The United Federation of Britain and The Colony. Humans are at the mercy of these two government titans. But enough with the political overtones. Quaid is tempted to visit Rekall, a super savvy technologically enhanced company that allows humans to experience their greatest fantasy.To read the full recap/review, go to: http://www.canyon-news.com/ Be sure to like us on Facebook to get all the latest movie reviews at www.facebook.com/canyon.news.la OR Follow us on Twitter @cnewspaper",Total Recall
402,Nilsosmar-2,"Nice design, but a disappointing story.",6,9 September 2012,"Total Recall (2012) is just okay.It has some great design elements. The world of Colin Farrel's character is well imagined. The flying cars, and the logic behind them, are cool, and show some originality. The designers appear to have been given reign to create some gritty, interesting visuals. The protagonist, Farrel, is in great shape physically.... he has the build of an action hero these days, appropriate to the role. The lighting enhances his good looks, particularly in the opening scene. As the old saying goes, ""even his muscles have muscles."" Still he has a nice ""regular guy"" energy that Schwarzenegger never cold have pulled off. So that's a point in his favor. Kate Beckinsale is also appropriately gorgeous. (In fact, so many people in the movie are good looking, it appears that the environmental devastation which destroyed much of the world only killed the frumpy looking.)MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!The movie starts well but heads downhill (for me) about halfway through. The action scenes are good, the fight choreography is satisfying and effective, but the plot fizzles out. The characterization and the characters' actions make no sense, and have an absence of logic or intuition behind them, giving them weak or nonexistent dramatic arcs. It makes me wonder if all of today's writers are doped up on antidepressants, disconnected from real feelings. For example, why does Quaid's wife (Beckinsale) disobey orders to try to kill him? She mutter something about the boss having liked him better, which is just silly, then something else about him having been a traitor, which makes no sense because he wasn't; the whole point is that he was a double agent. Why does the President of the world personally lead a strike force to kill a man he considers a terrorist? And why doesn't he deal more harshly with the woman who almost brings his plan down by disobeying his orders to let Quaid live?The first half is pretty good; the next quarter is uneven; the last quarter is frankly terrible. In the original movie, Quaid's wife is decisively killed off, so the story can move on without her; in the remake she keeps coming back, and stays in the story long after he realizes she's not really his wife, for no discernible reason. She keeps popping up to try to kill him. Then at the end, she apparently saves him from dying, and puts him and an ambulance, then pretends to be his current girlfriend, all so she can -- what-- try to kill him again? Why? Who cares? And why does his girlfriend get upset when she sees the wife is dead? The ending is a muddled mess.What bothers me most about this movie is the same thing that bothered me about Prometheus: that today's writers seem to have forgotten the interplay between plot, story structure and characterization, and how they need to relate to make a story come full circle. The ending needs to relate to the beginning and middle. It can't be just tacked on and rewritten a dozen times by a stupid committee. The result when it is, is that the movie falls flat and has no real emotional energy. The effects are nicely rendered, and the fight scenes are very cool. But the elements that could have made for an interesting and thought-provoking story are lost in a muddle. It's a shame, and points to a basic problem in Hollywood nowadays, a total lack of gut-level understanding about what makes an effective story.It's still worth seeing, for the effects, as a matinée. But I call tell you that Philip Dick would not have cared for this version of his story.",Total Recall

On a recent cross country flight, this movie was available as a choice, so what the hell! The first thing you immediately notice is that Colin Farrell is hardly a half an Arnold. The first movie had an awesome Mars setting, interesting characters, and was a lot of fun.This movie has none of that. The first movie had actual villains to root against. This movie has you looking at your watch. Watered down is an understatement when comparing movies. Had I not seen the way more memorable 1990 movie, I may have rated this slightly higher. Maybe.

I am grateful for the remake - I think great films like Total Recall should be remade for the next-gen film industry. Albeit the Arnie version IMO is way better but purely for the fact that it's Arnie - this remake adds that 'modern' feel to the story and doesn't go far & beyond the original if anything it repudiates the original versions' far-fetched story to reflect something that could actually happen on our planet. If they can remake films then why not the best ones? I'm more disappointed that they have remade Spiderman within the same decade - Neither were any good IMO.

405,nicotin_for_you,Total Recall 2012 or how you can pretend it's not a bad remake with decent cgi,1,12 September 2018,"First of all, this is the kind of remake that only uses the original as ""a fanbase"" while trying to be original and very ""hollywood"" but failling to capture the essence.
Setting:
This is just some nonsense SF world dystopia with a heavy political accent of freedom and democracy.
The whole world is destroyed and only England and Australia remain wich is strange. The rest of the ""entire"" world was destroyed by chemical attack, nuclear, war, SF magic weapons and it's inconsistent because it's not explained and no military tech is shown. Making everything seem very small scale, like the police forces of a bit city fighting with a whole country that does not have any military.
The war:
They seem to only need a basic gas mask to survive in the ""dead zone"" and they have the technology to drill through the entire Earth to make a huge capsule to travel. To be honest, i am sure they can reclaim the entire Earth with their technology and androids, they can dominate the entire world without too much hassle. No one uses futuristic weapons or technology except for some holographic display, the androids and some cars.
The world building aspect of the movie is poorly done since it shows more things that are in our timeline and some cgi future shots that only make things worse.
The androids:
These are the the main focus of the movie, the whole plot is made around them. How strong are they? they seem a little better than curent androids since they punch like men, they are pushed like they have 90kg and have shown no real A.I abilties, not even robot intelligence, they are basicly oversized drones. They look futuristic but use the SAME smg weapon that is used by ALL police special forces(paid by the company to use it as publicity?). Armor is useless in the movie since all bullets seem to pierce all armor, even the androids loose their plot armor after a few encounters. There are 2 types of androids, the white and the black. The black are even more stupid and weaker than the whites. They seem to have no special tech, weapons or abilities. If we compare them to the original terminators they are ultra light modern cookie cutter androids that are more fragile than a refrigerator. They don't give off that dread or fear that the terminator had and it's been so long since terminators were shown on screen.
The plot:
It's Total Recall with some cameo scenes from the original( eye candy humor) but it fails to offer any improvement since all the actors are dumbed down. They just don't look or feel real. The are slaves to the plot, having plot armor and 1 objective in the movie, even the main character. They have shown considerable restraint with less love/sex/intimate moments than i expected but in the end they don't build the characters and the movie can be edited to be about 10 minutes long. Very bad
Repo men inspiration?
It feels more like this movie than total recall sometimes. The ending is almost stolen from it in my opinion. I really don't like when a movie borrows so much from other movies that is no longer original, it's a remake of more movies that are good. If you like movies, if you love movies and watch a lot of them....this will seem like a waste of time, wich it was for me.
Equilibrium?
It borows some aspects from it too since the population is under the boot of the police and they don't have an army. But i want it to compare the police forces from here to the ones in Equilibrium. The police in Equilrium really cause fear, really have training, they have deadly special enforcement units(clerics), have better guns and they are the type that civilians would piss their pants if they got stoped by them. There are more similar things but i won't mention them, know just that the police(military since they use the police to invade) is very underwhelming.
Bad parts:
It just uses a clipboard and crosses out the clasic hollywood scenes:
Strong lead actor who is unsecure but then saves the known world
Interesting story that is reduced to stupidity plot holes, plot armor and no good acting or well written characters.
Car chase scene.
Stromtrooper chase and battles.
Plot twisting that make you twitchy and almost vomit a little bit.
Very pretentious, it's it's biggest sin, it takes itself too seriously and using it's budged on a few scenes.
Very political
You see the high tech, low tech, modern world mashup wich breaks the immersion like a brick through a glass window
Conclusion:
I give it a 1 because it showed potential and just wasted it on nothing. This is the kind of movie that you will never rewatch and makes you watch better movies. I almost feel bad for writing a bad review but these kind of movies need to stop. Remakes or sequals are good but not when they are done like this.
The movie is full of things like: plot armor, paper real armor, guns with 500% clip size, guns shooting or being used like lasers, same ""assets"" used over and over like costumes/guns/helmets, plot armor fight scenes, main bad guy who should be in an office or at least wearing panzer armor, very cgi fight scenes.

409,crimetex,Not exactly a remake.,4,27 November 2012,"I started watching this film excited about the casting of two my favorite actresses. Now, I have learned to appreciate Colin's acting after watching him in many movies, and again, my hopes were... a bit high. Now, I agree with the fact that Arnold's movie was good and it is now a classic of the action films era. So, what are the drawbacks on this new version?1.-Flying cars, Chinese people in boats, rain..., a few not very well timed nor applied strange angles... anyone thought of Blade Runner? Because I did, and whether this was on purpose, or a mere coincidence, I did not like it at all. At least in Scott's movie, Vangelis, and the plot, created a wonderful atmosphere.2.-The story. Of course, they had to make some changes, our we would've known the end from the beginning -wait! we knew the end from the beginning! - there are some loose ends, and things that make no sense. We know the hooker with 3 breasts was in the original movie, and her line is a reminiscence of the comment Benny does, but I don't think it was clear why that girl had 3 breasts -where as in the original it was due to defective domes in Mars.I won't even talk about the way they stop the invasion, and the ""fight"" between Bryan Cranston and Colin Farrell -well, if Christopher Lee fought Yoda..., I'll buy it-. 3.-The score. Lame and irrelevant. Not that the original had a remarkable one, but I mean, remakes should be an improvement, right?4.-Is it just me, or fight scenes are not what they used to be? I mean, the ones in Underworld, were good, until Selene had to fight this over-sized Werewolf in Awakening, and we realized mixed martial arts, Krav Maga and Brazilian Jiujiutsu were the trend on every action movie. I almost laughed when Bryan Cranston grabbed Farrell's arm and tried to break it taking him into submission!!! Not good, honestly.Overall, this is a movie you can skip until it's shown on open TV and you're so bored you don't feel like switching channel on the remote. I mean, Kate Beckinsale in underwear is worth watching it, but seriously, you can be more entertained by Click and I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry, both featuring my beautiful favorite actresses, than with this ""new"" Total Recall.",Total Recall
410,JoeStok13,A Len Wiseman Special,7,28 February 2013,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie at the start. I had not watched the original movie (with Arnold Schwarzenegger) so I didn't really know what the story was. I was expecting an overdose of action and a confusing plot.I was pleasantly surprised by Colin Farrel's acting. I feel he has really improved as an actor and I thought the chemistry between him and co-stars Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel was great. The action sequences were fun to watch and exciting. Fast paced action sequences kept me refreshed and the stunning Kate Beckinsale, who you may know from 'Underworld' and 'Van Helsing', nailed the antagonist role.The director, Len Wiseman, who previously surprised by making 'Live Free or Die Hard' a fantastic action film, has once again done his job well. The storyline was clear and made sense, which was more than what I had expected. I admit that it could have been better, because the climax was kind of dull compared to the rest of the movie, but definitely worth the watch.",Total Recall
411,stephen-whipp,Not as good as the original,6,2 May 2013,"I have a long standing affection for the original Schwarzenegger film and this didn't put things off on the best footing for the remake, however I eventually decided to bite the bullet and see what they had done with itThe film has some good points but I wasn't overwhelmed, and was definitely left with the feeling that they hadn't really achieved anything with it. Sure, it is visually far more impressive than the original, but that is no basis for a rating a film, and certainly not for a basis of comparison between films of different eras, any such comparison is meaningless. So lets look at the strengths of the original and see how it matches up in the new versionThe original plot, was pretty deep really (For an action movie anyway) and well thought out for the most part so long as you suspend your disbelief a little as to some of the background. The new plot simply doesn't hang together as well. In the original the reason for needing to have such an elaborate deception for Hauser was to fool the psychic in charge of the 'terrorists'. There is no real reason for such elaborate mechanism in the new plot. They have attempted to keep many of the key scenes in, but somehow they don't work quite as well, probably because at times they feel somewhat forced. There are other problems but I don;t want to go into specificsI think one of my biggest problems with this film, is the showy gadget (look at the effects) sci-fi. Why have something normal when you can make it extraordinary? SO rather than flying round the world, we have the ludicrous lift through the core, rather than having armed men, we have to have robots etc. Within reason gadgets are a good prop for the story however if they don't add up or don;t add anything other than flashy visuals then this is lazy sci-fi.Its not a bad film, just not really worthy of the name total recall in my opinion.",Total Recall
412,jillvesta16,Total Ripoff,2,30 June 2013,"Obnoxious lens flares. Badly cut scenes. Terrible karate moves.These are a few of Total Recall's favorite things. The film also features mindless drones of all varieties - not just the obvious robots, but the humans as well seem to have checked their brains out at the door, as the audience is expected to before seeing this movie. The writers allude to this fact of ""day in, day out, everything's the same"" in the beginning, but when our hero Doug (also known as Carl) bucks the trend and visits the Rekall lounge, he really is still a prisoner of doing the same things over and over again, just different kinds of things. They consist of: wondering who he is, running, shooting, bleeding, more shooting, more running, jumping, wondering who he is again, running, punching someone in the face, and hiding. Did I mention running? The movie is essentially a two hour long (very long) chase across the now narrow, sunless, and dismal world, with about five total relevant characters along the way. The end of the 21st century, according to this portrayal, does not look like a very great time to live within at all, whether you're sure of your identity or not. All characters combined managed to be even more humorless than The Dark Knight's cast, except for the punky bum, who was funny only in his stupidity. He was meant to be stupid. The others weren't intended to be dumb, yet somehow they managed to be just that. Instead of trying to vanquish the villains, they would wait until the very last possible second to take action as they pretended to consider their options. No tactics. No wit. Just jogging from location to location for more mindless action. The rather Jason Bourne-like identity crisis storyline, which could've been a decent character plot, was cut down in favor of twenty more explosions on a highway of levitating vehicles.By the time it got to the typical ""wake up, wake up!"" scene near the end, the movie was completely trashed and I couldn't wait for it to finally roll the credits. Hero and heroine save the world and the precious ""Colony"" (yes, that's the real name of this place) of Average Joes. The big bad guys are all dead, including the evil she-monster who, predictably enough, changed her face to fool our hero one last time. So instead of getting a cool storyline, we get a two hour long fistfight. Total Recall doesn't ask for a sequel, and thankfully, it's likely not going to get one.",Total Recall

417,peter_gedye,this new movie has nothing to do with the book,3,24 August 2012,"I have always loved Total Recall, the book and the 1990 one with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone and Michael Ironside.this new movie Total Recall (2012) should have been called something else, anything else.I was hoping this was going to be even more like the book had in it, because in that Douglas Hauser down the hole on Mars he finds a tunnel and finds a Alien artifact that gives him memories and knowledge of a atmosphere plant to change Mars into a Earth like world, this came from, and was made for Earth by a Alien Merchant Ant hive race as a gift to send us to the stars with there Knowledge and Technology, but if used wrong world wipe Earth and Sol system out with a Supernova.Sadly this stuff was was mostly missing from the movie, and only in the book. It would have been maybe 25 minutes more to the movie, bit like the uncut The Abyss (1989) had 33 minutes more to the movie, without that 33 minutes it didn't make sense, Runtime: 138 min (original version) | 171 min (special edition) I alway's hoped one day i was going to find out there was a Uncut version of Total Recall 1990 movie with a bonus 20 to 30 minutes, but sadly there is not, but yet have always loved the movie.Anyway going back. This new so-called Total Recall 2012 is only related by name, there is nothing about Mars in it, nothing about space flight, nothing about other worlds at all, there is only a few key scenes and actor names and actor parts to do with Total Recall 1990, it's more like a loose mix of The 6th Day (2000), Judge Dredd (1995), I, Robot (2004).they didn't even think of making into the movie anything to do with Aliens, not even a machine to pump all the Radiation and pollution out of Earths air, seeing in the new movie most of the Earth is unlivable besides Briton and Australia with some stupid Train going through the Center of the Earth making it that Briton somehow controls Australia with force. How many times more people live in Australia to England ????????",Total Recall
418,dannykalifornia,Better Than The Elitist Say....,7,11 August 2012,"I loved the first Total Recall and I think this current version is an improvement over the original. The acting was much better. Colin shows more depth than Arnold ever could. In the original Arnold plodded through the movie where Colin shows some nuance and depth that I didn't expect. When I read all the reviews here, I am amazed....REALLY? you think the original was that good? I would bet those that pan this movie thought that the Tree of Life was a masterpiece. This movie is just plain better than the original in many ways.... Those that long for acting that is one dimensional..special effects that are worse than average for their time and a plot you can see coming down the hall, then the original is for you. If you want great CGI, better than average acting and a more relevant plot to our near future...watch this version. Better yet, watch both and enjoy both...they both will entertain.",Total Recall
419,Leopoldus,Total wreck-all,5,8 January 2013,"A hundred and eighteen minutes of eye-blasting sequences and awesome background & futuristic landscapes but nearly two hours of complete boredom. I haven't seen the original Total Recall for a long time now, but there is absolutely nothing to compare, as often with blockbusting remakes like that, some would say. And they are damn right. The story gets completely drowned into action/fight/runaway sequences and very few are the moments where you can truly say ""wait, what is going on ?""—to be honest, it happened only once for me— and even that was way too shallow to be completely honest concerning what a viewer might accept. I'm not going to compare with the original.Okay, you can find in this movie what you expect Science-Fiction should look like in the 2010s, clean and wide shots of futuristic cities, the use of Mag-Lev technology for Cube-like runaway scenes and video-game paced car chase scenes, not to forget gun fights in Zero Gravity. That's for the visual part. The mental is quite absent, not that much of mind-games, just enough to say ""Okay, that's it for the plot, we can go back to fighting.""But Come on ! It's not the 90's anymore, you cannot pretend anymore that a battalion of elite soldiers and robot-cops fully geared can miss fully exposed unarmed heroes, even if the hero himself is a trained assassin. Hollywood should stop taking what worked 20 years ago when Schwarzenegger was still a class-A Action Hero and the bad guys emptied their clips at him without much success, now that the targeted audience is spending half of its time playing ultra-realistic First Person Shooter games That just doesn't do it anymore. When the awesome CGI background suggests you are in the future, the action just sends the audience back to what they are doing : watching a poor SF remake putting everything on CGI effects, action sequences and Colin Farrell trying to figure out what is right and what is wrong. There are some poorly reflected scenes, as for the Recall part that is presented as the ultimate and most trendy thing there is in this post-apocalyptic society, and you find yourself witnessing the hero going to a place without any clients, hold by a bleached-haired Asian guy —what could be more cliché ? barely explaining the dangers as the sequence is already initiated and the hero is strapped on the chair. Once again, it feels like somebody said ""quick, quick, get on with it, so we can throw in more action sequences !"" Come on Concerning the acting itself, Colin Farrell is doing is best, so quite good, but while Melina gives a somehow brain-dead acting as her character definitely lacks deepness, Kate Beckinsale is terrible, overdoing it playing the two-face hot bitch her character is, and in no time you find yourself praying for someone to shut her up, which doesn't occur until the end of the movie, that has been long, long, long, way too long. Not even 2 hours seemed like 3 and a half as the production clearly thinks you're dumb as f*ck and that Science Fiction means 90% of action for 10% of brain use & mind-game. They had the chance to do it otherwise, I really wonder why they didn't. All in all, if you are fifteen year-old, a wannabe futuristic architect or designer, a stoner having two hours to kill or you're into badly used big budget action flicks or maybe all that at a time, this movie is for you. For the others, true Sci-Fi amateurs, die-hard fans of implanted memories/mind controlled heroes-based story or simply not considering yourself an idiot, you would better read a book than go to see this thing.5/10 for visual design and that's all.",Total Recall
420,ian_span,Total Recall 1/2,5,4 March 2014,"First the pluses - great cgi, sets, overall production design. Yes, it totally rips off Blade Runner but since the two movies may be taking place in the same universe, I am perfectly fine with it. Still an eye candy - that is a plus I repeat. Then Beckinsale is hot, definitely hotter than Biel... or was it the other way around ... anyway the one is hot the other is not, they are hard to distinguish. You know, like in the original where the one chick was blonde and the other brunette. That little rivalry is now gone. Speaking of things gone. There is no humor - no this movie is serious, no mutants - too dark, no aliens - too juvenile, no mars ... too red. Richter and Benny are gone too. I am not saying all these elements must be in but since the new movie follows the original plot point by plot point and it practically does not add anything new, you get something like Total Recall 1/2.Unfortunately since the movie is bare bones it ceases to make sense. Best example - three tits. In both movies we have chick with three tits. In the original she is one of a whole city of mutants. These people have mutated because Cohaagen is a greedy despot (establishing why the bad guy is bad). Then while Benny caresses her (don't frown this is a thoughtful movie analysis here) he says he wished he had three hands. The point is he does have three hands because he is a mutant too. The scene has meaning, it foreshadows Benny's treachery. In the new one - well she comes and goes, there are no other mutants whatsoever, even Kuato (other name here) is in top shape.Then in the original there is a love triangle. Richter hates Hauser because he had screwed his wife Lori for six months. That's some motivation. In the new one, however, the love triangle is gone. Lori wants Hauser dead because... I am not quite sure, she was jealous of him, maybe. As I think of it the love triangle might not have been completely gone. There might have been a subtle hint that Cohaagen and Lori are lovers. He calls her Lori, that touch on the chin. But then why does she hates Hauser? Oh, no! Did Cohaagen screwed Hauser? Was that what Hauser was trying to recall - sexual harassment at work? So that's why he felt uncomfortable riding a giant phallic machine to the other side of the planet. Nooo P.S. Seriously the movie sucks, yet it is not a complete waste. It pairs well with the original (like the Psycho remake). I've always found it fascinating how one script may turn into two completely different movies. It also may be useful for a film student to watch both versions back to back and take notes. Education, yo!",Total Recall
421,anthonymaw,Not as good as the 1990 version,5,3 March 2013,"A reinterpretation of talented science fiction writer Phillip Dick's story re-made with the latest computer generated effects and film production techniques like action shots reminiscent of ""Mission Impossible"" and ""The Matrix"". This re-make also brings in film noir elements reminiscent of Blade Runner, another Philip Dick sci-fi blockbuster. Compared to the 1990 version, insertion of additional elements like the transporter through the center of the Earth does not seem to constructively add to the overall plot and in fact serves as a distraction. The juggling of some incidental scenes compared to the original like the appearance of the three- breasted prostitute does not contribute anything to the story either. But most of all, there's just no substitute for Arnold Schwarzenegger and his memorable quips like ""Consider it a divorce."" BANG! - he shoot her in the head. And then there is the super sexy Sharon Stone in her younger days with her convincing lurid yet hidden violent side attitude! If you have seen the 1990 Schwarzenegger/Stone original then somehow the remake seems like a badly watered down B movie not worth watching twice.",Total Recall
422,alexander-ivanchev,"An OK, but banal sci-fi derivative",6,26 August 2012,"I saw the original when it came out and as someone else has said before - you don't really appreciate Arnold until you see Total Recall without Arnold ;-) This version clearly has very little to do with the original though. That's fine with me, though I understand most people who had seen the original would not be as forgiving. To be fair there are quite a few nods to the original - both explicit and not so obvious, but similarities end there. This one takes quite a liberal approach and the story is completely different. When I say different, unfortunately it's less engaging than the original's. That's the biggest sin of this movie - despite all the great CGI (which take about 50% of the screen time) the A actors, and the original's premise, this movie fails to deliver in the creative department big time. It recycles and recycles without shame - to that the robots look like Star Wars stormtroopers and the transport thing looks quite liberally taken from the Core or whatever the name was. You can say you've wasted money seeing a movie on the big screen when you start yawning after 1 hour...Anyway, as for acting - Farrell does OK, but fails to establish a believable character, Kate Beckinsale is an utter failure (sorry to have to say that) with her 'acting' apparently based solely on ridiculous grimaces on the level of, say, Evangeline Lilly. My wife asked why did the director let her get away with all this and looking at the credits I now know the answer ;-). Jessica Biel does very well, especially given her limited track record. Oh, Bryan Cranston I also hard to stomach as the uber-villain - especially if you've seen him in Malcolm. To summarise - a good derivative sci-fi movie to rent on a Blu-Ray with lots of action and good CGI to keep you entertained on a rainy evening. Mediocre, but still OK.",Total Recall
423,alanjermy6,OK-ish,5,25 February 2014,"i haven't seen the original so i am reviewing this as a new movie and not comparing this one to the original. This movie is okaish, cant call this a good movie or either a bad movie. Flat characters, uninteresting plot and repetitive action scenes stop this ambitious film from being a blockbuster. The plot, there's nothing different or special about this storyline. its the typical sci-fi secret agent plot line with fancy cars and tech. the movie tries to have some plot twists but none of them seem to make me jump of my seat. The characters are flat. there is nothing much given to collen other than jumping frantically from rooftops and saying some shitty dialogues. The actress is a let down, to be honest this movie would be still watchable without the actress, its like she is just there because there should be. The action sequences are the ones which makes you go like ""ya ya I've seen this already"". There is always a running and chasing scene every 5 min. when you finally start to enjoy something, it goes to back to the same chase and in the end you'll force yourself not to expect to much. there are some good stuff though, for once the ""colony"" or rather the city of civilization is well realized, its dense and at time it makes you believe that this movie is taking place in the future. if your expecting action, you'll be disappointed. your expecting a good story, again you'll be disappointed. but surprisingly the movie never makes you say ""it boring"". i don't know what exactly kept me watching the movie but yes something did keep me watching the movie. lets say for example, the director of i robot did this movie while sitting in his couch.",Total Recall

The storyline can be hard to follow, the characters don't seem very ""realistic,"" but the one mildly good thing that can be said for this movie is the action/chase sequences. I'll admit, there are some exciting scenes in this movie, which doesn't make this movie a bomb, but it still doesn't make much of a difference.

Cast is brilliant, story is brilliant, dialogs are brilliant, fighting and running away scenes are brilliant, VFX are brilliant! it's a 10/10 movie from opening to ending - just top notch.I can't believe how amazing job they did with the cast. Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Bryan Cranston, Bokeem Woodbine, Bill Nighy! I remember first I've seen Bryan Cranston on TV, that comedy show titled Malcolm In The Middle. I thought that amazing man deserves to be on the top notch productions and here he is, one brilliant movie after another and on key roles. In the role of Vilos Cohaagen, corrupt and ruthless Chancellor of the United Federation of Britain, he's doing ART! Bokeem Woodbine is another artist who takes you into the story and the universe of the Total Recall even more on the scene where he's trying to convince Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) that its all a dream...Jessica Biel. I think since Blade Trinity, that is the best performance she ever did. She's fast, athletic, deadly and super-cute as always. Her performance from acting to action is just top notch. One of the most convincing actresses I've ever seen.Bill Nighy is a master. He's transforming from one character to another on his carrier. No doubt in Total Recall he's doing a brilliant job as Matthias. I only wish that his appearance on the movie was a bit more, because I enjoy very much watching him acting. Tone of his voice, the way he using the words and emotions, his facial expressions... He is pure talent and deep experience! Kate Beckinsale. Goddess!.I'm pretty sure Farrell and Beckinsale's breath-taking performance on their fight scene made SOME people cry. They are beautiful, they are convincing, they are talented, they perform stunningly and they CAN act. It was true pleasure to watch them.And last about VFX. The look development work done on the movie is brilliant, production design is flawless. Concepts are fantastic. And the 3D artworks/renders, matte paintings, all brilliant! You'll see the most amazing futuristic city environments - with some amazing detail and very creative designs.

429,danmankp37,Total Recall Remake is a Total Waste of Time,2,5 August 2012,"Easily one of the worst movies of 2012 and one of the worst popcorn movies I have ever seen. It's quite a feat for Colin Farell to add less to a role than a former Austrian Body Builder turned action star but he managed. He had no charisma in the part, he had no presence whatsoever and no chemistry whatsoever with any of the female leads. Other than that he was great... Speaking of the female leads, I feared from the trailers that Wiseman was basically going to give Beckinsale a huge role in the film or he'd be sleeping on the couch and sadly that was the case. She essentially took the role of Richter from the first movie and was chasing Quaid around for 2 hrs. Every fight scene was overdone and cheesy. Kate's line delivery had me rolling my eyes and she was just trying too hard to be good in a terrible film. Jessica Biel looked good but she was just there. She had Nothing much to add, just a pretty face in a bad action movie. What else can I complain about oh yeah, the movies design was ugly, there was waaaaaay too much CGI and the rehashed plot was hard to follow.

It was average Schwartzenegger action with some special effects and weird aliens thrown in. This movie is a lot less cheesy with a lot fewer cringe-worthy moments of dialogue.It does have faults. It seems to have stole a lot of its sets from Blade Runner and there were other factors that seem lifted straight from other sci-fi movies too. Plus every time Kate Beckinsale landed from a jump, with the poses she takes, I expected to see a set of fangs on her. Still, having these faults, I enjoyed the film. The premise is a bit flimsy, but I was able to accept it during the course of the film, and I'm not someone who easily suspends her disbelief during movies. Colin Farrell is great in the role, doing a good job of playing the confused ""average joe"" caught in something he doesn't remember. The other actors for the most part are good as well in general. The action is well paced and the CGI is realistic enough to not stick out obviously.

434,jeremyhwernli,It's very different from the original but is it truer to Dick's book?,6,26 August 2012,"Total Recall (2012) retains much of the original experience in being an impressive visual ride. But it's lacking the emotion of the original and frankly, I cared less about this Douglas Quaid/Hauser character than the one in the original.Believe it or not Arnold Schwarzenegger was more engaging as Quaid than Collin Farrel. I do think Collin Farrel is the better actor of the two but here things just didn't click like they did in the original. Also in the original there was a great deal more of a comedy aspect. Both these films consist of non-stop action and both lack creditability. This new installment is more or less left out the comedy and the feel for Quaid's vulnerability.The movie starts with an action sequence essentially consisting of Quaid being saved by Melina (Jessica Biel) and running away from some unknown hostiles. Then he wakes up and he is lying next to another beautiful women, Lori Quaid (Kate Beckinsale). The Quaid's are living a mediocre life in a less then modest home. Douglas Quaid works an assembly line job that adds to his contempt for his life. He feels stuck and despite trying and putting in hard work and having patience there seem to be no opportunity for him to move up or on. He does have a friend but he does not understand Quaid's discontent and seems to be pleased with his life (they are co-workers). When Quaid mentions Rekall , his friend is adamant that going there is a bad idea. Rekall of course being the company that can implant memories into your mind and syndicate a real-life experience of your choice. So of course Quaid decides to go to Rekall. He chooses to be a double agent and just before things get started, The Rekall workers stop the process, saying, ""You Lied to me!"". And before he can get to the bottom of what he is going on, police come busting in guns blazing and kill everyone except Quaid. They tell him to put his hands up and turn around. He does but just as they go to, I believe cuff him, he reacts and manages somehow to kill them all despite there being around a dozen of them. It seemed like an instinct reaction, very similar to the scene in The Bourne Identity when character Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is in a park and takes down two cops. Obviously there is a big difference between two and twelve, which is why the scene in the Bourne Identity had more creditability. Another big difference was the camera technique used in the two scenes. The camera movement in Total Recall was very effective, adding to both the mood and intensity of the scene. I said this scene is less creditable because Quaid in both the original and in this re-installment cannot not be shot mortally and he is a godly marksman (which is of course the classic hero aspect that borderlines stereotypical and archetypal).After the action (besides the opening dream sequence/memory) begins it does not stop. Quaid finds out everything he thinks he knows is actually implanted memory. *The action revolves around the central conflict in this story. Which is there are only two habitable places in the world. The island of Great Britain, now run by a Federation and Australia that is now a disorganized colony. The Federation essential controls the colony and uses the inhabitants for labor. There is only one way of transportation, which is a tunnel that goes straight through Earth and comes out the other side. The Federation controls this way of transportation and subsequently controls the colony in this way. This is why there are those who live in the colony who are rebelling against the Federation and their goal is to destroy this link between the two lands. Does this sound similar to a little U.S. history you picked up in elementary school?The colonies setting has more than a similarity with that of Blade Runner's (Ridly Scott's 1982 film) Los Angeles, another science fiction film based of a book by Phillip K. Dick. Blade Runner was based off of ""Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep"" Total Recall is based of the book ""We Can Remember it For You Wholesale"". The setting in both Total Recall(2012) and Blade Runner consist of neon lights, constant rain, little to non-sunlight, greatly over populated area and a look very similar to *Tokyo today. I believe that one part of the thinking in composing the set was it worked in one Dick story turned movie, why not another (I want to mention they are both loosely based of Dick's stories, very loosely). I liked the cinematography in Total Recall(2012). But I think in Blade Runner the settings was more aptly creditable than in this film.Overall this film was well made and highly entertaining. None of the acting was bad. Jessica Biel did a great job of being the quintessential dream girl. Kate Beckinsale displays once again that she can be very convincing as a fierce and volatile person. I think there isn't enough female antagonist who are challenging mentally and physically to the protagonist, which this film accomplishes. The narrative overall felt like it took a back burner to impressive action and visuals. Which made me lead me to be less invested in the story. The story is different than the original film released in the 1990's. Both films made changes from Dick's book, but both hit on some of the interesting and thought provoking ideals Dick was getting at in his ""We Can Remember it For You Whole"". I think this 2012 movie was truer to Dick's story but not by much. I recommend Total Recall(2012) for those looking for impressive visuals, entertainment and a story just effective enough to not ruin the strengths of this movie.",Total Recall

My husband, 14 year-old son and I have very different movie preferences but we were all looking forward to seeing this film. None of us liked it. The worst part about it was that there was sooo much going on in virtually every scene that it actually became irritating to watch. Too many special effects can detract from a film and this movie was crammed with so much ""action"" that it was just complete overkill. Granted, it has been quite a while since I saw the original, but I remember there being at least some amusing parts and I felt some connection to the main character- not so with the re-make. I could also follow the plot and thought it was better developed in the previous version.Before the halfway-point I found myself checking my watch every 10 minutes or so, and my husband and I both admitted afterwards that we dozed off a couple times (in self-defense I think) - something I NEVER do when I go to a movie theater. This was the closest that I have ever come to walking out midway through a movie. The only reason we stayed until the end was that we invested $25 for the tickets and felt stubbornly compelled to stick it out. I hope that others who decide to see the film have a better experience than I did, but I honestly wouldn't even recommend renting it when it is released to DVD.",Total Recall
436,eccooper,You've been here before...,6,5 October 2012,"There comes a time in every cinema goer's life when he realises despite the completely new actors, effects, concepts and plot line he has seen every inch of the movie before.Total Recall is set in a future world where the earth (ruined by our stupidity as usual) is inhabited in Europe and Australia. However The United Federation of Britain (Europe) is the big boss, demanding workers from the Colony (Australia - Yes they actually call themselves that) to support their evil imperialist aims. Imagine Winston Churchill's dreams of British Empire crossed with futuristic cliché and you have the idea.In the midst of this is a story about a man with two identities. Colin Farrell, married to Kate Beckinsale visits a company (Rekall) to give him memories he can return to in the squalor of his existence in the Colony. But his brain holds its own secrets and soon all hell is let loose as Farell scrambles across the remnants of society to discover the truth.There are a few nice innovations and nods to the 1990 Paul Verhoeven classic. But the reboot misses a trick. The film is half as clever as it thinks it is, and it doesn't give itself that much credit. Beckinsale (star of lycrasmash Underworld) is dull, Farell looks lost, Jessica Biehl is stunning and Bill Nighy bemused by the whole affair.It really does feel like a movie you've seen already despite all the innovation and the effect is quite disconcerting. It's a half marks and a must try harder. I recommend if you want a movie this week you take the other half for a good meal and wait for Dredd.",Total Recall
437,phil-johnston3-545-892970,Bad/Good Movie,3,3 December 2012,"If you've seen the trailer for this picture, you've seen the whole thing. Total Recall is an arduous movie to sit through because it's exactly the movie you're expecting to see. It does absolutely nothing outside the standard action movie dynamic, interspersing ridiculous CGI action sequences with statically shot expository dialogue scenes. It's a terribly frustrating experience as you feel the timer tick down to the next explosion while the characters bounce their clunky dialogue off each other. There are five people credited with the screenplay and story for this movie, which is far more hilarious than any comedy to come out in 2012.The movie takes its time to get going, but this can probably be put down to the extended edition tag. It feels like the cinematic cut would have been a solid half an hour shorter. Farrell is shown to be a man working in a factory (with a very cool apartment and one of the most beautiful women in the world as a wife) who wants more for some reason. So, he goes to Rekall, which is the only real connection to the movie's name, to spice things up by getting some fake memories injected into his brain. Not only is this just a clumsy device to set up the plot of the movie, it actually never gets mentioned again. This movie could have been called one of a thousand crummy titles, but jumps on the reboot bandwagon to boost opening weekend ticket sales. The action kicks off when it turns out that Farrell doesn't need to pretend to be a spy because he is one already. From there on in it's a series of mindless CGI explosions and poorly-written dialogue scenes that advance the plot to the next action set-piece before we get to the final big fight, which the good guy wins. Absolutely no tension, significant character development or any degree of cinematic finesse.To his credit, Farrell gives it his all and his quality as an actor shows as he brings a little bit of life to the stale script and dull action. Beckinsale does her job of looking amazing with a gun in her hand, chasing Farrell through various video game levels, but her and Biel (who looks downright plain next to Beckinsale) are never given enough time or attention to ever be more than pretty faces. Easily the most talented actors on the screen, Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) and Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean), have about five minutes of screen time between them. Nighy's lines are almost obscured by the dial tone of his phoned-in performance and while Cranston gets in and out with as little fuss as possible. The acting is probably the best part of this film, but that doesn't say much.Visually, Total Recall is pretty unspectacular. A lesser director would have filmed the whole movie on a green screen and Wiseman deserves credit for making sure there were a few sets here and there, but not much else. Overall, heavy reliance on CGI to create the sci-fi world the story takes place in robs the movie of what little humanity it had and the final sequence with Biel in the gunship on the landing pad while Farrell fights the robot is directly stolen from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Not influenced by. A shameless rip-off of. Lazy direction is one thing, trying to con the audience into enjoying themselves by abducting a familiar sequence from a superior film is another.There are certainly better ways to spend 125 million dollars, but movies like this need to be made to keep stupid people entertained and those of us who know better hungry for a movie of quality. Total Recall is only really memorable for its flaws, which there are many, and should be viewed with that in mind.goodbadreviews.wordpress.com",Total Recall

The plot is gored, and he goes to his standby of putting Ms. Beckinsale out front and terribly miscast in the the unlikely role that Mr. Cox slayed in the original. Arnold vs. Colin Farrell?

So I rate this film a 0/100 because the story, Kate Beckinstale, was terrible and the only thing I liked was the Zoom out whole view shots of the city are very cool and impressing.

To make the comparisons are fruitless and futile. I found the movie was made with great imagination, skill, spectacular stunts and giving me the impression I wouldn't want Kate Beckinsale chasing me. This was a very very good movie, I might even say it was a great movie. I seen it three times now, that doesn't happen much. It has excellent CGI. You cannot tell the robots are not real. There were a few plot pitfalls but hey, it's just a movie. It is definitely not worth the ratings that the haters be hating it with. I absolutely loved the fight sequences, all of them. As mentioned above, Kate Beckinsale is amazing in this movie. The most beautiful psychopath I have ever seen. If I were ever going to be murdered buy a beautiful sociopath I wanted to be her.

How disappointing.The whole plot was weak and the two main actors, Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel were totally cast wrong in my view. Sorry to say that this role is not a strong point for either of them. The Only redeeming factor was Kate Bekinsale playing the part of a psycho b**ch from hell and the fact that she played it so well is really disturbing.The alteration of the original story should have led to this being called Total Recall 2 as there was no Mars colony and no ancient alien mechanisms, the whole story takes place on Earth in the future. Sadly, the storyline is so weak that I spent most of the movie looking to see if there was something else worth my time instead. You could sleep through the first half of the movie and still see everything worth watching. Most of the methods he used to escape being killed was sheer fluke, there was no real skill involved.

445,svgbtz1,Decent remake of the original,6,3 August 2012,"Let's face it the original film was very far from a great work of art and neither is this film. However I am a fan of science fiction and what these two have in common is that they are both decent science fiction film for fans of the genre. I must say that I am not a huge fan of any of the actors and decided to see it base on the trailer. I thought Kate Beckinsale was poorly cast in the role of Lori Quaid and in fact I found her to be the same character from the Underworld series minus the dark vampire issue. Sorry but Sharon Stone was much more impressive as the wife turn government assassin. I was impressed Colin Farrell as Douglas Quaid/Hauser but I also thought the buildup of Hauser the bad ass government agent was done better with Arnold. I have to blame the writers because with the exception of Lori and Douglas Quaid/Hauser all the other supporting characters, Melina, Copenhaagen and especially Harry (Bokeem Woodbine) are poorly developed.Spoiler ----- ------ Was Harry supposed to be an Agent?? Because we suspect but are never told this.While this film has the basic guidelines of the original Agent brain wash turns against the evil government bureaucrat to save the world there is no mars. I believe it was the director's intent to give us a darker film as this had none of Arnold's charm that makes the first one fun to watch. However fans of the original will notice Len Wiseman pays homage to the original in several ways. Love the twist on the ""2 weeks"" scene. One thing missing from this film is the jealousy issue that made the head agent determined to kill Quaid/Hauser going against the order of Copenhaagen. Remember the line ""I'd want to kill him too if he was banging my wife."" Well this gave the agent's character a purpose to hate Quaid and allowed his men to believe the lie that Quaid/Hauser was to be killed. Here is where I feel I am getting too old, but it seems Hollywood has a serious lack of imagination. With the exemption of George Lucas and Star Wars, I am not sure why every other director's vision of the future looks like Blade Runner (The Colony) or Minority Report (Future Britain). Are the heroes always running to have a fight scene in the rain? Speaking of fight scenes I think directors need to take a page from films like Jason Bourne or Daniel Craig's Bond. A hero that's beaten or bruise throughout the film should have injuries throughout the film. Directors seem to be re-hashing the same fight scenes, explosions, public fire fights with bullets missing their targets.",Total Recall

First of all why credit for a work and make a movie as same name when nothing is similar to the original? even the production house named 'original movie' where i and surely the rest of the viewer weep for originality.Then we get a piece of crap story which feel like filtered from matrix/inception and many renowned sci-fi in mocking fashion. no grip in it, character looks drop dead emotion in them.

It threw Doug Quaid through several crazy challenges and turnarounds in the story. It was enjoyable to watch, and totally intrigued the viewer. It was campy. It was, all in all, a great movie.This remake forgot the entire element of fun, and instead replaced it with what the producers probably thought people wanted to see: more explosions. It's just, simply put, bleh.It's not very fun to watch. It's actually pretty boring in the scenes where there isn't action, and the scenes where there is action, it begins to get old very quickly. I don't ever feel like it's my place to critique another person's acting, but there are a few exceptions. Farrell just doesn't seem like a great Quaid. He kind of just takes everything that is thrown at him, and gets over it. Schwarzenegger was thrown into the action and was always surprised with what came next. He wasn't ever ready, and that showed. It made it more exciting! Farrell always kind of keeps that ""yeah, I'm a secret agent? okay."" attitude going the entire movie. The last thing: You have almost no doubt that Quaid is actually a secret agent in this one. The old one actually had you thinking it was possible that he was still back at Rekall; whereas the remake spells it out in the beginning: He is a secret agent. That's it. End of story. The point of the old Total Recall was that you were never really sure. Is it all fake? Or is it real? The remake completely missed that intrigue, which was a big part of the old one. It will entertain the people who like action, and nothing else. The substance just isn't there, which is a bit of a letdown. I give it a four, because it looked pretty.",Total Recall

458,sophie_summerfield,Not worth remembering,5,19 December 2012,"Total RecallTotal Recall 2012, directed by Len Wisemen, starring Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Beale, is a star studded adaption from the 1990 original. It follows the trend of book adaptations, sequels and rewrites that appear to be plaguing the box offices at present.Remake of the 1990 box office hit starring Arnold Schwartzenegger. Set in a future dystopian world, after the 3rd world war, we follow the life of an unsatisfied factory worker, Douglas Quaid who decides to have memories implanted in order to feel more fulfilled.An intelligent plot, this film it deals with the theme questionable reality, resulting in an intriguing storyline which leads you to question whether what you're viewing as this characters life is real or not and allows you to be part of his confusion and despair.However, despite a strong start, the film fails to develop Douglas's character effectively. Due to this, initial attentiveness in the film inevitably begins to wain as there's a lack of opportunities in which the audience can establish emotional investment in the character as there is seldom an occasion to see or learn more about who he is. An occasion is presented in the form of the friend that initially contacts him via a telephone implanted in Quaid's hand, however this opportunity is wasted when he is accidentally killed by Quaid and there is no sign or remorse or reflection in response to this. It is this type of reaction, or there lack of, that harks back to the 1980's hero who is very much a 'man's man' who consecrates very little time to emotion and thought. However, this is perhaps done with purpose as homage to the original.Regardless, this lack of underdevelopment of character could be interpreted as enhancing the plot in regards to the questionable reality therefore forcing Quaid to question his identity. Nevertheless this explanation is not fitting as, after his other possible identity ""Carl Hauser"" is revealed, he professes to know who he is – meaning that he maintains a feeling of identity but such identity is not made apparent to the audience.Despite the lack of time devoted to developing Quaid as a character, in comparison there is an odd amount of time dedicated to the quite impressive futuristic transport system, ""The Fall"". ""The Fall"" is a tube-like system that allows people to get from one end of the Earth to another in a matter of minutes. However impressive this concept is, it offers nothing in the way of substance to the narrative. I find that the only thing that this transport link offers is a platform on which a, admittedly, very visually dynamic zero gravity fight scene can take place.Zero gravity fight scene during Total Recall 2012 Still, even though this is superficially engaging, there is an inordinate amount of time wasted on the explanation on the workings of ""The Fall"", time which could've been better utilized to further develop the protagonists' character and not leave the audience feeling ""Why do I care about this person's life?"" After all, if there is little emotional investment in the person who is fighting, no matter how entertaining this fight may be, the sequence will be without suspense if the audience doesn't care if the person fighting wins or not.Visually, this film is impressive. The CGI is faultless and convincing and ""The Colony"", the city in which Douglas Quaid resides at the beginning of the film, is appropriately grotty and dank which creates a sense of realism in a fictional world. Such resounding CGI and dramatic set design bring these fictional places to life. Due to this, it's sad to say that regardless of its superficial brilliance, after digesting Total Recall I found my mind undernourished and the film, overall, unsatisfying.More reviews at http://sophiesum.wordpress.com/",Total Recall

Some films really just don't warrant it, and Total Recall is one of these titles.In an effort to add a grittier, more serious storyline to the basic plot of the original, the remake has lost the tongue-in-cheek humour and character which made the 1990 film such a success, and so fondly remembered by fans.The new film trumps its namesake on special effects, there's no question about it, but in the meantime it's become just another Hollywood shoot-em-up and the additional complexities of the plot don't give it enough weight to work properly.As a result, it's the worst of both worlds. It manages to shed all of the original's character without doing its own thing enough to stand up on its own.

Farell is a new dimension as Hauser and I found him a bit over-serious in his role. If you put some scientific errors aside (like ""The Fall""), it was very entertaining overall...One more word for the fastidious fans of the original: Please, relax and enjoy the ride designed by the ""zeitgeist"".

And who paid the Bladerunner designer to recreate Australia as a rain-soaked dystopia? I take that back; that's an affront to Bladerunner. Hey, anything to avoid character development and storyline.

The dialog is almost LAUGHABLY copied in large sections word for word from the original, which in essence clearly signifies that this film isn't even trying to be a standalone film - but a carbon copy of its predecessor, without any originality or character of its own.The skyrise sets have been done REPEATEDLY in Sci-Fi films, the more its done the less imaginative the scripts seem to be. Rather than having a full set created uniquely to give a film a given look (like Alien '1979 for example) films simply rehash a cliché high rise city to depict a future world...and its been done over, and over, and over, and OVER again to the point of irritation.A few notable examples are Blade Runner, Judge Dread, Fifth Element, Minority Report, along with the entire StarWars Prequel trilogy. All of these films however DO differentiate backdrop to vary the locale in the plot however, something which 'Total Recall' (apostrophes) fails upon...the CGI backdrops don't differentiate in any real sense when the film skips location, you simply feel like you're in the same High Rise set throughout the whole film - bar a couple of cheap Bigben 3d-Max overlays.The chase scene's are entertaining, but more of the EXACT same from IRobot, Minority Report, and Fifth Element - rolled together, packed into one, and repackaged as a new film. Even the fight scene's duplicate the same look done OVER AND OVER again from the Matrix, Equilibrium, right on through to Xmen Wolverine.In short NOTHING about this film is original, nothing is innovative, nothing is exceptional, little is entertaining, and very little is worth time watching.2/10",Total Recall
464,stevecramer-27727,No Spoiler Here...Not Worthy and Zero Point to it,1,8 April 2016,"I really disliked the movie. Current state of movie making is to portray women as SUPER humans. More intelligent, faster, stronger, more relevant than anyone. Reliant on no one and egotistical to the detriment of all else. The movie suffers for it.Colin Farrell (Ireland), seems like a deer in the headlights most of the time and of course the ladies took turns either saving or trying to kill him. Kate Beckinsale or Jessica Biel looked pretty much the same person in physical size, weight, looks etc etc. Ugh.No charm at all and just hated most all of the casting and whom ever was in charge of the film continuously...the between cuts needs help as a damage arm in one cut, is the other arm in the next cut..oh brother.I love the 1990 Total Recall with Shwarzenegger and Sharon Stone but the supporting cast were also top notch.

465,StationeryExplorer,"Not as good as the original, but nowhere near as bad as I expected.",7,12 May 2014,"Usually I hate remakes, this one managed to stay on my good side. The landscape was different, but seemed more of an homage to Blade Runner than anything else, so all I could do was forgive that on the grounds of shared appreciation.The major difference between this and the original was the absence of Martian aspect of the story, but again, the movie didn't suffer too much as a result.Even the fact that they managed to reduce the rating from 18 to 12 (PG 13) didn't seem to make a whole heap of difference to the movie.On the whole, this version had a much quicker pace, which I guess you need if you want to sustain the attention of twelve/thirteen year olds, but there were enough nods to the original to ensure grumpy old men like me were reassured it knew its place in the pecking order.In this instance, you'll be pleased to hear, I shall not be submitting this review to Comic Book Guy's ""Worst Movie Ever"" blog.",Total Recall
466,Stadium_Hot,"Who takes classic Art, burns it and puts it into a pretty golden urn? Oh, this guy did...",1,26 September 2014,"*although there is no point of an alert because all the incredible parts of the original are pretty much left out of this version* I wish to start by saying I am APPALLED this film has a score as high as a 6.3/10 (at the time of this review). No doubt the Millennials rating this piece are new fledglings in flight towards the blights of unadulterated changeling trite.My 2 cents on why these modern Directors 'remake' absolute classics: Modern times are indeed infested with spoilt brats. Said spoilt brats need and demand the here--the now--the fabulous. Everything has to be impressive. I could delve deeper into the atrocities of modern Technology making us dumber, alas that narrative is for a rainy day. In summary; society (youth especially) has become simple, they do not like (or simply cannot comprehend the possibility of) the arts having meaning - or in this case: storyline. These creatures do not have the intelligence to appreciate subtlety in Art. They want graphics, special effects, impressive technology and the dream of a technological future, well that is all this film offers.Firstly, Arnie was an absolute legend. Love him or hate him, he was a total original. He was a monster of the cheese-plagued action movie star role. Colin Farrel, hum, I scrape my brain here for just one role where he has shown even a glimmer of talent or originality. OK, not much of my brain left - 'desperation' began scooping my mind with a melon-baller until I became as dull as this crippling defecate. Lines such as; 'get yo a** to mars', 'considaah that the divorce', 'see u at the party Riktaaah' and my favourite 'Benny, Screeeeew Yoooooou' are all left out of the remake. Does Colin have the charm to come up with new ones? Nope. I permit you to borrow my melon-baller, too.Let's now move onto the plot. 'Plot?', you say, in a bewildered voice. Yes, they changed the entire plot for this remake. Why? I'm not even sure, it doesn't suit ADHD Millennials, does it? Am I missing something on their nurture make-up? Because the original is actually way more 'impressive'. Not to mention the original was rated at a censor of 18, the remake a censor of 12, kind of somewhat proving my point this is designed more for modern children. Moving on -- they do not go to Mars, meaning there are no Mutants, no travel in Space, no Kuato telling Quaid to 'start the reactor' to 'give those people air'. Instead, the World consists of 2 civilizations known as 'The United Federation of Britain' and 'The Colony' and he has to take some stupid journey. Good idea for an entirely different film? A possibility. A TR remake? Boooooooooring.Quaid's wife (played by Kate Beckinsale) has a real predominant role. While Beckinsale is the only glimmer of hope in this flick (seeing her shooting a machine gun was indeed one of the few treats), she is no Sharon Stone. I see no logical reason to make her the star (other than Wiseman wishes to still, ahem, get some you know what). Ronny Cox as Cohaagen in the original was an absolute dream and he had a bigger and a commanding role. Cohaagen in the remake is almost pathetic, although played by the wondrous Bryan Cranston (who is a genius in 'Breaking Bad'), he gets a nothing role here. Melina is portrayed by Jessica Biel, another that begs you for even quasi-endowment in the acting arts. There is no space for Richter, Benny, the mask lady going through the, ahem, 'inter-galactic checkpoint', there is no Johnny Cab - which alas means there is no genius scene where he says 'I'm not familiar with that address' in regards to Arnie saying 's***, s***' when he sees the 'bad guys'.I understand changing something original to suit your own interpretation, but if you change it, make it good. Scratch that, make it outstanding. Give people a reason to watch it, because it is too late for me to get my 2 hours back.I guess the more I lambaste this Film in the form of an Ogre's excrement, the more I appreciate how genius the original is, so that is one of the very few positives.Bad Points: Aforementioned atrocities. Too many to list.Good Points: Kate Beckinsale with a machine gun. The fight scene at Rekall where Quaid takes on 10 guys is impressive. Also, the film is so treacherous it makes you love the original more, does that count?How long do I think this preposterous remake will be remembered for? 'Twooooo Weeeeeeeeks'",Total Recall
467,sportingbiz,Garbage on film!,1,4 August 2012,"Total Recall - What a waste of money and talent! Unfortunately, none of these 2 aspects are a part of this film.You have high paid actors, 2 female A listers, a highly gross budget, and a lot of money spent for nothing! I am not sure what the purpose of remaking this film was for. The Swarzenneger original was a clever and entertaining film for it's time. If the original was bad, then I would understand why some studio would have an interest in remaking it. Building the creativity of the story. However, the original did it's part and for what market or audience it was originally intended for, the original did the trick and this is just a sloppy makeover. A film of this kind has but one purpose - to hopefully, ride the coat-tails of the original (without really adding anything clever) in order to try and build up the bank bucks on another unnecessary sequel. Shame on you!",Total Recall
468,manunderyourbed,My take on what could have been a lot better.,4,17 August 2012,"So... we went out to see the Total Recall reboot. Positives are: * Awesome special effects. * Really wild if severely impractical combat scenes. (How many times can Kate Beckinsale get punched or kicked and yet bounce back fresh like she just hopped out of the shower?) * Some really cool science fiction and futuristic travel concepts. * So much Kate Beckinsale! Actually that should be the first positive! Think Vampire Kate minus fangs and vampire eyes. She saved the movie from a rating of 2.Here are the negatives: * Ultra weak plot-line. * Inconsistencies in plot-line. * George Lucas is probably looking to sue them for theft on a number of I.P. fronts. * Extremely poor and lacking dialogue. * They never left the Earth. * Ultimately fails to trump the original despite the great science fiction and special effects. * At the end, I didn't care if ""Alexander"" died or not. I just wanted to see more of villain Kate running around kicking ass. They should have simply named the movie ""Kate Beckinsale Kicking Ass."" The movie would have received a 10 solely on that merit.",Total Recall
469,mseligm,totally entertaining!,8,11 August 2012,"What can i say, i really enjoyed this movie. There are similarities to the original but the new twist was very entertaining. It is definitely a special effects lovers dream come true. I don't really understand why some people gave this movie a bad review when clearly this is much better than most of the c*ap out there. I presume that most of the haters are either somehow against the movie to begin with or just don't acknowledge a good movie when they see one. Overall i give it an 8 out of 10 and would recommend this movie to everyone. It was just as entertaining as the original albeit with new theme.",Total Recall
470,warith-niallah,Too much of a departure,3,19 August 2012,"Total Recall without Mars is like the Terminator without SkyNet. It was an excellent musical score, great acting; but this remake in an attempt to be unique ruined what is a good story. If filmmakers want to make a unique movie, then make one; don't ruin the original.There were some similar story lines with the original, but the removal of Mars required the film to be totally rewritten instead of remade. This was just an awful job and I wish another filmmaker would give this a second try. Overall, the special effects were good, the acting was great, the camera work was excellent and a lot of work went into the presentation, but unfortunately the movie simply departed from a story that worked: Mars has been colonized, cheap domes caused mutations, air is very expensive and the system is corrupt. Perfect storyline that was abandoned in this remake.Not good as a remake, decent as a stand alone film. Please see the original if you haven't.",Total Recall
471,mwtkn,Looked great....but,6,24 August 2012,"Visually this film is amazing, for a modest 2012 budget for a grand scale sci-fi ride like this it does make you wonder where the second $125 mill goes on flicks like Transformers and POTC. It starts out pretty intense , in the second act its takes a dive of being slightly repetitive and then then the third act I had lost interest.I love these totalitarian thrillers, its so similar to the original in dialogue its disappointing - some scenes I was quoting the next line in my head before it happened.The action scenes especially the first chase through the roof tops is well cut, you can follow the action and felt some tension in there.Kate B is awful, constantly having a scowl on her face, I'm sorry as well trained as she may be, taking some of the hits to her face that she does and how little weight she carries, the hand to hand combat would be totally one sided.Speaking of hand to hand combat (spoiler) Colin F v an i-Robot in hand to hand combat - come on...and a black one at that - were they meant to be better or just costumes left over from Tron Legacy? Also, can anyone really explain why an army was being sent to the other continent? I really didn't catch that bit.Watch it for eye candy and for that its great, for an engaging story go watch Minority Report.6 points over all 9 for visuals",Total Recall
472,claudiu_condurache,A remark for a remake,1,19 November 2012,"Movie sins of all essential chapters: script, directing, casting. And as a bonus we get copied ideas: mixing of old and new as in ""Blade Runner"" (including a copied scene with a piano), robotics after ""I, Robot"", invasion army-inspired by ""Star Wars"" and an unbreathable atmosphere of ""12 Monkeys"". I gave a single star to this movie: is for the people who worked in design and special effects. But no matter how good they were in the job they've done, they couldn't save this film from squeaking from beginning to the end. A long yawn of boredom and a grateful remembrance for Philip K. Dick's book were my only reactions after watching this remake.",Total Recall
473,porches,Not as good as original,7,23 December 2012,Maybe the studio thought by just having good looking actors in this movie they hoped to make money. It was hard to follow and moved way too fast . It had too much CG!! I like the action but the gun play is much too unrealistic and maybe there should have been much less of it. The movie industry uses guns like they are making a cartoon and that is not the way the real world works. They needed to get there act together on having too much gun play as that is Not as the world is and is less likely in the future. I did like the robots but the character development was much too poor. I did like the way that the cars were realistic as the future will have these type of cars. I did not see this movie at the theater and am glad I just bought the DVD instead. It was less entertaining than the earlier version of Total Recall.,Total Recall
474,matthew-17-721107,A terrific sci-fi/action extravaganza.,9,20 September 2012,"I can't believe critics and audiences have condemned this remake so much - especially when films that are WAY WORSE get given so much latitude (ie. the Star Wars prequels, Indiana Jones 4 etc).TOTAL RECALL (2012) is a superbly made, high-octane action thriller that hits all the right beats and is a VERY worthy remake. unfortunately, people have judged this film on the trailer alone and/or viewed this film through the murky glasses of nostalgia. They fail to remember that the original Total Recall was very much a B-movie, lacking much of what they criticize this remake for - thin characters, thin plot, poor dialogue and an over-use of special effects. It starred a muscle-man actor that couldn't speak English properly; it relied heavily on visually effects and was filled with B-actors running around on starkly-lit plastic sets. The script was filled with corny one-liners and silly exposition, with villains so evil they almost twirled their moustaches while talking about their evil plans. But in the last 20 years we have all grown to love the original (rightfully so, its great fun) and injected our own 'depth' into it. Arnie was no more or less a boring than Colin Farrell. The villains and allies were no more or less 'developed' either. Both films are stock standard, by the book hardcore action films - and nothing more, nothing less. Total Recall borrows only a few lines and ideas from the original film. These are more winks and nods than anything, and then does it own thing - very very well, I must add.Colin Farrell is great as the central hero, and the world he inhabits is so beautifully realized it's worthy of Ridley Scott 'creating worlds' status. There are winks to Blade Runner in the production, and for that I am grateful - I've always wanted to see more of that world. The production design is jaw-dropping. I totally bought this as the future.The remake has been blasted for ripping off every sci-fi film and doing it badly - but I say it's the opposite. This remake takes all those elements we've seen before - robot police, new technology, flying cars, virtual reality, laser guns (you name it) - AND DOES THEM PROPERLY. The Fifth Element, the Star Wars prequels, Minority Report, A.I. and I, Robot were all shoddy, flawed films (with interesting ideas) but this film makes those ideas WORK. Sure, those black-and-white cyborg cops are like Stormtroopers - but these ones are bad-ass and very cool, better than any Kiwi-accented CGI cartoons that George Lucas created.The directing is tight and focused, the plotting sharp, the acting solid and the world is as real as it needs to be. The only problem is that the original Total Recall gave away the twist, so the remake can never really have the 'wow' factor. But lets face it, it's not that big a twist. This film is just as formulaic as any Batman or Marvel film, yet everyone forgives those without hesitation. Complaining about paper-thin characters in a film like this is just stupid. These films need archetypes - the hero, the villain, the girl etc etc. They were no more 'thin' than characters in The Matrix or any of these sci-fi action films. Having said that, the characters weren't paper thin anyway - I actually cared a lot for what happened to them. I was totally rooting for Colin Farrell every step of the way. They didn't set out to make Inception, with all it's deep, meaningful philosophy - they set out to make a summer blockbuster.If you're a sci-fi nut, a film buff or someone who just likes great escapism, see this film. It's one of the best in this genre for years. It doesn't try to better the original, it just gives us a modern spin on the old narrative. I applaud this film for its amazing production, it's restraint in the action scenes and for taking me into an amazing world. If films like this are condemned, then audiences and critics truly are way too harsh.Well done, Len Wiseman and team. And Colin, in a just world you would be a bigger star!",Total Recall
475,shaesterling,A whole lot of money gone to waste,4,25 August 2012,"OK, wow where do I begin, probably with casting ... Colin is a great actor, but he seems disconnected in some scenes. Spending most of his time looking around being cool rather than looking at the other character. I blame the director. The biggest let down for me was Kate Beckinsale, I haven't seen much of her before but watching here I think she gave a very weak performance. Rolling her eyes etc, she was just non-convincing. Its like they did one take for each scene then just moved on (or twenty bad ones)(not surprising as she is married to the director lol)(what a joke!).As for the plot, I enjoyed the fact that they tried to changed it up for the new audience from the original, however it just wasn't an upgrade. I prefer the mars concept. And if you want the audience to connect with the story then perhaps give them a reason to. Who cares about the colony? I didn't. In the original I felt sorry for the people when they turned off the air. In this version there was absolutely no way for me to connect with the worlds. I didn't care what happened to any of them. They just assumed that the audience would care for the resistance. Well I'm sorry, you have to give me a solid reason, maybe if we knew someone else on the colony that we cared about? His mate had no real depth at all.About 5 times too many convenient get-aways. There seems to a back door to every room they are cornered in. In every scene!! Drove me crazy. Advanced robots carrying guns with pin point accuracy cant simply just shoot a guy? Just shoot him! Hundreds of opportunities. What kind of robot can you simply take the gun out of its hand. (Maybe Arnie could do it if anyone ;) Why didn't they simply build the guns hardwired to their arms or something?Ripped scenes and environments. Hello? have you seen Blade Runner? Jeez. Also minority report? near carbon copies feature in this movie. And the scenes shot in daylight had such a different lighting to the fake looking (computer game like) cgi, just didn't work together.OK enough ranting, only good things about this movie, the first 15 minutes weren't too bad until Kate started featuring more. John Cho was a refreshing touch and I liked the tattoo.Actually this was way too early to be making a remake. Did they need to do this at all? With that Director? No, waste of peoples time and money.",Total Recall
476,jeremy-elgin,Nice reinvention of the original film,7,9 December 2012,"Just as enjoyable as Arnie's 1990 effort!I agree to a point with another review complaining of long action/chase scenes, time which could have been used by Melina to explain things to both Doug and the audience rather than showing off the special effects - which are impressive! Watch this movie for those alone if you have to! - I didn't feel they were too drawn out and found myself thinking they gave the film a realistic sense of time passing that wasn't jerky or contracted / stretched unnaturally.Although this diverges far more from Philip K. Dick's short story than the 1990 Arnie flick by keeping the setting on Earth I enjoyed this change, and should appeal to a wider audience. There were at least a couple of nice little nods to the 1990 flick which I did enjoy (although no robot cabs) and showcased some nice ideas about how transportation and elevators might operate in the future!If you like Philip K. Dick, or Arnie's 1990 version this is definitely worth watching.",Total Recall
477,chebs1,At last a reboot that doesn't just try to reshoot the original,10,13 November 2012,"Before I start let me say that I too loved the original when it first came out. It was original in it's day. It was also yet another Arnie film to source for movie one-liners and quips. Unfortunately, the very things that made it fun also made it a pretty silly sci-fi film.I'll just say straight out that I loved this reboot. It's not played for laughs which is a smart move - yes in the day Arnie's comedic one-liners where right for the time but now the audience that loved that film has grown up, moved on and wants a more serious version, what's wrong with that? The story has been re-written and has removed the need for Mars as a back drop or the, frankly, silly premise of mind reading mutants. There is a lot of action, in fact once Quaid gets to Rekall, the film becomes a non-stop roller-coaster of action. Again, I don't understand why people are complaining about this. It's suppose to be a sci-fi/ action film, the original was a sci-fi/action film what's is the problem?If there is a criticism it would be that other than the main characters, namely those played by Farrel, Beckinsale and Biel, the other main characters (Cohaagen and Matthias) don't really get any explanation or introduction, then again do they need it? I'm not so sure.For all those complaining about the fact that the original kept you guessing as to whether it really was a dream or reality. You obviously haven't seen both versions (the theatrical release and the directors cut). Lets just say in one it goes one way in the other another.So, bottom line, if you want a really well put together sci-fi/action film with cutting edge special effects, an excellent story that is really well acted by all involved, watch this. If you want to reminisce and bitch about anything that's different, don't watch this. Either way suit yourself.",Total Recall

Same name different film!,6,22 August 2012,"I would have scored this film more if they didn't call it Total Recall.Apart from the name of the characters and movie I fail to see what comparisons the movie has to the classic 1990 movie with the same name.Sure we have the idea of having memories implanted into your mind and the idea of a double agent but I would say that is about as far as it goes, everything else is a different story. Even the name Recall is changed to Rekall in the movie and yet the film is called Total recall.Why didn't the makers of this film change the name to something else and go with some new futuristic movie ill never know. Had they done that people wouldn't be comparing this to the classic 1990 version of the film. I think they may have ended up with a more positive rating and review from most people.As for the film it was OK, but I found myself constantly comparing it to the 1990 version looking for similarities expecting the same scenario and plot, even right up to the end of the film I still expected a similar ending to the 1990 version but this time instead of giving life to Mars I expected they would breath life to the rest of the Earth. But alas it didn't happen.I was even pondering the idea that perhaps this was still a false memory with the cheeky look at the billboard by the main character where we saw the advert for Rekall, was this a dream/memory or was it really happening.We will never know and sadly I doubt we will ever care.",Total Recall

This needless remake by Dumbman is completely void of the fun and thrills that the original movie exuded. Dumbman is clearly a man obsessed with the love of his wife which can only explain the constant screen time of Mrs. Dumbman who does not have a fraction of the intensity and scariness that Michael Ironside showed in the original film. The most famous scene in the original is the FX scene involving a very large older woman stopped at a checkpoint, in the remake this scene was completely wasted and has a very lackluster payoff. The original film is never going to be confused with Casablanca but it had its merits and those merits stayed with the viewer many years after it was available at the theater or on VHS home video, where I first saw it. This turkey by Dumbman completely left my mind right after I got my money back by the theater manager.

This movie was surprising, I never though it would be so good. Colin Farrell is perfect for this new role that they build based on the first one. Kate Beckinsale is just soooooo badass and Jessica Biel give us a lot more than what we were expecting from his character.This isn't a basic storyline, they're running for something bigger than their lives, they're running about the truth.

Even though the original film was good it was over rated, so a remake should have fixed any problems of the original, instead the remake is bad and still over rated at a 6.6 so far. It completely lacks fresh new ideas, there is nothing to provoke thought, instead you will leave the cinema and forget, of course I'm coming from the point of view of being a fan of thought provoking science fiction. If its a popcorn fest you are seeking then i suppose it delivers in some way, but that is the problem here, total recall 2012 is nothing more than a popcorn film, there is no point in remaking a film if there is nothing new to say.

Even at the end of the movie one might find a hard time answering the questions.And for many finding out the answer may not be worth it. But graphics have come a long way in the past 20 years.A clear contrast with the Arnie starred 1990s one is the visual candy the movie provides. However its very much irritating with a gorgeous blonde beating the hell out of our hero every time when he can fight against almost any opposition including mechanistic futuristic robots.And the absence of Arnie makes us realize how much he is worth to any movie.

In-spite of the original Total Recall's faults, at least it had a good ending where the atmospheric balance is restored to Mars and life returns to normal. There is no such hidden mystery in this remake of total Recall and no good ending. This movie has a totally different ending and a radically different story line for the most part, although they did keep the basic elements of the original.The bottom line is that all the CGI graphics in the world will never be able to make up for a bad story line and mediocre acting. The new Total Recall is just another example of a movie industry that has run out of ideas for good movies and is trying to use technology to ad spice to old ideas. My advice is to wait until it comes out on Netflix and save your money for a good movie.",Total Recall
486,kim-tully79,Good but not great remake of a classic,7,9 August 2012,"I was unsure if i would actually enjoy this film or just outright hate it. The initial previews were cool and defiantly peaked my interest. I was a bit concerned with the casting choice and felt that Collin Farrell may not be able to pull it off. After seeing him in Daredevil I wasn't to hopeful that he could pull off being an action star. However, after seeing the film (Total Recall) I can honestly say I feel that I got my money's worth. Overall I was very pleased with this new rendition of an Arnold Schwarzengger classic. Story and effects have been improved all around. I thought Collin Farrell did good job re-inventing a character from the 1980's. Jessica Beil and Kate Beckensale were great to watch as well. If you were a fan of the original film go check out the remake. You'll be pleased.",Total Recall
487,mo-466-929345,Total Recall Flop,1,2 September 2012,"I watched Total Recall today and was absolutely disgusted at the post production standard but more about that later. The storyline was pretty weak, no character development to speak of. Kate Beckinsale is best suited to playing a vampire which was pretty disappointing as she can shine when she truly wants to but as Farrell's arch nemesis, nope did not work at all. Jessica Biel was the ""star"" of the show as she was true to form with her normal 2 star lackluster performance for which she is noted, so no surprises there. Farrell's performance reminded me a lot of his Bullseye role in Daredevil in which no one ever figured whether he was happy, sad, angry or just bored. In this movie he was spot on with the same sort of devoid emotions. Pretty reminiscent of Miami Vice which was a great movie due to its good direction and excellent post work but Farrell tries a little too hard in every single movie he stars in. Please take a lesson or 2 from Cruise or Banderas about being natural. The most appalling aspect of this movie besides its lack of depth and shallow storyline etc etc was the post work. I am a professional visual effects supervisor, director, editor and DOP and have never ever seen such unnecessary use of flares in any movie..not ever. This was actually distracting and totally unnecessary. I counted off the flare shots and lost count after 40. Not a light source in sight yet a flare would show up on screen. Was this supposed to be a very long music video? I wish I could get hold of the director and voice my opinion. 1 out of 10...watch this only if you are being forced to...at gunpoint...",Total Recall

Knowing the story, i was curious how they'd twist the story. There are several winks to the original, which i enjoyed, yet it still is a film on its own. If you're hoping to see a rehash, you may be disappointed. As for the actors, most of them did OK. I sure like a furious Beckinsale, even Farrell did convince me he'd been the bad-guy-turned-good. Cranston was playing his 'Mr White' routine, Biel didn't do it for me however in this one..The cgi was OK, a bit over the top at some times, but hey, that's what Hollywood blockbusters are about: blingbling over story.All in all, if you're looking for an action packed scifi action movie, this one should be good enough for an evening with a cool beer and some crisps/popcorn.",Total Recall

I expected much, and it certainly met my expectations!The action in this movie is not something that we haven't seen before, but still it is very good, fresh and elevates the movie to a new level.Although it does not live up to its predecessor's level, individually the movie is really good.

491,brentadsley-717-3657,Not as good as the original,5,6 January 2014,"I watched this on DVD last night. On the plus side, the creation of a dystopian, futuristic world was nicely done and Kate Beckinsale was wonderfully sexy/scary. However, although I usually like Colin Farrell as an actor he wasn't given a whole lot to do other than fight, look confused and run away a lot. I love the novel and the original Arnie movie but this new version lacks the wit and invention of both. As others have mentioned there are too many chase scenes and not enough brain food. It's a shame as it is a visually stunning piece of cinema, though it does reference (rip- off?) a number of other, better sci-fi films such as I Robot (the synthetic police), the Fifth Element (the hover cars) and, of course, Blade Runner (the outside world in general).

No story line and for god sake adding a touch of Australia when referring to down-under as a colony would have been a little respectful to the country. The colony felt like hongkong ... well what can be expected from some American director who made such hideously mind numbing movie. Also, I think it was made for Kate Beckinsale, by her husband, as in not one scene did she look unattractive, despite of the grotesquely never ending action scenes, and Jessica Biel looks not so attractive in most of the scenes.

Arrogant, unforgiving, merciless.I liked this film. The premise was actually scarier than the original because we now know, post Iraq 2, just how far our governments will go to enable a war despite the flimsiest of grounds for one.A brilliant take on tales of state sponsored terrorism for power gain.

Instead I got exactly what a critic calls a thrill ride from early on to finish. Even the plot changes did not get in the way of enjoying better a remake and the meant to entertain as in old school matinée kind of movie only made it better. Fine job by all concerned and please turn Len Wiseman loose on some of these recent idiotic super-hero movies he knows how to entertain not steal ideas and characters to blow his own horn and what he wants it to be rather than what it is.

And I'll admit that a lot of the characters seem a little artificial, and the development is not all that great. And since I am not really a huge fan of the action genre, this could have put me off.

I must admit, I hoped much more from this film than it actually delivered. First, the actors! Colin Farell and Kate Winslet are real actors, good ones, I think, but the dubious script does nothing to give them something to work with. The dialogues are boring and most of the times it feels they are just there to lead from dull action scene to another. Second, the action scenes! They quickly become boring and repetitive and just artificially make the movie longer, not any way better. I would appreciate a good action movie, but the action in Total Recal:2012 is just hilarious, I must admit. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, although if you want to watch, how to make a bad movie, this one for you.",Total Recall
499,zumrat2000,Total Ripoff,1,28 November 2012,"I love the original movie. It is entertaining, satiric and well paced. I love it so much I watch it every now and then. Like another Paul Verhoeven's brilliant movie RoboCop. I was not sure what remake would be like. Now I watched it... OMG... It was really disappointing. Unbelievable. No, it's not Total Recall, it's more like Total Ripoff. The plot is so messed up (half of the movie did not make any sense, like the Woman with Three Tits), the casting is so bad (Colin Farrell??? Kate Beckinsale - eh... Jessica Biel??? Arnie, Sherone Stone, Rachel Ticotin and Michael Ironside were all perfect)... The only part is good - CG. In fact, I think, in stead of making totally new movie they should have retaken four scenes from the original: 1. opening eye-popping in Quaid dream; 2. taking the transmitter out of Hauser's nose ; 3. ""prosthetic head"" when Hauser arrives to Mars; 4. opening eye-popping of Hauser and Melina; and release ""new digitally remastered version"" on BlueRay.",Total Recall
500,nightchrome,Unfortunate,6,17 August 2013,"I decided to watch this because I recently saw the original on television just awhile back, so it was fresh in my memory...no pun intended. This was a solid action film with scifi elements, but I really don't understand why they bothered with the thin layering of ""Total Recall"" over what could otherwise have been a new setting. There was really no need to slap the label on this except for extra press, but I can guarantee the same people would have gone to see it had it been called ""Fallen Star"" or something equally different. As a scifi movie it had all the bells and whistles, but I'm getting tired of scifi that doesn't reach very far, doesn't try to posit the idea of a world beyond our own. Earthbound dystopias are the product of writers who can't fathom that things in the future won't just be the way they are now only flashier."",",Total Recall
501,ravemoncoeur,Saddening Remake Can Only Lose Money,7,27 August 2012,"Whenever you see this film is ""12A"", you know you're going to be disappointed anyway, IF you've seen the original. Or especially if you've seen the original. It interested me to see three other films reviewed by establishment critics in big newspapers in the past year, choose to criticise the plot development of these three Hollywood films because the characters simply didn't take their clothes off/have sex/display the European more uninhibited attitude - & that is why they thought the films lost money. Well, think of that principle, and it's true even more totally of this than any of those three films. Remember the 3-breasted woman in Total Recall 1990? Forget that. It's surely pretty bad that 22 years later, Hollywood actors just can't get their knickers off, even when it is relevant and necessary to the plot. I certainly do prefer the Swedish Girl With The Dragon Tattoo - 'nuff said. Or this post will end up being censored.

There is no Mars. It kills the movie. If they'd call it Free Australia, or something else, unrelated to Total Recall - it would be a good action movie. It has so little from the original movie, nobody would notice. But as a remake of TR - it's a complete fail without Mars. What were they thinking?",Total Recall
503,GrimNirTheGreyGod,Brilliant action film with major plot holes,7,17 August 2012,"This film is an action fans wet dream. It steams from action scene to action scene with a small pause for dialogue and plot. There's many will say this is a bad thing but not me. I hate long drawn out rhetoric in an action film. So if you like action in your action films you will love this.If your looking for an up dated version of Arnie's Total Recall then you will be disappointed, but then what would be the point of seeing the exact same film again just with new characters? It needed to pay homage, but also be a little bit unique and new. This managers that with ease.There's no Mars in this one. Its set in a future where much of the world is uninhabitable and there's really just the United Kingdom and Australia (The colony's) left. Travel between the two just takes 17 minutes by falling through a hole that travels through the centre of the earth. Which features as a major plot point.The acting's OK by Farrell and Beil and they both give a good strong action performance, however the true star is Kate Beckinsale's role as his fake wife then ardent nemesis. Kate show's she's best in the full on action roles and is totally believable as a hard as nails kick ass ruthless pursuer. She's absolutely brilliant in every scene she's in. From the ambiguous but memorable line ""I give good wife"", to her die hard relentless attempts to kill Farrell she is definitely the true star of this movie. I definitely want to see her in more action movies.From the point of keeping you thrilled, this film scores 10 out of ten, from an acting view point I give Beckinsale 10/10 and the others 8/10. The CGI is definitely 10/10 even if the first scenes are so very reminiscent of blade runner. The action, stunts and fight scenes are well above a 10/10 rating. In short this would be a perfect film if not for some silly plot holes.Now here's where the plot gets a bit silly. Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) lives in the UK travels by ""the fall"" to work in the colonies, where he's building synthetic soldiers that will be transported back to the UK to eventually use to invade the colonies, via the fall. There are terrorists who feel the fall generates second class citizens but no explanation why. UK owns the colonies, who are trying for independence, but are still owned by the UK, so why does the UK need to invade it? Quaid as Hauser has supposedly seen a kill code for the synthetic soldiers, if so why when he was first turned didn't he give it too the resistance. In this version he wasn't a pretend double agent he genuinely changed sides so why didn't he give it then? And as everyone seems to have recall technology why can only the leader of the resistance Matthias (Bill Nighy) get at it? Why endanger him? If anything Matthais roles seems to have been forced into the script from the original, but doesn't actually fit in this versions plot or premise. The the final annoying glaringly obvious plot hole. When the UK invades the colonies they load all their troops into the fall device and fall through the earth. The colonies know the invasion is coming through the fall we see news casts and alerts to the citizens warning them of the imminent invasion. So if they know its coming via the fall why not simply drop a bomb down the hole? Instantly kill the complete army and even block the only means of invasion ensuring their safety? Its so obvious its ridiculous.Its this plot failure that makes me mark the overall film down to just 7/10. But if you don't care about that and just want an all action fun movie then this is definitely a must see film.",Total Recall

You're as clueless as to what's going on as the main character- which must've been a terribly hard thing for Collin Ferrel to fake on film- he literally just walks around looking overtly ignorant for the duration of the film. If not for Cranston showing up with some real acting, and Biel's few good scenes, this would've been a total wash. Perhaps the futuristic set and glitchy CGI ran all of the budget up before they could fully bake an actual story line, but with a main character who's basically nonessential and bimbo brunettes fighting for only god knows what, this film falls short of any real expectations of being an even mediocre thrill ride.",Total Recall

I could have watched it happily, been a little bit bored maybe, and have only seen the installing of a memory as something taken from Total Recall. It seemed to completely reinvent the plot, so if you're going to see a Total Recall remake, you're only going to be sorely disappointed. See it as something that just happens to share the same name, you're more likely to enjoy it.Of course, when I say it reinvented the plot, I'm choosing to presume that somewhere beyond my own misery and personal frustration that there was a plot.

506,steadypaceswinsallraces,Better than the original,7,14 April 2021,I remember when I was a young adult I would collect certain DVDs that I would consider kind of mind blowing and not your mainstream typical Hollywood movie. And I bought the original Total recall on DVD because I thought it was unique in original and kind of mind blowing. I really like that movie so when this came out I avoided it because I felt like I didn't need another Total recall in my life already had the original one and it was pretty dang good. Well now flash Forward to 2021 during quarantine in the pandemic and having a little bit more time on my hands not going out as much I decided to watch the remake because lately I've been on a Philip k dick movie binge right in the last several days I've watched several of the movies they made off of his stories. So I decided to give this one a try after a couple of reviews on here said it was a different take on the same story then the original Arnold Schwarzenegger one was.It was very different from the original movie. Almost like a completely separate movie. The original if I remember correctly cuz it's been years since I've seen it now took place on Mars this movie takes place entirely upon Earth. The story gets a lot more in-depth even though the original had a good story to it I think this one story is better. This one dies much more into the resistance and it feels like there's a lot more character development than what I remember being in the original movie. Also this one feels like a more finished Hollywood production the original feels more like well I guess your typical '90s action movie but it felt kind of b rated compared to this movie. The way the cities and the cars and just the aesthetics of the movie to make you feel like you were in a futuristic world just seemed a lot better realized in this movie than it did in the original. That being said after watching this when I plan to go back and watch the original again just to see if I'm remembering it correctly in my head or if the things I liked in the remake the original did as well. But even the ending to this movie was a lot more satisfying than the ending in the original movie. Overall if I was going to choose just one to buy now it would probably be the 2012 version not the Arnold Schwarzenegger version. Because I do think this was a better movie.,Total Recall

But then I got tired of the running away and for one moment I almost quit watching the movie - thing I would not usually do for such high budget movies.I liked the concept of Total Recall; it was engaging during the movie, and left me thinking even afterwards.

If one views it as if it were a remake and not its own film then yes they will be disappointed that it is not the same as the original. But who wants the same thing all over again with updated cinematography? Not me. And that is why this stands out from the original. There are a few other movies that take the story a different direction than the original and thankfully this is one of them. In my eyes it was not so much a remake as it was a whole new spin on the franchise. Total Recall is actually set in its own universe and I think one can view all three films that share this title as three parts of the same overall story. That is how I viewed this film, not as a remake, but as a film in its own right that is worthy of the recall universe, as one of the legends that share the same future. I enjoyed it a lot.

Same concept, some of the same characters, story line has changed. Once you can accept this movie as a standalone and not compare it to the original - I believe you will be very pleased.Special effects are wonderful, Story was fast paced and exciting, actors are some of the best in the industry, and to me - it was a Thrill Ride from beginning to end.The only reason I give it an 8 instead of 10 is because I wish the movie had been just a little longer for character development and so that the movie didn't feel so rushed.

(Not saying that it has to be like Nolan's Inception, but it could be a good reference.)The other weak parts of the script are (1) the way Coohagen dies, too easy and too hurry; (2) the surprise twist when Lori disguises as Melina, it's too verbal.

So much of a movie review is personal opinion and the rating should not be based on someone who just didn't like the movie. That being said, I am a passionate fan of the art of film and here is my review:The 2012 version of Total Recall was well done. I gave it a 7 out of 10 because it wasn't perfect, but it was a good flick. I really enjoyed the fact that it was NOT a scene by scene remake of Verhoeven's original movie. The first movie was great, good story, lots of action, and the story was easy to follow. This new version was just a little confusing at first, but still a great story. I was both shocked but happily surprised when the opening scene paints out that this movie will not take place on Mars at all. With everything being so different, I didn't know how the story was gonna play out and that makes it much more entertaining. The are several ""homages"" to the original but still, the story is completely different and the talent in the movie was great so it turned out to be a good movie.

The action is electrifying and the CGI amazing...I'd put this above Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers in terms of the sheer electricity of the action;Colin Farrell is excellent - thankfully he is no Arnie with his stupid accent - Farrell is an intelligent actor and makes the best of the dialogue and storyline...I have had the good fortune of not seeing the original and hence can compare it with nothing ; this is a Bourne on steroids set in the sci-fi world and for the 2 hours running time there are only a few moments when the visual extravaganza does not captivate.Bosco CaldeiraBosco Caldeira,Total Recall

Everything was so clichéd and intentionally followed a pilot (to keep the characters busy throughout the movie.) Things just followed to each other so well that it was hard to take the movie seriously. I thought the movie would have a deeper story line, considering that it is a remake; but no, the whole movie was about chasing and adrenaline.In addition, unrealistic moments regularly appeared each 10 minutes or so, making the movie worse. Effects and fight scenes were not that good, only enough to satisfy easy audience.

522,michaelhkline,An Action Movie Smoothie,8,8 August 2012,"I'm shocked by the wave of negative feedback Total Recall has received. I had an objective experience when viewing the film; I refused to see the original. Taken at face value, this is an action filled blend of the best aspects of many great action films of the past 15 years. I highly recommend watching it, even paying to see it on the big screen before it comes out on DVD.The best films and TV shows begin with a disoriented main character with no idea what's transpiring around him (LOST, Bourne Identity, Walking Dead, etc.). It puts the character and the viewer on the same basic level, so that as the viewer tries to figure out what's going on, so is the character. In Total Recall, disorientation of Farrell and the viewer is a constant. Many reviews I've read complain about this, claiming it creates a poor plot, leaves too many questions, and opens too many doors for interpretation. I think that is exactly what makes the film so great. Just like with the spinning top at the end of Inception and the arguments it spurred: Which parts of the film are 'real' and which are rekall?Total Recall takes the identity crisis of Jason Bourne, the enemy-robot-filled-future of iRobot, the unintentional betrayal of Terminator Salvation, the 'There is no spoon' concept of the Matrix, the Shutter Island question of 'Is the main character lying to himself?', the reality/dream dilemma of Inception, the masks of Mission Impossible 2, and the 'who can you trust?' of any James Bond film and rolls them into one movie. The result is an extremely entertaining film with incredible graphics, fast-paced plot, and the ability to keep you guessing throughout.Many critics complain about the film being just like the original while others whine that it didn't have enough of the Arnold version. It's a remake. Some things will be better, some will be the same, some will be worse. Independent of the original, I give Totall Recall 8/10 stars and can't wait to see it again.",Total Recall

524,keoblogger,It's a good action film,7,20 August 2012,"This is the remake of Total Recall (1990) leaded by Arnold Schwarzennegger. I haven't seen this version before, so I can't compare it with this film. Wellfirst, it's a good full-action film from the beginning till the end. The world was destroyed some parts by the war, and we have only 2 forces: The Federation of Britian and the Colony. Douglas Quaid is a normal worker. One day, he feels tired because of his nightmare and bored by his repeated work, so he decides to go to a place named Rekall, where they can create his fantasy. But when Douglas chooses ""agent"" fantasy, he suddenly wakes up. And many many things happen to him, his memory comes back step by step, and time pass time, he knows he had ever been a good agent named Hauser. He becomes the tool for the war between the Minister (of The Federation Britian) and the Resistance (of the Colony). He also the pray for Lori (his wife in time he was Douglas). When his memory comes back completely, he fights again the Minister to protect the Colony out of the war. So, the story is really good with full action. We will see some action scenes that we can't forget. These are the chases between Hauser and Loli in the sky, in the elevation, in the Fall (where people can transport among The Federation of Britian and the Colony), the fighting in the last scene between Hauser and the Minister. Hauser's memory reveals slowly is a good mark of this film. When we watch this film, sometimes, we will wonder this is Hauser's reality or Douglas's fantasy. It's so complex and many details. And they hold us not stop watching into the scene. It's so interesting But one point to remark, the action is too fast, so, sometimes, you can't understand what happening. Something are not clearly. The fighting is really good. The burning and explosion effects are really good too. We can see them through in the invasion of Federation. The picture is also good. We can sense the modern of the Britian's city, the cold of the polluted city, the poor and ugly of the Colony. We also feel the modern of warships, cars, guns,It's so great. The sound is really good. Not many songs or music.but the sound of action scene is really good I especially love the sound of piano is played when Hauser comes back his home to find the key . That is a good sound. This film maybe a good action film. But it has not deep content. We watch this, feel good. But when we are out of the cinema, there's nothing remain inside us. So, if you want to find a film to entertain, this film is good choice. But if you want to find a deep choice, we can choose another film.",Total Recall

526,marksimmons-comedian,Mark Simmons- the UK's 3rd worst movie reviewer,7,13 September 2012,"A little joke to warm up for the review: 'I was asked if I could think of any films where the best bits were in the trailer, the only one I could think of was 8 mile when his mums doing it in one' This movie is action packed, full of futuristic gun fights and chase scenes with plot twists and turns galore to keep you on your toes.We join the movie in a post-apocalyptic world where only two areas of earth can be inhabited, one where Britain is and one where Australia is. The way people move from area to area is by a massive lift that takes them through the centre of the earth, when I saw this I thought 'cor!!!' This is a very watchable film but it's a shame how easy it is to draw similarities to other movies – there is a flying car chase scene similar to that in '5th Element', robots similar to that of 'I-robot', fight scenes like in Bourne Identity, and a blatant plot rip off of a 90's Arnold Schwarzenegger film which I can't recall the name of.There is even a scene with a three breasted woman like in the Arnie film. It shows that having 3 breasts is attractive, giving the impression that the more the merrier, but where do you draw the line, I mean are there men out there looking at cows thinking 'phwoar, I like those, they'd look good on my wife'.If women were to have multi-boobs they couldn't have them all on their chest for the pure weight of them, so if they were going to have more, maybe they could have them in more practical positions like on the back of their heads to save on pillow expenses, on the bottom of their feet to give the constant sensation of walking on a bouncy castle or on their face so men can stare at them while talking and maintaining eye contact.I give this movie 7 Marks(immons) out of 10",Total Recall

After a while, you just lose concentration, it's like 50% of the movie is the same shot. Why are the Robo-police so strong in one scene, and so weak the next?

Settings like a hotel, airport, hallways, luxury new age dinning room, bedroom, Lame Factory, all overlaid in doom and gloom, gray or green colors and long delayed overtones make you feel like going home and watching the SyFi channel, the lame show with the two head shark. Its just not worth the money for such production. The city in first one was more alive and action packed with charter development. Here you get close camera Proximity to a wall with a Chinese theme, so so lame. City may have a touch of coolness to it, but then it's like a video game setting or maybe a lame Futuristic Adult video.

530,wotangoestothemovies,"Total Recall 2012: or ""We can dumb it down for you wholesale""",3,11 February 2013,"Clearly Len Wiseman wanted to remake another P.K. Dick story turned film, Blade Runner. Instead he remade Total Recall. Maybe he got the stories confused? Maybe he couldn't get the rights to remake Blade Runner. Maybe he thought better than to risk remaking a better directors film? Who knows, but he remade Total Recall and now we must all suffer. The odd thing of course is that 1990's Total Recall isn't as good a movie as film fans memories or nostalgia for late 80's kitsch movies staring the ex-governor of California, Big Arni make it out to be. Like many of P.K.Dick's weird and wonderful stories, it has yet to filmed adequately. So Wiseman's job, and with a budget of $125,000,000, should have been made easy. But no. Even after hiding it in enough lens flair to make J. J. Abrams blush, he still manages to make a flat, unintelligent and simply boring mess. Oh, well.Guess what? At the end of a 21st century a global war devastates the earth, leaving much of it uninhabitable. Honest! But, not to worry, for some strange reason both the UK and Australia are OK. Maybe the orchestrator's of the final world war just liked ""Neighbours"" and ""Coronation Street"" and felt that destroying the homes of either soap operas would leave them with only re-runs to watch? Or maybe they had holiday homes in both countries? Your guess is as good as mine but there you have it. Most of the jobs and economic wealth are in the UK. Sorry, I mean ""The United Federation of Britain - UFB). This means those poor sods from Australia - sorry I mean The Colony - must travel to the UK each day to mindless and dangerous jobs working in factories making robot policemen that the UK then uses to suppress Australians further. Why? Again who knows. Maybe Coronation Street is more popular than Neighbours?One of those working stiffs is Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell). He has to travel from Australia to the UK every day on a device known as the the Fall"", a ""gravity elevator"", which travels through the Earth's core between Australia and the UK - very quickly. Sadly, ""The Fall"" (not to be confused with a rather interesting British indie band) seems to have little purpose but to set things up for a rather standard action sequence in the third act. Handy that.Not surprisingly, Quaid is rather bored of this commutator run everyday, his equally boring job and one assumes his economic suppression by those evil Brits (who oddly are all American and speak with American accents - as do all of the Australians). So he visits an outfit called Rekall, a company that implants artificial memories. Its owner tells him that he can implant any memory he wants and whatever memory is implanted Quaid will believe he has had and experienced. Now he will have some happy memories while taking that commutator ride every day and screwing robots together that are at the same time part of the cause of his economic repression. Who wouldn't? You? Well, you clearly don't star in a film scripted by Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback who have taken an intriguing short story and idea, originally carefully crafted by Philip K Dick and turned it into the drivel you have been reading about so far. Anyway, back to the plot.Quaid wants to remember being a spy. Not any old spy mind, but a double agent super spy - as you do. Easy, says Rekall and they make it so - or do they? As he is being injected for his memory implants he discovers he is a super-spy, his memories having been erased, that his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) is also a spy but an evil one set to keep an eye on him by UFB Chancellor Vilos Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston - who camps it up wonderfully and is clearly the only person aware of the nonsense he is in). And so, as they no doubt say in the publicity material somewhere, a journey for one man to discover the truth and fight for justice begins. So how do I know that Wiseman really wanted to remake Blade Runner? Because ""the Colony"" is a big budget, faithful and rather convincing re- imaging of Scotts future LA from that movie. Its rather good actually. And makes the first act rather interesting. It thus makes it so much worse when, in the second act we travel to the UK which looks like the UK now - but with the odd hover car. Its boring, flat and so is the script, acting, art direction and directing in this, long, oh so long, section. Not only does it look like a different movie but it looks like Wiseman lost interest in directing it and left it all-up to a poor second unit director to manage. Maybe he did - the lens flare, certainly becomes conspicuous by its absence in this act. And alas the script follows the same pattern. The final act - and return to ""the Colony - improves things a little but things never return to the opening acts far better realized conception.If you must watch this movie then walk out after the first act, go for a bit to eat and at the very most return for the final act. You'll be less disappointed. Alternatively don't go back, but watch the first act, go to Rekall and ask them to implant the memories of a decent second and third act instead. Clearly I couldn't afford that last option - or did I???",Total Recall

There is no suspense, mystery, or intrigue in this version of Total Recall. Both the central character and certainly the audience pretty well know the real situation from the beginning. So, rather than sharing in the doubts of the central character who, in the 1990 original, isn't sure what is real and what isn't, we instead simply get formulaic action mixed with a bit of romance.

540,Ben_times_10,"I expected a semi-decent film, and that's what I got",7,2 August 2012,"When I heard the news that Total Recall was being remade, I was just as disappointed as most were out there. However, I never hate a film based on such a simple principle. Before the release, I was simply curious as to what direction they were going to take with this film.I always rate a film on two scales: The technical aspects (an objective scale), and if I actually liked it (subjective scale). I'm pretty forgiving with science fiction films so I'll keep my review as objective as possible.Pros: The futuristic world that has been imagined for this film was well designed. Visually, the film is stunning. If you're the type that reads into the quirky inventions you see on screen, this film is littered with them. There were plenty of action sequences, and most of the time the film gave us eye candy that we haven't seen before. It seemed as though a general theme in the film (besides ""questioning what's real"") was constant play with gravity. This may have been influenced by inception, but the world turns upside down a few times, and it's visually interesting.Cons: The plot. It was there, but not as deep as you would hope for a ""Total Recall"" remake. There were a few cool things thrown in there, but the plot was definitely not the strong point of the film.The action sequences. There were a lot of positive aspects to all the action, but the movie seemed to rely too heavily on it. The movie came off as one giant chase scene, and it became slightly repetitive after a while. If you like a little meat on your plot's backbone, you may want to lower your expectations a little bit before seeing this one. Conclusion: Try not to think of this film as a literal remake of the original. Think of it as analogous to a band doing a cover of someone else's song... in a very different style. It lifts the ideas from the original film, and written source material, but takes a different spin on it.In all, I liked it. I had my quips, but it's a movie that I gave a lot of forgiveness.

I can't think of a single thing that I'd like to recall.It reminded of Tron Legacy & Matrix, but while Matrix's dialogs about dream and reality worked fine in that movie. Similar talk in this movie was almost laughable (people were actually laughing out loud in the theater during serious scenes, because the dialog seemed so ridiculous). The Hero had (sort of) Amnesia, and everyone kept messing with his head and his memories. It was so rundown, it wasn't even funny. Some dialogs were stretched out more than they should've been.The enemy was super powerful, with 100% surveillance everywhere, yet the Hero easily sneaks thro areas, and in the end manages to destroy the enemy while immobilizing the army.This is the last time I'm recalling this movie, because I want to save a few good people from this waste.",Total Recall

(And by the way, why is there only one available manufactured memory of a ""Secret Agent"" adventure? Shouldn't a customer fill out some sort of questionnaire on what they want to have happen? But no, they just inject the one scenario that fits all. Not very thoughtful for a place that is supposed to be catering to the wishes of the consumer.) Nice special effects, but so many of them and of such duration that you wonder if the actors got tired of climbing and jumping around on the greenscreen stage.The acting was acceptable; it was the lack of character development and lack of any emotional attachment to the plight of the revolutionaries that made the story a drag. Right off I'm supposed to think that anyone married to Kate Beckinsale has it rough? (Or, conversely, I think that most women would tolerate Colin Farrell) How come the original movie's Mars colony storyline was abandoned? Well that wouldn't have been so bad if it hadn't been replaced by a story dependent on a giant elevator through the center of the Earth. Yeah, that's right. And guess what? There is only one such elevator, and the ruling nation uses it to subjugate another region on the other side of Earth. Gee, I wonder if that obvious plot device will come to a ruinous end? And at the conclusion, why not just make the villains into pleasant folk with the Total Recall technology? At least the photogenic ones! I wanted to like this movie, but I really don't recommend it. It was frustrating for failing to take sci-fi story telling seriously.",Total Recall

546,Fadu-K7,Great Action (Well Executed) - Great Story (Poorly Executed),7,5 August 2012,"Acting: I am a fan of Colin Farrel. Kate Beckinsale is great looking as is Jessica Biel, but they are not favourite's of mine when it comes to acting, although they are tolerable for their strength in action scenes. Farrel is underrated, and I feel he should receive a lot more credit than he deserves, he can act when given the right direction and motivation. I personally think he was a highlight in this movie among the lesser skilled female actresses (in my opinion) and not enough screen time by Brian Cranston or Bill Nighy.Story: I absolutely loved this movie during the intro, it was instantly on it's way to being a favourite of mine. With ideas such as ""The Fall"" (which was a compelling piece of the story), the tension between the UFB and The Colony, as well as the main character going through a *beep* of a situation, this movie really had potential. Not to mention the great sets. Unfortunately, this story got lost when filming started, the movie relied too much on the action and although the story is there somewhere, you cant feel it with all the bullets flying.Action: This is the most important part of THIS review, why? Because this is what the movie wanted to be. It is meant to be a popcorn eating show of chases, bullets and fighting. This was not meant to be complex (although I wish it was) nor to be a complete mirror of the original. The action in this movie is worth the Full Price, although I would recommend a Matinée because the other aspects do hold it back. Well choreographed, well executed and well directed action scenes are good enough in my opinion to hold the movie itself.Conclusion: There was a point in this movie where I asked myself which reality was the more possible one, and although this scene was the make or break point in terms of storytelling, it only hurt its story telling because the opportunity to build on it was completely ignored. The rest of the movie keeps NEW fans attached. It is enough for a Tuesday show.Score: B Cost: Matinée",Total Recall

Maybe they wanted to create a completely new plot and world around it but it failed. Prime minister or resistance leader are just few seconds figures, saying almost nothing. Great potential from the robots is not used, even when it seems there is some special robots (the black one) as a bodyguard (??).The only thing which is good in this movie are special effects, those are good and I like them.

Now for starters I loved the original, and pretty much every other 80s/90s ""futuristic world is now a $h!t hole and one guy is about to f*** people up"". Im glad to see movies going back to this format (Total recall, Dredd, In Time, etc.) because its on of my favorite genres. As for the movie its heavy on the chase scenes and loaded with 1 vs. infinity situations that make for a fun night of action and not thinking too hard. It was a CGI heavy film, which isn't a bad thing but I feel they leaned a little too hard on it (something about the cars rubbed me the wrong way). The acting was good, Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel worked well together but I felt a forced aspect to Kate Beckinsales role. Don't go into this movie expecting to laugh, cry, or think. Go into ready for action and nostalgia (yes nostalgia, watching it feels like the 80s/90s with better acting and better visuals).

Yet, it received a lot of negative reviews maybe because some people expected to not be serious and deep.All in all, this is one of the best sci-fi movies ever released and it definitely worth your watch. It is more Fidel to the original book than its 90s edition and the acting is far better.

And schwarzies one-liner when he killed her was classic. Farrell does a very lame job here and doesn't convince. Trading in mars as a location also a big mistake.

551,spruehsahne,"...no second blade runner, neither a total recall of the 21. century!",6,24 August 2012,"This review is based on the fact, that Total Recall barely made its budget back. The feature had an estimated budget from $125 million and after 3 weeks it did not managed to regain the same amount, neither on domestic nor foreign box offices. After 3.4 weeks, it managed to pull of $134 million, thanks to foreign markets. Total Recalls weak box office performance might be caused by terrible trailer material or by a weak marketing campaign in general. Actually, the viral campaign ""Tell us your fantasy. We 'll make it real"" for the fictitious company REKALL, which promises to implant experiences, is not in the movie. Thus, Total Recall feels more like a TV feature, than a theatrical movie. But this is not the only negative point. Len Wisemans vision of Total Recall got some problems. The work of the camera operators and the lightening seems outdated in many scenes. There are no crystal clear visuals. There are no sharp contrasts. If you would like to get Michael Bay eye-candy, you are wrong here. The mass scenes are a shame! They look like theater. The rain is too mild. People are very slow and not busy. Also, they look like they are coming from the latest cosplay convention. They rather remind on mass scenes from Sylvester Stallones Judge Dredd, than on mass scenes from Blade Runner. The rhythm of the script is not balanced. The beginning is intelligent, but after a while the movie relies too much on bullet ballet and yes - car chases. So, there happens many times nothing but action. This makes Total Recall seem like children entertainment, especially in the second half. But not only the second half, the whole tone of the movie seems a bit simple, premature and fairy tale-ish. It is a medium big PG-13 movie, so maybe it is best for kids. But there are no fantasy elements in there. Thinking about box office numbers, the missing fantasy elements could be the first problem. The movie is PG-13 rated, but contains no fantastic elements, such as aliens or mutants. When you check the box office top entries, you realize quickly that fantasy, money and PG-13 go hand in hand. Either way, even in a R rated approach, aliens and mutants would not be wrong. It was especially the mutant scenes, which gave the original version from 1990 its charm and its wit, besides that Arnold Schwarzenegger exchanged cool lines with Sharon Stone.For me, as someone, who has seen the 1990 version from Total Recall while still being a kid, it is entertaining to compare to the actual 2012 version. As said in the beginning, the movie is not all bad.There are some cool gadget ideas in there - the implant mobile, which only needs to get into contact with glass to start to communicate, or the mask simulator, whichs technology is not invented yet. Also - almost like a cliché after being repeated many times in recent times - corning glass, in the apartment from the main character.Still, these ideas are presented in a way, as if they where going to make a TV feature. The cinema feeling is rarely coming up, even the gadget ideas are great and far away from being outdated. Sadly the visual approach on the movie seems aged. The colors are pretty weak and sometimes it feels like, as if the makers wanted to bring back that bleached 1990 look from the original movie. That's an idea, but it might be more appropriated to try an distinctive and individual look, fitting to 2012. To me, it was a disappointing experience, especially talking about Len Wisemans direction, not about the actors. After Wiseman had success in the fantasy genre, with his grim Underworld tale about Vampires and Werewolf's, I expected more imagination.Total Recall is inspired by and based on Philipp K. Dicks short story ""We can remember it for your whole sale"", which was published in ""The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction"" in 1966. Philipp K. Dicks story is actually about an alien invasion.The plot is simple and plays with the thought around ""what is real and what is not real"", but does not goes that deep, like ""the matrix"" or ""inception"". In the same time, the story plays with the thought ""who is real and who is not real"" somehow like in ""the island"", but as well, it does not goes that deep. The core of the plot is interesting and fresh, but the plot itself stays on the surface. The main character, which the male audience is supposed to identify with, is manipulated into two parts. Construction worker Quaid and special agent Hauser. Only one of them is worked out well, the other is not. I believe, the 2012 version of Total Recall is a box office let down because, it is a children movie, but it has no fantastic elements, such as aliens and mutants and because it relies too heavy on its action scenes, than on character development or complicated sub-plot elements. It would be wrong to say, that some scenes felt like the intro to a pc-game, but classical action elements, such as chases and bullet ballets are outdated. A nowadays audience would like to witness complicated technical processes, inventions and, in case of a sci-fi movie, detailed and near realistic future worlds. Criticism could go on and someone could come up with ideas and questions, such as - why no one placed the fictitious REKALL campaign ""Tell us your fantasy. We 'll make it real"" into the movie? Where are fictitious brands and fictitious commercials? Where was the REKALL commercial, before the main character got his memory transplanted? They should make an immediate reboot, but with a muscular lead actor, aliens and as R rated approach.",Total Recall

This film simply bored me to tears, and I like action movies. Even removing the back history of the original, I can't believe they let this one reach the theaters with its thin plot line and unoriginal action sequences.First off, the idea in this film is not to present you with any kind of real story line (at least nothing original), or provide any semblance of a movie experience. It's just 120 minutes of Colin running away from the bad guys with no break for a plot. Plot holes, while numerous, were filled in with other plot holes and a good story was filled in with iRobot meets Blade Runner graphics. Now, sometimes a bad movie can at least save its face with some 'appeal' with its stars, but they couldn't even give us that from Kate or Jessica.

Before going to see it I thought it will be a mediocre action sci-fi, yet it still managed to disappoint me.There were some dumb one-liners, a few ""why aren't they shooting back?"" moments and quite a number of odd cuts, where a lot happens in one part of the movie yet nothing happens in another(the final fight scene where Farrell is held in an aikido lock for what feels like 2 minutes while they cut back to a seemingly immortal Kate Beckinsale is a disgrace).",Total Recall

Considering all the rest it is different movie, so it shouldn't be compared with original one. What we have this year. Good (not perfect) summer action sci-fi flick with nice acting, perfect visuals and almost nonstop action. For me the story is more like I, Robot, but with poorer development. All three main characters act absolutely adequately for the genre. Tough man, beautiful and tough women it works and looks believable. What is missing: better character development and viewer's involvement to the story. The problem is that we don't worry about characters we just watch technically flawless moving pictures.

556,abhishekbharadwaj79,A pretty good entertainer,8,21 August 2013,"Let me start by saying that I loved the movie. If you are a critique and trying to find mistakes then it's a different issue but if you wish to enjoy I assure you that you will have a good time.Right from the beginning the movie intrigued me. It's the year 2084 and the whole world is inhabitable because of chemical warfare, except two areas namely (UFB) and the Colony(Australia). Colin Farell is a factory worker, named Douglas Quaid married to Kate Beckinsale named Lori Quaid shown as a little more important doing some police work. They live in The Colony. Now the colony is for the poor and UFB is for the higher class of people. So the people go from the colony go to UFB via a vehicle for various purposes, mainly for labour work. Douglas Quaid gets a dream every night where he is running away from the UFB agents with Jessica Beil who is called Melina whom he has to leave to save her and is captured by the agents. He starts to feel something is wrong. He one day sees an advertisement of ""Total Rekall"" where they implant artificial memories. I was really impressed by both the sets, specially the vehicle in which they travel. Now a days that it's pretty common to show such fantastic places with all the development in technology and because of that people have stopped appreciating it but they should know that no matter what it takes a lot of effort and should not just ignore it. Now coming back to the movie, The guy at Total Rekall suggests some memories,Douglas stops him at the memory of Double agent. The guys take him to a machine where he is strapped and about to be injected with some liquid. So right at the time when they inject him the guy says that he lied and asks everybody to abort, but it's too late a lot of UFB cops come in all guns blazing everybody dies except him. He does not run he starts to fight them and kills around 20 cops and this picturization was pretty good. He somehow runs and manages to reach home where he meets his wife and explains the whole situation, she tries to calm him down and hugs him but hugs him tightly and doesn't leave. Now Douglas after putting a lot of effort gets out of her control. And then she starts to attack him and he has no option but to fight her back and this sequence is when I was in awe, it was beautiful. I am being a bit biased since I love Kate Beckisnsale and her fighting sequence I always Love. .He finds the key and finds a message delivered in AI. Where in he discovers that he is a special agent of UFB who went rogue, regarding whom it was shown in the very beginning in the news. The message tells him that he realized that UFB were the wrong people and joins the resistance. He has to save the Colony with the code in his head. He is baffled and confused right now because from a common worker he is now the most wanted man of the world. He manages to escape and meets the head of The Resistance Matthias. Turns out Melina is Matthias daughter, UFB could never catch him because they used to live in the inhabitable area. But as soon as Douglas reaches there UFB finds his location and comes there to kill him. Now UFB head Cohagen played by Bryan Cranston comes there and tells him that it was all Douglas' idea whose original name is Carl Houser. He tells him that it was his idea to wipe his idea to change his identity and fall in love with Matthias daughter and reach to him. He tell shim there is no code in his head it was all his idea to wipe his memory and do it this way. Now Douglas is totally lost and me too. Cohagen kills Matthias and leaves his guards to give Carl his memory back. He manges to escape with the help of a guard. Cohagen takes his army to destroy The colony. He reaches there and dramatically saves The Colony and Melina.Now in the end where we all are yet confused that what's the reality that is he living an artificial memory or he is a UFB agent gone Rogue working for the right cause or a corrupt UFB agent.He almost dies while saving The Colony. When he opens his eyes he is severely injured and is being treated. He sees his hand where there should have been a mark of needle that was inserted in his arm. There is no mark, but he sees Melina and ignores it and is about to kiss her when he realises that she is actually Lori and fights her and kills her and goes outside the room where he is being treated and sees that he has saved The colony and his ""real wife"" is sitting outside being treated as well. That's the end and couldn't figure out the end. if someone could tell me about the end with proper facts I would be thank full.And did I say that I watched in on my laptop and not in theatre. One more thing if you expect too much from any movie you will be disappointed always. Not every movie is The Dark Knight.",Total Recall
557,pandazqueen,A good stand alone film,7,13 August 2012,"I'm not going to compare the new remake of Total Recall to the old as I believe they have nothing to do with each other and so shouldn't be compared. Before this film I didn't have high expectations from Colin Farell and Jessica Beil but I was looking forward to Kate Beckinsale's performance and to Len Wiseman's directing being a fan of his work already. Acting - The acting wasn't the best but I've seen much worst, Kate Beckinsale did a fantastic job of playing the loving wife before instantly switching into a cold hearted b****, she played her role VERY WELL. Colin Farrel was also really good, he'd switch from being scared and useless into a killing machine and then back, this almost split personality showed that he can act very well but his character didn't connect very well with Melina especially as they were meant to be past lover. Overall the acting was good by Beckinsale and Farrel and the two played off each other very well but Beil was a bit of a third wheel and hung in the background a bit. Directing - The directing was fantastic, the shots and scenery were fantastic and the ideas behind everything were well thought out and displayed spectacularly. Plot - There was a plot but it seemed a bit rushed during the middle and ending of the film, the film was mainly about the characters rather than what they were involved in. Some of the plot was a bit predictive but I didn't think that mattered too much. Action - There was a lot of it, from multiple people fighting at once to giant explosion. It was fast paced in places and was clear and fun to watch, the fights weren't a mess of arms flying around the placed but well choreographed and violent. Overall - The film was presented really well from the futuristic cities to all the cool gadgets they used but some of the acting and the plot let it down a bit. The ending also was a bit poor, it went from a fast paced action scene to a smaller action scene that only lasted for a couple of seconds and it didn't really work and the ending just felt rushed. Beckinsale and Farrel obviously worked very hard and it shows in their performances but Beil's character didn't really feature much, the script was a little cliché in places but a couple of jokes made it funny and not too serious. I found this film very enjoyable and I have already recommended it to my friends.",Total Recall
558,Jezzibel,Great Action Film,10,6 August 2012,"Overall thoughts: The film is beautiful. The scenery is awesome. I couldn't tell where reality ended and computer-generated began. I don't know how they do all that, even though I have relatives who actually do this computer stuff for a living. Everything was so detailed. It wasn't a beautiful world, but it was exactly what you'd expect if too many people were crowded into a small area. The film is not on film but is straight from a hard drive. I prefer that.The plot is not confusing. I think many people tend to go out for popcorn mid-film and then complain that they don't know what is going on when they get back. The plot is actually very simple. I came up with a few questions hours afterward. One, my husband and I were able to come up with a plausible reason for, but we're still not too sure about something else. (maybe we'll discuss this after more people have seen the film). So, there are a few loose ends, but it doesn't make the film confusing at the time).The acting is good for most of the actors. Bad acting always jumps out and grabs me by the throat. The only time I felt it was the scene between Colin Farrell and Bill Nighy. Nighy has little more than a cameo, but he phoned it in. The lines were stiff and Farrell reigned in his own acting as if he was thinking ""Really? That's all you're giving me to work with?"" There is a lot of action. A LOT of action! I have to disagree with critics who say that the film moves too quickly because it is all action. It is an action film, so, yes, duh, there is a lot of action. However, the action scenes are spaced apart by some nice, quiet, thoughtful scenes that show what Quaid is going through in his head.Yes, you have to suspend belief in the chase scenes. Lori pops up right where Quaid and Melina are over and over again without us knowing how she locates them (I assume that, since she is also a secret agent, she is thinking ""what would he do next?"" but the film never shows her playing this chess game.) It got to the point where she'd pop up and I'd think ""And heeeeere's Lori!"" Plus, her hair always looked great, no matter what she went through.There was one moment when I jumped clean out of my seat. There were several cringe-worthy moments. Oh, and I actually screeched out loud one time. I can't remember an action film where I was caught off-guard so many times. Two times during the film, I caught myself thinking that I had no idea how they were going to get out of all this. It was nice to be clueless instead of already having it figured out ahead of time.I had a little trouble with the sound. I'm partially deaf in one ear, as it is and do a lot of lip reading. I use closed captioning at home. Background sounds come out of all different speakers located around the theater. The voices are not loud enough. So, I'd be hearing background sounds right in my good ear while desperately trying to make out what the characters were saying. I missed several lines.I had intended to re-watch the original before seeing this, but I didn't get the chance. However, I did catch many of the bows to the original peppered throughout the film. No 'winking at the audience', just a bunch of ""hey, did he just say"" or ""hey, did they just do.."" So, I really enjoyed the film. Colin Farrell did an admirable job, but, sorry, ladies, he was not sexy at all in this role. He was just some poor schmuck having his brains scrambled, and he did a great job.",Total Recall

560,haikallp,Don't compare it to the 1990 movie of the same name.,7,8 August 2012,"I managed to watch total recall a couple of days back, and have watched it a second time. The reviews I've read so far reveals how many are comparing this to the 1990 movie staring Arnie.Well, there are many differences in these two movies and if you want to truly enjoy this remake, you have gotta forget bout the original one. Try not to compare Arnie with Farrel and Beckinsale with Sharon Stone.Graphically, Total Recall is beautifully crafted with good CGI work. It makes you wonder how believable the place is. It paints a future of the world where only two 'countries' exist while the majority of the Earth have become inhabitable. The difference in these two countries is vast and both of them looks amazing.Collin Farell acting here is good but not worthy of any awards though Kate Beckinsale was amazing. She was definitely the best actor in this movie, hands down. The guy who played Cohagen was average a best. The other actors seemed blend and no one really stood out.I have watched the original Total Recall and i have to say that these remake is slighty better. It feels more epic, saving a country seems more intense than saving a bunch of people living on Mars. The notion 'What is real' works well in this movie, especially in one of the scene in the hotel lobby i believe. What this movie lacks as compared to the original was a lack of witty lines. Arnie had some witty one-sentence line whereas Collin was pretty much serious throughout. Total Recall started out great but by the time it hits the 60-80mins mark it starts to become a mindess action movie and it was pretty much predictable after that.All in all, Total Recall is a great movie for someone who has never watched the original. I would give a rating of probably 7-8 out of 10.",Total Recall

There's something about Farrell that suits the role of ""the bored construction worker"" **SPOILERS** I liked the tension between Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel which is there from the first time they meet until the end of the movie. The special effects were outstanding and the storyline wasn't bad either, the whole concept of Rekall was the main thing that kept me on the edge of my seat as the film makes you believe that the WHOLE movie is set in Rekall and none if it is actually real. The people who have already seen it however will know that this is not the case. There were a few things that annoyed me though, such as Farrell's Irish accent coming out with certain things he said, it kind of kept me entertained whilst noticing these but at the same time was irritating as I was subconsciously listening for it through most of the movie. Quaid's wife (played by Kate Beckinsale) also had a MUCH bigger part in this movie and was a far more important character. This made it a bit more believable. Overall the movie kept me entertained and I was talking about how good it was all the way home from the cinema. PS.

(And seriously can you really say that you would have given the Arnie version a 10 if you saw it today, come on now).The action sequences were great. The fighting choreography was good. In all honesty I think Kate Beckinsale is one of the better female action stars out there, I mean she can really kick ass. Well the CG was awesome. The interpretation of the future was well though out. I especially liked that there were cars hovering and not ""flying"" using a magnetic levitation system (very realistic look into the future of transportation). The plot was decent, and this is where it loses 1 star. I thought it did a great job adapting Philip K. Dick's science fiction story into it's own. However, I thought that it followed too similar in plot sequence of the 1990 film. It would have been a 10 for me otherwise.

It seems that the concept of the Aliens and Mars were not on the list of the directors/writers or producers when remaking a great movie and this one did not come to par. Why mess with the original storyline, that was the whole reason behind the first movie. WE loved the original movie and were deeply saddened that it was ruined. The fight scenes were awesome and the graphics were definitely very cool, but like I said before, Kate Beckinsale, was the only good thing about the movie.

564,wook22,DO not see this POS- remake or not,1,5 August 2012,"I HATED it for the simple reason I have a brain that allows for reasoning- oh! And I am older than five years of age. I need to have SOME semblance of reality even when the genre is sci-fi or fantasy or even animation. This piece of excrement was so full of plot holes and implausibilities even the horribly staged/shot action sequences couldn't mask the obvious failings of the Director and screenwriter. I can't count the number of times I shouted in my head, ""just shoot him. Why can't they shoot him"". After Bryan Cranston's failed attempt at recovering the REAL Quaid, he sends the sour faced Kate B after him. At a time when Quaid ( Farrel) was SURROUNDED by gun toting minions! Just talk into your mic there and say, ""Kill him"". There were so many of these moments I'm getting angry again just REKALLING them.",Total Recall
565,freedomofthoughtmatters,Excellent gritty film that concentrates on a few strong performances,10,3 September 2012,"I was extremely impressed with the remake. I never much cared for the first TR film which was way too cheesy with terrible acting from Arnie and terrible cheap effects which were funny the day they came out. But reading some of the reviews on IMDb it seems that this second remake commits the ultimate crime of not being the first TR. I'm not sure why - the two aren't in the same class and aren't trying to achieve the same aim. It's like comparing the TV Series Lost in Space with an Alien movie - one is meant for laughs and light entertainment filmed with cheap sets and terrible acting, the other is a serious sci-fi film. But hey ho. This remake is top-drawer stuff - absolutely jaw droppingly realistic visuals which are crucial because of the number of scenes that rely on scenery for dramatic effect - long drops, jumping across roofs, bridges,cars etc at speed at what seems sometimes to be miles up in the air. It's a very believable high-tech world. Colin Farrell plays a very strong, believable role as a man who starts off as a man missing something in life, then is both struggling to hold it together whilst simultaneously being a super-agent. Vulnerable and hard as nails is a difficult one to pull off but he did it. In fact everyone in the film plays a strong role with the pursuing agent brilliantly played as an almost terminator like person but with a sense that her relentlessness is more professional pride than 'evil'. The film is very well paced and has a good number of pauses that give you time to catch your breath without giving you so much time to get bored. In fact the film itself plays almost as a heist movie with a constant threat always around the next door from the relentless pursuer. This and Avengers are my favourite movies this year and I wish that Prometheus had had some of the technical care, artistic vision and character development that TR has. But I suspect that this is the year of the fan-boys as to rate Prometheus highly (a film with no plot or character) simply because it's an Alien movie whilst simultaneously berating this one because it isn't an Arnie movie shows how dependent film 'quality detection' is becoming dependent upon things that simply aren't to do with the film that's watched.",Total Recall
566,georgeperdikeas,I give it 9/10,9,2 September 2012,"I can not understand why so many people gave this film such negative reviews. It does not contain scenes in Mars.So what? It does not have Arnold.So what? Arnold was always a horrible actor. Was Arnold's acting better than Collin's? Arnold could hardly vocalize more than one sentence in one sitting. Or was Sharon Stone better than Kate Beckinsale? Or was Rachel Ticotin better than Jessica Biel? Please... The visuals are amazing,10/10,the action intense. What was so special about the original one? Lines like ""consider this a divorce""? or ""man , I have five mouths to feed""? or ""Now, this is the plan. Get your ass to Mars.""? or ""I'm gonna drill you, sucker! I'm gonna grind you up! ""? Give me a break...

567,riley-piley,Well worth the ticket price,9,27 August 2012,"Just got back from mt local theater. Tonight I saw the sci-FY thriller ""Total Recall"" and I have to say: it was awesome. One of my favorite sci-FY movies of all time. The basic premise of the movie is that the antagonist used to lead a different life, and however it happened, he lost his memory. And now he's trying to figure out more about his past while trying to avoid the cops. Now, premise aside, let's talk about the movie.There was a lot to this movie that made it what it was in my mind. The visual effects were great and well thought out, which really made the action sequences stand out. Not only that, but the scenery looked really awesome and futuristic. The action sequences were good and gripping. My personal favorite would have to be the battle on top of and in the terminal that runs through the earth. The science behind the fiction was (apparently) almost perfect. And finally, the plot line was exceptional. It kept me hooked the whole time. It took a lot of turns that I did not see coming. I don't want to go into details and spoil anything. It was just exceptional.I do have a few complaints however. With all the things that were exceptional about this movie, the acting was not one of them. Don't get me wrong. The acting was good. It just was over shadowed by how awesome everything else was. None of the roles stood out to me as worth mentioning. But this is a minor complaint, because the acting was good. I enjoyed it. But I feel that if they had some better actors on board, the movie as a whole would be WAY better. The movie also had some predictable Hollywood moments. Nothing too bad. Just a bit personally irritating. Also, on a sad note, I had to face the fact that according to this movie, after hundreds of years, dubstep is still around. Let's try to change that :) All in all, I'd give the new Total Recall a 8.4/10. Great movie. Truly one of the best of its kind. The only movie I could recommend above it would be the Dark Knight Rises if you STILL haven't seen it.Oh, and from one bro to another, the lead female actresses in this movie were not bad on the eyes in the slightest.",Total Recall
568,liam-darby,Incredible remake of a sci-fi classic.,10,19 December 2012,"I absolutely loved this remake. The original was fantastic and I wondered what could possibly be improved upon in this version apart from updated special effects. To my surprise, the entire setting of the film was changed. The idea of an earth rendered uninhabitable by chemical warfare with the two remaining habitable regions connected by an enormous tunnel burrowing straight through the earth makes a great setting for futuristic sci-fi. What I really liked about the film is the way they kept some scenes very true to the original whilst changing just enough of the scene to surprise the viewer. Without giving anything away, classic scenes like the ""Two weeks!"" scene and the ""It's all in your head, Doug.""scene were done in such refreshing ways I also love the way they extrapolated from existing technology to produce believable sci-fi - things like phone implants in the hand, mag-lev freeways, holographic collars, etc. None of the future tech in this movie is fantastical, in fact the opposite is true - many of the technologies which are now in their infancy could believably be developed to the stages we see in the film. I've already watched this film three times and I could easily watch it three more within the next couple of weeks. After the disappointment that was Prometheus, it's great to see some smart, enjoyable sci-fi on our screens again.",Total Recall

The cast fit well, the acting was great and the action and directing of this movie was brilliant! until the very end, of which was not the greatest 'end of movie battle'. Besides that it was well constructed and if you had seen the original it definitely misleads you to think you know what is going to happen, but you don't. It was really well designed to correlate with the original but maintaining its own story line without letting the lines get too crossed. In order to replicate an old classic and maintaining a fresh new story would not be easy. 10/10 from me.",Total Recall

I understand the frustration of most people in comparing it to the original, however that is because this is not 'Total Recall 1990' nor does it try to be. What I came to realize is that this is a tribute to all of the sci-fi classics some harsh critics claim that this film is ripping off. From the rain of blade runner to the hover/rail cars of Minority Report. As a huge fan of the Arnold film I must say that there were several easter eggs in this film that others my miss. I won't go into details, but I definitely enjoyed this film, heck I may see it again and buy it on DVD (which is rare, honestly who buys DVDs anymore;) As a stand alone film this movie is entirely forgettable.

I have watched it more times than I can remember - especially on VHS that my mum recorded for me when I was a kid - oh the memories! The new one incorporates some of the exact same scenes and dialogue into this remake, in-between, OK I'll admit some cool looking landscape scenes, but an all together predictable and boring storyline. Many references were made to the funny parts in the original and I found myself playing out those scenes in my head and not appreciating what they were trying to do ie two weeks and 3 boobed girl.It's just weird seeing new actors acting out these scenes. Colin Farrel ain't the best actor and I can always detect his Irish accent coming through and personally, I find it cringe worthy! OK Arnie was a pretty bad actor but he made up with his screen presence and unique physique at that time.Why did someone want to remake Total Recall – it was a gruesome, quirky 80's classic that should have not been messed with.I guarantee if you wait for this to come on TV in a years time and watch it - you'll be pleased you spent your £10 hard earned cash on something else!",Total Recall

Only flaws were standard action-movie-issues... characters surviving beat downs that no one could, thousands of rounds fired with no hits on the main characters, robots that don't know how to shoot... same 'ol.

I couldn't wait for the drawn-out affair to end.The CGI elevators and car chase scenes were quite fantastic but with no story to back-up such graphics and artificial set, there was little point other than to wonder during the film why all the money went into the visuals and marketing and not into plot development or storyline. If just some budget had gone to the story the film could have been wonderful.For those who never saw the original, I don't know how you will ever figure out what this movie is trying to say or accomplish other than to take some hard-earned money out of your wallet.This film in now on my Top Ten Worst Films of All Time list.",Total Recall
575,jonathanabsolute,The only review you need to read,7,9 August 2012,"Let me start by saying I am 32 years old and own the original Total Recall. I have a bachelor's degree in a film related study (audio) and love everything from Scorcese to Italian Giallo films to David Lynch and independent movies.Part of the joy of Film is the wide breadth of events/happenings you can witness. And if you bought a ticket for this movie expecting to see an Andrei Tarkovsky flick, you are stupider than your expectations. Sometimes I WANT to see something that isn't going to change my outlook on life and just entertain me and that is my right as a human being. Just like I know I should be eating my green leafy vegetables everyday, sometimes a big, nasty hamburger really hits the spot.That being said, I definitely enjoyed the new Total Recall, probably because I got what I expected. I wanted to see a movie that would wow me with an interesting visual presentation of the future, excite me and not bore me. Suffice to say, I got what i paid for. Now for all those people who are saying the original was way better than this one with a straight face need to get a grip. Seriously, if you want a challenge watch the new Total Recall and then rush home and watch the old one. You may find yourself laughing. Seriously. Total Recall WAS NEVER GREAT! I mean seriously admit to yourself that pretty much anything Arnold was in was a glorified B-Movie. Yeah yeah, I love Predator, T2, trust me, but the 'man vs alien' and 'crazy robot' formula is straight up B-movie. I mean Commando. Get serious! That being said, the first Total Recall's effects are laughable and for a sci-fi movie this is a detail that you can't mess up. Within the last several months I watched both Alien and Blade Runner and didn't find myself laughing at the effects. And for all those who wanna talk about character development, script or acting in the original, WHAT MOVIE WERE YOU WATCHING? I'm not even going to elaborate on this point because it isn't worth arguing but seriously the new movie trimmed a lot of the original's corny elements. No, I don't miss the fact that Mars wasn't in this movie. No, I don't miss the fact that Kuato or any other mutants or midgets weren't in the new TR.As a matter of fact, I found myself saying that this was a totally new movie. Yes it still hinges on Doug Quaid, a man who laments his mundane life only to find his real self activate when he participates in a fantasy service, but these are totally different movies. I found Colin Farell more relatable as the every-man than Shwarzenegger, who I always felt was so much larger than life he's just a fleshed out cartoon (which works to his advantage a lot). Now I will say this. The movie is far from perfect. I'm not gonna sit here and try to convince you this is an Oscar winner or something that raises the bar on ANYTHING. Cuz it's not. I felt at parts I was missing something, whether it was a dramatic build into the next bit of action or maybe I truly did miss the absence of plot (let's face it David Mamet didn't write this one). One other reviewer, pretty much nailed it by saying that the action all blends into one contiguous piece. Fortunately, it is an amazing looking and sounding piece. A couple more minor complaints: although I loved all the technology, at times i felt we were being shown effects for effects sake and it wasn't woven into the action well. I will also say that I think that Kate Beckinsale is a talented and absolutely gorgeous actress. so it pained me to see her deliver a line like ""I give good wife"". It probably pained her to say it. All in all though, this is a popcorn movie for sure. The action is so fast paced and constant, one could mow through whole tubs of popcorn to this one. Just go expecting a nice juicy burger of a film and not the kind of healthy input that is good for you, and you will be satisfied.",Total Recall

May we never know... Now it is official that Colin Farrell is a bad actor, so bad that i felt ashamed watching him in this C movie. That was awful what he presented. We all make jokes about Arnie and his bad acting skills. But Arnie did a good job in Total recall (1990), in fact excellent, way better then Colin in this movie.

579,jllomax2001,What a waste of time and money,1,16 August 2012,"OK...So went and saw the remake of Total Recall today. With that said if you plan on seeing it and haven't yet...you might want to just keep on scrolling, cuz I WILL BE SPOILING.OK, so anybody that knows me, will say that i'm pretty easy going and like pretty much everything. In fact, when I say ""I like"" something, people usually just ignore me, but, when I say ""I don't like"" something, that usually gets peoples attention.=====So my opinion on the Total Recall remake==== In my opinion, DO NOT go see this movie. This is based on several reasons: 1.) Mars. The original movie took place mostly on the planet Mars. In the remake,they took the movies Resident Evil 3, the original Judge Dread, a little bit of the first Underworld, and a dash of Total Recall (And what I mean by ""dash"" is pretty much the names are the same and that's it.). So needless to say...it all took place on Earth.2.) Mutants. Mutants played a role in the original Total Recall movie. In the remake, no mutants what so ever. The ONLY homage they paid to the mutants, was the 3 breasted hooker. Which in the remake, I guess is just a prostheticly enhanced human 3.) Guado. Yeah, he's not even in this movie. They renamed the leader of the resistance to Matthias.4.) The remake is pretty much on point (as far as the Quaid character goes) right up until he goes to Recall, then, EVERYTHING is different.5.) Re-population. OK, so the movie DOESN'T take place on Mars, and there ARE NOT any mutants, and it REALLY has a feel of a bunch of movies that were just smashed up together. The best thing to do would to TRY to make the Earth able to be populated again...at least. But sadly no, instead of the Earth being repopulated, there is an invasion force of computer controlled soldiers controlled by Cohaagan that Quaid is supposed to have the shutdown code for, but turns out it's a ruse.6.) Aliens. In the original movie there were aliens that built a machine to make the planet Mars able to sustain human life, well, since the movie takes place TOTALLY on Earth, they have been removed from the plot all together as well.Needless to say, I REALLY disliked this movie. It did little to pay respect to the original movie, the storyline SUCKED, and i had a feeling that the director, producers, and others, wanted the opportunity to make a movie, and label it as a ""remake"" with the same title and characters but have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN COMMON with the original outside of some little things every now and then and the characters names.If you want to go see this movie please watch the original before you go see the remake...and you'll understand EXACTLY what I'm talking about.",Total Recall

The movie has many improvements from the original but a few minuses too. Good film over-ally, absolutely worth paying for. It is interesting to see how the director made the film more realistic and made the storyline more complete.

581,mixalis-ntalakos,"This BAD, even for a remake...",4,27 August 2012,"Learning that Hollywood will remake the good old action / sci-fi Arnold flick made my ears turn to attention. I consider the original a good film (not Arnold's best, but still good) and was really interested and open minded for this one.Where to begin? The new cast is good. All three major characters are tested in action films in the past and they do manage to handle the action scenes in a descent way. Sure thing the remake keeps a more ""up to speed"" pace compared to the original according to recent standards. In fact the whole movie is a frantic chase / fight collage of scenes with some slow ""story-telling"" moments (that take like 1/10 of the whole duration).Sadly for me that's where the whole thing comes crushing down.First of all where is Mars? Seriously? You are doing a remake and basically try to capitalize on the success of the original by butchering it? Sorry but that is so FAIL as Judge Dred without a helmet on! I started watching the movie thinking from that tenth minute on ""now they will mention Mars"". No deal, never happened.Second of all. Sure its an action film and yes I accept that I am not watching a historical documentary. But having a gravity train that travels through the core of the Earth is simply WRONG. You are saying you actually managed to build a tunnel through the magma? Why not simply built a... colony in Mars? Also the gravity train is called that way for a reason. It lacks gravity, which in the last 30+ minutes of the film is simply not happening.Third, guys try to be a bit original. Yes most FX where really good but that doesn't say a lot nowadays. Trying to set up a Bladerunner environment simply doesn't work anymore and is it me or the synthetic army had a lot in common with the robots from ""I, Robot""? All in all this is mediocre even if you don't compare it with the original one. Once you start doing comparisons... Not worthy of the money.",Total Recall

Jessica and Kate were stunning throughout, with looks that made my heart skip a beat.Not seen the original for many years, so can't comment on how it compares. However, I thought the story line held together and kept you in suspense throughout. I'm sure there were a few inconsistencies, but nothing that poetic license shouldn't cover. The pace of the film was fantastic, with never a dull moment. Effects made the whole thing look real (which it clearly wasn't). Robots looked a bit too much like Star Wars storm-troopers crossed with those in I-Robot, which was a bit strange.But the best thing about this film: Two stunning brunettes that oozed sex appeal throughout. Only dilemma, which one to add to my ""friends list"" (and who to bounce).

583,merryone7103,The movie made me THINK.,8,1 September 2012,"Total Recall is anything but ordinary. That is to say, the film is second to none! I can say this with certainty on account of these two main reasons.First, the plot of the film made me dwell on it. The movie has a refreshing story, which shows a secret agent, Hauser figuring out his erased memory. Watching the film, I was confused some of the times because I didn't know for sure if Douglus is having illusions of Hauser on the REKALL chair or if Douglas is actually Hauser. I loved the fact that I could actually ponder seriously while watching the film.Second, the quotes of Matthias made a great impression on me. He said that one should listen to his heart to know who he really is. He said clinging to the past is not helpful at all and can also do us harm. For me, what Matthias said really helped because now I stopped worrying that I might not do as well as the past. It's not the past that I have to care about, but the present.As I'm not a native speaker of English, it was not so easy for me to understand the film fully without making mistakes.

Yes the special effects were fantastic and the action was good, but this didn't make up for the changes to the story.I am however happy to hear that the team behind the new Total Recall are now working on two new projects. The first is a remake of Harry Potter, with a few minor changes such as no Hogwarts, no Wizards and Voldermort is good and has a nose. The second project is a feature length Knight Rider movie.

The main reason being that I could not recall it! In any case, in the case of re-makes, comparisons with the original only serve to inflate expectations and obstruct a clear and objective evaluation of the new version.The main problem with this visually satisfying movie is the balance between action and philosophy. Too much of the former, not enough of the later. What little philosophical musings on the nature of reality there are are relatively interesting but too short and too few.The main narrative of the film, whether he is inhabiting the real world or an imaginary one is purveyed well; you are always in doubt as to what is real and what is not, so the viewers interest is maintained throughout.The special effects and in particular the directors use of them in some of the shots is impressive. It is not enough to have special effects, it is how you utilize them to create space and dynamics and director succeeded in this.Not much more to add than this.

586,feather7707,I have just one question. Where the hell is Richter??,1,10 September 2012,"I was excited to watch this remake of Total Recall having been a huge fan of the original. Disappointed is not the word. This film (Total Recall 2012) should never have been made, or if so it should have just been billed as a completely different film with a different name. They took out all the best elements of the original and removed them, no Mars, no Alien artifacts, no Richter, no Benny, no humour and no grandeur. Richter's character being removed is unfathomable and being replaced by Kate Beckinsale is laughable. At no point did I believe that Farrell couldn't overcome Beckinsale if he wanted too, whereas Michael Ironside's Richter wanted Quaid dead and made you think he was crazy- jealous enough to get the job done. The casting of Cohaagen in the remake is also very poor as you just don't believe him as an evil dictator or understand why he suddenly wants to commit mass murder. Whereas Ronny Cox in the original was a real hard-line politician/governor of Mars who wasn't going to stand for any terrorists or mutants ruining his cushy job. He wasn't going to listen or negotiate he was in charge. I did think the idea of Earth in the remake was interesting and that only two areas were habitable due to chemical warfare, but Mars is a much more interesting destination to any sci-fi fan than Australia. Farrell does a good job in the lead but is not Arnie. By the last 30 minutes I didn't care what was going on it just seemed to be going along on some ride to the inevitable conclusion. A last thought - where was Benny the amusing double crossing cab-driver? ""Hey Man I got 5 kids to feed!""",Total Recall

Jessica is hotter IMHO, girl fight scenes are nice ;) in fact the only slight letdown was the male lead. i guess Arnie made the original so great, but this is better for sure by a long way. soundtrack a bit of a tron2 copy and not done as well. sound quality good. av demo track film for sure, sent the roof literally a rattling with decent subs.",Total Recall

Im amazed the actors signed up for this movie as there are some well known faces? A lot of scenes are total rip off's of the original movie and so blatantly so and not executed correctly which made it smell of pure cheese and my mind was made up very quickly that it was a cheap Re-Hash which was destined to fail because it was a copy cat of the original which everyone will obviously compare it too. It's certain death to do a low quality budget film and expect to get the peoples opinions on your side??

Lots of money invested in a movie with no context. It's hilarious how there is no one out there to make great scripts like the old times. Is lack or talent or motivation the main ingredients required to make movies today? What is it that avoids producers, directors and actors to make great movies and consequently great money?

The special effects of the trailer hooked me with great looking special effects. The ideas behind the remake kept the original premise but changed some of the background of the original from Earth/Mars to a chemically ravaged Earth 100 years hence. Great acting cast and the premise should have allowed for some interesting social and political commentary but instead there is simplistic rubbish set against some stunning CGI scenery with nods to other Philip K Dick adaptations such as Blade Runner and some references from the original film (the three breasted woman)which were completely superfluous and inappropriate for the UK age rating 12A. I saw this with my kids age 11 & 13. What however ruined what could have been an excellent premise and some topical political commentary was the scripting which veered from not too bad at times, to completely moronic! How many times to you need to use the word sh*t in one movie? As a result of the pure imaginary laziness of the word smiths there was none of the dark humour of the first movie and an opportunity for subtle digs at political greed, Western imperialism and capitalistic apathy is squandered. Action sequences and special effects are fantastic but in the end the movie disappoints because of the poor scripting.",Total Recall

Good story and all but I'm not sure why they choose this particular vehicle to jump on, other then the great character name choice of ""Douglas Quaid"", which is textbook for the ""everyman who becomes a hero"" character archeotype. I mean, 1990 was a great year and Total Recall was #7 for box office on a list of impressive titles.Other movies from 1990 that could have been re-made in lieu of Total Recall:Home Alone, Ghost, Dances With Wolves, Pretty Woman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Dick Tracy, or...Kindergarten Copy (guess that was a good year for Arnie).Here's the full list of box office rankings in 1990: http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1990Regardless, it was fun seeing the creative team play with the plot and the decisions regarding effects.

592,ibay-ltd,Not even worth downloading,3,30 September 2012,"Before I watched this film, I couldn't see how anyone could possibly mess this up. I had ideas of a giant spacecraft transporting paupers to Mars followed by an unsuspecting hero bringing down a corrupt government, thus freeing the people of Mars by bringing them back to earth. And maybe even a ""See you at the party Richter"" one-liner.However, there is no 'movie' here, what we actually get is a very long, boring, PS3 like, intro scene. Seriously, from reading the 250 reviews below, it's quite obvious that no one understands what actually went on. Let me summarize, whilst using the help of Google, because I didn't manage to follow it either. Somehow the earth's atmosphere was poisoned and there are only two countries left, United Kingdom and presumably its colony, Australia. We never really find out why the air is okay in Australia and the United Kingdom but poisonous in France or Singapore. Next we have the 'fall', some kind of subway train that goes through the earth's core, which brings back the comical days of ""unobtainium"". Anyway, the film never bothered to explain how this subway train works, all we know is that it takes 17 minutes, which roughly translates to 45,000kph, but amusingly there is a fight scene OUTSIDE the craft whilst it travels through the earth's core. Then we have the cast, starting with Chancellor Vilos Cohaagen, even after reading two versions of the synopsis, I still have no idea who he is and what he is in charge of. Then we have Quiad, who for reasons unknown to anyone commutes from, presumably, Australia to the UK to build robotic police. Why are robots built in the UK? No Idea! Anyway, his new workmate, who we meet for 30 seconds, tells him to go and see 'McClane' at Rekall, we never understand why he needed to ask for McClane. The rest of the movie dives off into a PS3 action scene with tons of fight scenes, explosions and other inexplicable content, such as Charlie & the Chocolate factory elevators, elevated roads with magnetic cars, Fiat 500s and scenes of Canary Wharf. This breaks for a moment where we are tested on whether this is a real situation or a Rekall based dream, for reference I personally hoped I was dreaming and that I was actually at home. Anyway, that scene quickly closed down and we returned back to the PS3 action scene, which finally culminated with ALL the police robots taking a single subway train to Australia, which unsurprisingly, is blown up. The end.Not even worth downloading...",Total Recall

How could they have released this garbage? The original screen play was entertaining and contained several plot twists and surprises. This remake changes almost everything about the original story for the worse. There is no Mars, no mutants, and almost no entertainment value in this new version. Practically all clever and memorable scenes in the original movie were either removed or altered. It's the details that count when making a good film. How could such a big budget production go so terribly wrong? This remake was so boring and generic that I struggled to finish watching it. In contrast, I've watched the original about 5 times and always enjoy it.The only good thing about this film is that it can be used by film students as the epitome of how not to do a remake. This film is a disaster of shocking proportions and compelled me to write my fist review on IMDb.",Total Recall
595,eric-539,Not as bad as many reviews suggest,7,8 August 2012,"This wasn't nearly as bad as so many other reviews made it out to be. Was is it great? No. Does it have flaws, yes. I think that understanding the nature of the flaws the way that I do is why I liked it more than others. To me, the major, salient problem was that in spite of all the action, the film moved slow, and in fact it seemed to drag. I think this is simply because we, as an audience, had no connection to the characters. Why do we care? However, this fact does not sink the whole film for me. The other basic problem was a facet of the story, namely ""the Fall"", the elevator contraption, being tied to oppression. Is that really a problem, or a symptom? Also, we needed to see more of Cohaagen, but not in fight scenes. If Quaid/Hauser had played such a vital role then we really needed to learn more about their past together. There were also smaller problems. In spite of this, it held up, at least for me, because I am already familiar with what is going on, perhaps making me more forgiving. The other note is, in spite of all these problems, it was cohesive and didn't bother me, or actually p!ss me off the way Prometheus did with its ridiculous screenplay. Given that Total Recall had so many writers (usually a bad sign), that's a decent point to make.I was a bit annoyed to find out that this cost $200 million to make, before I saw it. I think for that kind of change we can come up with an original idea. That being said, they did spend the money and you can definitely see it in the design. I felt that the world they created looked great. I'm the type of guy to let things slide just to appreciate the environment. Also they did, as a matter of observed fact, address the implications of not knowing who we are, on a philosophical level, just not the way other films do, films such as Blade Runner, the likes of which are more unlikely to be made today due to the Hollywood machine grabbing dollars from people with ever-decreasing attention spans. Perhaps my review is overly based on just how unhappy I was with Prometheus and this being the only other major sci-fi film this summer to get into, I was able to enjoy it. If this review seems generous, well, I'm a film student looking for some good karma down the road. Thanks for reading.",Total Recall

600,rlilewi,Absolute Garbage,2,25 November 2012,"When someone asked me to watch this film with them my exact words were; ""what is wrong with the original""? In my opinion this movie is total garbage, the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because some of the visuals were pretty good; and by that I mean the background scenes not the two female actors.I had very little knowledge of who was in the film apart from it having Colin Farrell so it put a smile on my face when part way through the movie I realized that BOTH Beckinsale AND Biel were in it and I was thinking; even if this sucks at least there are two hot babes in it. Unfortunately I can only remember ONE good oggle moment where you get to see Beckinsale's bum in her underwear but beyond that, nothing. The clothes each of them wear are boring; don't expect to see any close ups of Beckinsale in a skin tight latex catsuit (Underworld) or the jiggling boobs of Biel from Texas chainsaw massacre.The storyline was close to non existent and the characters had wafer thin development. They keep throwing characters at you with no background information or fleshed out character interaction to find out who they are or what drives them... nothing. There is a point in this film where the main character has to make a ""pain staking"" decision about which out of 2 characters he is going to shoot. Well to be honest I just couldn't care less and you're not exactly left shocked when you see which one he picks.The main ""plot"" if you can even call it that was so pathetic and the main bad guy Cohaagen so moronic that I couldn't help but laugh out loud at this drivel.There are so many throwbacks to the original film scattered throughout but all that served to do was keep reminding me how good the original was and how AWFUL this one is.Finally we have the action, which given that it's supposed to be an action film should be amazing right? Wrong! The film seems to follow the trend of all recent ""action"" films with this really annoying snappy camera darting about all over the place when in a fist fight so I can't actually see what the hell is happening, which I guess is the whole point since nothing is going on. Do you remember the original fights with Arnie and the clear and focused camera angles of people getting their neck snapped/arms torn off? Well I'm of the generation that does remember the awesome action films and this garbage is a DISGRACE!!! I am so sick of these stupid close combat fights with the stupid snappy camera.The gun fights involve robots and the shooting of organic targets results in next to no blood or gore, all very clinical but at the same time extremely boring and it totally disconnects the viewer from the brutality of killing. In the original I remember being very shocked when that innocent bystander was used as a human shield, his body being torn to shreds by the bullets and then tossed away like nothing. Again they threw back to the original on that point where ""the bad girl"" shoots a couple of civilians in a transport terminal but there is no blood and no attention paid to it and since there is no character development I have no idea why she is so ruthless so it ends up just being stupid and pointless.So to sum this film up it has very few decent totty/oggling opportunities, the storyline and characters are pathetic and the action is clinical, extremely boring and has the stupid snappy camera.

The problem with remakes are that they are going to be judged against their predecessor; which while no Best-Picture winner was a campy fun ride that lives in the section of my brain labeled ""fond memories"".From the opening scene, I was immediately put off by the crazy lens flares coming out of no where on screen. It was like the special effects team and the director were in a competition with J.J. Abrams to see who could have more ridiculous lens flares. They were in complete contrast to light scenes on screen and if they were intended to create a sense of disorientation and make one question what is real, they failed to do that.At one point they were pulsating on screen and flashing and took me entirely out of any sense of enjoyment i was getting from a ""check your brain at the door"" action flick. The other major oversight my wife pointed out to me as we were chuckling at the ridiculousness of it was that while they were in the outlands where it is supposedly poisonous to breath the air and they enter an air locked building, they immediately hand their masks over to someone inside the door. If a small crack in an old stained glass window is the difference between life and death, you keep that thing at your side. Then, all of a sudden, the bad guys repel in from the ceiling and smash in through the windows... oh guess what? no problem breathing the air!?!?! ugh.

603,rtgardner7,He should have gotten a lobotomy!,1,29 December 2012,"OK 1st off the original is one of my favorite movies of all time. Having said that I did go in with an open mind on this one since the previews obviously made it look like it would be more action and CGI based. Unfortunately I didn't expect for the plot to be so thin it's disturbing. This was yet another movie that bombards you with CGI scenes for what seems like the sake of doing it. The whole movie Colin is running and jumping on CGI objects over and over. It's 2 hours of just running from the bad guys (which is basically Lori), and as others have said, storm troopers and i-robots. The only reason I kind of understood this movie is because I saw the original. If it hadn't been for that this would've been a very confusing movie because everything was rushed to get explained. There was NO character development whatsoever. The guy went in rekall and instantly was escorted to the chair with a simple 45 second dialogue of what rekall was and how it worked. I mean he didn't even get a price or anything. Then they see he's a spy and everyone dies. From that point on it becomes the Running Man. No explanation of how he sided with the rebels except for ""he met a girl"". I mean seriously???? The original at least made you care about the people some. You also felt like there was a group that was deeply oppressed in the original. In this one the oppressed people go about living good middle class lives in what looks like china or Tokyo (that's in Australia somehow). By the time they get word they are about to get attacked it's stopped before it even happens so what was the fuss about?Finally I have to say this because I loved the original. Taking mars out of the movie was a very bad choice when trying to keep certain elements in. I mean a woman with 3 boobs just happens to be in Australia? Why??? And since there were no mutants there was no Quatto. The leader of the resistance was in the movie all of 3 minutes before he died. Why would you even care about him???

The chosen story line was very confusing and unclear and I was continually waiting for something interesting to happen. At least the original version was filmed in good lighting, clear to watch with a real futuristic, extra-planetary sci-fi tone to it. This remade rubbish looked like 'storm trooper meets blade runner' but with even more rain. If you must do remakes instead of using imagination to create something new, then at least do a good job of it. This version grossed millions at box office but I bet few will want to see it twice.

The special effects look pretty dated now but the storyline itself actually managed to capture my imagination. The thought that man might one day inhabit mars and that they might discover evidence of aliens. Everything is entirely plausible, from the greedy corporation to the idea of implanting memories and the whole plot, however far fetched, works.What this new version does is to take out the only point .. namely the alien presence on mars. To limit the plot to earth and some implausible core-transit train just mystified me. Where was the motivation for any of the characters to do what they do? I found the film utterly devoid of any purpose, I forced myself to watch every excruciating second to the end, and believe me it was hard work. The special effects are impressive, The acting is acceptable and the fight/chase sequences are well done. But a film without a plot is pointless and this is the main flaw in this version. There are a few subtle references to the original film but all that does is remind you how good the first one was! Save your money and get your nails done instead, or better still... redecorate your bedroom and lie on your bed and literally watch the paint dry. You will be more entertained than watching this drivel.Perhaps I'm being unfair, but I don't think so. In the original you had Sharon stone as the (fake) wife of our hero Arnie... who recovers his memory during his total recall procedure in which he had requested an implant to be a spy. it turns out his fantasy was true already and he had his original memory erased... intrigue! - his wife goes postal and he learns about his previous life... on Mars... more intrigue... he travels to mars and discovers a planet dictated by a greedy corporation that rations air to the inhabitants, some of whom have mutated... more intrigue... finally we discover that an alien artifact had been discovered, a machine, that can change the atmosphere of mars and provide free air for all... the penny drops, thats why the greedy corporation went to all those extremes to protect the secret. Arnie activates the machine and saves mars...the new film has no mars, no aliens, no artifacts... (it bizarrely has a 3-breasted woman but fails to explain why a woman would have 3 breasts in the first place)... we just two habitable areas of earth, England and Australia, and some no-mans-land in between due to chemical warfare. The entire film seems to revolve around the single train line that connects england to Australia via a super fast tube that goes straight through the earths core (even less plausible than finding alien artifacts on mars!). The train travels at supersonic speeds yet at one point our new hero manages to ride on the outside ... notwithstanding the incredible pressures, but he doesn't seem in the bit put off by the supersonic speed at which the train travels.I'm staggered that this film got the funding to be made to be honest, I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of people that paid to see this at the cinema would have done so on the sole basis of seeing the first Arnie film of the same name... but that I'm afraid, is about the only similarity between the two.",Total Recall

Did Houser ask Harry why he had a vest on in the housing lobby scene? Did the bank ask for a signature instead of the eye recognition? Was there an older Obama on the currency next to the stack Qaid took from the box? There were two scenes with the elevator fight and one did not have the synthetic arm on the floor? Not sure if I was seeing the same movie or imagining things!!?? I did like the digital graphics although as an architect the structures were truly hard to believe with the mass of materials hanging in thin air, but there were lots of people and structures but no visible means of feeding the masses!",Total Recall
613,embracefanm,Worst film I've seen in a long time,1,26 October 2013,"Warning - may contain spoilers (or not as the film is pretty predictable)Now I always knew when watching a remake of such an awesome film there was the danger I would be underwhelmed, but I never thought I would be bored or frustrated!For those of you, like me, who are pure generation X and were expecting an up to date homage of Arnie's masterpiece, you will be gravely disappointed. Not only does this film fail to follow what was a genius storyline, but it changes too much of what was good.Remember the classic 'airport' scene....'two weeks'....well the woman's head is just a head, and Quaid is the guy behind her. I get you may be trying to surprise, but you've taken out the most iconic scene.And why combine Ironside's character with Quaid's wife to create a woman not in the least intimidating or scary but just plain annoying??And where are the martians? Kuato? The fight to provide an atmosphere for Mars? Instead it's about saving 'The Colony' from being invaded, which let's face it - it's pretty crap there anyway so maybe invasion would be better?At least you kept the woman with three breasts - but why??? you're not on Mars!! There are no mutants?? So what's the point? And what about the taxi driver with ever changing number of children, the Johnny Cab, the nasal extraction of the homing device and wet tea towel over the head? What went wrong here? You had some hot chicks, some famous actors and modern technology, you should at least have been able to come up with something watchable!! I guess the only consolation is that I know there won't be a sequel (please no).And one final thought - hover cars....leave it to BTTF2....",Total Recall
614,Ahmed-Anssaien,This remake is epic! It's not even worth calling a remake!,10,21 February 2014,"This one is much better than the old one. I barely finished the old one. Just because it's old doesn't mean it's better. People must be blind. I got a message for those who think that every old garbage is priceless. ""Scr*w)))))))) you))))))))))"" *Arnie's voice*. Colin Farrel is an epic actor, and sometimes the remake beats the original. Anyone who gets butt-hurt about it, you must be wearing those glasses that look like the bottom of a glass. Pun intended. If I care about users' critics, I'll never be able to enjoy watching a single movie. Yeah, it's true that criticizing builds a good personality, but criticizing everything like a fanatic ignorant granny makes you look more like an overly negative person. Then again, if you think this remake is bad, you better join Twilight team.",Total Recall
615,James_Flops,"action packed, beautiful to the eye yet still predictable and cringe worthy",5,14 January 2014,"a movie full of imaginative graphics and filming techniques but with poor accents and floored cast it was inevitable for the loss in interest through the movie .Bill Nighy and Collin Farrell two of the main character are them selves outstanding actors who have been forced out of there comfort zone too act in a strange environment , which is pleasant to the eye as an end product. Some of the fight scene are also questionable you can see they are clearly not hitting each other.all this being said i was attracted to watch it for a second time, I wanted amazing and beautiful CGI which this movie has an abundance of this being said Star Trek : Into Darkness is far more beautiful, better written and has better actors and in general a better movie.In conclusion Total Recall is a eye dazing jaw dropping movie which intrigues the eye but with poor writing and some poor actor choices and accents makes the movie die near the end of the movie",Total Recall
616,StaceySellers33,Loved it!,10,28 July 2014,"I absolutely loved this film! I may not have seen the original and therefore cannot compare it but it is brilliant. The characters are brought to life by wonderful actors and although for some people it may be difficult to follow, I caught on straight away.I won't give away any spoilers but it truly is rather great. The ending is spectacular and suspense is built wonderfully. Action packed and sensitive also, this film I would recommend to anyone.I went to the cinemas to see this, and as a huge Colin Farrell fan I found no disappointment. Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel are also favourite actresses of mine and bringing them all together made me most happy. I loved the plot and how it is so compelling and intriguing. Could watch over ad over and love it every time. Never get bored. If fact, I have watched it a further 3 times after seeing it at cinemas and it still delights me the same. From me to you, this is a great film, you must see it!",Total Recall
617,kostie,Stellar waste of what should have been a fantastic cast.,4,11 August 2012,"When I first heard about this remake I was very afraid that it would butcher the memory of a cheesy but highly enjoyable classic. Then I saw a trailer that made it look like it might actually be alright.... I should have trusted my first gut instinct.There was a complete lack of character development, and I thought ""The Fall"" was completely ludicrous, even as a Macguffin device. There was no real development of the plight of the Australians, and Cohaagen's plot was cartoonishly evil and had no real benefit to him that I could figure. Pro tip: if you get an amazing actor like Bryan Cranston to star in your movie you should probably try and take advantage of his range, rather than just turn him into a cartoonishly evil cookie cutter villain. In TR'90 the oppression of the Mutants at least served a purpose, and there was a challenge to finding Kuato instead of 12's direction of simply *SPOILER* hopping a train to see Matthias. */SPOILER*The original had enough heart to make you care whether the character's succeeded, and actually had you questioning whether it was all in Arnie's head at the end. TR'12 was pretty and action packed, but laughable at it's best and a boring trek with no direction at it's worst. I've seen far better from every member of what should have been a stellar cast. It's pretty bad when you can look at an Arnie version of a film as the one that was several orders of magnitude ""deeper."" I gave TR'12 a 4/10 and wish I could un-see it.",Total Recall
618,averystorm-54196,Decent Remake,7,18 June 2015,"I went into this with fairly low expectations, and certainly not looking to compare every second of the film to the original. However, it's inevitable that certain comparisons are going to be made, and this movie does fall short when those comparisons are made. Colin Farrell may be a better actor than Arnold, but he's definitely not a better action star. That's the movie's biggest shortcoming. The lead character is just not that good. He's a modern mopey action hero, with a boring life, and even more boring personal problems. In an escapist action movie, I don't want to see me as the lead character. I want to see someone who I want to be.Now with that out of the way, I can move on to the more positive aspects of the film. In an action movie, you need good action, and that is where this movie excels. Sure, it's not the blood soaked original, but it has it's own charm. You pretty much get a dose of everything in this, from hand-to-hand fights, on foot chases, gun fights, and one of the better car chases I've seen in recent memory. All handled really well, and taking place within imaginative set-pieces, that are a feast for the eyes. The film's look was clearly inspired by Blade Runner, and as un-imaginative as that might seem, it works well.The absolute best part of this movie is the two female leads. Seriously, they should've just scrapped Ferrell, tweaked the script, and let Biel take the reigns. Beckinsale and Biel absolutely own this movie, and whenever they are on screen together, the movie is always better for it. Unfortunately, they're basically feuding over Mr. Everyman in every scene, and you can't help but wonder how much better the movie would be without that distraction.Another problem I had near the end of the film, was Beckinsale's character being pushed to the background, for everyone's favorite meth dealer, Walter White. Look, I like Cranston, but he's not Daniel Day Lewis. He's not fit for every role out there, and this is a shining example of that. He plays the most bland villain, in a movie that didn't need another big baddie. He's basically in the movie because he's Bryan Cranston and he's riding the wave of Breaking Bad. He has no screen presence in this, no charisma, and is just shoehorned in as the supervillain/end boss, so they could put his name on the ads.As for the story, well it's essentially the original with a few tweaks. Nothing worth going in-depth about. The ending isn't nearly as effective as it was in the original, but that's the only real negative thing I can think of. All in all, it mostly works.Overall, I think the movie has been a little harshly criticized for not being the original. It has it's flaws for sure, but you could do a lot worse in the genre. Check it out.",Total Recall
619,brotherbilalbrown,"Awful, predictable, and bland.",1,20 February 2018,"The script for this fit so many stereotypes, it was unbelievably poor. It was so predictable and follows the usual storyline of so many other similar movies, it feels like a high school kid wrote the script. There are no twists, no plots, just action, cgi, and terrible acting. If you are expecting it to be like the original, then don't, this is a totally different movie. Don't waste your time on this, they could have made it so much better but unfortunately it is a razzie.",Total Recall

621,nbennett-50055,Total Stinker,2,26 October 2018,"A sad sad remake. Should have been called Total Frankenstein since it uses chopped up pieces of the original and has built them into a monster.

622,jaycesixx,No where near as good as the original.,3,3 March 2021,"I can sum this up in 1 word. BORING. It was so hard to stay interested in the story. The characters were unlikable, dull and uninteresting. It was like watching a corny soap opera with bad acting.Only thing in this movie that was quality was the cgi although some of the camera work on the action scenes was annoying. The whole camera weaving from one direction to the next made some of the action scenes hard to follow. I'm not completely sure what the story is, it was too hard to stay focused. Dialog was dull. It came across as a low budget remake with the exception of the CGI and special effects. Ever seen a movie where you had no idea who the actors were but you watched it anyway and it just felt cheap? That's this movie. It had that ""Feel"" to it. I couldn't wait for it to end. The original was far better. Better script, better acting, better dialog, better everything. If this is the ""new"" style to action movies, I think I will stick to the action movies of yesterday. I think if you're under 30 you may like this film. If you're over 30 you may not.",Total Recall
623,cjb476,Well this was a disappointment,2,3 September 2019,"Sure the action is good and so is the CGI, but seriously, where's Mars? That was the whole premise of the Schwarzeneggar spectacle, and you ruined it! An elevator which runs through the Earth's core? A chemical war which decimated the planet except for Australia and a part of London...how does that work? You can take a subway train from Big Ben to Piccadilly and that takes you from paradise to a no-man's zone, but the rest of the planet is done? Who wrote the science for this?? Not just that, Arnie himself could walk through the plot holes. Nothing against Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsdale, Jessica Biel or Bryan Cranston, they all do fair jobs, but this one was awful.",Total Recall
624,errrv,"Good action flick, story line missing.",5,9 December 2018,"Pretty much like watching a video game. The original plot line from the Piers Anthony book was barely in the first movie. In the book it was very present with a great story about the ancient civilization on mars and the chamber set up to revitalize the planet back to its former glory. Of course you get none of this with this latest version of the movie. Also gone are all the memorable Arnold one-liners and funny sequences. Having Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Beil doesn't hurt (thus the 5 stars). A story line would help this endless chase scene along, and a great story has been in the background the entire time.",Total Recall
