0,nogodnomasters,Who put the worms in the cookie jar?,8,19 July 2021,"Finn Wheeler (Sam Richardson) is the new park rangers in the small town of Beaverfield, Vermont. WE are introduced to the town's folks who are all quirky. Finn is led around by Cecily (Milana Vayntrub) who looks like she still has on her AT&T shirt. She works for the Post Office. The Midland Gas Company wants to put a pipeline through town which has them at odds. (Real Vermonters would not allow a pipeline.) Snow drifts block the roads and it appears the town has a werewolf as we gather everyone in one room in this whodunit.I loved the Mr. Rogers quote opening with ominous music. The lyrics of the country song soundtrack were entertaining.Guide: F-word, no sex or nudity.",Werewolves Within
1,BA_Harrison,Werewolves without.,3,17 October 2021,"In the remote mountain community of Beaverfield, a werewolf is at work, targeting the locals. With the power out, and no way to get help, the townsfolk gather at the local inn, unsure whether one of them is the savage beast in human form.Despite the plurality of the title, Werewolves Within features just one werewolf, and it only makes an appearance at the very end of the film. It also looks like Michael J. Fox in TeenWolf, only angrier. As far as lycanthrope action goes, the movie is a major let-down.Adapted from a video game I have never heard of, the film is a horror comedy with the emphasis on comedy, which is fine by me in principle, except that the comedy is also a big disappointment: the characters are an oddball collection, but nothing that they do or say is actually funny.So that's NOT scary and NOT funny.3/10.",Werewolves Within
2,paul_haakonsen,Definitely a different approach to the werewolf genre...,6,3 August 2021,"When I sat down to watch ""Werewolves Within"", I must admit that I hadn't even heard about the movie, nor seen a trailer or anything, so I wasn't really sure what I was in for here. Yeah, of course the title does sell the concept of this being a werewolf movie, but aside from that, then I only knew this was a horror comedy.So with that clean slate, I sat down to watch the movie, so writer Mishna Wolff - and boy what a coincidence with that surname and the concept of movie, huh? - had every opportunity to win me over.And I will admit that the movie was actually quite interesting. Sure, the werewolf aspect of the movie was there, but there wasn't a whole lot of actual showcasing the lycanthrope itself in the movie. So if you sit down to watch it for that, which I had hoped it would be, then the movie might be a bit disappointing for you.The storyline was interesting, as it managed to combine a handful of different elements and genres in a rather fulfilling and entertaining manner. Director
Josh Ruben definitely managed to put the script and storyline to life on the screen in a pleasing way.""Werewolves Within"" is actually a who did it murder mystery with a supernatural twist to it. So yeah, this wasn't exactly your average werewolf creature feature.It should be said that the acting in the movie is rather good. Although I was not overly familiar with actor
Sam Richardson, then I will say that he definitely was well-cast for this movie.My rating of ""Werewolves Within"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",Werewolves Within

Yes you people that have to have vulgarity, nudity, sex, throwing up, farting, shitting, gross humor THIS isnt for you, this is good old fashioned funny ass acting a d writing. I'm not going to bother telling you all the little pieces of humor that add up to a phenomenal comedy cause if you give this anything under an 8 you wont get it anyway. For the rest that WANT TO LAUGH and not need the garbage humor stuff. Here you go!! What a phenomenal cast and crew thank you for the laughs WE NEEDED IT!!",Werewolves Within
5,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid Blend of Murder Mystery with Potential Creature and Comedy,8,13 July 2021,"This was a movie that I popped up on my radar by going to the Gateway Film Center. Jaime was intrigued to check this one out as it looked funny. Horror/comedies can be hit or miss for me, but this did catch my interest to see. I knew that it would be a murder mystery with a potential monster in from the title. It also has Milana Vayntrub, Lilly from the AT&T commercials, and I'm a fan of her. The synopsis is basic that it is a feature adaptation of the video game where werewolves attack a small town.We start this off with a man outside by a tree. He is texting someone and it appears he is thinking of cheating on his wife as he takes off his wedding ring. We will learn later that his name is Dave Sherman (Patrick M. Walsh). Something attacks him though and pulls him into the nearby woods. We are seeing that this happened right outside of his house.It then shifts over to Finn Wheeler (Sam Richardson). He is a park ranger that is reporting to his next assignment. It is a small town and out in the middle of nowhere, being in the New England area. Finn calls Charlotte (Anni Krueger), but she doesn't answer. He leaves her an awkward voicemail. What we pick up is that he isn't assertive and that she might not be into him anymore.Arriving in town, Finn heads to the local inn where he will be staying. It is run by Jeanine Sherman (Catherine Curtin) and she's in a debate with Sam Parker (Wayne Duvall). He's trying to convince her to sell as he works for an oil company and they want the land. She disagrees and is happy to see Finn arrive to break up the conversation. He is taken up to his room.Also staying at this inn is Cecily Moore (Vayntrub). She is the local mail carrier and she informs him that he has an item. It is sent from a Dr. Ellis (Rebecca Henderson) that is also staying at the inn. Finn asks if Cecily will take him to interview the man the accusations in the letter are aimed at and she agrees. This gives us a chance to get to know them as they get to know each other, along with the other residents of the town.To run through them, there is a rough couple that runs the local auto repair garage of Marcus (George Basil) and his girlfriend of Gwen (Sarah Burns). They are a bit raunchy. There is a conservative couple of Pete (Michael Chernus) and Trisha Anderton (Michaela Watkins) along with their dog of Cha-Chi (Ritz). All four of these people want to sell to Parker. Pete does have an issue with keeping his hands to himself and makes Cecily uncomfortable. Also in town are Joaquim (Harvey Guillén) and his husband of Devon Wolfson (Cheyenne Jackson). They struck it big in the tech field and are rich. They're against selling.Cecily leads Finn to the path to the final resident we meet, Emerson (Glenn Fleshler). He's a hunter and trapper who doesn't like outsiders. He threatens Finn which scares him off. Returning to Cecily, the two go back into town to get some food. They have natural chemistry that gets ruined with a phone call. This causes her to go cold toward him.Everything here in town changes that night. There is a bad snowstorm we keep hearing about that hit. The power goes out and the road to town is blocked. All the back-up generators are sabotaged by something with large claws. Cha-Chi is killed by an animal. Trisha is quite upset and the entire town gathers at the inn. It is there that an even darker discovery is made.That is where I'm going to leave my recap for the movie. Where I want to start is that I didn't realize this was based off of a video game. When I saw Ubisoft in the opening credits, I knew they did the Assassin's Creed games. With a bit of research, it does appear that this is a horror comedy game that was made for VR. It is interesting and now I'm curious how much of the game is incorporated into this movie.Where I want to shift to first would be the setting. I really like that we are getting this small quaint town that has some deep seeded issues. Greed is showing and how it can tear people apart thanks to Parker. We have two sides of this argument here. Jeanine doesn't want to sell as she knows nothing different from her life here. Dr. Ellis is against the pipeline due to nature purposes. There is also Joaquim and Devon who are already rich. They moved to the town for its beauty and want to preserve why they moved there. This is pitting them against Marcus, Gwen, Pete and Trisha who really could use the money for different reasons. I can see both sides of the argument and would be a tough choice. I'm against oil companies destroying nature, but if given the check it is hard to decline.This also helps with isolation. They are stranded here due to the storm and that already builds tension there. Taking it farther, everyone aside from one character ends up in one large house. This is where the movie then shifts to be a murder mystery. Evidence points to something that Dr. Ellis cannot explain and werewolf becomes the thought. What I like is that not everyone just believes it. We get a taste of The Beast Must Die as well as adding a bit of Agatha Christie here as people are picked off. This all adds tension as I was saying.What I think works in this movie's favor is that we don't know if there is a werewolf or not until the reveal. We know the initial attack on Dave. What I find interesting is that the lore of the werewolf started in I believe Germany due to them not believing that someone could brutally attack someone, so it had to be done by a person who shifted into a beast. Despite evidence pointing to it, there could be a logical explanation and that one of them isn't necessarily a monster in the literal sense. I'll also be honest, I didn't figure out who was behind all of this until the reveal. I also did get sucked into the story where I just went along for the ride. Something else I want to incorporate back in is the fact that the issues I stated above come back into play as tensions boil over for the character and the stress mounts.Then the last part of the story I want to go into would be the comedy. That is really the first genre here. That isn't to say there aren't horror elements or that they aren't well done. Cecily steals the show for me. Her along with some of the other characters I think handle the 'woke' jokes extremely well. It is to the point where I think they're poking fun at them while also being respectful. There are also poking fun at the other side of the spectrum as well. I will say that the comedy in this movie worked for me and Jaime afterwards said it felt a lot like Knives Out, if that movie went more into horror. I agree there.To move away from the story now, acting is the next part I want to go over. Richardson does well as Finn. I really like that in the beginning he's indecisive and that was the cause of his last relationship falling apart. He does take command here and we see some real character growth to where he ends up. My favorite part of the movie though would be Vayntrub. Her delivery of jokes is on point. She is also quite attractive which doesn't hurt. It is interesting that most of the movie she is wearing the bulky mail carrier outfit and there is only really one sequence where she isn't which is good. Aside from that, I think the rest of the cast are distinct in their characters and each adds their own level of comedy that worked together. This movie had me legit laughing if I'm going to be honest. I'm glad I got to see it with a crowd.Then I should go to the effects. This movie is a bit light in this category, but it also isn't that type of movie. There is some blood and some scenes where characters are killed. They all looked good as well. I'm assuming this is a mix of practical and CGI. What we get at the climax was also solid. I did want to give credit here to the cinematography. The movie is well shot to hide things with camera angles. The framing was also well done.The last thing I want to go into would be the soundtrack. What I really enjoyed was the 90's music that is played in the bar while Finn and Cecily are hanging out. They come back to this later which I liked. Aside from that, I'd say the rest of the soundtrack fit for what was needed and the sound design worked as well.So then in conclusion here, this is fun comedy/horror movie. I do mean in that order as well. I think that the concept is interesting and how the story plays out worked for me. The acting really helps to drive this movie and the effects that go with it work as well. I also think that the setting adds to the tension, especially when stress mounts and the characters start to panic. I just also just say that the soundtrack and design of the movie worked in its favor. This is a good movie to me. This is one that I would recommend to horror and non-horror fans.",Werewolves Within
6,Sergiodave,Murder on the Werewolf express,6,21 August 2021,"Watched this knowing nothing about it's video game origins. If Agatha Christie did a Comedy horror novel, I'd imagine it would have been something like this. Some people have complained about the over-acting, guess what, that is deliberate, and for me adds to the humour. Particularly enjoyed Sam Richardson, a bit like Kevin Hart, except larger, funnier and far more talented. Only reason did not give 7 stars is the ending seemed rushed, as they they'd run out of ideas. Definitely give this a watch.",Werewolves Within
7,gedikreverdi,It's an average comedy without a sprinkle of horror,4,17 July 2021,"The plot twist at the end was pretty surprising and everyone had a motive to be the killer or the werewolf and that should have kept the suspense alive but for me it didn't work. I just couldn't get into it. The characters seemed interesting at first: the ranger, the mail person Cecil, the mansion owner Jeanine, the outcast flint and the same sex couple and the rednecks and even the dog owner and his husband but they became all boring after a while. After finding out the mansion owner's husband had been killed like the dog of a woman, all the people took refuge in the mansion hotel for one night and they all of a sudden wanted to leave after the dog owner's husband was shot and one of his hand was eaten and the scientist woman committed suicide. It could have been a great comedy horror if they kept staying at that mansion while all roads were blocked because of snowstorm. But they all left for their houses. They were killed almost all of them off camera without any gore and blood at all. And Cecilia who was falling in love with the new ranger guy turned out to be a werewolf. He thought he killed her but she woke up and attacked flint the outcast and him but the mansion owner killed him finally. It felt like the film avoided being scary on purpose despite its huge potential and yet it's said to be a horror comedy. It's an average comedy film involving a werewolf. I gave it a 4 because it's also a whodunnit and I didn't see it coming.",Werewolves Within
8,meddlecore,Werewolves Within...Only...Without Werewolves...,3,6 October 2021,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, going into a film that was adapted from a video game...but I can't help but be disappointed by this half assed horror comedy.If you watch sitcoms...the cast of Werewolves Within might draw you in...as it features Veep's. Sam Richardson, Robot Chicken's. Milana Vayntrub, What We Do In The Shadows' Harvey Guillén, and a host of other recognizable faces.However, the whole story is lacking complexity, any dedication to special effects...and, well...werewolves.And on top of this...the plot is way too obvious.They have incorporated a whole mystery component into the film...but that is a pointless endeavour when you can tell who the werewolf is right from the get-go.It could have been salvaged with some creative kills and decent special effects...but they seem to have negotiated their way around using such things, for some reason.The climax of the whole film is a really bad transformation scene right near the end of the film.But when this is vastly overshadowed by an equivalent scene from a film from 1981...you know you've missed the mark.I mean...I've seen worse films for sure...even worse werewolf-oriented films (Werewolves On Wheels, anyone?!)...but this is pretty close to bottom of the barrel.The kind of lameness you'd expect from a Netflix horror.3.5 out of 10.",Werewolves Within
9,Movi3DO,Funny and chaotic,7,23 August 2021,"A horror comedy where neighbors in a small town were terrorized by werewolves.Let's put a disclaimer that this movie is chaotic. People were constantly screaming and panicking because first, they are clearly nuts, and second, they were stuck in a room in a who-done-it situation. The pacing was very fast, and there were hardly any slow moments. This and the craziness of the characters made the movie pretty funny and entertaining. The jokes were surface-level and snappy.As a horror, many of the scenes were pretty intense. There was nothing new, and a lot of jump scares. I got annoyed at some, but overall I wasn't too bothered. The atmosphere of the movie felt like a fun horror to watch on Christmas or Halloween.Among all the actors, Milana Vayntrub probably stood out the most. She was being her usual funny AT&T girl and her character's relationship with the main guy was entertaining.Overall, a fun and chaotic horror. 7/10.",Werewolves Within
10,TheTruthofItIs,Campy horror-com,7,12 August 2021,"""Werewolves Within"" is a good date-night movie, it's a campy horror-comedy that throws off ""Northern Exposure"" vibes. You'll enjoy Kenan Thompson look-alike Sam Richardson as the new park ranger in town. (Sam also played comic-relief in Amazon's recently released ""The Tomorrow War"".) And of course there's AT&T's ""Lily"" Milana Vayntrub who plays the cute ditz but surprises us in the movie's twist ending. It's a low-budget production but it moves along at a good pace and the ending is as campy as the rest, so just enjoy a lighthearted horror-com.",Werewolves Within
11,cdcrb,falls short.,6,27 June 2021,"A 6 rating may be a little on the high side, but it's covid time. You get a break. Anyway, a group of quirky folks are stranded in an old mansion, dealing with the threat of a werewolf among them. As i watched, i was wondering what to have for supper. Never a good sign. But actually, things improved a little as the movie went along, until, like all horror films, it fell completely apart in the last reel. I actually smiled a couple of times. Sam richardson, the lead, was pretty good.",Werewolves Within
12,trinaboice,Dark comedy with some insightful moments,8,25 June 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
The horror comedy is based on a video game Werewolves Within - PlayStation VR that I've never seen or played, so I had absolutely no expectations. It's directed by Josh Ruben and will make you laugh and cringe at the same time.The director stated, ""I grew up near the same small town where we shot Werewolves Within. As a kid, I'd freak myself out, making up monster stories, running through the woods, pretending I was Chief Brody, fighting creatures in the brush (I LOVED Jaws - hell, I loved horror). That hometown experience, where neighbors knew your business (whether you liked it or not) is so much of what makes Werewolves so personal. But, as much as I love horror movies, nothing scares me more than people. And as much as this movie is an homage to my love for Hot Fuzz, the Coen Brothers, and Arachnophobia, it's also about the monster in all of us.""Here's the story synopsis: After a proposed pipeline creates divisions within the small town of Beaverfield, and a snowstorm traps its residents together inside the local inn, newly arrived forest ranger FINN (Sam Richardson) and postal worker CECILY (Milana Vayntrub) must try to keep the peace and uncover the truth behind a mysterious creature that has begun terrorizing the community.THINGS I LIKED:
The first thing you see is a lovely quote by Mr. Rogers with super creepy music, letting you know this film is going to be different with a unique sense of humor.There's a Papillon dog in the movie! I used to have a black and white Papillon!All of the characters are clearly defined and hilarious. The entire cast did an excellent job and features Sam Richardson from Veep: Season 4.The cast also includes Milana Vayntrub, who made me laugh many times. Did you know she was born in Uzbekistan? She began her career making YouTube videos with over 11 million views! She then turned her content into an MTV pilot. You go, Girl!The rest of the small ensemble includes George Basil, Sarah Burns, Michael Chernus, Catherine Curtin, Wayne Duvall (who appears in 3 movies this year alone!), Harvey Guillen, Rebecca Henderson, Cheyenne Jackson (whose character's last name is Wolfson), Michaela Watkins, Glen Fleshler, Patrick M. Walsh, and Anni Krueger.Some of the dialogue is super funny and even insightful.The musical score of Werewolves Within is actually really nice and funny at times.It's fun to watch the characters try to figure out what's going on and who might be the werewolf.The mystery and humor will provide sufficient excuse for a second viewing for a lot of audiences.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
There's a lot of forced exposition at the end to try to explain everything so you don't see the plot holes in the story.Some viewers might be offended by the political humor and cliched characters.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Profanity, lots of F-bombs, and crude gestures
Images of dead, bloodied bodies
Someone's hand gets shot off
Guns and knives
Homosexual couple
Talk of infidelity
Violence.You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",Werewolves Within

14,destroyerwod,More a murder mystery movie than anything,6,25 September 2021,"Sixth movie of Halloween season for me. After slasher, vampires, ghosts and others, was time to introduce werewolves... Well lets just say despite the title this movie does not have a lot of werewolves in it. Ill keep this spoiler free but this is much more a murder mystery movie than a werewolves movie.I realize it was based on a game as i saw the Ubisoft logo but its a VR game and i don't have one, so never played it. Overall i think its fine... there is nothing cringeworthy or bad about this movie, but there is not a lot of great either. I would say the 2 main leads were good and kept me interested and there is some good ideas but they are not really well executed in my opinion.Its just a decent movie. I do not regret having saw it, but wouldn't watch it again.",Werewolves Within
15,Draysan-Jennings,Nothing happens,5,6 July 2021,This movie kinda sucks. Pretty much nothing happens throughout the entirety of the film. After an hour in I was insanely bored and couldn't wait for it to end. 5 stars.,Werewolves Within
16,PedroPires90,Overacted (and overrated) pretentious quirkness,4,6 July 2021,"I really can't understand why everybody - especially critics - love this film. Josh Ruben didn't convince me with Scare Me and neither with this one. Yes, it's quirkness is the typical quirkness that the White liberals love (the new Wes Anderson's deserves 5 stars even before it was released, just wait for it!).Can people tell me 3 good jokes on this film? Yeah, it's woke, but that is not enough to be considered a good film. As an an horror film, it doesn't scare a soul. As a comedy, didn't make me laugh a single time. Some dialogue is good, but that's about it.Can't get all this love, this is not a Shaun of the Dead. But probably if I loved overacted pretentious quirkness and people screaming all the time, this would be for me.",Werewolves Within

23,leesimon-26357,This is my type of humor. Top to bottom hysterical,10,6 September 2021,"I don't quite understand the negative reviews, because as I was watching this movie, I already couldn't wait to see it again. There are so many jokes inside of jokes that I knew I was missing a lot of the humor on the first viewing. If you are into satirical humor, you will love the characters. Overall, the movie is very kind to its stupid characters. Everyone is treated well despite being dumb, or losers or other character flaws.The acting was very good. The story is well written, and every bit of dialogue is funny while moving the story forward. There is a corny 'love story' element that is played very intelligently. The violence is also played as comedy, and not to be frightening or gory.I understand that if this isn't your type of humor, the whole thing may be boring. If you saw and liked The Art of Self-Defense, you are likely to like this movie. This is one of the best movie's I've seen this year, and is definitely in my top 20 favorites of all time movies.",Werewolves Within
24,youngcollind,Horror comedy whodunit,7,11 October 2021,"The film effectively promotes itself as a lighthearted werewolf flick, but doesn't fully convey the ""And Then There Were None"" style murder mystery at it's core. The three styles do work well together, though they all come across slightly diluted. The comedy is dry but likeable, coming more from quirky character traits than slapstick punchlines. The horror is very minimal, nearly all coming from off screen implication. The whodunit is the central focus really, and for the most part effective, though some details and backstory border on tedious. If you can accept the three styles without asking too much of one, it's all the kind of light fun you can expect from a movie with ""werewolf"" in the title.",Werewolves Within
25,kenzibit,Mild suspense with unexpected outcomes,5,3 July 2021,Some parts of this movie reminds me of Knives Out a lot. Has some some few suspense moments with surprising outcomes. That alone will make you wanna watch the movie to the end. Plot wasn't soo gripping though with not too over the top characters but performances were on point and they did a good job of bringing this to the big screen. This can be a movie for some family time and have some good laughs otherwise not a movie too eager to see for the hardcore cinephiles.,Werewolves Within

Maybe 2 second of werewolf, literally zero attempt at comedy, and a handful of miserable attempt at jump scares. Don't watch it.The whole movie is just talking, talking and then more talking. The only thing decent about this film is the production and most of the actings.It's just such a waste of time.Ubisoft, maybe just stick to making CGI animations cause they are a million times better that this shtshow.I don't know what the hell they were thinking making this movie.",Werewolves Within

31,babyjaguar,"Ruben's ""Werewolves Within"" (Pipelining the Lycanthropic Curse with a Laugh Track)",6,24 June 2021,"This comedy (directed by Josh Ruben, written by Mishna Wolf based on a VR game) blends activism (environmental rights, ""pipeline"" reference), greed and the werewolf's curse. As a comedy, the film's dialogue can be seen as off-beat humor, fun for particular viewers (and for some not so funny).But what it importantly lacks (of what would have been a great opportunity to secure a horror film fan base) is comedic references to werewolf folklore and popular cultural representation (classic films like ""The Wolfman"").This could have serve great potential, could made this filmic production a following. A formula that has worked well, in the case of horror/comedy or ""hormedy"" references like Edgar Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead"" with the ""Zombie"" cinematic genre.The diverse cast was funny, featuring and spotlighting the comedic talents of Sam Richardson, George Basil and Catherine Curtin. Its production value and plot schematics worked well plus special effects were modestly good (earning it a second-look again).This film ain't no John Landis's ""American Werewolf in London"" or Joe Dante's ""The Howling"" (both 80s films incorporated humorous, but classic lycanthropy references) but this filmic production gets B-.",Werewolves Within

Story was also not bad. But just the thing I hate that it was really very booring specially in its first hour,because there were all talks and dialogues nothing else. No killing scenes were good enough to watch they weren't even shown sometimes and when they are then they look really awkward. So for fun it was kind of good but for action and horror it was really really weird. Also twist at the end was predictable but still good with some nonsense scenes in it.",Werewolves Within
37,BijeshNagesh,"Comical, verging on Campy, hinging on Sophisticated",8,4 July 2021,"Comical in a good way. Weird, quirky, awkward... All in a fun way. A strangely refreshing comedy that focuses on characters/people on a bizarrely literary level. The movie ran like an Agatha-Christie spoof, only American J. Each character felt distinct and brought their own 'misdirectional' flair to this whodunit. A dark and gritty 'serious' version of this story would have done it wonders as compared to the comedic angle they chose to go with. But it still came off as amusing and interesting regardless. The musical score kept the tension taut. The film keeps you guessing till the end, and remains true to the whodunit adage: 'it's rarely who you think it is'.",Werewolves Within

This is a straightforward, multigenerational, audience-pleasing comedy horror, all taking place in a foreboding , constantly snowy location. If you enjoyed Bill Murray and Adam Driver's ""The Dead Don't Die,"" then you will likely enjoy this scary walk in the woods.

53,blazesuncaster,WEREWOLVES OUT,7,14 July 2021,"To start off I really did enjoy myself watching this movie. It was actually better than I thought it was gonna be because I thought it was just gonna be another horror spoof. The good things I liked about this films were the characters, I think roughly every character was explored nicely but there were a lot of unanswered questions regarding the situations that took place. I found it really funny and laughed a lot throughout the movie, the delivery with the jokes were right on time too. Cinematography was great for this kind of a film. The writing was clever, which was really crucial to this story, but there were some problems but we will get to those in a little bit. Now for the not so good things, horribly rushed with a lot of unanswered questions. The whole movie we had a sort of ""Knives Out"" type of movie in which the characters argued about who was the killer. And they all agreed to stay inside for the night because it wasn't safe outside, and then they all up and leave a little later in the film. May be because of the fact that an attack took place in the house, so it wasn't safe inside either. The doctor that did the tests on the werewolf was very poorly written and poorly executed by the actor. Very 5th grade type assumptions as to what the creature is. The first act of the film and most of the second act were the best parts of this film, and then it derailed into a mangled up mess. I was kind of frustrated to find out that the werewolf was in fact Cecily, because the bond that Finn had with her was satisfying and they seem to have had a good relationship, and then Cecily showed absolute no emotion towards him after she turned which sort of made me mad, because she was just being a jerk to him about how rare a girl like that would come around for a guy like him. And I didn't really like that aspect. We forget about characters and then they just come back later in the film. Characters die and never brought up again. And then all the characters just die in like a span of 10 minutes which was just really dumb. But like I said, I really did enjoy watching this film, and could honestly watch it again. But I know where it's faults are and I am aware of them. But if I enjoy a movie, I try to block that stuff out and just enjoy the movie.",Werewolves Within

56,Shadowking1001,Quirky Non-Horror Movie,4,14 July 2021,"I am okay with the set of characters in this movie, as they were designed to be idiosyncratic and over the top. Milana Vayntrub is certainly adorable, but all actors did a decent job. The writing could have been better and the humor felt kinda flat and forced - so calling it a comedy is generous. There are enough twists and turns to keep your interest, once you acknowledge that this is neither a serious nor a horror movie. However, what I dislike is when movies start pushing political and social messages. Although it wasn't over the top as
many Hollywood movies tend to be these days, there were enough to roll eyes at. For that, I take 2 stars off, otherwise, this would be a forgettable-one-time-watch 6 star movie.",Werewolves Within
57,Shadowboy_25cm,"Refreshing, entertaining and well done horror-comedy",8,5 August 2021,"This is a horror-comedy that plays with genre conventions and breaks them satirically.As the title says, it is a werewolf movie, at the same time a whodunit with many potential murderers in one house, which should create tension. The tension is palpable, but more is up to the fun factor: I had a blast following the film, the quirky characters, and the constellations within the group in the house.I laughed often, which speaks to the good quality of the script, the chemistry of the actors, and the comedy portion of the film.The film is more of a scary than a horror film, but doesn't detract from the fun ""horror"".The direction is confident, the pace of the film is right, the actors are fun, especially the main character as a newcomer to the small town, with whom we as viewers can easily identify to know all the oddities and inhabitants with him.Overall, the film is very refreshing, very entertaining and very well done, with some surprises, false leads, twists and satisfying ending.Highly recommended for those who want to have an entertaining, fun and slightly scary horror evening.",Werewolves Within

60,hydralien-40230,A sarcastic treat,9,16 August 2021,"First thing first, the reviews saying that there's nothing happening are questionable at best - there's a non-stop plot development and character exposure. Every character is a gem, and the longer screen time they get the better - but it's also about building the suspense and the uncertainty; I think it was done brilliantly. Then on more general note, it's not exactly a comedy, nor is it exactly a horror movie. Yes, the characters are somewhat grotesque, but not unbelievably so - rather they're eccentric, just like if they would be were they inhabiting a distant little town for a while. And the horror part is more a thriller kind of scare, it's not really to frighten but to mount the pressure.Overall it's a great movie, well acted, shot and edited - and with a plot light enough to be entertaining but luckily not a plain comedy.",Werewolves Within

Comedy is definitely the creative minds behind 'werewolves within' forte, horror less so and this is evident in uninspired cgi gore effects and the perfunctory staged terror scenes. Horror comedies are never gonna be a perfectly balanced mix, 'Shaun of the dead' whilst centered for the most part on humour,still managed to lay on the carnage effectively.

It's very diverse...The bad: For a comedy horror, it's neither funny or scary... It's also not as witty as it thinks it is. During the 1 hour and 40 minutes or so run time I smiled a couple of times but didn't quite laugh. Nothing happens until the last 10 minutes and when it does, it's pretty inoffensive and meh.Based on the title and the cover art alone, I had hoped it would be closer to Dog Soldiers, what it offers is something closer an episode of SNL (the new stuff, not the old funny stuff).

It's watchable, but not novel, rarely clever, and largely forgettable. Being based on a videogame isn't an excuse since Clue (1985) was based on a board game (and it's still a popular cultural reference).Maybe if they had taken a cue from Shaun of the Dead (2004), Cursed (2005), or Tucker and Dale vs Evil (2010), they could have blended the genres better. The characters try to come across as quirky, but they're largely annoying or just plain irritating caricatures. As for the main leads, Sam Richardson and Milyana Vayntrub, they have even less chemistry together than Will Smith and Mary Elizabeth Winstead in Gemini Man (2019).

But these days culture has been usurped by social media culture and now we have movies reflecting that distorted image of our most obnoxious extremes instead of reflecting ourselves.Werewolves Within is all over the place. Nothing makes sense and it wants to have its cake and eat it too. People in this Vermont town are evil white people but also very nice. They are supposedly intolerant yet they have gender-neutral bathrooms. The government is pure and good. The freedom-loving people are bad. But the ""good guys"" are obnoxiously self-righteous and it's hard to tell if they're meant to come off that way or not.You can tell there was likely a decent script here that got touched by too many hands to make a good film. Its kindergarten message-be a good neighbor-barely makes it over the finish line.

Yes there is a werewolf but the delivery isn't a payoff. They tried to pull something but it just didn't work. The movie, itself, has the tone of ""who done it!?"" a la Murder on the Orient Express or Knives Out with a twist. The characters are good but it isn't enough to hold you to a lackluster movie, by the end you will feel burned out and hoping that it ends. I was crossing my fingers that it was going to be good, because I'm a fan of skin walkers/lycans/werewolves; specifically there isn't much werewolf based movies. Lately it is what's lacking.Before any one says anything. Yes, I know the writer and director intentions were, they wanted to make an all artsy movie but it didn't work for me. And that's because I enjoy few slow burners. They had a good idea, but I guess the filmmakers lost their way. I continue to cross my fingers in the hopes that there WILL be a good werewolf movie.

Or 2, what really happened is, there is nothing to show !!! IT's BAD ! REALLY, REALLY BAD ! Just watch 1994 Wolf with Jack Nicholson, that movie had 10 times better make up.

I like both Sam Richardson and Milana Vayantrub, but, let's be honest - This isn't an ""86% of critics are raving"" movie.

Where the trailer makes it appear to be one thing, & the actual movie is nothing like it.That's basically this movie. The trailer had me so excited. As a massive werewolf fan, it was great to see what looked like a decent budget werewolf film that was going to be a brutal horror, with some comedic (similar to SCREAM) elements as well.NOPE!!!! We were given what was mostly a veryyyy slow burn, character driven story, with minor humor ... which is fine, but not if you went into it expecting to see a brutal, vicious man eating werewolf terrorizing a snowed in town....(SPOILER WARNING) This is a semi spoiler...really, but had to be accurate...going off what I just said about the beast tearing the town to pieces? Well... it sorta does...? Except EVERY...SINGLE...WEREWOLF kill is done entirely OFF SCREEN! Not only that? You don't even see it (AT ALL!!!!!) until the final... 10 minutes? & oh boy... it is not great lol. It's a very lame look, basically ZERO creativity went into the design...I will say, I usually figure out the ""who is the killer!?"" Movies quickly, but here I actually was wrong. Although, early on I DID think ""it would be wild if (name here) ends up being the monster! But didn't think it was... but it was!!! So kudos on that! They also attempt to throw some red herrings in, such as the ""crazy, wild man hermit hunter"" (it's too obvious he's a red herring, not even a spoiler really...) might be because he's ""creepy!"" Lol. I know who for sure it WASNT.. just not who it WAS... but again, once (name here) transforms, I was kinda like, ""wait... is that the full transformation??? THATS AWFUL!""TBH, this would've been more enjoyable if it were just done as a simple murder mystery comedy, like CLUE in a snowed in town.Final negative is 2 in 1 really... the comedy aspect, ugh... yes, you're likely looking for the next, ""Shaun of the Dead"" as well... this ain't it. The comedy is never laugh out loud. You'll have some smiles, & maybe a laugh or 2, but in NO WAY is this geared towards comedy fans. It's more, ""that's kinda cute!"" In many ways, due to the main girl being adorable. The 2nd part, the acting...this is a tough one, because the 2 main people (Sam & Cecily) are AWESOME!!!! (Cecily will remind you of the girl from ""SCARE ME"" if you've seen that) she's a down to Earth, sweet, but cynical cute girl. She was incredibly good!! Sam was also pretty solid... but the rest..? Wow some were basically nearly jokes... which COULD be in large part to being they were meant to be funny but just weren't? Idk.All in all, it's a FUN film.

So its a little disconcerting seeing her in the lead role of a movie, but she deserved it. She was good. Sadly, she is the only bright spot in an otherwise boring and cheap production. The minute they change the location to have the entire cast in one room of the hotel it dawns on you how cheap this production is and how unbelievable the characters are. It looks like you're watching a play except its a movie. So the Direction is bad as well.

Middling at best, eye-rolling so bad its good time killers. I'm not rating it based on the game - I'm rating the movie itself. If you're looking for a small-town, quirky Fargo-esque whodunit with some small moments of humor mixed in with even smaller moments of horror and weird small-town, narrow minded personalities represented, then this is it. If you're looking for a heavy dose of any one genre or sub-genre you're going to be somewhat disappointed with this hybrid film.The lead is an up an coming actor with a great range - (see him in The Tomorrow War w/Chris Pratt) - other than him, the rest of the cast is middling. It feels like a missed opportunity with the supporting cast, dialogue - and given that they skimped on red herring moments and great kills (or lack of) - I would give this movie a 5/10. The lead, setting/atmosphere, score are 9/10 and elevate the overall package. It is a perfect introduction to horror for the younger crowd.I'd rank this as a better film than Howl, Late Phases and Wer but it does not stand out for its time like Ginger Snaps. An American Werewolf in London will never seemingly be toppled for a horror comedy and remains the platinum standard in the werewolf sub-genre, with The Howling close behind for transformation and overall horror.",Werewolves Within

Also Harvey Guillen from What We Do In The Shadows got me thinking maybe it would be something the lines of a mockumentary with werewolves and all the lore that comes with that. Unfortunately the film misses the mark for what it was trying to be: funny and scary. I won't give any spoilers. The dialogues and jokes were just too forced and boring. Reminded me of a cable teen comedy show. The plot was just too muddled and dragged on too long. A majority of the characters were unlikeable and forgettable. There were some good scenes when the film tried being a horror film and a few funny moments but half way through i kinda just wanted it to end.

161,amysueduke,Super Funny,10,18 July 2021,I actually loved this movie & couldn't stop laughing. My fav part was the 2 thieving crackheads robbing trish's house & Marcus runs out talking shhh & his g/f ran em over & didn't know it... I couldn't stop laughing.,Werewolves Within
162,scotttalarczyk,The RT rating is a lie,4,28 August 2021,You know those scenes were everyone starts talking at once and the lead character has to yell something 3 times before everyone shuts up? That happens 17 times in this movie. 2 out of 5. It's bad.,Werewolves Within
163,msundeen,It's a Movie,7,10 July 2021,"Ok, who the villain was, was predictable. They tried too hard to keep you guessing.. But I wasn't looking for a big mystery. I just wanted a fun movie. And the little twists and turns, finding out just how horrible some people were, was fun. Not to say that it was some expertly executed character development, but it kept me entertained.If you're looking for a great movie, look elsewhere. Looking for some fun ""turn your brain off"" fluff, this does the trick. I don't regret watching it.",Werewolves Within
164,alper99,I don't understand the current rating,3,12 August 2021,Honestly; movies likes this motivate me to be a screenwriter.,Werewolves Within
165,stevelashway,Great surprise!!,8,14 July 2021,"I rented this on Vudu after watching the trailer and having nothing to do one Friday night. I loved it!! One reviewer mention it has a ""Edgar Wright"" vibe. Totally agreed! Speaking of other reviews, I'm surprised this doesn't have better user reviews. I thought it was very fast paced and funny. I loved Sam Richardson, whom I've never heard of before and I had never seen Milana Vayntrub in a movie before, she was also fantastic! It was like a murder mystery but instead of finding a killer, it was figuring out who was the werewolf and if there even is one! I watched it a couple times, and after you know what happens it's even more fun watching it unfold. Really surprised me how much I enjoyed this.",Werewolves Within
166,whats_fordinner,More political garbage.,2,10 October 2021,"Everyone once in awhile I like to watch a bad movie knowing its going to be bad, but this movie takes it to a whole different level by feeling the need to add in lines like ""Gender is just a construct"". I still watched as much as I could before I inevitably fell asleep.",Werewolves Within
167,mrcoat,Lacking substance and authenticity,2,17 July 2021,The plot pointless and the acting weak. Humans don't interact like these people are trying to sell. It was unwatchable and we stopped watching after 45-minutes of very unenjoyable pain.,Werewolves Within
168,chillyscott,Characters too goofy,4,30 July 2021,"Great choice on the ranger and the mail woman, the rest of the characters are just over the top goofy. The sound and the film quality is great! This had so much potential, just needed better actors and more werewolf scenes.",Werewolves Within
169,justinmcken,Fun,8,7 July 2021,"Great fun with a good cast, nice script with tongue firmly in cheek. Definitely not Dog Soldiers but trotting along happily in its wake.",Werewolves Within
170,creimire-15699,Enjoyed it alot,8,5 July 2021,"Overall a very enjoyable movie. It had just the right amount of comedy, little bit of gore, decent storyline and I thought the acting fit perfectly.It's not a thriller Gore fest horror movie. I can see some viewers would be very disappointed if they walked into this movie thinking that it was.",Werewolves Within
171,travisspaff-52813,Loved it.,8,5 November 2021,Very enjoyable. Good horror comedies are far and few between. Sam Richardson DELIVERS as he always does. And Milana Vayntrub was amazing. Would def reccomend checking it out if youre into horror comedy/mystery/b-horror.,Werewolves Within
172,chrisshanesanders,Poor Werewolf Film,1,3 July 2021,"This film doesn't know what it is. It's not funny, there's no real mystery because it's obvious who the werewolf is from the very beginning. The werewolf is very poor looking too and only shows up ten minutes from the end.",Werewolves Within
173,sirus-47202,Very Enjoyable,10,7 July 2021,"If your looking for gore look elsewhere. If your looking for a fun , horror comedy that is character based with good characters this is for you. Sam Richardson leads a cast of talented people who bring their characters to life with easy chemistry. A different type of Werewolf movie with tension of a different type.",Werewolves Within
