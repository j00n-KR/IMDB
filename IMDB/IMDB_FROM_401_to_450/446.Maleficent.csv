0,MartinHafer,"Provided you can completely forget the story you already know, it offers some interesting of interest.",7,6 August 2014,"If you are looking for a live-action version of the old Disney film ""Sleeping Beauty"", then you will be in for a BIG disappointment. Instead, ""Maleficent"" is a lot like a re-inventing of the old story. While some might say this is horrible, it must be remembered that there is no ONE definitive tale of ""Sleeping Beauty"". Perrault wrote down this and other French fairy tales (such as Cinderella) but they, like the Brothers Grimm stories in Germany, were folk tales--ones with many, many variations. So, if you look at the film as just a variation of the old story, it's much easier to enjoy.In this version, you get back story as to who Maleficent was--both when she was nice and when she turned mean, much because of a jerk-faced King who was nasty to her (Sleeping Beauty's jerk of a father). While I thought all this had way too much CGI and was at times very distracting, I did love the 'love's first kiss' angle--one that flies in the face of the ludicrous love at first sight crap!My verdict is that this certainly is no classic but the story is worth seeing. Neither brilliant nor an abomination--it reminds me of some of the newer children's story books such as ""The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig"" or ""The True Story of the Big Bad Wolf""--stories that stand the older versions on their heads!",Maleficent
1,TheLittleSongbird,Doesn't really enchant or entertain,4,30 May 2016,"As 'Sleeping Beauty' is one of my favourite films, Disney, animated or otherwise, and Maleficent is a contender for the scariest and most memorable female villain of the Disney canon, despite the mixed reviews 'Maleficent' did maintain my interest.Finally watching it after being very behind with film-watching, 'Maleficent' does have enough to salvage it from being a complete waste but largely it is really underwhelming.The best thing about 'Maleficent' is the performance of Angelina Jolie. Jolie looks incredible in her knockout costume and make-up (which are spot on for the character), and she is sinister and alluring while also bringing some wit to some scenes. The film also looks gorgeous, it's beautifully shot with eye-catching and richly atmospheric set and costume design and the director's long-time experience in special effects work clearly shows in the film. The score is whimsical, haunting, hypnotic and beautifully orchestrated, as one would expect from James Newton Howard.In terms of story, the highlight is the suspenseful and quite powerful Christening scene, that gave the film and Maleficent's character so much promise and set the tone brilliantly. Also loved the delectably witty and subtly dangerous rapport between Maleficent and her servant Diaval, played creepily by Sam Riley, it is by far the best-executed and believable of all the character relationships in the film.However, part of the problem is that after how well Maleficent (film and character) is set up and after the character making such an impact as one of Disney's most iconic and scariest villains it just didn't seem believable no matter how much the film tried seeing her softened and more sympathetic. More problematic is that in the attempts to give Maleficent this dimension and origins story, most of the rest of the characters suffer, not just in being bland but in some cases being distorted. The worst case being King Stefan being made into a shockingly one-dimensional and underwritten villain. Prince Phillip is almost completely useless (Aurora's mother even more so), even for a plot device, and the three good fairies are irritating and their inept stupidity makes them far less endearing.With the performances, the only great one is Jolie's (Riley's is also effective but his role isn't anywhere near as juicy). Elle Fanning is a very vacuous and at worst somnambulist Aurora. Say what you will about the Aurora in the animated film being a dull catalyst in her film, she is at least one of the most beautiful visually Disney protagonists, radiates in charm and her singing voice is one of the most distinctive and loveliest in a Disney film ever, which at least makes her memorable, all three attributes of which Fanning lacks with her Aurora. Sharlto Copley both fails to engage and over-compensates as Stefan, Brenton Thwaites is bland while Juno Temple and fine actresses Lesley Manville and Imelda Staunton are charmless and annoying, their slapstick comic relief falling as flat as a pancake.Linda Woolverton's script is very lazy here, with clichéd and dreary dialogue and very clumsy attempts at being funny. Apart from the christening scene and the scenes between Maleficent and Diaval, the story is a mess of inconsistencies and half-baked ideas seen before in Disney films that executed them far better (notably 'Frozen'), not enough of it enchants and entertains and it is really hard to swallow Aurora being so forgiving as easily as that.Overall, starts off great and has benefits of looking beautiful, having a wonderfully composed music score and a lead performance that couldn't have been more perfect. But it isn't enchanting or entertaining enough really, and the way the other characters are written and the flawed execution of the script and story hurt 'Maleficent' severely. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Maleficent
2,Leofwine_draca,Fairy tale reworking,3,3 January 2018,"MALEFICENT is a fairy tale with a twist: it's a live-action follow-up to Disney's SLEEPING BEAUTY, with the focus now on that film's villainous character, the witch Maleficent. It turns out that she's a misunderstood wood-dwelling recluse who's just looking for love, but with this film's laughable scripting you won't be buying that for a second. No, this version is a complete waste of time, and you realise that from the outset as it's one of those kid-friendly films absolutely loaded down with CGI: you get CGI flying through CGI landscapes, CGI castles, and CGI fairies and supporting characters. Shoehorned-in battle scenes are supposedly there to keep adults and boys involved but don't, while Angelina Jolie is merely distracting with those contact lenses and prosthetic cheekbones. The meandering storyline goes on and on without getting anywhere, and the unconvincing actors mired in this mess include a wasted Sharlto Copley and a miscast Sam Riley. The end result? Don't bother.",Maleficent
3,SnoopyStyle,Maleficent redux,6,21 November 2014,"Two kingdoms exist side by side. The human kingdom is ruled by a greedy king. The Moors is populated by magical creatures. One day, orphan boy Stefan goes into the Moors and befriends the orphan fairy girl Maleficent. They grow apart over the years. Later, the king attacks the Moors and an adult Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) mortally wounds the king. The king offers his kingdom for the head of Maleficent. Stefan (Sharlto Copley) drugs her and cuts off her wings. Stefan is given the kingdom. He has a daughter which Maleficent curses with a sleeplike death on her sixteen birthday. She can only be saved by a true love's kiss. Stefan tasks three pixies Flittle (Lesley Manville), Knotgrass (Imelda Staunton) and Thistletwit (Juno Temple) to guard his daughter Aurora (Elle Fanning) in a country cottage until her sixteen birthday.I'm fine with the reimagining of the classic villain. The story works hard to make her the aggrieved party. The movie looks good. Angelina Jolie looks good but she's very monotone. It feels a bit lifeless. Maleficent just isn't the appealing character that a movie needs to build around. It starts at the childhood stage. The two kids need to have more fun. I understand the need to get to Jolie as quick as possible but their childhood is nothing more than a weak montage. I like the true love's kiss. I don't find the pixies all that funny. There are good points and bad points in this movie.",Maleficent
4,Prismark10,A Fairy from the Moors,6,30 January 2015,"I liked this reworking of the Sleeping Beauty tale by Disney as they focus on Maleficent the malevolent fairy in Sleeping Beauty,Here Jolie's powerful fairy has been betrayed by a boyhood human friend and she curses the baby princess more out of anger and wanting revenge for the loss of her wings.However as the King for some reasons after the curse abandons the baby princess to three inept fairies its up to Maleficent to keep the baby safe from a distance which includes making sure she is fed.The screenplay and story is not without problems, in fact its heavily flawed and might perturb younger viewers. The parents give the child to the three fairies who are clueless in raising a baby and seem to be criminally negligent which ceases to be funny.The humans are shown to be power hungry out to destroy the fairy world with Sharlto Copley's King being an uneven villain himself. He betrays Maleficent for his desire for power and Copley's accent is a cross between South African, Nordic and Scots.Its a light film with great sets and costume design, a flawed fantasy with a strong performance from Angelina Jolie who lifts the film and makes it better than it has any right to be.",Maleficent
5,claudio_carvalho,The Absence of New Ideas Reaches This Point,8,30 August 2014,"""Sleeping Beauty"" is a well-known classic fairytale by the Brothers Grimm perpetuated through several generations. ""Maleficent"" rewrites the tale but is not a bad movie; on the contrary, has a good story, screenplay, performances and special effects. Unfortunately it shows the present absence of new ideas from the writers that need to destroy or remake what does exist and is excellent. When it is a classic like ""Sleeping Beauty"", the procedure is very sad for those that have spent their lives worshiping the wonderful fairytale. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Malévola"" (""Maleficent"")",Maleficent
6,mark.waltz,"Too beautiful to sleep through, but is it worthy of re-telling?",3,11 May 2016,"I was not initially impressed by the cover art of the poster and DVD of the 2014 blockbuster, a companion piece to the 1959 Disney classic ""Sleeping Beauty"". But upon seeing the film, I must say that it is much better looking than I anticipated, and Angelina Jolie doesn't look like someone renting a Kmart Halloween costume like the poster indicated it might look.Still, although you are pulled into the magical world of Disney through computer generated effects and obvious animation, is it really nothing more then assassination towards the 1959 classic? Or is it something that you can enjoy once, and then move on, hungry for more substance? I'm hoping that is a combination of the two, because as entertained as I was, I was really disappointed that it is all style and no substance, and certainly not something that is generally well-acted. In the case of this one, the acting ranks highly between over the top and severely bland. Then, there's the feminist aspect of the leading character which at times makes her totally unsympathetic.Malificient's backstory is presented believably with her a pretty young fairy, meeting an poor farm boy who through his own ambitions ends up becoming King, ultimately jilting her after cutting off her fairy wings which he uses to advance his position with the dying king, humiliated by Malificent in battle. His betrayal of the young Malificent leaves her filled with revenge, and that brings on the story of the curse to the spinning wheel and eventually her influence in the life of Princess Aurora. Jolie alternates between softly speaking and flailing curses, and if there ever was a bi-polar fairy in need of medication, Malificient is it. Even when she removes the curse after having an odd bond with the princess, it seems obvious that plans will change and that it is revenge that she is after.At times after the bonding occurs, the story takes more than passing resemblance to the fairy tale of Rapunzel which was then being finalized as part of the movie version of ""Into the Woods"". How teen-aged Aurora couldn't see that the darkly dressed Jolie was the evil fairy who cursed her makes no sense. I never quite believed that even after being introduced as a sweet young fairy that as older she was nothing more than an evil queen separated at birth from her twin who terrorized Snow White. The abundance of computer generated effects in movies may look great, but that doesn't mean that the films are. I am fairly happy to say that this one is adequate, no masterpiece but no stinker either. However, its anti-male mentality can be taxing, and trying to sanitize an obvious evil character just doesn't always jell. While the musical ""Wicked"" did make the Wicked Witch of the West understandable, this just makes Malificent seem like some sort of Satanic demon who only wants to castrate the one dimensional king who once gave her true love's kiss. The repeat of the original love song at the end has a demonic edge to it and left me spooked more than touched. Call this Disney's ""MacBeth-ish"" variation of the classic Grimm fairy tale.",Maleficent
7,nogodnomasters,SHE'S ONLY SLEEPING,10,10 August 2018,"I think we all know the story. Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) slips Sleeping Beauty (Elle Fanning) a roofie and allows a Prince (Brenton Thwaites) to kiss on her while she is asleep and still keep it a family film. Add a spinning wheel, a castle, and a fire breathing dragon and you got the basic story.What Disney did was to retell the classic in such a magnificent way as to make you never want to watch the old one again. Maleficent is our horned fairy who is basically good. Both her and the plot develop levels of complexity that is not the norm for a children's film. There is a role reversal as good and evil blur lines until the point we root for those we had desired to fail in the original tale.Jolie was great in a role seemingly made for her. Elle Fanning would not have been my first choice, but she was sufficient, perhaps over shadowed by Jolie. My favorite line was when Jolie said, ""I don't want children."" Sure you don't, Angelina.There is an underlying theme that perhaps our enemies aren't so evil once we see the world through their eyes. This is a kids film that adults will love. Indeed, I felt like I was eight years old munching on my popcorn, chasing it with Metamucil.The language is G rated. The PG comes from battle scenes and some dark scenes. Comparable to ""Narnia"" or ""Alice.""",Maleficent
8,kosmasp,It's fantasy,8,23 September 2014,"I have to admit, I was expecting this to be darker. The promotion they were making with this was all: this is not your usual bed night story. Well it kind of is. It might be a tad darker than the usual Disney inspired stories, but it's still not something that was made for adult (and that is a good thing) ... they should just stop promoting movies in a false light like that.So my first reaction to the sort of usual story wasn't real excitement. But thinking about it afterward, I have to admit, the story is pretty solid (if very predictable) and Angelina has another standout role to look back to. Your children should be OK, if there are not too little to watch this too. Fairy tales are supposed to be a bit scary ... a bit, like this one",Maleficent
9,lee_eisenberg,new fairy,6,20 November 2015,"Robert Stromberg's ""Maleficent"" is an alternate telling of the Sleeping Beauty story, turning the supposedly evil character into a sympathetic one. Angelina Jolie depicts the title character as a strong woman defending her realm from the humans, all of whom come across as ruthless jerks (just look at what Stefan does to acquire the throne). It does seem as though humans ruin things everywhere they go.It's not any great movie, but I like what they did with the character. It's a basic tenet of storytelling that a character has to go through changes, and Maleficent goes through many over the course of the movie (and not just physically). I recommend the movie as a different look at the who Disney princess genre. Could it be that everything that we've known about these stories has been a lie? Worth seeing.",Maleficent
10,jboothmillard,Maleficent,5,21 June 2014,"I saw a teaser trailer of this Disney film and was most excited, I looked forward to a new live action story from the point of view of the memorable villain from the 1958 animated classic Sleepy Beauty. Basically Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) grew up a beautiful and pure-hearted fairy in the peaceable forest kingdom, but human invasions caused harmony to diminish, her good nature is tested following a relationship between human Stefan (District 9's Sharlto Copley) breaking down, due to his ambition to become king. King Henry (Kenneth Cranham) is defeated by Maleficent in a battle, growing old and close to death he tells that whoever kills Maleficent will become his successor, Stefan (District 9's Sharlto Copley) overhears this and goes to find her, but he cannot bring himself to kill her, so he drugs her and with an iron blade cuts off her wings, presenting them as proof of her death. Maleficent is emotional without her wings and angered by Stefan's betrayal, she plunges the forest kingdom into darkness and becomes a dark ruler to all other creatures of the Moors, and she gains a loyal servant saving the life of raven, turned human, Diaval (Brighton Rock's Sam Riley), he flies to the human kingdom and confirms Stefan is king, and some years later that he and the queen are hosting a christening for their firstborn daughter Aurora. Maleficent appears uninvited at the christening to get her vengeance, she casts an unbreakable curse over the child, before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel she will fall into a death-like sleep, but after Stefan begs she allows there to be a breaking of the spell, she will only awake with true love's kiss. After Maleficent leaves Stefan orders all spinning wheels to be locked away, and he allows the three good pixies, Flittle (Another Year's Lesley Manville), Knotgrass (Imelda Staunton) and Thistletwit (Killer Joe's Juno Temple), to take his daughter away to the safety of a secluded cottage in the outskirts of the kingdom, where they will live as mortals and raise the child until the day after her sixteenth birthday, he also orders Maleficent to be killed, but she has surrounded the Moors with impregnable shield of thorns. Maleficent is fast to find where the king's daughter has been taken, over the years she watches her grow up, and despite her hate for the child, she does help her out of trouble as the pixies are hopeless and neglect somewhat, at the age of fifteen Aurora (Super 8's Elle Fanning) meets Maleficent, she assumes she is her ""fairy godmother"", recalling her watching many times as she has grown up, and Maleficent allows her to enter the Moors. Maleficent has become fond of the princess and decides to try and revoke the curse upon her, but she cannot do so as she declared in the spell it cannot be broken, Aurora meanwhile meets and falls in love with Prince Phillip (Brenton Thwaites), Diaval thinks this could be the way to break the curse, but Maleficent confesses that she chose true love's first kiss as the only way to break the curse because she believes there is no such thing as true love. Aurora is allowed by Maleficent to live in the Moors if she wishes, this also serves as a way to avoid any spindles, but on the day of her sixteenth birthday the three pixies tell her that she is the daughter of the king, and they also tell her that Maleficent has cursed her, in anger Aurora disowns the fairy queen and runs away to meet her father, but Stefan is dismissive in their reunion and has her locked away for her safety. While Maleficent races to the castle, Aurora falls under the spell of the curse, in a trance state she is lured to the room where all the spinning wheels have been locked away, and she pricks her finger on the deadly spindle of an assembled wheel and falls asleep, Prince Phillip is taken to the room where she sleeps and kisses her, but it is not true love's kiss, it is fact Maleficent who wakes her, after an apology and swearing her protection she kisses Aurora on the forehead and wakes her. Aurora forgives her and they try to leave the castle together to return to the forest, but Maleficent is caught in an iron net, she turns Diaval into a fire breathing dragon to fend off the humans, but Stefan comes in taunting her about removing her wings, Aurora however frees her wings from the chamber they are kept and they reattach themselves to her body, flying Stefan clings onto her and attempts to kill her again, but he falls to his death. In the end the forest kingdom is restored to its former glory and beauty, Aurora mentioning she is ""the one they called Sleeping Beauty"" is crowned the queen of both the human and fairy kingdoms, which have become united, and Phillip is by her side to rule, and Maleficent feels happy with the way of the world now, and embraces her returned wings. Also starring EastEnders' Isobelle Molloy as Young Maleficent, Michael Higgins as Young Stefan, Never Let Me Go's Ella Purnell as Teen Maleficent and Jackson Bews as Teen Stefan. You cannot deny Jolie is a good choice to play the fairy protector gone bad who becomes good again being a surrogate mother, the special effects are fantastic, and the three pixies are alright comic relief, but Fanning is a bit too naive and innocent for my liking, the reworking of the story is not as engaging and predictable, I much prefer the original 1958 cartoon, but this is a reasonably fun fantasy film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the BAFTA Children's Awards for BAFTA Kids Vote - Feature Film and Best Feature Film. Worth watching!",Maleficent
11,Tweekums,An interesting retelling of a classic fairy tale,8,4 April 2019,"This live action Disney film shows the story of Sleeping Beauty from the other side; focusing on Maleficent, the 'evil' fairy who cursed her. As the story opens we are told how there are two neighbouring kingdoms; one of greedy humans and another of friendly magical folk. Maleficent is a young fairy who lives in the latter. One day she meets a human boy named Stefan. They become friends but ultimately he comes to see her less and less. The years pass and Maleficent grows up. Then the human king attacks the fairy realm but it thwarted by Maleficent. He promises his kingdom to the man who rids him of Maleficent; Stefan uses her trust to get close to her and then betrays her. He becomes king and has a daughter, named Aurora. On the day of her christening Maleficent places a curse on her... a curse that will take effect on her sixteenth birthday. She grows up in the care of three fairies and with Maleficent keeping a watchful eye to ensure nothing happens to her before the curse is due to take effect. Inevitably the day of her sixteenth birthday approaches and Maleficent starts to regret cursing Aurora; will anybody be able to prevent it happening or end it if it does occur?The way the focus of the story is moved to Maleficent is rather fun; she starts off as one of the good people before the act of betrayal leads to bitterness and a desire for revenge. This doesn't mean she comes across as evil or as a real villain. She is shown as a caring character who comes to regret actions made in anger. If there is a real villain of the film it is Stefan; the betrayer who's actions started the curse. There are plenty of exciting moments throughout the film leading up to a finale that should be exciting for children and adults alike... and perhaps a little too scary for some younger viewers. The story ends in a way that should be pleasing for most viewers. The cast is solid with Angelina Jolie standing out as Maleficent; just menacing enough to be seen as dangerous without being evil. The special effects are really impressive; especially the various magical creatures. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to those who like new takes on old stories.",Maleficent
12,moonspinner55,"A retelling of ""Sleeping Beauty""...revised, but without suspense or irony",5,16 November 2014,"Did Walt Disney's 1959 adaptation of ""Sleeping Beauty"" need to be updated for today's audiences? I'm guessing executive producer and star Angelina Jolie thought so, especially as it affords her the opportunity as an actress to ""show both sides"" of the de-winged black fairy Maleficient, dominating here as the villain and the savior. In the prologue, little Maleficient and the future king Stefan become friends and then sweethearts, but when he deserts (and eventually crosses) her on his way to the throne--stealing her wings--we are never given a hint as to his actual personality (Linda Woolverton's weak screenplay turns the character of Stefan--Aurora's father--into a cheat and a liar, without guilt or conscience). In the interim, there's a battle between Maleficient and the reigning king, who wants to take control of the enchanted Moors, that makes no sense (it's just visual bombast), while Jolie swoops through the skies with absolutely no authority (her cheekbones are more severe than her apparent conviction). After Maleficient has cast an evil curse upon King Stefan's newborn baby, three tiny pixies named Knotgrass, Flittle and Thistlewit are introduced for comic relief, but it's too late: the picture is already doomed. The art direction and visual effects are marvelous (if at times either too candy-colored or dimly-lit), but the narrative is a squashy mess, the action looks expensive but feels rote, and the plot twist involving 'true love's kiss' is given an updating which, if potentially clever, is not followed through with any sense of surprise. The filmmakers have put all their vested interest in the fire-breathing dragon and the battle in the castle, but these beloved characters are left wanting. ** from ****",Maleficent
13,paul_haakonsen,A great take on the classic fairytale...,7,17 August 2014,"I had been waiting to see this movie for some time, and I must say that now that I have, I am pleased to say that Disney did deliver as expected here.The movie was a great and interesting take on the sleeping beauty story, and it managed to capture the essence of the fairytale, but also added much more to it. It was especially great to see the story from the ""villain's"" point of view. But of course, this story differed quite much from the original story.There is little need to go into the storyline here, as it is a class fairytale that I believe everyone should be familiar with. But director Robert Stromberg managed to get a great twist on the tale.""Maleficent"" is a movie driven by its storyline as much as it is driven by the CGI effects. And wow, the effects in the movie were impressive. The marsh really had that enchanted fairytale-feeling to it with the vibrant colors, the marsh inhabitants and the general appearance of the place. And the effects team really managed to pull it off nicely turning the enchanted marsh into a gloomy and dark place once Maleficent had a change of heart.As for the cast, well no doubt about it that Angelina Jolie really carried the movie quite nicely. And the costume and make-up for her was just mind-blowing. If they hadn't gotten Angelina Jolie for the role, I think that Famke Janssen could have been just as great in the role.""Maleficent"" is a great twist on the classic fairytale, and it is well worth watching, as it is entertaining and visually nice to look at.This movie easily scores a 7 out of 10 stars from me.",Maleficent
14,tavm,I loved this recent take on the villainess Maleficent-here depicted as having a compelling motive for her actions,8,3 June 2014,"Just watched this-a revisionist take on the villainess Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty-with my movie theatre-working friend and his nephew. Angelina Jolie was quite compelling as the fairy-turned-witch who then rediscovers her good side when she sees how Aurora (Elle Fanning) often takes a positive view on her life. Lots of charming twists on certain characterizations where you wonder who's the real villain and how things are changed based on what you know about the tale. Really, I couldn't get enough of the visual splendor or the bombastic score and the humor concerning the three fairies were amusing enough, if not hilarious. So on that note, Maleficent was quite an epic spectacular well worth seeing!",Maleficent
15,ComedyFan2010,Should have stayed closer to original,6,15 November 2017,"It was an interesting idea to tell the story from the perspective of the villain. But it failed because they didn't make the villain evil. She was evil for maybe 5 minutes. Then she turned into savior.I looked at the other reviews and cries about it being misandrist are just hilarious. Similar to when the so called snowflakes see discrimination in all innocent features. The reason that they made her save the princess and didn't let Maleficent to be evil isn't because ""all women are good and all men are bad"", but because it is a Disney movie and they can't let their main character be bad. Too sad. They could show the explanation of why she turned evil but then keep her this way. It would keep the movie close to original and give it a special dynamic. Since the move is a bit too violent for kids it wouldn't be much of a problem.At the same time I like the twist on the ""true love kiss"". Again, not because there is no true love between men and women and only women are capable to love, but because true love is not what you feel for somebody you just saw but somebody you know. Still, even though it is a beautiful message I wish they remained with original.The movie is gorgeous though. Great setting and beautiful scenes. Angelina Jolie's costume is perfect and makes her look like a true Maleficent. Still, the fact that they never made her evil takes a lot away from her acting. She just walks around looking evil. Not really being such.Entertaining movie but a bit disappointing.",Maleficent

17,LeonLouisRicci,True Love Comes In Many and Different Ways,9,14 July 2015,"A bit Dark for a PG Rating so Parental Guidance is Advised. But the more Mature and Well Grounded Children are sure to Get a Thrill from this CGI Ride that is Full of Fantastic Images and Stirring Action.It is Pathos that the Movie Embraces and the Good and Evil are Reversed somewhat but there are still Characters Worth Rooting for and others to Hiss and Boo. Haters of this Backstory seem to be Under the Delusion that the Original Fairy Tale and the Original Disney Animated Movie have been Purged from Existence with some Sort of Orwellian Eraser and Cease Existing to Enjoy.Both are still there to be Perused and Appreciated, this is just something a bit Different, Not a Replacement. Angelina Jolie makes a Great Maleficent and is backed by an Array of Colorful and Interesting Fairies and other assorted Moor Magnificence. Thankfully there are No Outburst of Sappy, Old-Fashioned, Done-to Death Songs Interrupting the Story and it Plays out like a Truly Grim Fairy Tale. True Love comes in Many Forms and is not always found in a Traditional way, there could be others, and this is Not a Replacement, it's just Manifested in Another Form.The Film certainly Looks Seamless incorporating Live Action and Animation. The Three Fairies are Amazing, and the Whole Movie is Spellbinding in a somewhat ""New"" Kind of Look from Modern Artistry.Definitely Recommended for Those that Don't always Take the Path Well Traveled and are Willing to Accept and Embrace New Directions as New Entertainment and this Does Not Eliminate the Old, but Enhances with Enchantment.",Maleficent
18,CinemaSerf,"""You're the evilest in the world""",7,24 December 2020,"Perrault's ""Sleeping Beauty"" is easily my favourite Walt Disney adaptation and this film takes up on by far the best character from that delightful animation - the wicked witch ""Maleficent"". It tells us how this true epitome of wickedness was actually quite a good-natured elf until an evil king duped her and stole her wings. Now that had to hurt - not to mention get her a touch irked, so she set out on a vengeful existence culminating in a curse on the young Princess ""Aurora"". As per the novel, the three good fairies take the princess to hide in the forest but the crafty witch tracks them down almost immediately and has some fun manipulating them all as the baby grows to womanhood, at which point this story takes an unexpected turn (from the book too!). The cast are really good in this: Angelina Jolie - in the title role - could have been a bit more menacing, but she is still on good form, as is Sam Riley as her rather kindly sidekick ""Diaval"" whom she changes into whatever she needs to do her bidding. Elle Fanning is just a little bit too ""nice"" (for me, anyway) as ""Aurora"" and Sharlto Copley as the rapidly losing the plot ""King Stefan"" just a bit too hammy but cutie Brenton Thwaites does a half decent English accent as Prince ""Philip"" and the three fairies inject some light-hearted comedy into the proceedings too. The whole thing, though just a wee bit cheesy, is still a really well produced watch with some superb visual effects. Though it looks great, I didn't like the ending, much - but then I always wanted ""Darth Vader"" to win, too...",Maleficent
19,writers_reign,La Jolie Femme,7,13 June 2014,"Given her penchant for appearing in things like Lara Croft, Salt, etc, and my preference for real films I have only seen Angelina Jolie in one movie, Changeling, in which I thought she was excellent. I think she also does a good job as the eponymous Maleficent where, coincidentally, an arguably finer actress than Jolie, Lesley Manville, is wasted in a joke role which is underwritten to boot. It's a nice take on The Sleeping Beauty though the song from the original Disney animated version, Once Upon A Dream may well be lost on younger viewers who were not going to movies in the early fifties - and while we're about it whose bright idea was it to drop Tchaikovsky's name as composer. The film is shot in somber tones so that even the few scenes that call for sunlight are muted. Definitely rates a look.",Maleficent
20,utgard14,Enjoyable Enough Despite Flaws,6,24 August 2014,"Yet another reimagining of a classic fantasy story with the goal of adding layers to some of the characters, specifically the villains. It's the latest trend I guess. I wasn't exactly rushing to see this because I figured with that formula it would be pretty by-the-numbers. For the most part, I was right. You can telegraph most of what happens in this movie fairly quickly. The one big surprise being the betrayal of Maleficent early on. This took me by surprise, particularly the brutality of it.I must admit to not liking a lot of the CGI. I was shocked at how poor some of it was. Pretty much every scene involving a fantasy creature that takes place in daylight is very obviously fake, cartoonishly so. The three little fairies with the faces of the actresses superimposed on the cartoon bodies is the worst. Now, perhaps I'm just an old fogey who misses the point, but shouldn't the goal of CGI be to blend the real with the make-believe as seamlessly as possible? Maybe they should spend the time to build the sets and costumes and work on old-school make-up techniques if this is the best they can do. As you might expect, the effects are better for scenes that take place at night. Seems like that's always the case.Anyway, my gripes about the CGI and the predictability of the story aside, I was entertained. It is well-acted and enjoyable. It helps if you haven't seen a lot of these types of fairy tale reworkings in recent years so maybe you won't feel a little burnt out on them. It helps even more if you aren't a fan of the older stories so you don't feel like movies like this are giving your childhood favorites the middle finger.",Maleficent
21,grantss,Entertaining,6,27 May 2015,"Entertaining.A decent adaptation of the Sleeping Beauty fairy tale, mixed with another Brothers Grimm tale. Interesting story. In typical made- for-children fashion, however, plot is sometimes quite random, and not entirely watertight. On the other hand, and oddly for a Disney movie, it is not your usual all happiness-and-light. The movie is fairly dark, which is good. (Though not sure that will play with the targeted child audience though).Good performance by Angelina Jolie in the lead role. She brings the suitable edginess and darkness. Good support from Elle Fanning. Shalto Copley seems a bit miscast as the villain. Cast also includes Hannah New, of Black Sails fame. A pity she gets very little screen time and hardly any dialogue.",Maleficent

Linda Woolverton's screenplay leans a tad too-good-to-be-true and lightening the darkness to shades of grey in one of cinema's greatest villainesses but it works well with Robert Stromberg's fanciful direction (taking a page out of Tim Burton's 'freaks are people too' filmmaking) and a grand production design by Dylan Cole and Gary Freeman, a Danny Elfmanian score by James Newton Howard, gorgeous lensing by cinematographer vet Dean Semler and some fine-tweaking digital assisted make-up design by wizard Rick Baker giving the aquiline Jolie jawline planes so sharp it'd cut ice. Fanning is proving to be an up-and-coming-actress-of-her-generation as the sweet Aurora while Copley's callow anti-hero power-hungry king has shades of Alan Rickman oiliness.

23,view_and_review,Magnificent,8,31 May 2014,"So, I looked the word up because I initially thought that it was two words combined to make one like ginormous. I figured it was a combination of malicious and beneficent, which would be mixing two opposing words together, but then it would make a LOT of sense for this movie.Maleficent, like Wicked, is a retelling of a popular story from a different perspective; and in this case it is a retelling of Sleeping Beauty. This version would be like Sleeping Beauty meets Lord of the Rings as there was a bit of LOTR touch to it at certain points.The movie was cinematically wonderful. The setting, the make up, costumes, CGI and effects were all excellently done. When things were dark it really conveyed the mood and when things were bright it did likewise. The movie was narrated at times which was helpful to speed things along. There were a wide swath of emotions throughout the movie but the movie never got too complicated to where children can't follow it.Jolie did a wonderful job, you could say she made the movie. Without a doubt the movie rested upon her delivery. A solid summer movie well worth watching.",Maleficent
24,neil-476,I really liked it,9,5 June 2014,"Back in 1959, in more innocent, less sophisticated times, Disney Studios made the animated feature Sleeping Beauty. This, the first animated feature in Cinemascope, was a fairly faithful retelling of the Perrault fairy tale (itself drawn from other, earlier stories). Disney added typical Disney touches - adding lyrics to the romance theme from Tchaikovsky's ballet music to create the song ""Once Upon A Dream"", for instance, and giving all the characters cutesy names. It also gave the wicked fairy a name - Maleficent, a clever blending of Magnificent and Malevolent. And, at the age of 7, as an innocent unsophisticated child in an innocent unsophisticated age, she scared the pants off me, particularly in her arrival at and departure from the christening. Now, 55 years later, Disney delivers a live action (well, live action and CGI) prequel and retelling and, as is usual with these things, nothing is quite what you believed it to me. Some liberties are taken with the original, it must be admitted, and some people may find these to be deal-breakers. I didn't.Revisitations can be dodgy but, for me, this one ticked all the boxes. It gave me what I liked about the original, and tweaked it enough - more than enough! - to bring lots of new things to the table. So what if the good fairies are now called Knotgrass, Flittle and Thistletwit, and not Flora, Fauna and Merryweather? They are still obvious analogues for the animated originals. The film looked great, the effects were excellent (and, to my eyes, bore a clear fantasy/magic stamp, rather than either simple photorealism or artificial CGI-ness), the story worked, and the performances (with one reservation) were all good, with excellent work from Jolie.My sole reservation was the dense and rather impenetrable Scots accent affected by South African Sharlto Copley as Stefan. I don't know what the purpose was, but I can't believe that a non-accented delivery wouldn't have been more successful. But this is a minor quibble.I expected to quite like this film: I didn't. I loved it.",Maleficent
25,anaconda-40658,Magnificent.,10,23 June 2015,"Maleficent (2014): Dir: Robert Stromberg / Cast: Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning, Sharlto Copley, Sam Riley, Imelda Staunton: Like Hoodwinked, we are given a totally different perspective of a fairy tale. In this case it is Sleeping Beauty, and the change is that villain Maleficent is given her own story. As a young girl she had horns and massive wings. She is determined to keep humans away from her hidden enchanted wonderland until she befriends a petty thief. They grow to adulthood with their first kiss until that friendship is betrayed. The king is wounded in battle against the fairies and he promises the kingdom to whomever slays Maleficent. Needless to say she is betrayed when he cuts her wings off while she slept. She vows revenge and gets it when the princess is born. She makes her presence known with a curse that will have the princess prick her finger on her sixteenth birthday with only the kiss of true love to break the curse. The wonderland is stunning eye candy but the real steal is Angelina Jolie who steals the film in her dominating presence as Maleficent. Her anger is countered with her sudden love of the princess Aurora and that brings about a great reference to Frozen. Elle Fanning plays the happy free spirited Aurora. Sharlto Copley plays the tortured greedy king whose betrayal leads to downfall. Sam Riley plays a shape shifting raven servant of Maleficent whose loyalty is limitless. Imelda Staunton plays the leader of three pixies that end up raising the young princess to adulthood. Beautiful portrait that demonstrates good ultimately overcoming evil. Score: 10 / 10",Maleficent

Even though she has put an evil curse on an innocent, you still feel for Maleficent, and her sorrow and unhappiness shows throughout the films narrative.Copley is the weak link in the film, he starts out brilliantly, all innocent and humanistic, but soon he just becomes a stereotypical pantomime villain, shouting and chewing scenery.The sets and costumes are wonderful, and even though there are connotations to abuse, they are quickly swept under the metaphorical carpet, so to say.In twenty years time, my daughter, and others of a certain age, will regard this like people my age regard Labyrinth, The Goonies, and Gremlins, a generation defining movie.It's funny, scary, full of love, and thankfully, not the first of a trilogy that this could have so easily been.Well worth seeing.",Maleficent

The story is sophisticated enough to delight adult audiences with a brilliant take on the beloved tale with a delightful twist including the meaning of true love. The characters are sympathetic and there is enough excitement.The art direction and cinematography are beautiful. The fairy land scenes resemble a pre Raphaelite painting. The castle was a bit generic CGI. The right blend of human faces with CGI so it didn't look too animated. The director Stromberg who did Oz the Great and Powerful did an even better job here.Angelina Jolie's expressive face is the perfect showcase for the character - it is the role of her lifetime. Like the way they did her cheekbones to make it like the Disney cartoon. Sam Riley as her sidekick morphs into many fairy tale creatures crow, dragon horse. The creatures are well done not awkward in movement and not overwhelming. Elle Fanning is sweet and picture perfect for the role of Aurora and Brenton Thwaites plays her prince. The fairies including Juno Temple and Imelda Staunton are cute too.Liked this more than the Snow White movies 'Mirror Mirror' and 'Snow White and the Hunstman'. The first was fun but a bit silly and the second was too grim. Maleficent is the perfect blend of excitement and fairy tale. Most enjoyable film of the year.",Maleficent

Once the betrayal comes in this flick turns into a dark fairytale. Angelina Jolie is excellent here as are the special effects used to create good and evil.

30,siderite,Intriguing twist on the Sleeping Beauty tale,7,17 August 2014,"Keep in mind that this is a Disney movie based on a fairy tale. The expectations should be low enough to make this film a very good effort. It's like Syfy doing something watchable! Also, they had ample opportunity to screw up either the story or the overall production of the film and they did not.The main plot is that of Maleficent (kind of a ridiculous name) which is the strongest fairy in a magical land which borders the human realm. Predictable enough, humans covet the land and want to conquer it. After some battle and some deception, Maleficent is really angry with human folk and unleashes the curse. What happens afterwards and the deception I was talking about is where the twist happens.I have to say that Angelina Jolie made this movie good. The ridiculous standins for ""always cheerful and kind girl"", ""wacky pixies"", ""prince charming"" and even the ""evil king"" were as cardboard as they can be. Some scenes were so ridiculous that I thought the actors were cheaper replacements for CGI (see the scene where the child is born and the hand maidens are all abuzz). The always helpful servant was an interesting character and it was bad that they didn't expand on it. Who knows, perhaps in Maleficent 2. Either way, Jolie's almost magnetic acting saved the movie from mediocrity and made it stand out. And I don't normally like the woman, so I am not biased.Bottom line: a mediocre Disney movie with an interesting twist and magnificently evil acting from Angelina Jolie.",Maleficent
31,JamesHitchcock,Hell hath no fury like a fairy scorned and left wingless,6,18 March 2015,"Recent years have seen a cinematic vogue for re-imagining fairy tales. Thus ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" was a dark fantasy film more influenced by Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" than the Disney version, while the 2011 ""Red Riding Hood"" renamed the heroine Valerie and turned the traditional story into a parable about religious fanaticism. ""Maleficent"" was produced by Walt Disney Pictures as a live- action remake of their own 1959 animated film ""Sleeping Beauty"", but with the story told from the screenplay viewpoint of the villainess, the evil fairy Maleficent.Except that here she isn't wholly a villainess. I haven't seen the cartoon version since my childhood and I don't remember much about it, but I do remember that Maleficent was a nasty piece of work. Here, at least to begin with, she is a nice piece of work, in which case she should really have been given a different name- ""maleficent"" is not a proper name but an adjective meaning ""doing evil""- but the scriptwriters clearly wanted to emphasise the connection with the earlier film. This version of the story is set in two neighbouring kingdoms. One is inhabited by humans, the other (known as the Moors) by fairies and other magical creatures, including Maleficent herself, who looks less like the traditional depiction of a fairy than like a beautiful girl with wings like an eagle and corkscrew horns growing out of her head. An odd feature is that the humans all seem to speak with Scottish accents, the inhabitants of the Moors with English ones. (Was this Hollywood's comment on the Scottish independence debate?) This even applies to Maleficent after she has grown up and turned into Angelina Jolie. Someone obviously told Angie that fairies are an exclusively Old World species and that an American accent would therefore be inappropriate.Relations between the two realms are not good, but this does not prevent Maleficent from falling in love with a human boy named Stefan. The course of true love, alas, never did run smooth, and Stefan cruelly dumps his fairy lover. Worse than that, her erstwhile paramour cuts her wings off, motivated less by sadism than by political ambition. The human King, who has a grudge against Maleficent for defeating his forces in battle, has decreed that whoever brings him her wings will be named as his successor.Well, hell hath no fury like a fairy scorned and left wingless. When Maleficent discovers that Stefan, now King, is giving a christening party for his baby daughter Aurora, she crashes the party and, in a vindictive rage, pronounces the fatal curse. As, however, Maleficent is not totally maleficent, she comes to regret having done so and tries to revoke her curse, only to discover that magic curses are more easily pronounced than revoked. She therefore decides to watch over the young Aurora (who happily has not inherited her father's vicious nature) and protect her from harm. She becomes Aurora's unofficial Fairy Godmother, performing that task rather more effectively than the three quarrelsome, careless and incompetent fairies whom King Stefan has appointed as the young princess's official guardians. In the end it is Maleficent who gives Aurora the ""true love's kiss"" which awakens her from her enchanted sleep, the handsome prince officially appointed to perform this function having proved sadly deficient. (This is supposedly a family film but lesbian subtext seems to run through it like a stick of rock).Indeed, for what is supposedly a family film ""Maleficent"" deals with several adult (using that word in the sense of ""more suitable for adults than for children"" rather than merely as a euphemism for ""erotic"") themes- war, unrequited love, male abuse of women, revenge and remorse. Its most ""adult"" feature is its moral ambivalence; normally in fairy tales good is good and evil is evil, and never the twain shall meet. Here, good and evil meet in the person of Maleficent, who is capable of both, and therefore both hero and villain.Jolie (who also acted as the film's producer) has not always been my favourite actress, but I have to say that she is good here. I was reminded of the performance given by Charlize Theron- another actress who in the past has seemed to trade more on her looks than on her talents- in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". The difference is that Theron's character was wholly evil, whereas Jolie has to depict Maleficent both as vindictive avenger and as benevolent Fairy Godmother, and manages to succeed in both, as well as looking splendidly sexy at the same time.The other acting contributions are not really in the same class, apart from Kenneth Cranham as King Henry, Stefan's warmongering predecessor. Sharlto Copley never makes much impression as Stefan himself and Elle Fanning is a bland, milk-and-water Aurora. The three incompetent fairies charged with looking after Aurora are more irritating than amusing.Ever since ""Lord of the Rings"", it has been an unwritten rule that all fantasy films need at least one battle scene, preferably with walking trees, but the one here is nothing special by Jackson's standards. The magical realm of the Moors, however, is well realised, especially in the sequences where Maleficent is flying above it. This is far from being the greatest modern fantasy film, but it does have its points of interest. 6/10",Maleficent
32,lasttimeisaw,a sounding welcome for Angelina Jolie,6,7 June 2014,"A quite long absence from big screen, since THE TOURIST (2010, 7/10), Angelina Jolie is back with this unorthodox adaption of Grimm Brothers Sleeping Beauty fairytale, parades her overpowering belligerence and devilish look, retells the story from the angle of the villain Maleficent, an evil fairy (with two giant horns) who puts the sleeping spell on princess Aurora (Fanning) in order to pay back to her father King Stefan (Copley) for his brutal betrayal. Indubitably, one crucial prerequisite of the movie's success pivots on Jolie's personal attributes, her majestic empress aura amalgamates with the distinctive malevolence set the keystone of the story, which is ecstatically bewitching, her slightest facial expression and even the most common utterance entice the viewers into an oblivion of her-costars and a thorough submission to her realm of prestige. First-time director Stromberg is a credentialed wonderland architect, (won two Oscars for AVATAR 2009, 9/10 and ALICE IN WONDERLAND 2010, 6/10), in this film, the virtual dichotomy of two worlds looks derivative and the epic-ness of the story is lacking, while, firmly leans on a family-friendly doctrine, it borrows from FROZEN (2013, 8/10) for the concept of a bigger love, true love should never be hamstrung within the boundary of princess-and-prince banality, it transcends beyond gender, age and race, it is a cutting-edge message unyieldingly transmitted from Disneyland presently. Elle Fanning and the Manville-Staunton-Temple trinity of fairies (Flittle, Knotgrass and Thistletwit) bring breezes of joyfulness and it is axiomatically impossible for us to be immune from cute babies, let alone one of the young Aurora played by Jolie's real-life daughter, who contributes the most adorable scene in the picture. Copley is typecast in his demented ruggedness, his side of struggle maybe too dark to expound to younger audience, and Riley as the crow Diaval, finds an unlikely allegiance with Maleficent, whereas Thwaites, plays Prince Phillip, is a handsome pawn and completely throwaway. In a nutshell, MALEFICENT is an enthusiastic welcome vehicle of our goddess Jolie in a fantasy world, a befitting role for her to testify her star power and further lure us closer to her distanced and mysterious charisma.",Maleficent

34,KineticSeoul,"Slightly better than ""Sleeping Beauty"" the animated movie",6,28 September 2014,"Now I didn't really enjoy the animated Disney ""Sleeping Beauty"" movie. And this was at least to a certain extent better than the animated ""Sleeping Beauty"" movie in my opinion. However the Maleficent character was a bit of a mystery to me. And wasn't quite sure of her motives in the animated movie. So it's nice to watch the other side of things from Maleficent's point of view. I think this is one of the few Disney live action movies that has a direct or close enough correlation with the animated version. To a certain extent I had empathy toward Maleficent, because too much darkness, including betrayal can break a person for the worst. Angelina Jolie was the perfect candidate for this role as Maleficent. She just nails it as her. Some of the character actions doesn't make much sense in certain scenarios though. And the back and forth good or compassionate Maleficent and bad Maleficent get jumbled. I guess it's to add more sympathy and likability to the character, but it just seemed like the writer's couldn't make up their minds sometimes. This is a very entertaining Disney movie, nor does it carry much emotion. And Maleficent constantly stalking Aurora got old after a while. Also the acting and cinematography made it seem like I was watching a play more than a movie. Overall this is a movie just worth watching to get a glimpse of Maleficent's side of things. I just don't get how this movie cost 180 million to make though. I give this a 6 out of 10 because of the message near the end. Which is a message I am contemplating about to this day.6/10",Maleficent
35,OllieSuave-007,Sleeping Beauty turned upside down.,7,17 July 2014,"If you are a hardcore Disney fan who relish the traditional story of Sleeping Beauty, then this film is not for you. However, if you enjoy a good 360-degree twist to a fairytale, then give this film a go.A spin-off from Disney's 1959 film adaptation of the classic fairytale, this movie, according to the narrator, is about the true story of the villainous fairy Maleficent and how a betrayal and an attack by King Stefan's army against her peaceful forest kingdom led her to become evil and to curse Stefan's newborn daughter Aurora.This movie's plot goes at a fast momentum, making each scene interesting and attention grabbing, leaving no room for monotonous and unexciting elements. The visual effects were done quite well and made careful utilization of CGI in generating some colorful and bright visuals, particularly in the effects of the good fairies and the forest kingdom creatures. James Newton Howard gave a wonderfully adventurous and haunting music score and the acting performances were pretty good for the most part. Angelina Jolie gave a brilliant performance as Maleficent and Elle Fanning gave a down-to-earth and spirited performance as Aurora. Sam Riley as the raven-turned-human servant Diaval also gave a touching performance. The rest of the cast performances was a little sub-par, particularly that of the emotionless King Stefan and the bubble-headed three fairies (the Flora, Fauna, Merriweather-based characters). However, it was interesting to see how each of the characters came to be and what the true backgrounds of them were when compared with the original animated Sleeping Beauty movie (i.e., Maleficent's pet raven/servant offered to be her servant after she saved his life).***spoilers ahead, but does not give away ending*** While the casual fantasy/fairytale movie viewer might enjoy this movie, those who are loyal to the original Sleeping Beauty story and the 1959 animated adapted film version might not like the movie because it retells Sleeping Beauty in a different point-of-view. I thought that this story revealed why Maleficent turned evil and that she would remain dark and wicked throughout the film, with plot elements mirroring that of the animated movie. However, the story is mostly different as Maleficent was portrayed as not truly evil, just vengeful (I would have preferred her to be more dark and sinister). And, Aurora's slumber, Prince Phillip's role, King Stefan's true purpose and the Three Good Fairies all weren't what they seem. Therefore, instead of a movie that further details and expands the Sleeping Beauty fairytale, it changes it. I would have preferred screenwriter Linda Woolverton to have scripted the movie that follows the animated movie storyline with expanded plot elements instead of the story that was produced, as I think her approach might make people, especially those who grew up watching the animated version, think they were told the incorrect or false story - can't help but think it deprives them of a childhood memory or they were deceived all these years. ***spoiler ends*** Overall, despite the fact that I wished the movie's story would have been scripted differently to be more faithful to the original Sleeping Beauty fairytale and the animated film, this movie as itself is a pretty good fantasy adventure nonetheless.Grade B-",Maleficent
36,sddavis63,An Unnecessary Fairy Tale About A Fairy Tale,4,10 August 2019,"Some years ago my daughter watcehd this movie and has always spoken of how good it was. I didn't watch it with her at the time but decided to check it out this morning with some free time that had fallen into my hands. I have to be honest and say that I was disappointed. Everything you would expect Disney to do right Disney did right. The CGI and the animation was quite good. The basic story was creative. The problem was that the story failed to pull me in. It's a fairy tale about a fairy tale. This is obviously based on ""Sleeping Beauty"" and seems to be trying to fill in the story of the evil fairy godmother who cast the spell on the Beauty. It explains what happened to Maleficent (the ""godmother"") and why she responded the way she did. Personally, I've never felt the need for backstories on the evil characters we sometimes come across. I think they're far more fun when they're just delightfully and wickedly evil. Telling us all about Maleficent's past was ike the movie version telling us why the Grinch was such a grinch. To me, it was unnecessary. Creative, yes. As I said - credit for that. But still unnecessary, for me at least. I have to confess that this was one of the few movies I've watched that I didn't make it through to the end with. After the first half hour or so my attention was wandering, and I actually turned it off with about 15 minutes to go. I wasn't even interested enough to see how it all turned out. (4/10)",Maleficent
37,Hellmant,If you think 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' and 'THE HOBBIT' movies are bad you definitely won't like this!,8,5 June 2014,"'MALEFICENT': Four Stars (Out of Five)Disney's live-action 're-imagining' of their animated classic 'SLEEPING BEAUTY' (based on the fairytale by Charles Perrault, and adapted by the Brothers Grimm). This version centers on the villainess Maleficent (and makes her a sympathetic antagonist) by telling her origins story; as a strong heroic fairy, who was betrayed by the human boy she loved. Angelina Jolie stars as the title character, Elle Fanning plays the young princess she curses (the 'Sleeping Beauty') and Sharlto Copley plays the male villain of the film (an evil king who betrayed Malficent, by steeling her wings). It was directed by first time film director Robert Stromberg (a veteran visual effects artist) and written by Linda Woolverton (who also wrote the 2010 Disney live action update to 'ALICE IN WONDERLAND' and co-wrote 'THE LION KING'). Purists (who don't approve of a lot of creative liberty) will hate this movie but I found it to be immensely entertaining.The movie begins with Maleficent (Jolie) as a young fairy (Ella Purnell and Isobelle Molloy, at different ages) who lives peacefully in the magic realm of 'The Moors'. She falls in love with a young boy, named Stefan (Michael Higgins), from the human world next to hers. As the boy gets older (Copley) he becomes obsessed with becoming king, like his father King Henry (Kenneth Cranham), and stops visiting Maleficent. After Maleficent leads her people in battle against King Henry's invading army, and defeats them, Stefan betrays her. He steals her wings, by cutting them off with iron (the only thing that can hurt fairies). Stefan does this to become king, by impressing his dying father, which upsets Maleficent so much that she becomes evil and dark hearted. She gets her revenge by cursing Stefan's newborn baby, Aurora, to fall into a sleep like death (on her 16th birthday). Stefan then sends the baby into the woods, with three pixie guardians, to protect her. Maleficent learns of her whereabouts and watches her (from nearby). She sees her grow into a strong young woman (Fanning) and begins to see the beauty in the world, once again, through her. At the same time Stefan grows mad, with vengeance on his mind.To say the film takes a lot of creative liberty, with it's source material, is an understatement; this is practically a completely different fairytale. If you think 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' and 'THE HOBBIT' movies are bad you definitely won't like this. The basic plot points are the same but the central characters are almost completely different (the title one most of all). Jolie looks great in the part, and gives a decent performance, but still it's not the same character as classic literature (or the Disney animated film). Even so I still really enjoyed the movie. It looks beautiful and it's surprisingly emotional and sweet. I predicted the ending (about halfway through the film) but I still really liked watching it play out (and was very moved by it). It's great to see two strong lead female characters (in a fantasy/action flick) and a central relationship story all about them. Almost every male character in the movie is either an idiot, evil or crazy (but I didn't mind that either). It's a highly enjoyable film in my opinion, even if it bares almost no resemblance to the original.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpJHaK5PsZc",Maleficent
38,cherold,Best fairytale movie since Stardust,10,11 April 2015,"I watched Disney's Sleeping Beauty for the first time about a year ago. Maleficent was a fascinating villain, and one I could see being scary to small children, but I was bothered that she seemed so hellbent on destruction with absolutely no reason. Even evil people usually have *some* reason for what they do.Perhaps this also bothered the writer of Maleficent, who gave the character a back story in this revisionist fairy tale. This time around, Maleficent is a nice fairy who, after some very bad experiences, gets very angry and goes on a vengeance bender.Angelina Jolie is indescribably wonderful as Maleficent, beautifully riding the line between the sardonic, cackling cartoon villain and this movie's hurt, broken, and very powerful woman.I also quite liked the treatment of Aurora. In the original cartoon she was one of those painfully bland Disney princesses they had before their resurgence in the 80s and 90s. While Disney has tended to give later princesses more personality by making them feistier, Aurora is still just as sweet as pie. But Elle Fanning is so radiantly positive and likable that she completely avoids the simpering tendencies seemingly inherent in such a role.The movie has gorgeous special effects, whimsical humor, and an engaging story. It does a really nice job of matching up with certain scenes from the original. It is also wonderfully touching; I haven't actually cried this often during a movie in years.From looking through some of the reviews, it seems the people who most hate this movie had very specific ideas of what it should be. Many wanted Maleficent to be the evil character they remembered, with simply the story told from her point of view. But having seen the cartoon only once, as an adult, I have no attachment to the original.This makes me the ideal viewer for this film. If you've never seen Sleeping Beauty you'll miss a lot, but if you watched it over and over as a kid you may have too many preconceptions to fully enjoy it.There were small flaws. Portraying the fairies as Three- Stooges-level idiots wasn't as humorous as intended, and the changes in the curse seemed to be an unnecessary softening, but this movie is so magical and so lovely that these minor quibbles barely registered.I love this movie. I love it so much that I feel like putting a curse on everyone who doesn't like it. That's just the Maleficent in me.",Maleficent
39,FeastMode,i really love this movie,8,25 June 2019,"Awesome movie, awesome story, awesome scenes, awesome job by angie in becoming the character and also in her overall acting job throughout the movie. They did a great job of getting you emotionally invested in the characters, both good and bad. And Maleficent is one of my favorite characters ever. she consistently made me feel for her and root for her. She's a straight BEAST too. (4 viewings 10/19/19)

The way aurora was awoken at the end was also very awesome. It would have been kind of cheesy if the prince woke her up with true love's kiss when he'd only met her once. But the love of a mother (sort of) for her daughter was shown beautifully here with a perfect emotional speech by maleficent before the epic battle ending. The dragon fight at the end, and the moment she got her wings back were both amazing. Also when she spinning-burst out of the window in slow motion. She was powerful, angry, vengeful, hateful, and at the same time loving, caring, empathetic and remorseful",Maleficent
40,Robert_duder,Maleficent is magnificent! My expectations were blown away,9,5 November 2014,"I remember first hearing the buzz around this film. It seemed to start long before the film came out. Then when filming began to buzz was that Angelina Jolie was stunning. I desperately wanted to see this on the big screen but it was one of those films that I just kept missing the chance to see. Finally...months and months later...I got to watch it. Mind...blown. This might be one of the most visually stunning films I have seen in years (maybe since Avatar?) But special effects don't make or break a great film. The Disney magic is alive and well in this brilliantly re-imagining of not only a classic fairy tale but a classic Disney villainess as well. Who else but Disney could take a legendary villain and turn them into an empathetic hero with a touching back story? The film is full of swords and dragons, magic and fairies, Kings and Princess'. Perhaps my only complaint about the film (and it is less of a complaint and more of an observation) is that the film is very dark and has some really powerful imagery that I personally think is too much for younger viewers who may normally be subjected to Disney films. Older children and adults will absolutely love this movie.I am definitely not a huge fan of Angelina Jolie. I think she is a decent actress but she has never been a top choice in my books. However, let it be known that I think she is absolutely mind blowing and stunning in this film. Not only does she completely own the character and invest herself into it but she did her own stunts and just completely becomes Maleficent. She has captured this role and made it her own and it won't ever be forgotten. I believe she likely deserves an Oscar nomination for the part. Elle Fanning takes on the role of the young Aurora (Sleeping Beauty if you will.) Fanning is decent and definitely has a chemistry on screen but she isn't quite as strong as you would hope from a lead actress. She doesn't show the same level of talent as her older sister did at her age. Fanning is still good but compared to Jolie, she needed to be amazing. As with many Disney films the supporting cast are as important as the main cast because the character are so vibrant, quirky or vital and children of all ages become enamoured with even secondary characters. Sharlto Copley, Lesley Manville, Imelda Staunton, Juno Temple, Sam Riley and Brenton Thwaites all have their moments to shine in the film. Some get more screen time than others but either way they all fit their roles very well. Thwaites is very underdeveloped as Prince Phillip but somehow I expected that. The chemistry with Fanning is average at best but the romance is not the focus of this film. Copley is really terrific as Aurora's father and former love interest for Maleficent when they were children.This film was to me the epitome of a modern day fairy tale. I am absolutely floored that this is Robert Stromberg's directorial debut. This is just a magnificent feat of film making and Stromberg's direction is flawless. Obviously he has extensive experience in special effects but he doesn't let that take away from an impressive, moving, emotional, beautiful story. I know a few IMDb reviewers had less than positive things to say about the scene where Maleficent's wings are stripped from her but I honestly thought that scene was one of the best I have seen in a film. It was gut wrenching (and another reason why this film is NOT for younger children.) The film works on so many levels and I will forever regret not seeing it on the big screen. This is an absolute must see!! 9/10",Maleficent
41,Lejink,Wake me up before you glow glow,8,28 August 2016,"A nice movie to watch on a Sunday summer evening. Disney's sort-of-prequel live-action feature is big on production values and certainly on Angelina Jolie, who keeps Sleeping Beauty off-camera for about half the movie. In this re-telling of the fairy story, we get to see the motivation behind the not-so-wicked witch's curse on the young princess, so much so that you end up almost rooting for her to have her evil way, so badly is she treated by her one-time young boyfriend, now the grown-up paranoid King, the oddly Scottish-accented Stefan (see what you started Mike Myers?).Of course, being Disney, the cute factors are raised to the factor triple-x as witness the three pixies charged with protecting the baby girl in her youth, a humanised raven which becomes Maleficent's conscience and a mop-haired prince who in a neat twist doesn't do what he ought, according to the legend.Jolie it must be said is very good in the title role, her jet-black hair and razor-sharp cheekbones to the fore. The effects are excellent too, especially the depictions of a fairy grotto with brightly-coloured fairies lighting up the place, the forest of thorns and Diaval's transformation into a fire-breathing dragon at the conclusion. I also liked the twist as Aurora is wakened from her sleep at the second time of asking and the exciting SFX finale between Maleficent and Stefan.I would carp at one or two modern-phrases which wincingly crept into the dialogue (one pixie criticises another for ""having a go at her"") but you'd have to have the heart of a fairytale malevolent King not to enjoy this lovingly made film which well complements its animated predecessor from over 60 years ago.",Maleficent
42,richardchatten,Fairy Story,8,18 July 2020,"A slick live-action retelling of 'The Sleeping Beauty' with Angelina Jolie - with horns giving her the appearance of a big sexy stag beetle - giving the title witch all the hard elegance Disney originally gave the wicked queen in 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarves', plus heart (albeit a black one), sharp blood red lips, sharper teeth and even sharper cheekbones and an occasionally boisterous sense of humour.",Maleficent
43,bowmanblue,Evil has never looked so good,7,4 November 2014,"Okay, so, like many, I grew up on the animated Disney film, 'Sleeping Beauty,' so I flatter myself that I know the story pretty well. I was sceptical about how well dragging out the 'villian's' side of the tale would translate into a full length live-action movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.For a start it had a big advantage with Angelia Jolie in the lead role. She does seem born to play the titular evil fairy, Maleficent. Obviously, the story does follow Sleeping Beauty for the most part and I actually got a little bored, technically just watching a live-action version of the classic fairytale. However, when it changes, it changes.I won't go into too much detail, but the film-makers use a fair amount of creative liberties to stray from the story we know so well. Let's just say if you think you know the story, then you'll probably be surprised by what transpired.Of course it's not perfect, but then my main gripes came from the excessive use of computer-generated scenery. I always get a bee in my bonnet when I watch a fantasy film (think Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, or Oz: The Great and the Powerful). I think I'm too old to allow myself to let go and just enjoy the story. All I can see is *technically* Playstation 3 graphics talking on screen next to the odd real actor or actress. Plus the three 'good' fairies just looked weird (in my humble opinion).But the film does its job at breathing new life into an old (and well-known) tale. It should be enjoyed mainly by children, but it shouldn't be beyond finding its way into the hearts of adults, too.",Maleficent
44,ThomasDrufke,Sleeping Viewer,5,1 December 2014,"It tends to be a theme now-in-days to retell a story through the villains perspective. Maleficent being the latest, grabbed Angelina Jolie to star as the so called 'anti-hero'. She is magnificent. She really brings this sexy femme fatale vibe to the film and gives probably the only worthy performance to the picture.Let me preface this by saying I have yet to see Sleeping Beauty so take my opinions with a grain of salt, but I really don't think this is a very good film. I was very intrigued as to the way they would treat the lead character, with it being a villain per say. But in reality she is just the misunderstood one and the king is the true villain here. It just seemed too by the numbers for something that was supposed to be all about changing what we already believe. There were many things that made absolutely no sense. First, they don't explain why Stefan ever left Maleficent when they were young in the first place? And it doesn't make too much sense why Stefan would send Aurora away under the protection of the 3 fairies when he could easily do the same thing but in the castle. If he would only do a better job burning the wheels, because burning wooden wheels is so difficult right? The film looks impressive and is darker than most Disney films, but in all it's just not too much fun. There is plenty to look at but the characters don't feel relatable because everyone besides Jolie, just seems like they are acting. Sharlto Copley, who is usually great, seemed like he took the paycheck and walked through this role. There just wasn't much too this film. I appreciate what the film was going for, I just don't think the outcome is worth an admission price.+Jolie +Visually beautiful -Supporting characters -Plot holes galore-No depth to the story, and overall boring 5.2/10",Maleficent
45,MLDinTN,"great visual effects, but the story has its faults",6,7 March 2015,"This movie was OK, but the main fault with it was predictability. You knew from the start, the young boy, was going to turn selfish, that Maleficent would want revenge, and that whom would be required to give true love's kiss. Bringing the Prince into the picture did not add any suspense because you knew that he wasn't true love's kiss.But the special effects were very good, from the flying of Maleficent into the clouds, to the living trees, the growing black trees. Truly amazing. Also, I loved Angelina Jolie's makeup. The pale face and contour with the red lip looked so good and just make her look like a villain.FINAL VERDICT: A little dark for really young kids, but I think 10 year olds would enjoy it. I liked the visuals, but I just wished the story could have had more suspense. A lot of adults probably should just skip it.",Maleficent
46,g-bodyl,Sleeping Beauty Revisited!,8,21 April 2015,"Maleficent may not be the best fantasy movie from recent years, but it still is a good watch. It's a movie that continues the trend of turning Disney classics into live-action films and I welcome that as long as we get quality films. This film features good CGI and I liked the overall tone of the story. Speaking of which, I kind of enjoyed how they changed Maleficent from a cold-blooded villain to an anti-hero misguided by betrayal. Aside from the occasional narrative stumble, I thought this was a really enjoyable film. Robert Stromberg's film is about a pure-hearted fairy who falls in love with a man, but he ultimately betrays her. In spite of anger, Maleficent curses the man's daughter. But as the years fly by, she realizes that this girl, Princess Aurora may hold the key to peace between her fantastical kingdom and the king's kingdom. The performances here are very good. Angelina Jolie delivers a magnetic performance as Maleficent. Despite her not being labeled as evil, Jolie still manages to deliver some intense, angry scenes that are very mesmerizing. Elle Fanning manages to deliver a good performance, although she seems to smile a bit too much. Sharlto Copley made a good antagonist. Not overly evil, just a heart of stone. Overall, Maleficent was a fun movie to watch for many reasons. The main reason has to be Jolie's stunning performance. The story itself hits a few roadblocks at times, but I feel that it doesn't necessarily matter. Taking away those annoying fairies would have done those problems justice. Mostly, I was pleased about how the movie turned out and kudos to Disney for making high-quality live-action remakes. My Grade: B+",Maleficent
47,cricketbat,"Way to completely pull out the rug from yourselves, Disney.",4,31 October 2018,"Way to completely pull out the rug from yourselves, Disney. Maleficent changes everything we know and love about Sleeping Beauty for no good reason. This film isn't clever, it's subversive. Yes, it's visually appealing, but this movie dismisses classic fairytale elements and, instead, replaces them with modern reboot clichés. People who like this movie probably didn't ever like Sleeping Beauty in the first place.",Maleficent
48,lesleyharris30,"Fails to Dazzle or Bring the Story to Life,",5,29 June 2016,"Maleficent is a mediocre movie with mostly poor story development, albeit a terrific cast. The highlight is, without any doubt, Angelina Jolie's dedicated performance, she lives the motivations of this character and brings her to life in a way that every other aspect of this movie failed to do. The development of the story is a major disappointment, failing to bring us what was meant to be the Wicked equivalent of Sleeping Beauty, but we never truly understand her aspirations. The tone was also very uneven, it stretched from dark, Tim Burton like moments, to very light, whimsical parts with cute, lovable CGI creatures, I could not help but wonder how much better this could have been if Burton had directed it, he would have set up the tone perfectly and this type of story is right up his alley. Failing to deliver the promise of its premise, Maleficent falls flat on so many occasions that a short ninety minute run time manages to feel like a drag. A vengeful fairy puts a curse on a new born princess in which she will remain unconscious until she discovers true loves kiss. Best Performance: Angelina Jolie",Maleficent
49,A_Different_Drummer,Watch the Disney Studio give a clinic in movie making...,8,24 August 2014,"While it may be hard for younger readers to imagine, the Disney Studio has not always been God-like, there were times when it seemed they had exhausted their creativity.That was then. This is now. An influx of talent, inspiration, and a few well-chosen corporate takeovers have put Disney back at the top of the heap. And this film is not merely entertainment but a flexing of those corporate muscles, especially after the worldwide success of Frozen.Note the quiet arrogance in re-imagining a story which the studio itself had made archetypal. Try pulling that off in film class.And if they don't create an Oscar category for best cheekbones, they should. Many actresses in Hollywood will tell you that they could look that good with prosthetics. They lie. To look that good you have to START with the best face in Hollywood.In deference to critics, the second Act of the film simply does not maintain the wonder and innovation of the start; and Elle Fanning, a future actress of great promise, seems slightly lost in an under-written part.Still, this film is a major achievement and destined to delight children for generations to come.",Maleficent

After watching this she isn't as scary,7,22 June 2014,"""The story is not quite as you were told and I should know. For I was the one they called Sleeping Beauty."" Maleficent (Jolie) is a fairy that is loved be everyone in the Moor. When she stops a human from stealing from her land she thinks she has found a friend and her true-love. Little by little he begins to show up less and less. After an unsuccessful attack by the king on Maleficent's forest the King offers to name whoever can take her down as his successor. When he tricks her in order to take the throne Maleficent is bent on revenge, she aims her hatred at the one thing the new King cherishes most, his new daughter, Aurora (Fanning). I'll start with the one question everyone will have, this is not a straight kids movie like Sleeping Beauty was but it is also not as dark and adult as Snow White and the Huntsman. That said I thought it was better then I was expecting but my 11 year old daughter loved it. The only real problem with this movie is the same problem that caused the Star Wars movies to lose some of the magic. Maleficent is arguably the Darth Vader of the Disney Villains, I think of her as the darkest and most powerful of all of them. When the prequels came out and you saw his origin it took some of the mystique away and he no longer had the aura he had before. This one had the same effect, I don't want to give anything away but you will see what I mean when you watch it. Overall, a movie that is geared toward young teens but isn't terrible for adults. I give this a B.",Maleficent

Either this story has no holes or I missed them being hypnotized by beautiful scenery and wonderful effects.

There's no point to further analyze this movie because I have no objections at all and if I start praising its qualities it could take forever.

53,atlasmb,A Fairy Queen's Story,7,10 November 2014,"""Maleficent"" has a simple story, based upon the original tale and the earlier Disney animated feature ""Sleeping Beauty"". But this film is less about the story and more about the telling.And what a telling. With amazing visuals (aided by plenty of CGI), ""Maleficent"" takes the viewer into a lush wonderland that consists of two parts: a kingdom ruled by a bellicose king, and ""The Moors""--a land of natural beauty, populated by fairies and all other manner of non-humans, who live a happy life under the protection of Maleficent, a beautiful young woman whose greatest passion is soaring through and above The Moors with her wonderful wings.The use of rich colors and varying degrees of light and dark provides for the changing tones of the film, mostly due to Maleficent's changing perspectives on life.Angelina Jolie, as the older Maleficent--aided by strong makeup, wardrobe and virtual facial appliances--is a strong presence throughout the film. Much like ""Wicked"", the viewer sees a different side of the story, where the title character is portrayed in a somewhat sympathetic light and not as an evil caricature like most myths.I enjoyed this novel view of the classic Disney story, richly envisioned and realized.",Maleficent
54,ironhorse_iv,"This movie was indeed sleepy beauty. Beautiful to watch visual, but the plot was bit asleep and weak.",6,4 June 2014,"Walt Disney's 1959's animation film ""Sleeping Beauty"" got the Broadway ""Wicked"" perspective flip treatment, with a life action story from the villain's POV. I don't mind how Hollywood is rewriting fairy tale villains, but there is real absolute evil in the world. Confusing children, between what good and bad, just makes it harder to tell them what's good and what's bad. Was Countless Elizabeth Báthory which Maleficent is based on, just a falsely slandered victim? The movie was made from first time director, Robert Stromberg and you can see the faults of the film, more than its strengths. Don't get me wrong, 1959's Sleeping Beauty was no masterpiece, it had one-dimensional characters, awful feminist message, but at less, that movie follows more of ""The Beauty sleeping in the Wood"" by Charles Perrault or ""Little Briar Rose"" by the Brothers Grimm concept than this. This movie just loosely use it. Thank God, both movies didn't use the whole Aurora AKA Talia wake up, due to kinda being rape and having babies only to find herself being eaten by cannibals ogres in the folktale plot. Maleficent for the most part did work as a retelling movie. Angelina Jolie as Maleficent was the best part of the film. Still, the movie makes Maleficent too sympathetic instead of portraying her as the dark and cruel tragic woman that she is supposed to. Without spoiling too much, I like how Maleficent doesn't cast a spell on baby Aurora just because she didn't get an invitation to the Christening. Her motives are deeper than that when King Steffen (Sharlto Copley) wrong her in the past. When you think hard about it, King Steffen kinda save Maleficent here, as others would had kill her. Still, anyways, this cause her to curses the infant Princess Aurora in revenge. This is where the movie fails in the plot, rather than her cursing Aurora (Elle Fanning) to ""prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die"". She instead, choice to make her fell asleep in a coma, until love true kiss save her. Honestly, if the movie character isn't going full evil here, why did she even bother cursing an innocent child, than attacking the father!? If the movie kept the dying plot like the original, it would be a lot more invested in Maleficent trying to undo her actions after she grew to love Aurora. Instead, you get a half-ass sleep plot that resolves itself in less than a couple of minutes. There is no real danger to Aurora. Even if she fell asleep, they still have time to find out what true love kiss is about. Honestly, the whole truth kiss ending here is a just lazy writing. I saw the same concept, use better in 2013's Frozen. It doesn't make sense, anyways, since Maleficent said that ""no power on Earth can break this curse"", which means that even her own power would not be enough to revoke it. So there is no way her maternal love should had work. Even it was, Maleficent says 'all will love Aurora' in her cursing. Does that mean that she really truly in love with her like a mother, or was it just curse working its spell on her? Also, what happen to Aurora's mother? Are we supposed to believe that giving up your daughter for her safety wasn't a sign of true love? After all, true love comes in more varieties than simple romance. Honestly, are we supposed to believe that Maleficent can't control her sleep magic that she made? She seem like she got a whole of it, using it frequent, in pleasant multiple interaction with Aurora throughout the film. There is no limit to her power. From having plant-based magic, to shape-shifter and we suppose to believe she can't revoke this curse? Stupid. For a PG movie, this movie is deeply unsettling. From an adult perspective, I don't see this movie appealing to many children out there with the date rape analogy and violent acts. The young adult crowd is more likely to see it, but the movie really lacks establishing the young stars. While, Aurora is more fleshed out here, she's isn't given much to work with. Honestly, rather than having her do nothing for 16 years, hiding Aurora from spindles, they could had help train Aurora during the 16 years to find the right love interest, or have her finding a way to stop the curse. That would be interested to watch, but no. We barely know her. The movie made Prince Phillip (Brenton Thwaites) into a joke, with awful bad hair, and his uselessness. He's just a tool to move the story on. The three fairies, in regard to their portrayal in the animated film had it worst. They came from fairly intelligent beings that occasionally sunk into foolish behavior, in the original, to here they're shown as being more annoying neglectful idiots. Honestly, having one of them soften the curse is outright cut was a mistake. It would add so much to the plot. More supporting character development needed. The movie had so much hokey dialogue, with little humor. It was sleepy to watch, when there was no action scenes. The movie was cut down due to re-shoots to 90 minutes, which is too small to tell a story, this big. Another fault is that the camera barely moves. Frames are cluttered and clunky. Some of the CGI are badly done, such in the case of the Raven and the fairies. This movie score by James Newton Howard was lackluster at best. I like Lana Del Rey's haunting re-imagining of the renowned song ""Once Upon A Dream"", but it wasn't use in the film run time. This is why Wicked & Frozen is better than this music-less movie. Overall: if Walt Disney was alive. He would hate this movie. I would have to agree with him. I would pick the Disney classic over this.",Maleficent
55,The-Sarkologist,The power of vengeance,6,10 January 2015,"This was one of those films that I wanted to see but ended up missing when it was in the cinemas. From what I gathered though it was another retelling of an old Brothers Grimm fairy tale much like Snow White and the Huntsman – this time it was Sleeping Beauty. I must admit that I do like these retellings, especially when the the original themes are twisted around, such as is the case here. However, it is still a Disney movie which means that it is targeted mainly at families rather than adults.The story is about how the fairy queen is betrayed by a human friend from her childhood all in the name of ambition. The fairies live is a land called the Moors, and the human kings have long wanted to conquer it. However, after another failed attempt the king is dying and promises the throne to whoever can defeat Maleficent. So Stephan, the friend from her childhood summons her and cuts off her wings.Maleficent is a story of vengeance and repentance, but it has other aspects as well, such as the descent of the king into madness as he fears the inevitable reprisal that will come to him. However Maleficent is hardly innocent for she lays a curse on the king's child that when she turns sixteen she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and fall into a deep sleep, only to be awoken from a kiss by someone who shows her true love.The problem is that the girl discovers Maleficent and a strong familial relationship is formed to a point where she begins to regret ever laying the curse, however it turns out that even though she laid the curse she cannot remove it. Thus is the power of vengeance that the innocent will suffer and an act committed in anger is hard, if not impossible, to undo. However there is also the idea of love, because while many of us think that it is the kiss of a prince that will awaken her, the truth is that true love exists elsewhere. As Plato indicates, true love is not the love between friends, or even lovers, but something on a much higher level.",Maleficent

She appears only briefly, but her extremely dark persona and complete lack of empathy make her a memorable and intriguing Disney villain. Maleficent the film continues the trend of allowing female fairytale antagonists to tell their side of the story, as well as Hollywood's desire to re-make every film ever made that was ever a success. Disney is sitting on a treasure-trove of beloved stories, all ripe for 're- imagination' and money-making. But, cynicism aside, Maleficent is actually not that bad, thanks mainly to a purring performance by Angelina Jolie as the titular witch.Opening in the CGI-heavy world of the Moors, we meet a young girl with mighty wings. She is Maleficent, the fairy-queen who is one with the strange-but-lovable beasties and natural kingdom all around her, which borders the land of men. She meets a young man named Stefan, and the two becomes friends and eventually fall in love. As they grow older, Stefan stops visiting the Moors, and when he becomes an adult (Sharlto Copley), begins to work for the greedy King Henry (Kenneth Cranham). Henry, terrified of Maleficent's magical power, declares war, only to be beaten back by Maleficent and her army of tree creatures.On his death-bed, the King announces that whoever kills her will become his heir. Stefan, befriending Maleficent, tricks her into drinking a sleeping potion and, unable to kill her, cuts off her wings and brings them to his king. Years later, with Stefan now king and announcing the birth of his daughter, Aurora, Maleficent gets her vengeance by gate-crashing the party and cursing the child with the dreaded spinning wheel spell, promising release only by true love's kiss, something she knows not to exist. As Aurora is cared for in the woods, Maleficent watches closely, and sees Aurora (Elle Fanning) grow into a person capable of uniting the two lands.Directed by visual effects artist Robert Stromberg (who won Oscars for his Art Design on Avatar (2009) and Alice in Wonderland (2010)), Maleficent has spectacular special effects, but the world it takes place in feels almost entirely soulless and fails to capture the magic created by those using a pencil 55 years ago. The story often goes to dark places, but it's difficult to care about the characters that inhabit the film, who aren't allowed to develop any extra dimensions other than the ones they were given in Disney's original vision. However, Maleficent, in the hands of Jolie, dominates the film as expected. She manages to juggle the understandable darkness brewing inside of her character as well as the humane, caring side. The film may be good-looking nonsense, but it's nice to have an interesting, morally grey female lead in a mainstream film for once.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Maleficent
58,filipemanuelneto,A movie that satisfies without surprise or delight.,6,16 January 2017,"This film basically recounts the old story of Sleeping Beauty from the point of view of the wicked witch, which ends up being transformed into a sympathetic anti-heroine. The lead role is played by Angelina Jolie, who does a very satisfying job in this film. Unfortunately, Elle Fanning is a totally superficial Sleeping Beauty. She is a pretty silly face that appears because it has to appear. But the blame may be on the script rather than the actress. In fact, the script tells an interesting story and is generally good (especially if we realize from the beginning that the film is a reinvention of Charles Perrault's short story) but it also presents ideas and situations that we just can not swallow, like the initial attack on the Maleficent kingdom, with an entire army in line for battle against an enchanted forest. The Roman emperor Nero (or Caligula?) did something similar when he wanted to conquer the ocean and dominate the god Neptune, but we know he was crazy... The movie has several situations that our logic simply does not accept, even with the excuse of magic. Stromberg, the director, did an interesting job, although the film used (and abused) CGI and special effects. The photo is very bright and colorful, sometimes it even looks like an animation.This movie is a good movie to watch with the family. The younger ones will probably like it more than the adults, but the film has something to give to the grown up too, especially in the final half, where the film takes on more dramatic force.",Maleficent
59,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,4,26 November 2014,"The classic story of Sleeping Beauty through the eyes of its villain, Maleficent. Maleficent is a beautiful fairy, living in a peaceful kingdom. She meats Stefan, a human boy who comes into her region to steal. They become friends, then lovers. But Stefan is too ambitious. He wants to become king, and in order for that to happen, he has to kill Maleficent, the protector of the magic kingdom. So he tricks her and cuts off her wings. Broken by Stefan's betrayal, Maleficent seeks revenge. And she gets it by coursing Stefan's only daughter, Aurora. The movie is not as good as I expected it to be. Yes, it is not the original story, but it is not as good either. I liked the fact that they showed Maleficent from the start and how she became who she became, but the whole battle theme, Aurora growing up, King Stefan turning mad, wasn't that interesting. And the meeting with prince Phillip, well, that was a disappointment. I liked, though, the special effects, the make up and the costumes. They were really good and looked quite original. But the plot doesn't really support their level, especially the ending that was eehh well, you could easily guess it from the beginning. So 4 out of 10,because I liked the performances for that I couldn't rate it lower.",Maleficent
60,leonblackwood,Surprisingly Enjoyable! 7/10,7,27 October 2014,"Review: I really thought that this was going to be a typical Disney movie about fairies and magic dust, but I really enjoyed it. Although the storyline is based around Sleeping Beauty, I found it quite dark with some adult content. The CGI throughout the movie looked impressive and Angelina Jolie played her part extremely well. After being betrayed by her loved one, she turns quite evil and full of hate, but once Aurora comes into the picture, you get to see an inner sweetness which made her character entertaining and a joy to watch. Pieced together with Sharlto Copley playing the villain, this movie really did have every aspect covered and I'm not surprised that it made so much money at the box office. A Great Watch!Round-Up: Angelina Jolie really doesn't make that many movies anymore, but when she comes out of the woodwork, she really does come out with some good movies. From Changeling to the action packed Wanted, she really does have a versatile acting ethic and with all of her charitable work and her hectic family life, I'm not surprised that making movies is low down on her priority list. I liked the chemistry between her character and Sam Riley, who played the crow, and the action scenes were very well thought out by the director. Personally, I don't think that it's a movie for the young ones because there are some scenes that will give them nightmares, but there are some scenes they will enjoy, like her magical land and the amazing creatures. In all, I'm surprised that I enjoyed the movie because I really wasn't expecting something so dark.Budget: $180million Worldwide Gross: $757million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there Disney movies which are based on the concept of Cinderella. 7/10",Maleficent
61,TheMovieDiorama,"Maleficent malevolently rejuvenates a classic, whilst inducing you into an eternal coma.",4,27 May 2020,"Much like Lana Del Ray's monotonous rendition of the once melodic ""Once Upon a Dream"", Maleficent herself has endured a radical change of character. Once revered as the ""mistress of all evil"" in the '59 animated classic, now reprised as a sympathetically misunderstood fairy whom attempts to protect herself and her fantastical domain from the neighbouring iron-equipped (seemingly her only weakness) humans. The horned wicked sorceress, now a good-hearted feathery winged fairy. After falling in love with a peasant boy, whom eventually burns off her grandiose wings with iron so that he can ascend the throne, Maleficent rages war against the humans by cursing the king and queen's daughter Aurora which can only be broken by ""true love's kiss"". A notion she believes to be non-existent. Maleficent cares for Aurora from a distance, to ensure the curse is completed upon her sixteenth birthday, and eventually develops maternal affection for the beautiful princess she aptly names ""beasty"". Thus creating a protagonist, and extraordinarily lesser antagonist, simultaneously.Stromberg's fantasy re-imagining of Perrault's original fairy tale, and Disney's animated classic, clearly changes the perspective of its story by altering the motives of its infamous antagonist. Bestowing her the central role and vital mechanism for commencing the 'Sleeping Beauty' plot. Undoubtedly, Maleficent in her gloriously acidic black attire commands every scene thanks to an engrossingly wicked performance from Jolie, whose prosthetic penetrative cheek bones carry the weight of this entire feature. Fully embellishing the original black-hearted nature of her character when re-creating such scenes including her vengeful uninvited appearance to Aurora's christening. ""Well, well..."" she calmly mutters, relishing in her magnificent trademark costume and darkened visuals.Unfortunately, that's as antagonistic as she gets, before Stromberg's complete misdirection confuses her characterisation and implements a tonally jarring mess. Maleficent, unlike her cheek bones, rarely receives strong development. Woolverton's screenplay opting for a tragedy rather than a comedy. Which is adequate, if the tone had matched the tragic nature of the central character. Insubordinate comedy, mostly from the three pixies and Maleficent herself, superimpose a family-friendly aesthetic and consequently diminishes the villainous archetype of Maleficent. Rampantly fluctuating changes of heart for the central character, from raging vengeance to doting motherhood, prevented sustained natural development for the titular fairy, as the script rushes a bloated origin story glazed with narrational exposition before proceeding with the brisk events of 'Sleeping Beauty' (originally a seventy-five minute story now condensed into the forty minute second half of this re-imagining).Jolie ultimately is given nothing substantial to work with, only creating an aesthetically pleasing shell of her character rather than exploring the depths of Maleficent's tragedy. No fault of her own, more so the producers for wanting to implement blatantly artificial digitised visuals to further enhance the overall laziness that plagues this retelling. The fantasy world-building of the Moors is acceptably pleasing, with both flora and fauna exuding imagination. The distracting CGI battle sequences and green screens of fakery however were, well, distractions by definition.The supporting cast were lacklustre, all focussing on their painful British accents rather than their performances. Fanning was flatter than Aurora's personality, whom glaringly breaks one of the pixie's gifts by ""feeling blue"". Copley was one-dimensional and provided minimal threat to his royal character. Thwaites' late inclusion was pointless. And Riley was severely underused. Atleast Staunton, Temple and Manville added some dimensionality to the feature as the pixies, even if it costed the film's tonal consistency. Oh, and the inevitable breaking of Aurora's curse? Terrible. Eye-rolling sentimentality at its worst.Re-imagining a Disney classic by shifting the perspective of its story from the protagonist to the antagonist sounds like an act of courage. A valorous attempt to execute a refreshingly different approach. Whilst this is admirable, the antagonist themselves should not have their entire characterisation altered for the sake of emotional connectivity. It defeats the purpose of this exercise. With that said, despite Jolie's performance, superlative costume designs and Howard's reliable score as always, Maleficent never manages to soar through the clouds with her feathery wings. Instead, grounded by misdirection, characterised confusion and vacuous dialogue.",Maleficent

64,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Visually delightful twisted fairy tale that plays to its strengths,7,26 July 2015,"Disney's latest trend remaking its animated classics with live action and special effects meets the ""untold story"" motif in ""Maleficent,"" a spin on ""Sleeping Beauty"" from the villains' perspective. With traces of ""Wicked"" in the story and Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" in the visuals among other aspects, ""Maleficent"" has some excellent fantasy characteristics, and by carefully playing to its strengths, results in a sufficiently captivating film.Everything about ""Maleficent"" starts and ends with Angelina Jolie. Ask the average person some Disney trivia and they probably wouldn't be able to tell you who Maleficent is. The only reason the film received $180 million and a go-ahead was because one of Hollywood's biggest stars had the eyes and cheekbones to pull it off and she said yes. Turns out Jolie has more than the obvious traits to make Maleficent into a sinister and sassy anti-hero. Every little catchphrase she delivers is the acting equivalent of taking a perfect bite out of a juicy apple.Written by Disney live-action ""Alice"" scribe Linda Woolverton and directed by ""Alice"" production designer Robert Stromberg, ""Maleficent"" feels very much cut from that film's cloth, only it's a little more straightforward and less boring. At a tastefully merciful 97 minutes long, there's an understanding that this is just supposed to be a clever twist on a fairy tale and not the next big Disney franchise.Stromberg's visuals are as impressive as his resume would suggest, having won Oscars in art direction two years in a row for ""Alice"" and ""Avatar."" The world of fairies doesn't play an integral role in ""Maleficent,"" but when the film does take us there, it's something to marvel at. Given these visuals exist for the sake of being beautiful, not because they serve a greater purpose, it speaks highly to the art team of ""Maleficent"" that they distract from the narrative blah of the film.The problem with ""Maleficent"" is that its premise is far more interesting than the actual plot. Woolverton twists the classic story of ""Sleeping Beauty"" to make Maleficent so totally misunderstood and in doing so shakes up the traditional and often gendered archetypes of fairy tales. That's how the film hooks the audience, not with riveting suspense over how it will all play out.In a nutshell, Maleficent was a kind and beautiful winged fairy, and a human boy, named Stefan, being as human boys are, stole her heart and betrayed her so he could become king. So when King Stefan (Sharlto Copley) and the queen give birth to Princess Aurora, Maleficent's curse on the curl is much deserved pay-back. And as it turns out, as Aurora (Elle Fanning) comes of age, Maleficent isn't simply hiding in the shadows.On one hand, there's something frustrating about how narratively, ""Maleficent"" is about two adults who can't talk about their feelings and instead wage war against one another, but on the other, watching the film is like diving quickly into a beautifully drawn picture book that reinterprets a classic story. There's a nice message about true love in there too that really makes the whole concept a worthy exercise. No one will call ""Maleficent"" an excellent film in anything but its production value, but it should enjoy a long life as a visually fun and delightfully campy fairy tale twist.~Steven CThanks for reading!

66,funkyfry,Above average,6,15 September 2014,"Angelina Jolie gets to play, in the film's words, ""hero and villain at the same time"", and makes a good show of it. Unfortunately, the film's supporting characters, particularly Elle Fanning's Aurora and Sharlto Copley's Stefan, could have used more work and more development. The visual imagery is excellent, even in 3D -- it avoids the over-the-top tricks that one would usually associate with Disney 3D presentations or 3D in general, and creates a visually appealing fantasy world.I guess I particularly have a problem with the way this film depicts male characters in an uneven manner -- we never get much of a sense whether Stefan or the negligible Prince Charming character who shows up later (mostly for a joke and some really half-hearted drama) are supposed to be the best that the male gender can promise, or not. ""True love"" is talked about a lot but never shown. Jolie's character's cynicism is supposed to be upended by the conclusion, but I still found myself feeling cynical and dubious about the characters, particularly, again, of the male gender. Also, if Stefan had been a more rounded character, or if he had been developed enough so that redemption would be possible for him, it would have given the film much more dimension.As it is, it's a fine pseudo-feminist take on classic faerie tale tropes, or at least Disney movie ""fairy"" tropes. There's fun bits with Imelda Staunton, always a bonus with fantasy movies lately. Robert Stromberg feels free to let his story speak for itself, trusts his actors (even those that he really shouldn't.... but even bad acting such as shows up from time to time in this film has its charm), and doesn't feel the need to add a lot of flair (like Sam Raimi did a few years ago with his Oz movie for Disney, or Tim Burton's embarrassing Alice in Wonderland film).",Maleficent
67,Vartiainen,"Angelina Jolie is magnificent, but that's about it",4,28 June 2014,"I'm still not convinced that this movie needs to exist. It's a new take on the beloved Disney classic, which in turn is inspired by a tale of the same name by The Brothers Grimm. So yes, it's an adaptation based on an adaptation, but it's not really good or new enough to fully warrant its existence. That being said, it's not a bad film, actually, and I had fun watching it.The best thing about this film, by far, is the performance and sheer charisma of Angelina Jolie. She's the perfect fit for the role of Maleficent and in every scene you can see that she's having a blast with it. Pretty much the only scenes she doesn't absolutely sell are the ones where she has to be really loud and bombastic, but the rest are pure gold.The rest of the cast is good, though nothing special. Elle Fanning as Aurora is a fitting casting, though for a princess blessed with beauty beyond all measure she's perhaps a tad plain. But that's me nitpicking, and she's a pretty girl by any measure. Sharlto Copley is also a great deal of fun as King Stefan. Some people have complained that his accent is distracting, but I didn't really mind.The film also looks amazing. Some of the CGI looks a bit rubbery, especially in closeups, but most of it is very impressive and especially the backgrounds are breathtaking - fitting, because the original Sleeping Beauty by Disney was also known for its background art.Maleficent has its good sides. Jolie's performance is a joy to witness and the story, while a bit naivé and predictable, will keep you entertained. The characters aren't the film's strongest point, but none of them are offensively bad. It also looks great. Recommended if you're a fan of Jolie or are just looking for a good popcorn fairytale.",Maleficent
68,taylorkingston,An alright movie...,6,26 July 2015,"I didn't mind this movie. It was not too bad, but not too great. I thought the character of Maleficent was really funny, just the way she spoke, and how she was so nonchalant about things. But I won't watch this movie again, it just wasn't for me.This movie is about Maleficent, a vengeful fairy who is now driven by hate, since a man she loved, stole her of her greatest pride and joy, her wings. Now, years later, that man has had a child, and she is determined to punish him through the baby. By cursing her. Over the years, Maleficent checks up on the child, but soon grows to love and cherish her.Overall, I give this movie a 6 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Good.",Maleficent

Soon, she becomes wicked and full of hate after he takes her wings and sets out to become heir to the king's throne. She vows to get revenge by placing a curse on his newborn daughter, Aurora on her 16th birthday. Maleficent watches Aurora grow up as a sweet, innocent girl and may not be so bad when she starts to grow close to her and tries breaking the curse. Fanning plays Aurora at 16 and Copley plays Stefan as an adult. Jolie gives a great performance and looks exactly like the original character.

70,lisafordeay,I enjoyed this version of Sleeping Beauty(some spoilers ahead),7,7 June 2014,"Yesterday I went to the cinemas 6/6/14 to see the new live action movie based on the 1959 animated fairy-tale Sleeping Beauty(which I also bought on DVD yesterday what coincidence eh)that deals with the villain in the movie Maleficent(played by Angelina Jolie sporting a British Accent like the time she was Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider movies,who knew Maleficent or any of the charcthers from Sleeping Beauty were UK accents its kinda weird why as I thought Sleeping Beauty was based in Denmark?). Anyway back on to the review Maleficent is a fairy with beautiful eagle like wings and horns on her head who falls in love with a handsome human boy named Stefan. But when Stefan got older and his dad the king was dying and wanted someone to take over, but before anyone could take the kings place they must kill Maleficent first,Stefan decides to destroy Maleficent by cutting off her wings using chains. Heartbroken,Maleficent swores on revenge and finds out that Stefan's wife had a baby daughter according to her shape-shifting crow who she transforms into a man as she says that he will be her wings and she interrupts the ceremony and puts a wicked curse on the baby girl where she will fall asleep on her 16th birthday by pricking a spinning wheel with her finger and the only way to be awakened is by true kiss.So Aurora(played by We Bought a Zoo's Elle Fanning who is Dakota Fanning's younger sister)is now living at a nearby cottage with her 3 fairies who turned themselves into peasant women, and every night Maleficent would sneak in and see her from the time she was a baby till she was 16,and also play misfit with Aurora's 3 fairies. But when Aurora meets Maleficent she thinks she is her Fairy Godmother; but is Maleficent really that bad/evil??. Of course Aurora later meets a prince called Phillip and she takes a shine to him,but when the curse is already set upon can Phillip's true love's kiss break the spell or someone else??Overall I really enjoyed this movie as its got a very surprising twist to it similar to Disney's overrated masterpiece Frozen with Elsa and Anna where they don't need a man to break the curse. To be honest I think this film was sorta trying to be Frozen especially where (if you seen the movie),their kiss worked on Aurora and I was surprised by it. Angelina Jolie was brilliant as Maleficent sporting horns and wings and a PVC suit and a British accent. As well as starring in this movie,,her daughter Vivienne Jolie Pitt makes a cameo as Aurora as a toddler where she meets Maleficent and plays with her horns,as Maleficent says to her I don't like children,and Angelina was the Executive Producer for this film too. It was her movie and she did a fantastic job as the villain in Sleeping Beauty,but you do see a soft side to her character. Check it out and see what you can think of it. Also Lana Del Ray sings Once Upon A Dream and if your a fan of her's then you will like the song,if not than you will hate the ending credits song. 7/10 Out of 5 a 3.5/5",Maleficent

True, Angelina Jolie as Maleficent is very good, but she is the only versatile and solid figure; otherwise good Sam Riley and Imelda Staunton had too small and plain characters to play. For the child/teen roles, the choice was evidently based on ""cute"" appearance, and Sharlto Copley is not versatile enough to be a due villain (I had similar feeling in Elysium). As for its visual effects, yes, they create a fitting atmosphere, but types and movements of different creatures have been used in many prior movies, e.g. Transformer and Percy Jackson series, so they have lost their novelty and marvelousness.The story itself is uneven, with questionable moments and unnecessary scenes, and with too obvious moralizing on topics such as good and evil, love and friendship, loyalty and betrayal... Even children are able to obtain necessary values via deeds and images, it is not required to put them into exact words.Hence, a cartoon-like twisted fairy tale, specially created for good box office due to the inclusion of Jolie and fairy-tale environment, but at the expense of seamless narration.",Maleficent

Disney has now made a live-action version of Sleepy Beauty, focusing the villain Maleficent.Angelica Jolie takes on the title role: the producers begged her to play Maleficent and she was the best feature of this fantasy film. She gave a committed performance and was best at bringing out the fiery fury of Maleficent. The best scene in the film was the Christening scene when Maleficent wants revenges against the main that betrayed her and King Stefan (played by District 9's Sharlto Copley) begging her not to curse his new born daughter, giving his character some depth. Robert Stromberg, the production designer of films likes Avatar and Oz and the Great and Powerful makes his directional debut and it shows. The costumes, particularly of the army and the castle set design is excellent and Oscar worthy, but the CGI is sub-par for a big budget fantasy film and the creature designs were downright terrible. Stromberg and writer Linda Woolverton were taking an approach of being a dark fantasy and mixing in annoying comedy shtick by the three pixies who are totally hopeless. The action was solid enough but it affected by a strange zoom effect which annoying and out of place.Maleficent was an underwhelming experience that wasted potential with an under written plot and characters and poor direction.

75,dfranzen70,"Deep, dark, and delicious",7,25 April 2015,"One day a Disney exec wondered out loud about what would happen if they remade one of their classic animated films but told from the villain's point of view. His yes men thought it was a great idea, until one of them pointed out that if the villain was the main character, they'd have to find a way to make him or her more appealing, someone the kids could root for, rather than against. And that leads us to Maleficent, in which the baddie from Sleeping Beauty is not a simple conduit of pure evil but a glad fairy wronged by by a human lover who perseveres despite her negative nature.For those of you not up on your Disney, Maleficent was the wicked fairy who placed a curse on the infant Aurora, the daughter of the king who'd once held Maleficent's heart. The curse stated that on her sixteenth birthday, Aurora would be pricked by a spindle of a spinning wheel and then fall into a deep slumber that could only be broken by true love's kiss. Much of that plot structure is intact here, but we get to witness it all through the eyes of the fairy herself, Maleficent (Angelina Jolie).At the story's outset, Maleficent is a winged fairy at one with the land and her ethereal companions. She laughs, they laugh. She protects them from harm, they laugh. It's all very symbiotic. And then one day a young boy wanders into the moors that the fairies call home - a boy named Stefan. They laugh a lot together, too, and they become close friends over the years. Then, as a young man, Stefan hopes to be named successor to the king whose realm surrounds the moors (a king who is dying thanks to the injuries inflicted upon him by Maleficient after his army attacked); the king says that whoever can defeat Maleficient for him will be the new ruler. So, despite the many years of laughter and love, Stefan decides to betray Maleficent, and that's when stuff gets truly deliciously dark.For kids who saw the '59 animated movie, Maleficent was indeed a forbidding character but still manageable thanks to the cartoon nature of the film. Jolie's Maleficent is a little more terrifying. I don't know if kids today are just more jaded, but I think if I were eight years old I'd find this particular evil fairy the stuff nightmares are made of. Maleficent has large horns emerging from the top of her head, deep-red lipstick, and wicked, wicked eyes. She's not one to be trifled with. She also has what your English teacher might describe as ""verve."" Or maybe you would, if you're British or pretentious, or both. Anyway, grown-up Maleficent not only wields very powerful magic, she's defiant, defensive, and scheming. Add to that the fact that she's been spurned, and you have a perfect storm for a whole lot of revenge being dished out.Now, in contrast to Sleeping Beauty, in which we witnessed Aurora's adventures through the prism of three bumbling (but well-intentioned) pixies, this trip is more about character growth. Look, it's a Disney film, so good things are probably going to carry the day. But it's not as if the well-known fairy tale is being treated as gospel, either. Because of the shift in perspective, some tropes common to Disney animated films are tweaked just a tad.Jolie is amazing in a dominating (naturally) performance. Elle Fanning, as the teenaged Aurora, is fine in an understated (and understandably underwritten) role. Sharlto Copely plays Stefan, who transforms from a kind romantic to a caricature of Howard Hughes by the time the denouement arrives. (He's still pretty good, though.) But Jolie is the only actor who matters here, and this is a tour de force for her. It's a fun, intense role for her, and she doesn't dilute her character's ferocity by vamping. The visual effects, though, help mask the fact that this is a one-woman show. All of this adds up to a really well done live-action reimagining of a Disney classic, which is not a phrase one would have expected to type even five years ago.",Maleficent

This is not a remake of that classic film, but it is based on it. It goes more into the early history of the characters. As the film starts, Maleficent is a child who is a fairy with horns on her head and big wings on her back. She is a good person, both to other fairies and creatures of the forest and even to nature itself. Then, she meets, falls in love with and gets betrayed by a normal human and things turn dark. Angelina plays Maleficent as an adult and Sharlto plays the grown up betrayer, who is now a king. Elle plays Sharlto's daughter, the girl who is to become sleeping beauty. The effects are pretty good, as well as the acting. The only thing is that it may be a little too scary for smaller kids; I saw several people with young kids in my theater that seemed a little frightened during certain scenes.

She was just like Loki because of how charismatic she is it makes her villain more likable and you end up rooting for her.

The three fairies were so annoying and irritated me so much that it took me out of the film. The story with maleficent was great and mixed with angelina jolies performance it really worked. But there are allot of moments in the film that are shoehorned in the film and really hurts this film. Also the ending of the film is a bit too nice then it should have been.

But before the sunset on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel, and she will fall into a sleep like death!""Maleficent isn't a masterpiece and it actually has several flaws, but it was much better than I had anticipated considering the latest failed attempts at bringing a beloved classic fairytale to the big screen through live action. Snow White, Jack the Giant Slayer, Cinderella, Hansel & Gretel, Beauty and the Beast, all failed in their adaptations so I didn't have high expectations for Maleficent. They all seem to share something in common which is that they always incorporate a spin on the classic tale, and Maleficent is no exception as there is a big twist to the familiar story. They played it safe with the twist in Maleficent, and it was rather cliché, but it worked nonetheless. Despite not being a huge fan of this genre I decided to give this film a shot because I was looking forward to Angelina Jolie's comeback (her previous starring role in a feature film was in 2010's The Tourist alongside Johnny Depp). Jolie doesn't disappoint and she carries the entire film giving a strong performance. Many complained that they wished the film would've centered more on her character as a villain than a hero, but I actually enjoyed the duality in her performance and the struggle she faces while dealing with her betrayal. She owns this movie, but it didn't hurt that the she had a strong cast to work with; I loved Elle Fanning in her role as Aurora, Sharlto Copley as the ambitious King (if there was ever a film in which he could go overboard with his character this was it, but strangely he played it safe here), and of course I can't leave out Sam Riley who was great as Diaval. Perhaps I enjoyed this film more than others because I went into it with fairly low expectations, but compared to other recent fairytale adaptations this film is superior and one I'm sure the new generation will appreciate.Maleficent is a retelling of Disney's classic animated film, Sleeping Beauty, although this time the screenplay written by Linda Woolverton centers on the villain. The film begins by introducing us to the young fairy named Maleficent (Isobelle Molloy) living an ideal and peaceful life in the Moors, which is full of magical creatures. On the other side of the Moors lies the human kingdom which is ruled by an ambitious King. One day Maleficent is warned by the forest guards that they have caught a human trying to steal a jewel from the Moors. Maleficent discovers that the thief is actually a boy named Stefan (Michael Higgins), who she kindly asks to return the jewel. She then escorts him out of the Moors, but when he returns the two bond and become good friends. As time passes the two fall in love, but their relationship doesn't last long once he becomes ambitious. The film jumps forward many years and now we follow the adult Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) as she continues to protect the Moors from King Henry (Kenneth Cranham) and his army. The adult Stefan (Sharlto Copley) happens to be serving the King now, and he and his men are ordered to kill Maleficent. Whoever does so will become his successor to the throne. Stefan heads to the Moors to warn Maleficent of the king's intention, but blinded by his ambition to become king he betrays her. This turns Maleficent's once pure heart into one full of hate and a desire for revenge. When Stefan becomes King, Maleficent curses his newborn infant Aurora and claims she will fall into a sleep like death once she turns 16 and only a true love's kiss will be able to break the curse.The best thing Maleficent has going for it apart from Angelina Jolie's lead performance and the strong ensemble cast, is the fact that it was directed by Robert Stromberg who has a strong record as a production designer. Despite the fact that this was Stromberg's first feature film he has a lot of experience in the art direction department (actually winning two Oscars for his work in Acatar and Alice in Wonderland). Maleficent looks great and the art direction may be it's best asset. The visual effects and the fantastical creatures of the Moors are stunning. The screenplay may have its flaws and the story may fall into a predictable and clichéd final act, but it always looks great. This may be yet another case of style over substance, but the cast elevate the material and make this a much better film than it has any right to be. The weakest elements of the film for me involve the portrayal of the three fairies who are tasked with taking care of Aurora and raising her. Those comedic moments felt a bit forced and the characters didn't have much substance to them. However, the scenes that Maleficent and Aurora share together are solid as Jolie captures the inner struggle she faces when she's confronted by Aurora's innocence and beauty. Sam Riley also shares some great scenes alongside Jolie and those were the best moments of the film for me. The film does suffer from a slow introduction and a weak final act, but the middle act was really strong and that is why I actually enjoyed Maleficent.",Maleficent
79,iquine,Unique Spin on a Classic,7,13 September 2019,"(Flash Review)This magical fairy tale revolves around a bitter fairy, Maleficent, who's majestic wings were sliced from her back by a man who would become king if he killed her. Since those two were childhood friends, he couldn't bring himself to kill her. Yet Maleficent, in a furious rage, puts a curse on the new king's newborn daughter that'll will come true on her 16th birthday, which can only be removed by a kiss from a true love. As the little girl gets older Maleficent began to grow fond of her and tries to remove the curse but even she is unable. Oh No! ;-) Will a true love find her before her sweet 16 and if not, will she ever find true love? A typical fairy tale story but nonetheless, it is magically presented with sweeping special effects and solid acting. This type of role is well-suited for Jolie as her chiseled look is right on. This has a darker atmosphere than most of Disney's movies yet has enough creativity and quirky characters to entertain older children.",Maleficent
80,r96sk,Cool to see a different telling of 'Sleeping Beauty',7,12 November 2020,"Not as dark or deep as I was expecting/wanting, but it is cool to see a different telling of 'Sleeping Beauty'.Angelina Jolie fits as the titular character, bringing with her a good performance. Elle Fanning (Aurora), Sharlto Copley (Stefan) and Sam Riley (Diaval) play their respective roles well enough, but neither come close to matching Jolie - as you'd probably expect.I found the special effects a bit iffy. It's not that it looks anything close to bad, I just thought it could've looked better. The score isn't all that memorable, either. I did enjoy how the plot unfolds though, mainly thanks to the lead admittedly.Intrigued to see what the sequel to 'Maleficent' has to offer.",Maleficent
81,MissSimonetta,"Decent enough spectacle, but I think Disney forgot why people love Maleficent",5,7 August 2014,"It's weird how this movie turned out. Out of all the great Disney villains, Maleficent of Sleeping Beauty (1959) remains the most beloved. It's easy to see why: her character design is cool, her demeanor is elegant, and most of all, you can see the sheer delight she takes in being mercilessly evil. If that character is the one you wanted to Angelina Jolie play, then you'll be disappointed.I actually knew what to expect going in, because a friend of mine saw the film before I did and told me the writer had turned Maleficent into a tragic figure who becomes a sort of guardian angel for Aurora. A strange choice, but I figured maybe it could work.Well, it doesn't. Maleficent (2014) is a run-of-the-mill fantasy spectacle populated by flat characters and the most uncanny CG abominations (the three fairies are terrifying). The world of the film looks like a garish Thomas Kinkade painting. About the only good aspects were the costumes and Jolie's performance.Also, the claims that this film is a great feminist one is bologna. Maleficent becomes a villain when a male love interest betrays her, and unlike a male villain, has to suffer a broken heart before becoming a tyrant. However, I do appreciate that the filmmakers highlighted the relationship between Maleficent and Aurora, giving us a mother-daughter dynamic so rarely seen in the movies.I cannot say this film was outright bad, but I cannot really recommend it either. Take your money and time elsewhere.",Maleficent
82,3xHCCH,Ironically Enchanting,7,28 May 2014,"""Maleficent"" is about the evil horned witch we see condemn Princess Aurora to a grim irrevocable curse on her 16th birthday in the Disney classic animated film ""Sleeping Beauty."" Like the recent ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", this re-imagined fairy tale goes beyond the beloved story we know. In this case, it tells us the reason behind Maleficent's malevolent hate for humanity that caused her to issue such a miserable curse.The popular trailer with all those quotable lines (""Well, well ..."" or ""Then you'll be afraid ..."") does not spoil anything. There is still so much to see and be enthralled about as the story unfolds from Maleficent's childhood until that fateful day of Aurora's Christening. You will definitely understand what made Maleficent deliver such a deadly curse.But for me there was more ironic magic in what unfolds after that day, when Aurora was brought to live in the woods with the three small fairies, who were not how we know them as well. Even in the face of impending danger, the film manages to convey a sense of wonder and even awe. It does so without ever lapsing into over- sentimentality or being corny. For me, these scenes are a pure delight. That is, until we reach that part when the sleeping Aurora gets wakened from her eternal sleep by the kiss of true love. What was supposed to be THE climactic moment of the film turned out to be a most anti-climactic disappointment. This scene was just so familiar, very reminiscent of another climactic moment in another recent big Disney hit. Angelina Jolie looked like she was born for this role. Those exaggerated cheekbones actually suited her quite well. She captured the many layers of Maleficent's emotion and character in both big theatrical gestures, but more so in those small subtle facial or vocal inflections. I cannot imagine another actress other than Ms. Jolie in this role. That beautiful scene between Ms. Jolie and her real daughter Vivienne (as toddler Aurora) was divine beyond description.Elle Fanning was a very pretty Aurora, with her disarming smile radiating her character's good nature and blithe spirit. Sam Riley also stood out as the human form of Maleficent's trusted crow, Diaval. Sharlto Copley looked woefully miscast as King Stefan since he did not particularly look or act kingly at any point. Brenton Thwaites, the awkward young actor they chose to play Prince Philip, did not particularly look or act princely as well.The three actresses who played the three little ""good"" fairies led by Imelda Staunton were not bad. However for me, they were only occasionally funny as sometimes their comedy could get corny. That they did not stick to the dear Flora, Fauna and Merriweather we know is also rather disconcerting.The land of enchantment in the mysterious Moors, with its fairies and other fanciful creatures, was created as an unexpectedly delightful and happy dream world by the computer animation artists. The special visual effects which transformed Diaval into his various animal forms (including fire- breathing dragon) were also topnotch. This film is best viewed with a blank slate, no expectations at all. The magic of this film is witnessing firsthand those unexpected twists and turns in the relationship between Maleficent and the other characters in the well- known tale. Up to the point before Aurora goes back to the palace, I was very fascinated with the storytelling such that my rating was 9, or even 10. However the very weak and predictable climax significantly knocked a couple of stars off. But overall, it is still a film worth catching on the big screen. 7/10.",Maleficent
83,aharmas,This is how you spin a tale,9,1 June 2014,"Here is a film that lives to expectations. Building on Jolie's appeal and charisma, the film survives and impresses a completely different spin on the classic tale. We are given the back story on Maleficent's conflict with King Stefan, and throughout the new adaptation, we are treated to an expanded and revised version of the classic fairy tale. Disney has kept the look, adapted it to live action. We see the exquisite Medieval interiors of the castle, incredible costumes, from ladies' gowns to metal armors, and a dragon that manages to take our breath, even after that little creation in ""The Hobbit"" second entry.Jolie of course, is the center, soul, and heart of the film, for no matter how charming and beautiful the other characters turn out, it is nearly impossible to take our eyes away from her. She is such a powerful force, magnetic, dangerous, exquisite, and with the ability to make delicious deliveries of lines to completely steal every scene she is.Looking back, it is also notable that she doesn't have much of a speaking part. Much of her performance originates in the way she looks at the camera and uses facial gestures, and in more than occasion her body. Hers is a turn she was born to play, giving love (of more than kind), regret, disappointment, revenge, and more in less than 90 minutes. Her villain is one Disney's crowning moments.This film explores her origins, the descent into mad revenge, and her discovery of what her nature truly is. Her character is powerful, yet there are imperfections, and those can become her undoing because much of the storyline centers around the issue of trust. Aurora's trust of her godmother, Maleficent's young romantic liaison, and other minor relationships'.What at times was annoying and distracting in other films that combined drama and fantasy, this one has a great soul, one that completes a full cycle, but it wouldn't be disappoint if we got to see maybe another chapter about this amazing and seductive magical being.",Maleficent
84,peterp-450-298716,I believed in fairy tales again during 97 wonderful minutes.,7,24 August 2014,"""Before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will fall into a sleep like death!"" The very first feature film I've seen(as far as I can remember)was the original Walt Disney film ""Snow White and the seven dwarfs"" when I was about 6 years.It was in such a tiny village cinema in the pre-smart phone era.You could actually enjoy a movie without the feeling that you were in some kind of nightclub with all these luminescent screens.That movie made quite an impact on me. Maybe that's when my love for the medium of film was created.Later in life, I read lots of books.Especially the fantasy genre appealed to me. A fantasy world as Terry Pratchett,Feist,Terry Goodkind and Tolkien (of course) described it.When reading a book about a mythological and magical world populated by dwarfs,giants,wizards and knights,I spent hours in this imaginary setting.The film industry also amused me with great movies like ""Willow"",""The Lord of the Rings"" or ""The Chronicles of Narnia."". Ashamed I have to admit that I was eager to see the first Harry Potter movie,as if I was still a teenager. And nowadays, being a father, I enjoy watching ""Frozen"" and old Walt Disney classics with my two kids. To make it short: I still love a fairy tale once and a while! ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" already appealed to me. The first one because of the beautiful SE's and the impressive giants.The second film because of the gang of funny dwarfs. Sad enough the expression on the face of Kristen Stewart was again of the same level as a typical pancake.That disappointed me a bit. And that's the most successful part of ""Maleficent"":.The wide range of expressions that Angelina Jolie demonstrates herein.No discussion.She was perfect for the role. That soft and sweet look while relaxing and during loving moments. The menacing, unyielding gaze during a confrontation. The devastating evil glance at the time she felt betrayed and hurt. Both facial expressions as body language are used by Jolie in a fantastic way. Those glittering eyes, those sharp cheekbones,the dominance and that demonic laughter. I never thought I would say this about Angelina Jolie,but this was really a beautiful rendition.Everyone knows the story of ""Sleeping Beauty"", so it's a bit pointless to summarize it here. But if you assume that this is an ordinary film that doesn't deviate from the original story, then you are mistaken. This time they looked at it from a different angle. And I must admit that you can call it a fairly successful result. First of all the build-up to the story of ""Sleeping Beauty"" was magnificent. Although it looked more like the intro of ""Settlers"". It felt like a cartoon. That feeling goes away the moment you enter the Moors. A magical land adjacent to the human civilization, where only peace and happiness prevails, and one does not know or understand the human traits of greed and envy. A magical landscape populated by all sorts of wondrous characters, including the small (but powerful) fairy Maleficent who lives in a huge tree. That she eventually becomes the evil and vengeful witch because of underhanded treachery, is a very creative brain twisted idea that the filmmakers have used here. And the denouement differs somewhat from the original fairy tale. But I must admit that I found it extremely fascinating and unique.About the parts being played I can be short and concise.There is only one masterful rendition in ""Maleficent"" and that's the one Jolie takes care of. The whole movie revolves around this character and (I can not say it enough) she did it masterfully and professionally. An engaging and friendly character at the beginning,who's determined to defend the Moors against the humans.And then transforming into a nasty, evil witch with a devilish smile.The most striking imaginative scenes were the battle at the Moors and the christening. Then you see her slowly transform into an understanding person with remorse. For once I felt sorry for the wicked person from a fairy tale and sympathised with her.The other members of the cast were reduces to meaningless roles that were necessary for the story because of this acting by Madame Jolie. Elle Fanning did well as Aurora (Sleeping Beauty) but was really annoying after a while with her innocent giggling all the time. Sharlto Copley was convincing as the power-hungry King Stefan. And the three fairies, who were given the task to guard Aurora until her 16th birthday, didn't look great when they were still mini. But they took care of the humor side of the story. The only one who could make an impression next to A. Jolie, was Sam Riley as Diaval. But I guess the successful effects when he transformed into a horse or dragon again, had something to do with that.And then there is the second very important part of this film : the special effects. These were at times overwhelmingly great. The landscape of the Moors, the creatures living there, the battle against the humans with the living trees (immediately reminded me of ""The Ents"" from TLOTR), the dragon and the flying skills of Maleficent herself. Breathtaking and simply beautiful. With a budget of roughly $ 200 million it ought to be. And Stromberg as a director also guarantees that. He knows the craft of visual effects, looking at his impressive resume on IMDb.An entertaining movie with a masterful interpretation. Nothing negative to say then ? Oh yes, it's sometimes so blandly and predictable. Immediately you feel where it's going and how the denouement will be. It's not very original and the surprising twist is actually obvious. But it's a long time since I was immersed in a fairytale atmosphere like this and momentarily I forgot I had already passed that age where you still believed everything. I believed in it again during 97 wonderful minutes.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",Maleficent
85,Amari-Sali,"When a man's ambition leads to the betrayal of a young woman heart, you find yourself within the re-imagined story of Sleeping Beauty known as Maleficent.",7,1 June 2014,"Like a good majority of people, I found the idea of Angelina Jolie as a Disney villain exciting, and Maleficent, without question, fits all the appeals she has an actress. But, alongside of the appeal of having Jolie in the film, also the remixing of an old story is quite interesting. After all, the Disney animated version came out more than 50 years ago and while Once Upon a Time has featured Maleficent, it wasn't Angelina Jolie.Characters & StoryWhen the movie begins, we are introduced to two separate kingdoms. One in which the humans live, and another in which fantasy creatures live, including Maleficent (Angelina Jolie). These two worlds, separated and peaceful, have little to no interaction with one another until one boy searches amongst the Moors' (The realm of the fairies) land for their rumored riches. Said boy, Stefan (Sharlto Copley/ Michael Higgins), finds himself caught trying to steal a crystal like object so he can feed himself. Thus leading to him being confronted by one of the few human-esque creatures: Maleficent (Isolbelle Molloy & Ella Purnell).After shaming him to giving back what he stole, a sort of friendship blooms between the two, and with time it evolves to the point where you can see some semblance of young love bloom. However, due to Stefan's ambitions to rise above being a peasant, this trust he built with Maleficent ends up used for his own personal gain. You see, around the time both he and Maleficent become adults, King Henry (Kenneth Cranham) has risen to power and wishes to claim the riches of the Moors. Thus leading to a battle in which he is defeated by The Moors, but especially Maleficent. And on his death bed he promises his kingdom to the one who avenges him. So, Stefan returns to see Maleficent, with their time apart not being noted for he seemingly was never consistent when it came to visiting her. However, this time is different. He drugs her, and then goes to kill her, but is unable to. The reason likely being because whatever they had keeps him from taking her life. So instead he takes her wings, her most valued possession, back to his king. Thus leading to his rise, and a betrayal which leads to the great villain we have come to known.PraiseWithout a doubt, Angelina Jolie is the highlight of this film. She is comical, ferocious, and complex. Take for instance her revenge against Stefan by cursing Aurora (Elle Fanning). As you watch Jolie stalk Aurora, and even see if she can scare the child, you begin to see her soften. I would argue that she even sees Aurora, at times, like the child she would have had if Stefan did right by her. For while she has multiple opportunities to just let Aurora die, especially since the three pixies, Knotgrass (Imelda Staunton), Thistlewit (Juno Temple), and Flittle (Lesley Manville), are morons compared to the animated version, she not only keeps her alive, but nurtures her to the point Aurora sees her as a fairy godmother.And all the actresses who play Aurora, including Jolie's daughter Vivienne Jolie-Pitt, create this lovable girl who you can see melting away Maleficient's malice and helping replace the stolen bits of her heart. Leading me to speak on how they redid the story. While, I must admit, I wish they kept to the general storyline of the animated version, with a few touches so we knew what Maleficent was thinking, I didn't completely hate what the new version of Maleficent's story. I won't say it was perfect, it was far from that, but it was adequate.CriticismQuickly jumping back to talk about the three pixies, I personally did not like them at all. If just because they came off like the Three Stooges with their silly antics. Then, on top of that, I found issue with how they changed the story to do more than make Maleficent seem like a misunderstood villain, or even present the classic tale from her point of view. Instead, post-curse, they create a new fantasy which seems to not even be the least bit inspired by either the Disney animated version, much less the source material. It clearly looks to make sure Jolie shines, even if that means adding massive amounts of filler to the story to make sure she earns her paycheck. Thus hurting the film for this filler between pivotal and familiar scenes, while fun to watch because of Jolie, leaves mostly everyone else lacking in a multitude of ways.For example, the story of Stefan cutting off Maleficent's wings is weak for considering The Moors just went to war, at the time, with the humans, and now one is around their unofficial queen, it is odd to me that no one saw him drug her, almost kill her, much less see him cut off her wings and take them out of their kingdom. For, even if it was night time, you'd think one of the creatures would have been awake and heard something.Overall: TV ViewingWhile I love Angelina Jolie, and do wish she would participate in more movies, at the same time it makes her rare appearances all the more worthwhile. And, without any doubt, I can definitely say that I can't imagine any other actress who could play Maleficent. But, even with that said, Jolie is so relied on to make this film watchable that you are left with the feeling that Disney in fact is just trying to cash in. Though I do hope it does well if just because I would like to see Ursula get her own movie. Hopefully with the production actually inspired, and focused, on the source material.",Maleficent

87,jadepietro,Witchy Woman,3,19 June 2014,"This film is not recommended.Once upon a time there was a terrible idea that became a movie. Its name was Maleficent, a gaudy and fussy retelling of the beloved fairy tale. The film suffers from a lack of real imagination, bad acting, less than stellar visual effects, and a villainess that really was just hopelessly misunderstood. As the saying goes, a woman shorn is a woman scorned and that is the underlying theme in this dud.Angelina Jolie's cheek bones and ruby red lips play the evil Maleficient. Ms. Jolie is a stunning prop. As Trixie Delight once said, ""And don't think bone structures not important."" It's one of the only thing that this film has going for it. Except for an exciting dragon sequence, the film is a deadly dull affair. Who needs a spinning wheel needle to put you asleep! Maleficent does that task within fifteen minutes.Aimlessly directed by Robert Stromberg, the film is is a shambles of misguided narrative and banal dialog. The screenplay by Linda Woolverton is Grimm indeed. This revision paints our evil fairy as an anti-hero who was cruelly used by a man and its preachy message of women's empowerment is more than slightly overdone, as are the battle scenes. Poorly filmed to the point that the action becomes a blur, which might be beneficial after all when experiencing this goofy story.Ms. Jolie, who resembles Lara Croft in leather with matching black wings and horns, delivers her lines with a heavy British accent that wavers from scene to scene, but she does show some restraint playing a cartoon, unlike the hammy and annoying Sharito Copley as King Stefan, the real baddie in this version. This actor shrieks and shouts non-stop throughout his scenes in search of a character. Elle Fanning looks the part of the pretty Aurora but Brenton Thwaites lacks the princely charms. There is some comic relief by Leslie Manville, Imelda Stauton, and Juno Temple as the miniature trio of bumbling fairies and Sam Riley as Maleficent's servant contributes mightily to an underwritten role.Maleficent is an act of malfeasance that creates much injury to the good memory of the Charles Perrault folk tale. The film is waste of your time and the artisans involved. The only happily-ever-after feeling I had was exiting the theater. GRADE: C-",Maleficent

89,Seraphion,A good job on retelling of the classic children's tale,7,2 June 2014,"At first, little Maleficent was a nice fairy. One day she meets Stefan, a human boy from the neighboring human kingdom. The acquaintance grows into a romance until they're adults. But then after his 16th birthday present to her, he doesn't go to meet her anymore. The Human King then sought to conquer the Moors, kingdom of the forest where Maleficent stands guard. She and her forest army managed to repel the attack and injure the King, but he survived because his iron armor wounds her. At his sickbed, the King ordered his men to avenge him by killing Maleficent. Stefan, who turns out to be one of the king's men, meets her in the forest at night, at first warning her of the King's order. But then he betrays her by cutting away her wings while she's asleep. Not long before she knows the truth of Stefan's betrayal and his reasons, and this turns Maleficent from a pure at heart into a vengeful being. Without her wings, but fueled with vengeance, her magic grows stronger. Not long, the new king and queen have a child and throws a grand celebration.As in the tale, the wicked Maleficent came crashing at the celebration, giving the child Aurora a bad wish of eternal slumber on her 16th birthday, which can only be awakened by true love's kiss. Aurora is then kept hidden for 16 years by the good fairies while the king's men tries over and over to siege the Moors to no avail. Over the years Maleficent and her aid crow looks over her without the fairies knowing. At one point Maleficent lets herself be known to Aurora, and Aurora rekindles the love that was once in her. Maleficent tries to cancel her curse on her but fails. Aurora briefly meets Phillip. On the eve of her 16th birthday Aurora discovers the truth of Maleficent. She then goes to her father but the king locks her up in a room. Maleficent snatches the returning Phillip, knowing that he can be the answer for the curse. The curse manifests a spinning wheel and Aurora goes into sleep as her finger is punctured by the needle.Maleficent sneaks into the castle carrying the fainted Phillip and deliver him to Aurora's room. The fairies encourage him to kiss Aurora, but she still sleeps after it. Maleficent, out of her regret kisses Aurora on his forehead, and that kiss awakens her. Maleficent and Aurora then go to see the king but the soldiers capture Maleficent with an iron net. She changes her crow into a dragon that saves her from the net. But the soldiers prepares iron tower shields and block her movement while the dragon is shackled with chains. Aurora slips into a room where her father keeps Maleficent's wings and breaks the cage. The wings fly back and merge back to Maleficent's body, strengthening her. She carries on with the fight and manages to exile the king with her alone on a top of a tower. She holds back her fatal blow but the king stabs her from behind. In retaliation she sort of throws him from the tower. Afetr the king's death, the two kingdoms are united and the story ends well.The base story is an example of a creative retouch on an already well- known story. But instead of being a mere sequel, prequel, remake or reboot, Maleficent promises a fresh story by simple altering the perspective from which the original story is being told. And by having a different perspective, of course there are altered elements of the original story. Much like in a case with more than one witness, some witnesses will have differing elements to the same story.The choice of cast is quite unique from my point of view. The main cast unite the senior Angelina Jolie with the newcomer Elle Fanning. Elle has a great deal on her hands, being to have a significant role in a big break to at least stand on the same standard as her sister Dakota. The supporting cast is filled with stars with remarkable acting capabilities but with relatively no significant role as yet, such as Sharlto Copley, Sam Riley and Imelda Staunton.Yet with those cast of diverse blockbuster experience, the acting proves quite good. No doubt their theater experiences, and the basic setting and story mood that requires less of common-era behavior, helps to boost the perspective towards the acting.The makeup department did a great job overall. Although for me, Maleficent's headdress slightly slipping over forward at the later parts is quite annoying. The music scoring is a great help in building the mood of the scenes, especially on the scenes of battle preparations, appearances and magics. The visual effects are done well giving us enough to live out the fantasy world of the Moors. Although I think that the visual effects is taking more emphasis it should have.From me, Meleficent (2014) deserves a 7 out of 10 score and a recommendation to go and see. It's a good family movie to spend time with.",Maleficent
90,rgkarim,"A New Take, A New Maleficent",8,30 May 2014,"It seems that Disney pumps out a new movie every month these days, as the studio releases yet another film. Instead of baseball throwing Indians though, this weekend's film revives an old tale in a new form. Yes, I'm talking about Disney's Maleficent, director Robert Stromberg's adaptation to the animated Sleeping Beauty. Did he fill the big shoes and hype the trailer's brought? Read on to find outIf you haven't been swept away by the cascade of trailers, this tale focuses on the dark fairy's origins and how she became so wicked. At least that is part of the story. Stromberg took some interesting steps in his rehash, putting enough spin on the tale to make it almost an entirely different story that is sure to bring mixed reviews. I myself rather enjoyed the tale, despite it's predictability, creating a character-centered story with emotion, passion, and a little bit of surprise while still bringing other elements into the tale. Of course the main support of the movie is Angelina Jolie, who captured the villainess in both looks and spirit. Her natural beauty, combined with fantastic makeup and wardrobe, was accentuated in this film, ditching the green skin for a more natural look that radiated power. Jolie's beautiful eyes seemed to act on their own, mirroring the emotions trapped within the dark fairy. Even her voice sounded like Maleficent, grabbing the arrogant and malicious smoothness the cartoon made famous, though her screaming and moaning were a bit overdone. Jolie nailed the spectrum of emotions her part required, and had me fall in love with her acting all over again as well as have a different look on Maleficent. Of course I am a reviewer who likes his balance, and Maleficent fails to spread the acting weight around, relying on Jolie a little too muchThe other cast in this movie were okay, their limited screen time just long enough to bring something to the movie. Sam Riley as Maleficent's raven Diablo er Diaval , was my second favorite of the cast. His character was a mini version of Maleficent; helping to keep the sorceress on her toes, while providing well timed comedic relief to keep the tale running. Elle Fanning brings cuteness and positivity, but doesn't add much more than that, often reduced to walking and smiling at the green screens around her. Sharlto Copley as King Stefan is an important character, but his overstretched accent, and acting made him a bit more humorous than what I think they intended. However, the greatest thing about this movie for me is the world Stromberg and company created. Maleficent's design is gorgeous in all aspects, as the fictional kingdoms come to life in spectacular detail, that would look even better in 3-D. While the human kingdom is fitting, the true masterpiece is the Moors, as the mythical beasts and enchanted creatures come out in dazzling colors and light that fits the whimsical nature befitting fairy tales. The integration of nature into each creature, allowed for a variety of creatures to be seen in the movie, each mirroring their place in the hierarchy of Maleficent's kingdom. My particular favorites were the tree warriors, not just for the action they brought, but for the integration of cultures and movies in their design, though I'll admit they are a bit similar to the tree ents in Lord of the Rings. Maleficent does have some weaknesses at hand. Some of the creatures were a bit too similar familiar characters we've seen in other films, the biggest being the fat elves that look like an overweight Dobby from Harry Potter. The pixie's were my biggest problem. Their design was a bit too fake, exaggerated, and sometimes very similar to what Smeagle would look like as a girl. On top of that, they were airheads that were meant to be funny, but were more annoying, very similar to a certain Star Wars character we all know. I think Stromberg made them the way that Maleficent saw them, but he just went a little too far for my tastes, luckily they aren't in most of the movie. As for the story, the twists are interesting and well needed, but at times I was a bit bored, wanting something else to happen instead of getting an eyeful of Maleficent stalking in the shadows. It seemed they fast-forwarded through some parts, focusing on the visuals and Jolie, more than the actual story. Of course I may have been a little close-minded at parts from my expectations of the film. Maleficent took a different path, but there are so many good elements to this movie that make it worth a trip. Visually it is gorgeous, and Jolie brings so much to the part though it was at the cost of the other actors. Story wise it is fine, but try to go in with an open mind or you may be disappointed with Stromberg's approach. Is it worth the hype? For me it wasn't as good as the trailers made it out to be, but it was still good and emotionally fulfilling, despite some of the odd antics. I would say it is theater worthy to see. In my book Maleficent scores:Action/Adventure/Family: 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",Maleficent
91,raulfaust,Karma Chameleon,8,8 June 2014,"Since some good friends invited me, I went to the cinema to check this picture, knowing nothing about it-- except that Angelina Jolie would be in it. I'm not a fan of animations, and I haven't ever heard about Maleficent's story, but I really enjoyed this movie. Angelina Jolie plays a fairy that due to bad circumstances of her life, becomes relatively mean. The good point that this movie tries to show is that people aren't a hundred percent good or bad. It depends on a lot of circumstances that sometimes are not up to us. In this case, spectator can't distinguish who is the villain. Both main characters have their motivations and do what they feel like doing when the feelings come up. And that's a good thing, considering that children movies used to expose the manicheaist idea of ""good vs. bad"". Also, the special effects are AWESOME, and so is the directing, delivering a professional characterization. The story becomes very cartoonish once Maleficent goes mad and invades the castle to spell the curse. If I was a child, I would surely be scared in that scene. The real love thought is also interesting, being another mark for the genre, along with ""Frozen"". All in all, ""Maleficent"" is a GREAT picture that sets another mark for the genre, and may inspire a lot of other stories from now on.",Maleficent
92,Kamurai25,"""A Second Side of Darkness""",7,13 August 2020,"Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.I'm not a big Angelina Jolie (""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"") fan, but she definitely nailed the part, and I felt for her when those things happened, so I'm definitely not going to say she's not a good actor.Elle Fanning (""The Great"") is great, mostly an annoyingly happy little thing while she's awake, alongside wonderful supporting cast and gorgeous (and sometimes goofy) CG animated creatures.Disney definitely poured money into this to make it look great. They also spent quite the effort to revitalize the story. After rewatching ""Sleeping Beauty"" and some other variations (I did fail to reread the original story), I am definitely a fan of the direction they took. The original story was just so weak and empty, and this does one of my favorite things and humanizes a villain into an adversery into of an evil monster.I'm not a fan of how or why the 3 faeries get involved, but it makes some sense. And I'm very happy with how they handled the resolution of the curse.They created this awesome world which adds to the movie in a very special way.",Maleficent
93,moviexclusive,The truth behind Disney's iconic villain turns out to be a visual treat that could have benefited from a tad more evil,6,29 May 2014,"The folks at The House of Mouse have been known to make you feel good – even in the lousiest of days. On a good day, you'd be thankful for that (Watching Disney productions like Saving Mr Banks and Frozen have had extremely positive effect on depressed people), while on bad days, you wish things could turn a little wicked (Wasn't the mermaid in The Little Mermaid supposed to turn into a bubble and burst? Surely Quasimodo from The Hunchback of Notre Dame could be more hideous?)When we heard that Disney is going to produce a live action movie based on Maleficent, we were thrilled. We're talking about one of the evilest villains from the 1959 classic Sleeping Beauty. That sharply angled face, that irritating crow and need we mention those horns. The Mistress of All Evil, as we know her, wasn't too pleased when she found out that she wasn't invited to the royal christening of the kingdom's infant princess. Cue a terrible curse that would cause the princess to prick her finger and sleep forever, magic potions that look too venomous for comfort and lots of evil crackly laughter.Now, Disney wants to tell you the truth – one that will have you understanding why Maleficent's pure heart was turned to stone, a betrayal that involves a royal kingdom and a dastardly forest and of course, a beautiful princess that may be the key to peace in the land.Or so says the marketing copy.When the publicity trailers were first released online, we were impressed by leading lady Angelina Jolie's uncanny resemblance to the animated Maleficent. That cold glare, that menacing stare and that depraved cackle: Jolie has effortlessly managed to send quivers down our spine. Then came Lana Del Ray's cover of ""Once Upon A Dream"", the single that will serve as the title song for the movie. The American singer songwriter's haunting vocals was a perfect match for what seemed to be a sinister ride down our memory lane of this beloved fairy tale. While the 97 minute movie is a feast for the eyes (cinematography by Dean Semler boasts numerous fantastical scenes filled with fairies and forest creatures), and the action scenes are excitingly choreographed (the battle between man and nature, and the finale showdown between soldiers and a ferocious dragon are easily impressible pieces), you can't run away from the fact that this is a Disney production.Jolie is aptly dark and menacing in her outfits designed by Anna B Sheppard, and the Academy Award winning actress snarls and growls like a true villain, but as the story progresses, you get a nudging feeling that everything will turn out fine in the end. Without giving away too much, yes, it is a happy ending that is so family friendly, you'll wonder where that cynical realism was chucked after leaving the theatre.First time feature director Robert Stromberg (known for his visual effects work on movies like Life of Pi and The Hunger Games) is clearly a visually driven filmmaker. The movie is a joy to look at, and competent performances by a supporting cast of Sharlto Copley as King Stefan, Sam Riley as a raven shapeshifter and Imelda Staunton, JunoTempleand Lesley Manville as the pixie fairies don't hurt the movie either. Bonus points also come in the form of the likable Elle Fanning who takes on the role of Princess Aurora.We just wished that this potentially sinister tale could have been peppered with more ominous cynicism and menace.",Maleficent
94,mike48128,Angelina Jolie Shines in a very scary and curious Fairy Tale,7,7 June 2016,"I pray that the little 5-year-olds dragged to this Disney Mess have recovered by now. Too mean and cruel in several ways and there are not enough words to describe the whole scary movie in detail. It opens all sweet and beautiful. A 5-year-old fairy queen with oversized dark wings and horrendous horns fails in love with Prince Stephen. She grows up hating him, as he spurns her for a human princess and the power of the kingdom, like a medieval Darth Vader. She turns the cute little gnomes into cute little trolls. Creates matchstick men out of dead trees and becomes a genuinely ""Gloomy Glenda"". So predictable that I couldn't sit through the middle of the DVD. I resumed it when she ""cursed"" little Princess Aurora. The 3 good fairies then hide her in the woods for 15 years. Several twists and turns here. She befriends ""Aurora"" and has to reverse her own curse after the teenage girl finds a room of broken spinning wheels. She is drawn to them like a magnet. Maleficent breaks her own curse by kissing Aurora, who she now loves like her own daughter. King Stephan is driven mad and someone else becomes the dragon. Several knights become dragon-toast and Aurora becomes the human queen who unites with the fairy Queendom, overseen by the ""new"" Maleficent. (Yes, Aurora finally gets her ""Prince""). Maleficent flies off into the sunset (really) with her winged sidekick and everybody (left alive) lives happily ever after. Dakota Fanning's sister ""Elle"" is so young and adorable as ""Sleeping Beauty"". Angelina Jolie plays ""Maleficent"" magnificently. The sexiest fairy with creepy giant wings and horns that you have ever seen! Should be rated PG-13. This will give really little kids nightmares for years! Just as ""Pinocchio"" (the 1950's re-release) bothered me for years: cigar smoking ""Lampwick"" ""morphs"" into a donkey and Pinocchio ""dies"" briefly after being swallowed by ""Monstro"" the Whale. Such sweet little ""Disneyfied"" Fairy Tales!",Maleficent
95,Terryfan,Maleficent has it moments,7,27 August 2015,Now I have heard a lot about Maleficent who was the main antagonist of Sleepy Beauty. This film however centers around Maleficent.Angelina Jolie's performance in the movie is very well crafted and that she is actually a fan of Maleficent make her performance that most impressive. She did all she could to look like Maleficent.Elle Fanning plays Aurora and she did what she could in the film. Sharlto Copley plays Stefan and his character you have to watch what he does.The film really present itself with a lot of visuals and powerful effects that are impressive that you have to watch to appreciate. Disney didn't hold anything back on the effects and it is very well crafted.But where I feel the film really feels strange is that the story has been change so much from Sleepy Beauty that you are going to be throw so many curve-balls that you will not believe itNow I know this is a movie about Maleficent it just the whole plot can feel out of place. Also some of the other characters can be annoying.The main thing that makes the film is Jolie's performance and the visual that is what droves the film.I'm not saying I hate the film it just there is a lot of mix results for me. But I do recommend it if you're a fan of the characters and this is one Disney film that you might want to check out I give Maleficent an 7 out of 10,Maleficent
96,MartianOctocretr5,Lots of noise; unimpressive take on this old story,4,18 January 2015,"Remember Sleeping Beauty? Try to picture how it would be if every aspect of it were turned up-side down. You'd have this. The recent outbreak of efforts to rewrite fairy tales and make them more adult and dark is getting to a point where new extremes of darkness and violence are all that is seen, with ever more aggressive themes. Maleficent takes this ""darkness for its own sake"" approach to new levels, but doesn't really come up with anything interesting in its new take on this old story. It fancies itself that way, by cranking out some now exhausted themes like ""evil people are really the good ones' they're just misunderstood,"" There is an act of pointless violence that is an obvious reference to rape, and the story line tries to build a scorned woman motif from that. Ultimately this is offered as an excuse for someone planning to murder an innocent child. Sorry, nobody who wants to kill a child is a hero. Ever.The royal family are all rewritten as power hungry and vicious, and the fairies that once protected the child are stupid, inept, and useless. I was wondering who was doing all the mugging and overacting underneath all that Maleficent costuming. Who else: Angelina Jolie being self-important, trying hard to be a frightening screen presence. She tries to chew up every scene she's in with glares and monotonal line reads. She seems to think (and she's done this in several movies now) that if she's wearing black, she's a scary villain. No, just one you look forward to seeing her get exterminated so she'll shut up.Special effects are impressive, but always overdone. Every battle looks like something George Lucas and Michael Bay came up with when they got drunk together one night. Acting is poor throughout, and the director's heavy-handed approach is loud but never interesting.This movie tries hard to impress you with smoke and mirrors, but does not succeed.",Maleficent

Many of us have forgotten to stand up for our Second Revision Rights: ""Our Ruler will make no law to prevent us from bearing and spinning wool."" It doesn't matter how many pixies go on needle-cursing rampages, the Disney Conglomerate reminds us in MALEFICENT. Regardless, Big Government has NO RIGHT to confiscate the personal spinning wheels of its citizens just because a few bad apples misuse them to harm society. We MUST retain our full God-given rights to spin anywhere AND at any time AT ALL COSTS! Only a crazy dictator would try to gather up and destroy all a nation's wheels, in order to keep the entire population from spinning. If spinning is outlawed, only outlaws will be able to spin! Or, to paraphrase Charlton Heston, the only way the jack-booted thugs will take away our spinning wheels is to pry them out of our cold, dead hands! People get killed in America's prisons every day with spoons. Are they going to take away our spoons, too?! How will we eat our soup and ice cream then?

Lord of the Rings series , Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter etc have entertained the audience all over the world. Maleficent is true attempt to the genre. After getting betrayed in love, a witch curses an infant who is supposed to bring peace and harmony to the troubled land.First time director Robert Stromberg, who worked previously as Visual Effects supervisor does a fabulous job in keeping the audience alive. The story is similar to the fairy tale "" Sleeping Beauty"" which has been tweaked little for good. Art direction is mesmerizing. Cinematography is brilliant. Background score is soothing. Editing is perfect. Screenplay does falls short of being excellent but smooths well keeping you entertained. It is Angelina Jolie who is the captain of the ship.

Graphics is similar in all, as is the story and stunts (flying, magic, war...). Also Angelina and others here look very confident playing their role, as if they are born for it. Unrealistic, but that is appropriate for such cartoon or kids movie. Bit negative at the end, but appropriate for the situation and earlier events, just like it is appropriate to defend ourselves in the war, even if we have to kill.

104,thekarmicnomad,Very pretty but oh so stupid.,3,29 January 2015,"This is an attempt at giving Sleeping Beauty the 'Wicked' treatment. Tries, and fails dismally.First of all the magic kingdom is fantastic, with lots of bright CGI forest dwelling folk frittering around the screen. This will be enough for most small children to get their moneys worth.Above that this film is awful. The plot does not work on any level. Now I know this is a children's fairy tale, no one is rewriting Shawshank here but the story is so awful it is insulting to the intelligence of infants.Basically the producer has gone down a check list of standard movie elements. So we need a flying scene, a battle scene, a magic forest, a princess. Check, check , check, check. Then at the last minute someone remembered they had to hammer the whole thing into an alternate Sleeping Beauty.Small children will be entertained by the graphics, adults will be dumb founded by the unnecessary moronic story.

107,PartialMovieViewer,Males-Need-Not-Apply-a-Cent – Still Enjoyable,5,22 June 2014,"On the surface, this movie had some outstanding ingredients. Angelina's hypnotic screen presence is only matched by the film's co-star, the ever so talented CGI. And, I understand this was a first for the director, I must say this was a very commendable jobvery commendable. With so many awesome components, I don't know what happened on the way to the blending bowl, did someone trip over an ego and spill the compassion? Whatever occurred, the mix really spoiled. Hmmm, maybe it was the writing? Ya – think? The script itself seemed mechanically OK, but the intent of the narrative was very troubling - but clear. Don't worry, I got the message, men, sons and boys are no longer welcomed at future Disney Productionsroger that. I don't know if the fervency of the divisiveness was intentional, or maybe it just happened. It just seemed the writer's concoction of women-empowerment and the mutation of 'evil' Maleficent to 'good' Maleficent, was entirely trumped by a goodly amount of in-your-face misandry. Good job, I really hated men leaving the theater. Not really, but what was supposed to be some kind of empowerment story, was twisted into a spite-filled segregationist message. I don't know if this was the writers' intent or was it 'Disney's'? Meh – who cares, I am over it. Honestly there were just too many good things about this movie to give it a bad review. I doubt this will become some kind of a classic – come on - the fairytale concept has been replaced by some sexual vendetta scheme. Angelina Jolie was spectacular, the rest of the cast were lackluster and forgettable. The scenery and camera work were breathtaking. The director did a very good job and the overall flick was very entertaining. Will I buy the DVD? Let's see, I have two daughters, a wife and two female cats – well duh – I lose. Of course I will purchase the DVD. I will put it right next to my copies of 'Tomb Raider' and 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith.'",Maleficent
108,adamscastlevania2,Too little girl focused,6,28 August 2014,"(55%) Without doubt a mixed bag. The opening 10 or so minutes are far too sweet and kid friendly for my taste, but the real fly in the soup is the fact that Maleficent herself is at no point actually evil in the slightest. She is for the most part slightly bitter, much more so than out-and-out evil, or even bad, and as there's no real arc to her character the movie feels a little hollow and somewhat lacking. Jolie though is pretty fantastic and the movie splutters whenever she's off screen, but the 3 annoying fairy characters are given far too much attention that they really don't warrant in the slightest deducting from some good, exciting scenes. Overall If it had more bite, and the script was polished to a higher degree then this could have been a classic in waiting, but sadly not.",Maleficent
109,gkeith_1,Smashing performance by Jolie.,10,23 August 2014,"My observations: Number one. (Repeat). Smashing performance by Angelina Jolie. A wide range of emotions. Plus, her being beautiful is a definite plus. Evil and happy; young and older. Executive decision making, and strong feminine leadership abilities. Fantastic costuming, perfection of makeup and prostheses for her -- horns on her head, gigantic and powerful wings, etc. She really loved Aurora. No, I did not see the earlier movie. I did see Maleficent portrayed in the TV show, ""Once Upon A Time"", however. Maleficent there was shown to be a really evil villainess.In this newer Disney movie, Maleficent shows hope, disappointment, military prowess, as well as fear and love. She has a tender side. Her youthful friend/boyfriend ends up becoming king, and an evil king. As a matter of fact, he figuratively sticks the knife in her back by removing/stealing her gigantic wings to give to the dying soon-to-be-previous king.I was wondering if later on Maleficent thought that the baby should have been one that she would have had with the new king, but instead of course he became king and married someone else. That backstory I do not remember -- how King Stefan met and married the queen. Maybe I missed something, but of course it was ""arranged"". No wonder Maleficent had a soft spot for Baby Aurora.Oh yes, but vengeance can be very sweet. Still, did Maleficent ever have her own true love? Was true love's kiss from Maleficent meant to be a neo-feminist vision of the love of a mother or strong mother figure? Incredibly, the teenage Aurora thought of Maleficent as her own fairy godmother -- and later Aurora was told that Maleficent was an evil fairy.I also liked how the raven was turned into a man, and also the types of animals and monsters he was changed into according to the commands of Maleficent. That was stunning makeup and presto-change-o, plus special effects. It was a very interesting process. He always had to do Maleficent's bidding because she saved his life. I even thought he would be the romantic one involved with Aurora.This is, I feel, a wonderful tale in order to get the viewer away from the realities of the outside world. The forest scenes were spectacular, as were the interiors and exteriors of the beautiful castle.There is no traditional singing and dancing here, which you already know are my favorites. I did enjoy, however, the jumping and dancing antics of the short green monsters in Maleficent's world. I also enjoyed seeing the small flowing fairies fly around, the ones performing for Aurora's approving benefit.10/10",Maleficent
110,RforFilm,A good performance and some nice imagery can't save Maleficent from a poor script and unconvincing CGI,4,3 June 2014,"To quote Wicked, ""Are people born wicked, or do they have wickedness thrust upon them? "". Wicked was the first medium I know that looked at a famous story like The Wizard of Oz and reexamined the tale from a different point of view, mainly the villains to show that the wicked witch was not a bad guy, just a misunderstood human. I saw this as an interesting change in story that can unveil one-dimensional villains as more then bullies or devils. It even asks who the real villain of the story is. This new twist excited mefor a while. Frozen took the same stance with The Snow Queen as did other fairy tale movies like Hoodwinked, Happily N'ever After and Mirror, Mirror. The examination of villains as good guys has become a cliché that I'm growing somewhat sick of. I don't think it's a bad idea, but the people that try and reexamine the bad guys tend to change the original story to such an extent that it's no longer the classic fairy tale or they make the motivations and conventions illogical to the personality of the character. Sleeping Beauty now has the chance to show a new side in Maleficent. The movie stars by showing us a land that has two kingdoms; one for the humans and one for the Moors (some term for magical folk). It looks promising when we get a glimpse at a young Maleficent, a good fairy who comes across a young boy named Stefan where it's revealed that there's some hatred between fairies and humans. We cut to some time later when Stefan becomes heir to the throne by cutting off the wings of Maleficent and straining the relationship between magical creatures and humans more when she decides to use her powers for darkness.As revenge for steeling her wings, Maleficent (played by Angelina Jolie) goes to the christening of Aurora and delivers a curse-gift, proclaiming that by touching the needle on the spindle on her sixteenth birthday, the child will fall into a death-like sleep. King Stefan (played by Sharlto Copley) orders every spindle burned and that three fairies, Knotgrass, Thistlewit, and Flittle, to take Aurora into the woods to raise her. Maleficent keeps a close eye on the child, sort of becoming an accidental mother to Aurora when the three fairies prove to be incompetent. At sixteen, Aurora (played by Elle Fanning) believes Maleficent to be her fairy godmother (this got a laugh out of me) and the mistress of evil seems to be having second thoughts about the curse. I'll admit that I curious about Maleficent, as the original villain from Sleeping Beauty had given me nightmare for a while. While she's not as scary, Angelina Jolie is an ideal choice. She has the right face and keeps her cool attitude in check while balancing out being evil and being a mother. Elle Fanning also does well enough with what she's given, and the poor screenplay only has her smile and feed deer. Did I say bad? The story here strays too far from the Sleeping Beauty story to be considered part of the story. Maleficent follows the route of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland and puts the focus on it's CGI environment. The result is similar with many of the effects ranging from really good to obviously phony. The movie simply assumes that no one will tell the difference from real and computer generated. In fact, half the time, I thought I was watching a cut scene from a video game then an actual movie. How about a little combination of animatronics?Taking the eye candy CGI out of the picture, how's the full story? Though it's not the worst, this is just a bland fairy tale that's meant for children only (or those just looking for a fairy tale), giving pretty imagery and uninteresting characters. Why couldn't Maleficent had focused on the political aspects of the fairy and human kingdoms. Had it gone with that route, we might have gotten material that rivals Game of Thrones. But as it is, this is a popcorn fantasy only for those that aren't looking for anything meaty.I'll give this two Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty out of five. It didn't do me any bit except for some nice imagery, but I'm sure there is a large audience that will make this a hit. I'll stick with Sleeping Beauty myself, thank you.",Maleficent

113,bob-the-movie-man,An effective children's film that could instill movie wonder in younger audiences,7,9 June 2014,"I'm always a sucker for a good story, and you have to admit that – at their hearts – some of the fairy tales are corkers. Sleeping Beauty is a case in point. Tension, narrative drive, good vs evil and – thanks to writers Jack Lawrence and Sammy Fain – a gloriously memorable Disney song in ""Once upon a dream"".The new Disney reimagining of the fable – Maleficent – takes some liberties with the story in serving up a star vehicle for Angelina Jolie, who was also an executive producer on the picture. In the story, we see the young and carefree Maleficent, strongest of the fairies in the magical land of ""The Moors"", corrupted by the greed and avarice of man who inhabit the neighbouring kingdom. Betrayed and mutilated by Stefan – the man who would be king – a vengeful Maleficent places the famous curse upon Stefan's daughter who is grows up in the care of the bickering red, blue and green fairies as featured in the animated version, here played by Imelda Staunton, Leslie Manville and Juno Temple.Maleficent is aided and abetted in her evil plans by henchman come crow come wolf Diaval, played by Sam Riley (so good in ""Brighton Rock"", but here looking all the world like UK jazz star Jamie Cullum).Angelina Jolie's beauty is evident, but it is a strange and angular beauty and just perfect for this role. In fact it is difficult to imagine any other actress that could play this. You might imagine the role to be fairly two-dimensional, but the twist given to the story allows some significant range for Jolie to explore, and she does it very well.The evil and deranged Stefan is played by Sharlto Copley – continuing his bad-guy roles following ""District 9″ and ""Elysium"".Elle Fanning, younger sister of Dakota and so effective in Super 8, plays the teenage Aurora, in a suitably smiley, sweet and totally asexual Disney manner. Perhaps its just me, but at times I think she has a striking resemblance to a young Drew Barrymore. A particular star of the show is the baby that plays the young Aurora: if this kid grows up to be a film star this footage will feature strongly in ""Before they were famous"". Also worthy of note is the five year old Aurora played by Jolie's real life daughter Vivienne. The scenes are quite special, in the manner of a ""what the hell are you doing wearing those big horns on your head Mummy?"".I was first attracted to this film in part due to the gorgeously spooky rendition of ""One upon a Dream"" played over the trailer. And we hear it in full over the end titles. I'm embarrassed that it took me until the titles to realise it was Lana Del Rey – of course it is!! The rest of the score, by James Newton Howard, is suitably orchestral and supports the drama well.The special effects are excellent, from the imagining of the mystical land of the Moors to the effective fire-breathing dragon in chains, so feared by generations of kids under the Disneyland Paris castle.This is fundamentally a kids film. But it is a good kids film, and if you took a sensitive five or six year old to see this they might be infected with the wonder and love of cinema that followed my inoculation by Mary Poppins at a similar age. And whilst there is mild peril to alarm kids, there are none of the emotional plot jolts that infect some similar films like Bridge to Terabithia (which this has some similarities with): it certainly has a much lower traumatisation quotient compared to that shocker! Where the film lacks something is in the crossover to a potential adult audience. Cute baby aside, there are not a lot of laughs in this which is an opportunity missed. There is a lot of very plodding dialogue all on a very one-dimensional plane and I feel that having a sparky writer of the likes of a Jane Goldman, to add a layer of adult humour 'above the heads' of the junior audience, would have spiced the recipe up significantly.(If you enjoyed this review, please see my other reviews at bobmann447.wordpress.com, and sign up to ""Follow the Fad""!

116,DarthVoorhees,"The worst kind of Disney film, the kind that condescendingly talks down to kids",4,7 November 2014,"'Maleficent' has some intriguing concepts. The idea of a villain having their side of the story told has been popular and I can see why. Fairy tales have just become so bland with such rigid characterizations that unless there is a commentary on the genre they just become boring. 'Maleficent' begins with the notion that only a villain or a great hero could save this kingdom. I'm sold. The problem is 'Maleficent's title character is such a teddy bear that there is no fun or characterization to the villainy because she never really becomes a villain. My only conclusion is that Disney did not think it's target audience could comprehend anything but a straight forward fairy tale.Angelina Jolie is not allowed to give any edge to Maleficent. She never truly becomes villainous. Sure there are creepy trappings and set pieces surrounding her but they are just there for aesthetic effect. Maleficent is given a pretty tragic back story and it is a good starting point to begin a characterization. Maleficent's wings are stolen by an old crush. I think the audience, even a young Disney audience, would forgive the script and follow it if Maleficent turned her rage into actual acts of villainy. Instead we are merely treated to Jolie's character at her worst dressing in black and humming spooky. This is lazy and condescending to the audience. Mainly because Maleficent isn't a character but a caricature. The promise of exploring the innermost pain of this character is never delivered. When the 'Sleeping Beauty' elements enter the story the whole thing just becomes a warm cuddly fairy tale. Elle Fanning plays Aurora like the worst of Disney princesses. She is bright eyed and has no spunk or edge to her whatsoever, you can almost smell the pixie dust. Worse yet is that Jolie has no real jealousy or animosity towards her at all. I realize that over the course of the film she is to be redeemed but there is nothing to be redeemed of. It's truly a shame 'Maleficent' is a failure because stories like this are beneficial to children. I like the idea of these supposed warped fairy tales because they show kids that labels are harmful and to look for the positive qualities in all people. 'Maleficent' is more like the harmful Disney tales of past which perpetuate negative world views through easy thematic choices and images of over theatrical beautiful people and ugly villains. 'Maleficent' needed to not necessarily go darker but deeper and find a dramatic arc in the title character. It's really just Angelina Jolie playing fairy tale dress up with action sequences stolen verbatim from better fantasy films.",Maleficent

The movie is certainly scary and violent without being gory, but definitely don't take little kids to see this one. It will be quite unsuited for them.Maleficent begins life as an immature fairy in a beautiful, harmonious fairy world next to a conventional and harsh kingdom. She is visited by Stefan, a boy of a similar age from the kingdom, who implies that someday he will live in the king's castle. An innocent romance begins, but soon ends as the boy grows older, and the current ruler of the kingdom attempts to invade the fairy world with his army to steal its treasures, only to fail. As the old king is dying, Stefan claims the throne by amputating and stealing the fairy's wings. He gets the crown, marries, and has a baby daughter...only for the now-embittered and vengeful Maleficent to arrive and place a curse on the daughter. Stefan is forced to have his daughter raised by three fairies to try to keep her safe...and in the process, becomes embittered and vengeful himself. But over the years, as the daughter grows up, unaware of what had happened, Maleficent sees her and starts having second thoughts. But the cold war has started between Maleficent and Stefan; can Maleficent undo the damage she has done?Like most characters in recent fairy tale-themed movies, nobody is entirely good or evil, and everyone is the victim of the attitudes of their respective cultures and eras.

120,mfellipecampos,Very good,8,9 December 2020,"The plot revolves around 'Sleeping beauty' from the point of view of the Malevolent fairy who, betrayed, is blinded by hatred and a feeling of revenge. The film can entertain two types of audiences, both children and those who have seen the 1959 animation in the past. The story is reimagined under the events of the Brothers Grimm story. Angelina was able to clearly demonstrate the feelings portrayed in Maleficent. His features, screams, looks, laughter, everything was magnificently touching. Watching this film is like discovering the great mystery behind the character's story. The new art brings a new look at Maleficent, King Stefan, Princess Aurora, Prince Phillip, the Diaval raven. The story tries to show a world that no one has ever seen, as Angelina Jolie said. The film's plot revolves around a beautiful and naive fairy with penetrating black spoiler wings: Maleficent leads a life of peace in the kingdoms of the Moors, having grown up in this peaceful kingdom; until one day, the humans, seeing the rise of the Moors, decide to exterminate them, threatening the harmony of the region. Maleficent is portrayed, at the same time, as villain and heroine, she being the real Sleeping Beauty, for having her beautiful personality asleep and forgotten in the midst of these new feelings of revenge, bringing an anti-heroine role. The great innovation of 'Maleficent' was the story being told from a point of view that until then was unknown, even giving us several moral lessons, such as being careful with the thirst for revenge, because we can regret it later. spoiler: The film is also innovative in portraying other forms of love, not being attached to the classic imposition of love Eros, between two people of opposite sexes, a characteristic present in the classic Disney fairytale animations. The film is directed by Robert Stromberg, a specialist in visual effects, who left the audience gaping with the effects in 'Maleficent' as well as in 'Alice in Wonderland' or 'Avatar', winning the Oscar for his better work as an art director in these films. The soundtrack composed by James Newton Howard was also magnificent, epic, and related well with the environment of the film. As for the script, written by Linda Woolverton, it is touching, exciting, impressive and lively. The way of portraying events that were not revealed in 'Sleeping beauty' was perfect. The question of '' Why did she cast the curse? '' Has never been well explained, and made us see Maleficent as just a bad, hate-filled witch. However, in this overproduction of Stromberg, the way she was wronged and wants her revenge is revealed from beginning to end.Film reviewed on December 8, 2020.",Maleficent

122,Laakbaar,True love does exist,8,10 June 2014,"This is a terrific, beautiful, well-written, meaningful, sometimes humorous movie.In ""Maleficent"" we have a fairy queen who becomes twisted, bitter and vengeful after a childhood lover betrays her and brutally mutilates her. Angelina's wailing drives the point home. ""True love doesn't exist"", she spits out venomously. But in the end she discovers that anger is not the way and that true love does exist after all — just not as she imagined it. And, nope, she doesn't need a husband.In ""Frozen"" we had an ice queen who rejected her destiny, family and kingdom, preferring a cold and lonely life in which she could emote freely and exercise her real powers. But in the end she discovered that this isolation only hurt her and others. She could still be herself, master her powers and rule her kingdom. And, nope, she didn't need a husband either.Disney and other Hollywood filmmakers have long tapped into our cultural negative stereotypes of women. But now in the age of psychological understanding and gender equality, these stereotypes have become uncomfortable. Things are never black and white. We now know that the ice queen was hurt in the past; the evil stepmother fears abandonment; the wicked witch was abused as a child; the creepy spinster has a secret. The flip side of this coin is that we know all girls are not princesses, all mothers not saints. Isn't it time for Hollywood to stop reflecting these stereotypes of women based just on what they are? You've got to hand it to Disney for trying to turn things around. In modern celluloid fairy tales, the moral is more nuanced. Women and men look at relationships very differently, surely a key message we want girls to learn before puberty. Girls do not need to be rescued and should not go through life looking for it. Another message is that if prince charming does not come alongor is not so charming after allor turns out to be not really what you want at all — well, a girl can still lead a happy life and find love in her own way. The stereotype of prince charming is deliberately, almost coldly denied in these movies. This is apparently a message that women screen writers and film makers rightly need to pass on to the next generation. And fathers barely escape either. Nothing is black and white, totally good or totally evil. We don't hold those values anymore as a society, and our fairy tales should reflect that.But don't fret too much about this. In these two movies, there is also a princess who does find her prince charming. So the old stereotype is still in there for those who cherish it. All I can say is: wow, Disney, keep it up!",Maleficent

124,SquigglyCrunch,A Bad Spin-Off That Tries to Humanize a Villain Without Giving them any Developmental Scenes,3,21 March 2017,"Maleficent is a spin-off of the Disney classic 'Sleeping Beauty'. It follows the main villain in an attempt to modernize the entire story. The main goal of the movie appeared to be to humanize the villain, Maleficent. However, the best time to humanize this character was right at the beginning, and it's idea of 'trying' was narrating a generic back story for the character without giving her any dialogue or lines or anything that would make the audience relate to her. The narrator simply told us her characteristics, and that was that. Nobody hears a narrator say ""She was kind"" and thinks ""Oh yeah, I relate to that"". You have to see that kindness on screen the fully understand and relate to it, and there was none of that. So that didn't work, but maybe the rest of the movie is good, after all it is Sleeping Beauty. Other than the rest of the characters, all of whom are bland and uninteresting, the acting was sub-par at best. They were completely over-acted which, again, makes it hard to relate to the characters. The special effects were on and off. Sometimes they were good, sometimes they were terrible, mostly being the latter. And in a movie all about fantasy and magic and basically revolving around CGI, that isn't really a good thing. One thing that I got a kick out of though were the action scenes. They were terrible, mind you, but they were terrible in a funny way. In every single action scene the camera would focus on a character, then quickly zoom in on their face after a moment of hesitation, and it was hilarious. It was like this were a video game where the player was looking for something and they suddenly spotted it, at which point their vision zooms in to get a better idea of what they're looking at. Maybe that doesn't make sense, but you'll know it when you see it. It's so bad, yet it's so funny. Overall Maleficent just sucks. It's just a bad movie. It's kind of funny, but for all the wrong reasons. The characters are so bland robots could've played them and nothing would've changed. The CGI is usually bad, the humanizing attempt was both clear and bad, and the action was downright awful. In the end I suggest you leave this one on the shelf, whatever shelf that may be, and watch something else.",Maleficent

126,billygoat1071,Sympathy of the Villain,5,28 May 2014,"Maleficent is ought to tell the backstory of one of Disney's most formidable villains. Definitely, there might be a dark truth about an innocent outcast transformed into the monster the villain is now famously known for. There could be a possible inspirations from famous tragedies into the drama. Meanwhile, when you somehow realize the fact that the person behind this project is only known for special effects, indeed you'll get the best looking blockbuster you'll see this year. Unfortunately, that wasn't supposed to be the key merit of this story. Maleficent suffers for the lack of gumption of portraying true darkness and depth that this tale calls for, which results a disappointing origins of the classic villain.Telling a backstory of a villain doesn't always have to be tricky, one I could suggest is a Shakespeare inspired tragedy type of storytelling, because apparently that is what perfectly fits to their themes, but the film rather focuses on the aesthetics. The story itself is about sympathizing the villain, like pointing them as the real victim of the world's darkness because of the people's lack of tolerance in their strangeness. This idea is obvious for sure, but it all falls short by the script's lack of real depth. It doesn't really have any interest at developing much of its characters, especially when it comes to relationships. Princess Aurora's friendship with her supposedly enemy is nothing more than an exposition to their world and admiration to its beautiful creatures. There is no genuine emotional impact and it hurts a lot of elements. While betrayal and threat are the vital point of the story, the shallowness of the film refuses to make them feel like they're a big deal.So really, it could have focused a lot more on the characters and only let the narrator talk in the intro and the epilogue. The film surely has enough time to linger on the characters. Instead, it lingers more on how beautiful everything in this world looks. We shouldn't blame at the director's fascination with his own skill, in fact it is the only thing that brings it to life. The effects are indeed eye candy, the production and costumes are totally rich, and the cinematography could be perfectly use for something iconic. But again, this is not what the movie generally asks for. The visuals could have worked better in a superhero movie or any fantasy that is mainly about action, but a story like this should always be at the heart of the drama and not of the action or landscapes.The performance at least beats the contrivance. Angelina Jolie, as expected, shines as Maleficent. Though there's only one scene that will totally amaze the audience which also had already been seen in Sleeping Beauty. But overall she brings the soul of the character thus makes this Maleficent really effective. The other cast doesn't do much. Elle Fanning is undeniably charming as Princess Aurora. Too bad, manifesting her innocence is the only thing the script can make her do. Manville, Stauton, and Temple are mostly use for comic relief, and it becomes so broad, the fairies end up becoming like a female version of The Three Stooges.Maleficent has plenty of great technical achievements and solid acting, but the problem really is its lack of darkness. Aesthetically, it is dark, but thematically and emotionally, this is where it becomes underwhelming. It makes the 1959 Sleeping Beauty movie looks darker and will scare children more than this supposedly grim prequel. So the main message is basically Maleficent's evilness is actually just an illusion that is made up by the ones who have a problem of accepting people who are different. Well, that is just one of them. All of its messaging could have worked better if the characters and their interactions to each other are also well developed. Still, these things doesn't even justify on what makes this villain so compelling. Overall, it's neither bad nor good, it's just not the movie Maleficent deserves to be.",Maleficent
127,DareDevilKid,"You Only Think You Know the Story, but this One, in Many Ways, is so Much Better",9,9 September 2014,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 stars (an extra 0.2 stars solely for Angelina Jolie's exemplary performance)Once upon a time, a fairy girl, Maleficent, and a human boy, Stephan, dared to breach the boundary separating their two worlds, and they became extremely close. As the human boy grew into a man, he became ambitious and took to the service of his king; as the fairy girl matured, she remained the protector of her fairy kin but longed for Stephan's return to her world. After an unprovoked battle by the mortal kingdom against the fairy border, the human army is decimated and their king placed upon his deathbed after succumbing to the retaliation of Maleficent (Angelina Jolie). When the dying king offers his throne in exchange for revenge, Stephan (Sharlto Copley) returns to his childhood friend but betrays her, leaving her devastated and abandoned. Maleficent reciprocates at the christening of King Stefan's first- born, cursing the infant princess to a terrible fate that only a vague notion of true love might undo. In the years waiting for the curse to be effected, Maleficent begins to question her vengeance against the blossoming but innocent Princess Aurora (Elle Fanning) while the man who truly deserves her ire prepares for the day he knows the dark fairy will come for him at last.There were so many ways for this live-action retelling to go horribly wrong, and yet it remains surprisingly faithful to the original while recreating the title character as an infinitely more complex creature. Angelina Jolie proves her acting mettle in every glance, speaking volumes without saying a word; it's hard to imagine anyone else playing this part after seeing what Jolie brought to the role. Likewise, Aurora's demotion from the main character to supporting cast member neither undermines her nor renders her irrelevant, re-purposing her through Elle Fanning's portrayal as the instrument that un-blackens a heavy heart. Sharlto Copley plays the mad king well, a man obsessed with keeping his power received through betrayal. Sam Riley adds a wonderfully additional foil to Maleficent's darker moods as Diaval - a rescued raven she can command and turn into a man or anything else she might find readily useful. While the cast alone put the film on the right track, it's a combination of all the elements both behind and in front of the camera that bring the movie into perfect focus.The production design, cinematography, and unblemished CGI effects fill in all the remaining elements needed to complete the atmosphere of the story - the human kingdom overshadowed by the king's castle, the stone guardians that mark the border to the fairylands, a spellbinding magical world forbidden to the human populace, and all manner of creatures to populate this magical world. It's all mostly computer-generated, of course, but it plays perfectly to the fantasy and fears of the characters involved in the story as a character itself. If ""Maleficient"" a bit, it's in the editing where some of the scenes could have done with a more seamless continuity. Also, visual effects wizard, Robert Stromberg, directing his first feature film, tends to stumble a tad while handling the plot transitions between drama and action. Barring this visible glitch, he shows good promise and does a decent job of narrating the plot.There's a moment that defines the mood of the entire film – hinted at in the preview trailers – where Aurora asks her dark watcher to come out and face her, saying, ""I know who you are."" Maleficent seems delighted to be recognized for the antagonist she perceives herself to be, stepping into the light to take a wicked bow. When Aurora surprises the dark fairy with her reaction, Jolie utters a spot-on repartee without sacrificing a hint of her intensity, a wonderful character reveal that she can still be surprised so deep into her dark transformation, alluding to the distinct possibility that beneath all those dark layers her purity and goodness might still be hidden somewhere.With wanton dark material for a story adapted from a children's tale and willing to stay true to it, ""Maleficent"" walks a balanced line between revealing the darkness in the light and finding the light in the darkness. So what if the dark fairy isn't quite as irredeemable as her Disney animated counterpart; it's just as satisfying watching Maleficent give her oppressors all the rope they need to hang themselves with.",Maleficent
128,TheSquiss,"Dull, twee fairy tale adaptation saved only by production design & Jolie's sexy, withering villainess.",4,13 June 2014,"Think you know the story of Sleeping Beauty? Think again. At least, that's the intention of Robert Stromberg's directorial debut, Maleficent.The double Oscar-wining production designer (of Avatar and Alice in Wonderland) cherry-picks from Charles Perrault's original story, La Belle au Bois Dormant, and Disney's subsequent bastardization, gives a backstory to the malignant fairy that cursed the newborn Princess Aurora and then changes Well, you'll just have to see for yourself.Stromberg's intention is good, the production design is mostly superb and he's landed himself a fantastic leading lady in Angelina Jolie as the deliciously evil Maleficent. Top marks so far. The second official trailer (ignore the third, 'let's show everything' trailer) enticed me so much that I overturned my initial reticence and took a punt. The use of Lana Del Rey's reimagining of Once Upon A Dream from the 1959 Disney film as the trailer's score is wonderfully haunting and chills the spine. So why is it squandered on the final credits of the full film when 98% of the audience has departed with joy in their hearts? And so it is with Maleficent.It begins with an unforgivable and horrendous narration that goes on and on patronizingly, annoyingly, endlessly and is then relied upon frequently when Stromberg has run out of ideas to tell his story. Not even the talent of Janet McTeer can make the narration palatable. If boredom set in early, relief when actors upon the screen took up the story was short-lived. How, with a budget on this scale (about $180m) is it not possible to find two child actors to play the young Maleficent and Stefan who can actually act? And the poor performances don't stop with the children, although to be fair to Elle Fanning, a more than capable actress, one of the gifts bestowed upon her Aurora at birth is perpetual happiness even in the face of adversity. What a pity Stromberg directs her to grin inanely at everything around her. The effect is not the beautiful, heartwarming child we should all fall for and want to protect but a horribly, painfully, artificially happy moron for whom a curse-induced coma cannot arrive quickly enough.As for Brenton Thwaites (Prince Philip, the Prince Charming character), his performance is so shockingly stilted he appears to have an entire tribe of broomsticks bound together and rammed up his ass.Sharlto Copley plays Aurora's father, King Stefan, with a certain melodramatic flare, but we've to come expect that from him and it works perfectly here. It also serves to differ his reign from that of the former monarch, King Henry, played with panache by British stalwart Kenneth Cranham.There is light relief from the trio of fairies (Imelda Staunton, Lesley Manville and Juno Temple) but the occasional, weak attempt at slapstick that usually involves them only serves to diminish the impact that Maleficent should have.The sets are beautiful and the effects mostly spectacular, bar the occasional oversight like the wolf, which is clunky enough to be the brother of Harry Potter's, Fluffy. The walls that clatter apart in Maleficent's wake are fantastic, and the incidental fauna and flora are reminiscent of all that was good about Avatar and, to a certain degree, Oz the Great and Powerful, another of Stromberg's production design triumphs.Principally, Stromberg has failed on two counts: 1. He hasn't realized that great children's films (and books) enthrall adults just as much, on their own level and 2. He fails to enthrall the children. Stromberg does; not Angelina Jolie.And so, along with the production design, we come to the reason Maleficent earns four stars instead of just one: Angelina Jolie.But for Jolie Maleficent would be a tedious, dull, twee and horrible experience. Like Charlize Theron in Snow White and the Huntsman, she inhabits her villainess with a cold, vicious, prickly evil that is sexy, sassy and exciting. With a cold, crisp English accent, she frosts the atmosphere and crushes her opponents with a withering stare before unleashing her magical fury. Frequently Stromberg cuts to an ECU of her eyes, beautifully lit to accentuate her fantastically sharpened cheekbones and concentrate the power of her eyes. It is here that Stromberg succeeds. And it is Angeline Jolie who saves him.If I should ever suffer death by fairytale, please don't let it be from boredom caused by an inept director; let it be at the hand of the Angelina Jolie's Maleficent.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Maleficent

However, it still looked awesome-sauce and how can you pass over a film where Angelina Jolie is being a wicked and sinister? Answeryou can't.The special effects in ""Maleficent"" were incredible and really crafted a believable magical world that was full of interesting creatures and whimsy up the wazoo! Additionally, the unique new twist on the ""Sleeping Beauty"" legend was refreshing, fun, and really made Maleficent a sympathetic character that was easy to understand why she made her turn towards the darkness but also cheer when she makes the turn towards the light. Finally, the cast in the film was incredible. Everyone was very entertaining but special mention has to be made to Angelina Jolie who was unbelievable as the powerful fairy. Jolie was not only engaging as Maleficent, she was wicked, delightful, dramatic and, most of all, fun as the character. She really embodied everything the viewer and the story needed from Maleficent.The only real downside I had with the film was I wanted a little more development between the characters of Maleficent and Sharlto Copley's Stefan. While the relationship that is shown work fines and doesn't take away from the drama and excitement, I couldn't help but feel if they had taken a little more time to focus on their doomed love the resulting feelings between the two would have had an even larger impact. However, as it stands, the film shows their relationship just fine and this is only a minor complaint.Since the character of Maleficent terrified me so much as a child, I was hesitant to see the villain in any other light but Disney really made something entertaining and remarkable with ""Maleficent."" It would be easy to write this film off as just another type of remake, reboot, or reimagining that Disney created in order to make more buttloads of cash but it was something much more than that. Nothing about this film felt empty or vacuous but rather exciting, entertaining and meaningful.",Maleficent
130,andrewroy-04316,"Maleficent is exactly what a family movie and what a reimagining should be: smart, visually impressive, and full of heart",8,27 January 2020,"It feels completely ridiculous to put Maleficent in as an 8, along with movies I adore like Nightcrawler, Moon, The Favourite, Sicario, Leave No Trace, and much more, and ahead of 7s like Moonlight (don't kill me!), First Reformed, and even other fun family films like National Treasure or Ice Age 3. I'm making a more conscious effort to rate the movies solely based on what they do for me and independent of my expectations, which are inevitably based on Metacritic scores. And if I throw all the extraneous information out and just think about how satisfied I was with Maleficent, it does deserve an 8, as a great movie.I was already intrigued by the premise and ready to enjoy Maleficent, and throughout the movie I saw pitfalls that I figured the movie would certainly fall into, and I'd think that but to not expect so much. Miraculously, the film was conscious of them and came up with plausible and thoughtful solutions to just about all of them. At its heart, rather than being the same generic cliche messages we see in most Disney movies, I found Maleficent to be a film about greed. Early on, I think they could've leaned even harder into emphasizing Maleficent's love for nature and purity, never knowing any humans and only knowing the wonderful Moors. The plot, while simple, is excellent: she meets a single human and has a great relationship with him, but he ends up having to focus on his human life for a time, and when the king offers a handsome reward for her death, he can't bear to kill her but can't turn down the reward and clips her wings. The complete sense of loss and betrayal she feels with the only person she's ever known makes perfect sense (though I will admit I found her acting in the scene where she awakes to find her wings clipped a weak point in the film). His actions are driven by selfishness, and as that relationship was her only emotional string, she is driven into hatred and rage against him and his people, assuming that all humans are selfish creatures. When she hears he's marrying someone else and having a daughter, what better way to exact revenge on him and take out her jealousy on her than to curse the child? Aurora developing into a wonderful nature-loving girl and Maleficent caring for her and being reminded of her own love for nature was excellent. The scene where they throw mud around with the animals was a highlight. Maleficent's regret and attempt to remove the curse was a nice touch as well. The part I was most concerned about, and what makes Maleficent an 8 for me, is the ending. For one thing, it explains the seemingly arbitrary and bizarre condition on Aurora's curse that true love's kiss would cure it. It makes perfect sense that Maleficent would include that after being betrayed and convinced that true love didn't exist, as if that were true the condition would be tantalizing and devastating for the king. We all know the classic fairy tales end with a kiss from a prince they've barely met, which is a poor message and lazy. Instead, while it was obvious as it came, the kiss from Maleficent to wake Aurora was absolutely heart warming and made perfect sense. Maleficent actually is an ambiguous and well-written character here, clearly flawed but also caring. Jolie does a great job with both the wrathful scenes and the caring, regretful ones. The visuals and cinematography work great for some and not for others, and I fall firmly in the former camp. The film from the outset is unambiguously taking place in a fantasy setting, where a faerie who can manipulate nature is the main character, and I found the CGI Moor scenes to be gorgeous. The shift in coloration as Maleficent is betrayed and her negative energy seeps into all the Moors in darkness and fear was very explicit, and the returning warmth that Aurora brings to Maleficent and the Moors was visually nailed. There are even some interesting themes that weren't at the forefront but were alluded to, including the human propensity to value individual progress over nature and cause climate change, and the strength inherent in what one considers to be their identity. I love Maleficent as a realistic, fascinating character with a great arc, I love her relationship to Aurora, I love the visuals, and I love the pivot from a traditional romance to a deep and nurtured friendship. Maleficent is exactly what a Disney remake can be: smart and mixing the classic tale with modern twists in creative ways. I really hope Mistress of Evil doesn't bring down the major goodwill I have towards these Disney remakes and Maleficent as a character. I will firmly stand up for Maleficent, and as I just put in our hot takes channel, I have it as a top 5 Disney movie of all time (behind Lilo and Stitch, Zootopia, The Lion King, and Mulan).",Maleficent

I heard this movie had its problems but I never expected something so boring. Yes Jolie looks great in the makeup for the older Maleficient but her standing there with big gigantic wings (when I saw them in the trailers I knew the movie was in trouble) she looked really stupid. The other fairies, well they look like fairies. Now they act like the three Stooges but at least they look like fairies; she looked like a vampire from Underworld. The actor who played King Stephon was terrible, every time I heard his voice I just wanted to cringe. The story lacked imagination the ending was just dumb. Snow White and the Huntsman and this movie both have the same problem; one great actor/actress and no plot. Too bad.",Maleficent

135,bbickley13-921-58664,Better than I expected.,7,11 July 2014,"It was a really good fairy tale, or re-imagining of a fairy tale. It's able to come from a dark place like most fairy tales do with out dimming down the Disney light too much. It's very old school Disney story telling that the Mouse house seems to be coming back with.I like how the art direction gave the film this dark and grim look, and I love how the story did not feel the need to point it out. When we first see the lead character, Maleficent, she does not share the look of the stereotypical fairy that Disney pretty much invented with Tinkerbell. Instead the look takes after the folk lore of Fairies and has a very demon like style. One of the better costumes and make-up design in the whole film.Although still very formulated like you'd expect from Disney, the film does not hit a lot of the Fairy tale Stereotypes you expect. Another trend I noticed over at the Mouse house, just a little more respect for the Disney princesses and their role in modern society.Angelia Jolie was perfect as Maleficent. the whole look was stunning. For me the best performance was Elle Fanning as Sleeping beauty, she was very cute ,but not annoyingly cute. I'm a fan of Sharlto Copley, and I was glad to see him in this movie as King Stephen. I also like the performance of Sam Riley who played a crow made human and the sidekick of Maleficent, redefining the animal side kick you see in animation.Honestly, I think I would have preferred if the movie was animated, or maybe I'm just use to such a good fairy tale coming from the animation department. It was however worth sitting in on.",Maleficent
136,PyroSikTh,Maleficent is the best of Disney's modernised Fairy Tales.,8,10 June 2014,"Maleficent follows the recent trend of adapting and ""updating"" various classic fairy tales, a trend that started with Tim Burton's (unfathomably) successful Alice in Wonderland. Of course none of those that followed have been successful either financially or critically, so it begs the question why are they still be made? They've all been superficial CGI-fests that practically p*** on it's source material, with few good changes and many bad ones. Maleficent stands out, as thought has actually been put into it. It's not a prequel (Oz the Great and Powerful), or a complete re- imagining (Jack the Giant Slayer), but more of a change of perspective. All right the end result is hugely different, but most of the film is spent giving Maleficent backstory, explaining why she curses Aurora, and what she does in those sixteen years. I don't want to go so far as to say it's realistic (because it's about fairies and dragons and true love's kiss), but it certainly resembles more of what the story would be like if it was real (if that makes sense). Maleficent isn't inherently evil; she loves, she regrets, she cares. King Steffan isn't just happily getting drunk with a fellow king for sixteen years either. He's consumed by Maleficent's threats and goes to a darker, more obsessed place. So far so that he dismisses Aurora once she re-appears in his life. In this respect he's painted to be the villain to fill the hole left by Maleficent, but I wouldn't say he was evil either, merely ambitious and obsessed. Another aspect of ""realism"" is with the three fairy godmothers. In Sleeping Beauty, they cart her off to a cottage in the forest and we catch up with them sixteen years later preparing her birthday, where they're useless and incompetent. I always wondered how they could raise this child and still be that useless at general household things. This movie answers that; they don't. They make a hash of everything for the entire duration, and they can't wait to get rid of Aurora. Yeah okay, sure, these changes pretty much fly in the face of the character's original representations, and Maleficent's in particular is a bit hard to swallow (turning your best, creepiest, most evil villain into a protagonist feels counter-intuitive, but let's face it it's unavoidable; you can't sympathise with a sadistic, evil witch for 100 minutes), but this actually makes the characters a lot more believable and a lot more relatable. They're actually 3D characters rather than just the paper-thin stereotypes they are in the cartoon.The quality of acting is pretty high too. Angelina Jolie unsurprisingly steals the show as the titular Maleficent. She was always going to play the character in this movie, ever since it's inception, and I'm glad she stuck with all it's delays, because it's a role she was made for. She gets to show the softer side of Maleficent brilliantly, while also having fun with her more bombastic moments of villainy, while crucially never hamming it up. Sharlto Copley appears once again, but this time with a Scottish accent! He pulls it off really well, and considering five or six years ago he'd never taken an acting class, that's impressive. He does a really good job of Steffan, although I do fear he's starting to get typecast as a villain, as his last three movies (including this one) have painted him as an antagonist. Elle Fanning does a good job of Aurora, but I can't help but feel sorry for her having to smile at everything all the time. Aurora is too damn happy as a character. Sam Riley, Imelda Staunton, Juno Temple, and Lesley Manville all provide the comic relief (the latter three as the fairy godmothers), although it has to be said that Sam Riley's Diaval is the only one to actually earn any laughs.The CGI was unsurprisingly fantastic in most cases, considering first-time director Robert Stromberg found his footing as production designer on visually fantastic movies such as Oz the Great and Powerful and Avatar. Maleficent's wings (yeah, she has wings now) are rendered fantastically, giving her a sort of dark angel look (made more pronounced by the ""fallen"" subtext later on), the landscapes are detailed, and most the creatures are imaginatively designed. My only criticism in this regard are the three fairy godmothers who just look awful in their natural form. I mean I commend the effort to make them look like the actresses, but one has to wonder why they didn't just miniaturise the actresses and give them wings digitally, like they did with Jolie. My only other visual complaint was that some scenes were super dark. Even in a dark cinema it was hard to see what was going on at times.Maleficent isn't a perfect movie, and I'm not even sure it'll go down as a widely remembered (or regarded) one either, but it's certainly the best live-action fairy tale modernisation to come out of Disney since this all began. All the characters are really well-developed and well-rounded, and the performances elevate them further. Also the approach of a differing perspective means that (for the most part at least) Maleficent enhances the original rather than replacing it, or being a completely separate entity, although as I mentioned Maleficent does take a vastly different route in it's last half hour or so. In all, I give Maleficent a very good 8/10.",Maleficent

138,Al_The_Strange,Maleficent Review,7,24 June 2014,"You know her, you walked with her once upon a nightmare. Maleficent, the original villain from Disney's Sleeping Beauty, is an instantly recognizable icon of evil; even if you never knew her name, there is no mistaking her tall dark figure with the twisted horns, the wicked green fire all around her, and her coldly sardonic demeanor. Originally, she was evil just for the sake of being evil, and for all intents and purposes, that was all she needed; she was a villain we all loved to hate, and she is one of the most definitive examples of her given archetype (that of the evil witch, sorceress, or a dark queen of sorts). But, she was a rather one-dimensional caricature that was begging to be filled and fleshed out as a deeper character. I always wondered, what was her beef with the king and the princess and everybody else? Why was she so evil? 2014's Maleficent comes in an ever-growing line of live-action fairy-tale movies, to flip around the moral roles of the classic Sleeping Beauty tale and show a new perspective on who's really good and who's really evil. Those who are familiar with the classic animated film will recognize the characters and scenes instantly, but they are remixed in pretty refreshing ways. Obviously, the main goal is to make Maleficent herself a more empathetic character with a compelling backstory, so we can understand why she does what she does, and allow us to root for her. At the same time, the other characters we always thought of as good are villainized.Despite these interesting twists, the story doesn't really bring that much new to the table. It's actually been a common trend nowadays to make the bad guys sympathetic (as Disney already did with Frozen, Wreck-It Ralph, and Oz: The Great and Powerful). Thus, the story for Maleficent became predictable, even when it tried its best to be unpredictable. The only thing that really keeps it from falling into mediocrity is Angelina Jolie's sumptuous performance as the title character, and the sumptuous visuals.If it's fantastic visual whimsey you want, the film will certainly deliver, but not in any kind of dark or Gothic manner. Even at its darkest moments, Maleficent maintains a pretty light fairy-tale tone, offering just a few major scenes of combat and battle. There are scenes that are goofy just as much as there are scenes that are dramatic and serious. You could find it really delightful or really dry, and it all really depends on how invested you are in the storytelling and genre.Fortunately, the storytelling isn't all that terrible. Even though it retreads much of the classic tale, it moves at a pretty even rate, and it seems more interested in actually telling the story and developing a deeper pathological struggle than stringing together action setpieces. In the end, I found it most interesting in the way it spun the characters around and developed a pathological conflict between Maleficent and King Stefan, using other characters as proxies, as if they were pawns in a 16-year-long chess game. As this goes on, the characters experience just enough change to make them endearing and twist the plot around to its inevitable climax.The film is pretty well-made, with decent photography and editing. Angelina Jolie embodies the title character perfectly, while Sharlto Copley plays a perfect jerk once again. Writing gets the job done, but I felt that some of the dialogue was weak. This production uses good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects tended to look cartoony and fake. Music is alright.Maleficent falls somewhere in between the colorful, whimsical Oz: The Great and Powerful and the gritty, serious Snow White and the Huntsman. It is pretty much more of the same, but it's best seen for its visual flair and for Angelina Jolie's captivating performance. Chances are that families and genre fans will love this film, while most others will be indifferent. Probably best recommended as a rental.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Average)",Maleficent
139,ArchonCinemaReviews,Sloppy plot produces flimsy fairy tale,2,21 August 2014,"Maleficent attempts to tell an old story anew but all it does is completely redefine the title character's personality without taking the time to create a feasible explanation and alternative to the well known fairytale.In Disney's new Maleficent we first see Maleficent as a young girl with magnificent wings. She is the largest fairy and protector of the magical Moors from the greedy humans in another nearby kingdom. She meets a human Stefan who befriends her and she eventually falls in love with him only to be betrayed by his selfish and sinful human-nature.This is the new and unknown back-story that motivates the Maleficent we know from the animated Disney narrative.Children will enjoy this movie. It is beautifully designed and full of wonderful scenery with magical creatures and talking trees! Disney plays into the innocence of children and fascination they have for nature and capitalize on it. There is the darkness of a discernible villain and the light of a righteous hero.Adults and fans of the fairy tale will be disappointed. The film is drawn out because no story progresses nor evolution occurs within Maleficent. The plot is flimsy, weak and completely inconsistent with the narrative and poorly conceptualized. Nothing makes any sense and the title character's behavior is neither explained with a back-story nor revealed as a sad misunderstanding.The writers try to make you believe that Maleficent endured the ultimate betrayal, and by her closest most trusted loved one. There is absolutely no proof of this with the exception of a fabulously believable freak out by Angelina Jolie when she awakens to find herself mutilated. No wonderful love story involving the future king Stefan is shown and the first five minutes should only exist on the editing room floor.There is a nice sentiment behind the maker's intentions but the entire story is unrefined, like a first draft. Director Robert Stromberg is new and it shows. He lacks the confidence, ability and experience to take the initiative and lead the story. The writer, Linda Woolverton, is most at fault in her creation of a feeble, unconvincing and baseless story.Executives should have used some of their $180million dollar budget on consulting with Gregory Maguire. Then there would be an intelligent, logical but beautiful plot and Woolverton could do what she does best, create a screenplay to match.Now for the worst party of the film, the fairy god mothers. Oh dear lord, what have they done to the fairy godmothers? They are flighty, imbecilic, self-absorbed, twits! Since the story is so moronic the fairy involvement in raising Aurora is explained with an impractical sentence, as is most of the film. Then they spend the whole 16 years they are supposedly watching Aurora by complaining about its inconvenience and arguing like the three stooges.Elle Fanning is not the enchanting Aurora and her Aurora is annoyingly cloying. They try to make it seem like this profound love exists for Aurora from Maleficent.Angelina Jolie looks like Maleficent. She has the stature, the prowess, the harsh beauty and the outfit but little else. Sadly she never really acts and her accent is slacking, she just stands and glares; I never sense malice, anger, love, betrayal, or anything for that matter and certainly not ominous villainous evil. I am supposed to believe she has a quiet strength from her power? No.I'm guessing Stromberg was taken by her beauty and celebrity, and thought that sufficient.With a flimsy story, bad acting and a complete disregard for the story's structure, the whole thing is preposterous. Is creating a harmonious rational account where a fairy turns evil really that difficult? Or did executives hope that nobody would notice behind the cloak of the Disney/Jolie name.I never felt anything watching this movie, especially considering the immense power a Disney movie can have. Nope, no hope, no love, no care, no warmth – I honestly never felt a single emotion for the whole shebang except for when the credits rolled.Find more reviews at our website!",Maleficent
140,estreet-eva,Jumping on the rethinking-the-villain trend Disney-style,6,6 April 2015,"Since ""Wicked"" opened up the concept of an original work that draws heavily from a famous work by rethinking the villain of the original and finding some sympathy, it was only a matter of time before we got to ""Sleeping Beauty"". And a visually arresting rethink it is. The transformation of crow to man, the battle of Angelina Jolie (who seems a generally frightening person with or without ludicrously oversized horns) versus the army of the human world and numerous other CGI-heavily special effects all delight. The story does not quite live up to the telling with Angelina's baddie-turned-goodie seemingly spending some 16 years hiding in the bushes and secretly protecting the original damsel in distress Sleeping Beauty from harm. The running gag of the three fairies losing focus on Baby Beauty and her wandering into mortal danger before Jolie saves her gets a little disconcerting after a while - did the Moors have no Child Protective Services? Anyway, the acting is respectable, the script passable and the entertainment value for the younger set reasonable.

141,blackmamba99971,Fantastic Change to the story,10,15 June 2014,"I found this to be one Anjelina Jolie's best roles. A wonderful fairy named Malificent who met a human who was to be the next king by his own hand. Yet to do so would mean the sacrifice of Malificent's beautiful wings. Without her knowledge he took her wings by use of a sleeping potion, and when she woke up found her wings gone... or cut off by her so called friend Stefan (Sharlto Copely). Now with the birth of a new baby to Stefan... Aurora (Elle Fanning) Malificent in her cruel state of mind curses her with a sleeping incantation that could only be broken by a Pure Feeling of true love.Now sixteen years later Aurora becomes victim to the curse, and in all honesty I never would have guessed it would be from Malificent herself who could break the curse. I found this to a be a wonderful twist of fate. To see Aurora loving the fairy valley with Malificent as her guardian to watch over her. To see her god daughter become the queen of the valley and unite it as one with both human and magical worlds. Anjelina as always places her role as first, and became the cruel ruler with no holds barred, and to see her swayed by such a girl like Aurora at the deepest levels so she could question the validity of her part as to why her heart has softened.I especially loved the three aunts who in their own way paved the road for Aurora's destiny as the would be fairy queen to the entire valley. What was also a nice blend was that Aurora herself was the narrator to this story. To show us what it meant to be freed from the confines of cruelty and dictatorship from a mad man who once loved Malificent only to be blinded from the curses of greed, and power. I thought the music was fantastic, the action was well blended in without over the top special effects to ruin the story plot.What has become an unnecessary thing in movies is out blown special effects. Moving through the film with too many effects can take away the attention span of the audience. Like Micheal Bay has done with his movies. I do however like the first movie he has done, but since then have been turned off by the use of too much special effects. Malificent does not have too much effects, which is why it turned out so well. But if it did have too many effects, Disney did it to such a degree that a person does not sway from the story at all. You can follow it, watch at the edge of your seat biting your nails. Which is what it should be.Since our technology has gotten more sophisticated more studios think of using too much CGI to awe inspire audiences around the world. But in this day and age, its only the kids who like the effects. The only one's that like a good story are the more intellectual individuals who want to see, and hear a great story. And Malificent is a prime example of a great story. Wonderfully done Disney. A really good uptake on a classic story.",Maleficent

After having watched it I have to say that I really liked it. It is a nice fairy tale based on the Sleeping Beauty but from the perspective of the evil fairy (who is not really that evil actually) instead. As far as I am concerned the concept worked surprisingly well.Obviously the story is highly rewritten compared to the original Sleeping Beauty story. Whether that is good or bad is probably a matter of personal opinion. I think it is good since it allowed to story in the movie to have its own merits and not be too dependent on the original. It works for me since the original story is not very present except and thus you do not get any annoyed every so often because the deviate from the ""original"" since the movie clearly demonstrated that it intended to be quite different from the start.The movie is quite beautiful with a typical fairy-tale air to it and at the same time dark and ominous during the scenes that required it. There are plenty of CGI of course and, to me, it was all quite well done. Angeline Jolie did a good job as Maleficent. I was actually less impressed by the three fairies that were supposed to take care of the princess though.

146,James_De_Bello,5/10,5,26 September 2014,"5/10 Definitely not a solid entry in the Disney slot this year, but it has its moments. From a visual point of view the movie is a mess: there is no balance between CGI and the (few) practical effects. More than half of it is shot on a green screen and it just shows in the final product. There is nothing tangible or real everything is just a mass of digital effects thrown at you that simply continue, throughout the movie, taking you out of it. The transitions between the aerial-digital shots or the introductory shots and the real sequences is flat out weird and makes for a very uncomfortable watch at times. Moreover there are some shots and sequences that are copied unashamedly from the Lord of the Rings and instead of making for a pleasant throw-back they simply come out as cheap. In the mist of all this digital mass of weirdness there is some practicality that is used, but comes off as strange because of this visual incoherence. On the flip side, except for a couple of scenes, the effects are actually well rendered, yet simply overused, but the moments in which the movie manages to deliver are in the majority visual and when they are well directed they actually make for a very entertaining time that unfortunately is quickly stopped by the return to the actor in front of a green screen. A shout out has to be given to James Newton Howard for his wonderful score: it frequently managed to elevate all of the on screen material and make you much more interested in the drama, if it hadn't been there I guess I would have been bored through all of it. Despite there being close to zero character depth on the general scope and a screenplay that doesn't manage to do anything mildly enthralling other than a sweet dynamic which works thanks to the actors, Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning bring an amazing amount of charisma to the screen that made me surprisingly entertained. Yet on a performance level, other than some subtlety from Jolie, there isn't much going on and here it's the director that clearly takes the blame, because despite managing to put together 100 minutes of messy fun he clearly does not have a grip on narrative, character development and actor direction, all of this resulting in some very dull or cheesy moments. Nevetheless I will credit the movie for making me interested in parts of it and actually entertained by some dynamics, yet on the whole I simply wasn't into it for all of the above reasons and will probably forget most of it sooner rather than later.",Maleficent

It's fine when someone wants to take something and make a different take of it. But what is the point of this? Ruin all characters, even Maleficent herself?? The fairies are not caring, but hateful and dumb! The prince is useless and their meeting lacks any emotion.. Originally, their meeting in the forest by singing as if a dream come true is one of the best scenes of the original. In a few lines you understand her frustration, and the prince's awe at her beauty! Also, the prince Philip is at the end for some reason. He ""felt"" he needed to be there, but does nothing, and the feelings between them don't exist.The King trusts 3 fairies he has never seen with his newborn daughter for 16 years! He even calls them idiots when Aurora is back. Granted, this version of the King is an idiot himself in every level. A man that found love at a young age, but for NO reason (aside from being ""a man"", whom are ALL greedy by nature, according to this) left because he wanted more, even though he never had anything and should've had it all in Maleficent.Compared to the original, there are more scenes of unknown men being trashed around by CGI than real characters and real plot.The great feeling I had after the original was washed away by the disgust caused by this unnecessary piece of Garbage!!",Maleficent
148,fciocca,"A live action movie with stunning visual effects, but not my cup of tea",6,25 October 2019,"Maleficent is one of those movies that I would never watch, but my girlfriend love this genre, so I watched it, by having real low expectations. Because of this, I was very surprised, and I actually enjoyed it quite a lot.Technically speaking, I found it stunning, CGI sequences are so amazing and realistic, the Maleficent world is well conceived and people who worked on it put a lot of effort in details: monsters, landscapes and locations are breathtaking. For a while I did not see something so amazing.To complete this live action, you need to have a good cast. Angelina Jolie plays Maleficent, and she is surprisingly good, even in a complete different role that she is used to. She is bad, but at the same time caring and she takes care of Aurora for 16 years, by becoming her Fairy Stepmother, but she can also be bad with people that deserve. An interesting character with a good development. Elle Fanning in this movie does not have the time to express herself, writers did not gave to the Aurora character a lot of space. I love Elle's work as an actress, but this time she was decent, but I know that she can do better, she has demonstrated this in ""Neon Demon"", but not in this movie. Maybe this character had too many limitations, so she couldn't perform as well as she previously did.Maleficent was not was I expecting and the trailer does not give the right idea to the movie. There is a perfect balance.",Maleficent
149,jawneyfloros,exceptional,10,19 November 2018,Review: I really enjoyed this live action retelling of the classic cartoon version of sleeping beauty. This version of sleeping beauty is much darker than the classic cartoon because it is from Maleficent's point of view instead of the sleeping beauty. The direction and screenplay are both incredible. The casting and acting are both incredible also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.,Maleficent

152,doug_park2001,"""So you see, the story is not quite as you were told""",9,15 July 2014,"Angelina Jolie gives an outstanding performance as adult Maleficent; ditto for Isobelle Molloy as young Maleficent and Ella Purnell as teen Maleficent, a fairy with the body of a cute young fairy girl who matures into a beautiful woman with large, plain, but VERY powerful brown-feathered wings and twisted ram's horns. At an early age, Maleficent makes the mistake of befriending a human boy from the neighboring quasi-English realm who ultimately hurts and betrays her. From there, the story, with many clever deviations and without seven dwarfs, follows some of the rough pattern of the fairy tale popularized by the Grimm Bros/Charles Perrault and the earlier Disney movies. Elle Fanning also gives an impressive performance as Aurora (""Snow White"").MALEFICENT strikes just the right balance of fantasy and reality, humor and horror, meaningful storyline and simple entertainment. There are all sorts of reasons to enjoy this film: The unique version of the story itself, the visuals, the character study of the protagonist, you name it. For me, the single best thing about MALEFICENT is its vivid portrayal of the Fairyland Moors, complete with pixies, elves, dryads, naiads, dragons, talking toads, Bokwus-like tree giants, and a host of others, including a were-crow.This is a film without absolutes: No one is completely evil or noble, and no one, no matter how powerful, is invincible. MALEFICENT goes much deeper than the original tale of the handsome prince randomly falling in love at first sight with Sleeping Beauty and awakening her with a kiss from the evil swoon imposed by her horrible wicked fairy godmother. There are all sorts of big themes here: Good versus evil (and there are intermixtures of both in all the major characters), love versus lust, deception, greed, and so on. Many historical parallels can also be seen, the British Empire and American expansion to name just a couple. Yet, all the film's allusions will not get in the way of anyone who just wants to watch it for the rich and surprising ride it gives.Some violent (and entertaining) battle scenes and disturbing images, but no serious gore. There's probably nothing here the average 8-year-old can't handle. Still, MALEFICENT is primarily a fairy tale for adults. Younger children may be confused by who they're supposed to root for, who's supposed to be ""good"" and who's supposed to be ""bad."" ""Good"" characters, after all, generally do not have horns. All the same, it provides a fine illustration of the complexities of human and other natures.While the script and soundtrack could have been a little better in places, the whole quality of the acting, filming, and everything else is superb. Great use of Anglo-Celtic accents. Last but far from least, a beautifully fulfilling and well-earned ending.",Maleficent
153,TheMarwood,Generic and dull Disney fare,4,6 September 2014,"This charmless fairytale is a brisk 88 minutes (9 minutes of end credits bring this to 97 minutes) and it's played so safe and rendered so generic and accessible, that it feels like a product more than a film. With first time director Robert Stromberg's background in visual effects and digital production design, he seems ill equipped to flesh out the narrative and get consistent performances from his cast. Were the actors even directed? They all seem left to their own devices - Jolie is genuinely creepy in some scenes, hammy in others, sometimes just posing for the camera and occasionally lost in front of a green screen. Sharlto Copley over acts. The three fairies are grating. Elle Fanning has a nice smile plastered to her face, but the script requires little else from her. The vfx are a mixed bag, as the environment work is mostly well done, but some creature work is shoddy, the fairies are terrible and a few shots of an entirely CG Jolie in action is lazy and cheap looking. Maleficent just coasts by on the established mythology of the title character and is a hack job of connect the dots poor writing, uneven acting, no vision from the first time director and manages to bore even at its abbreviated length.",Maleficent

I had two points of personal interest... Ella Purnell who plays the teen Maleficent is related to my friend and I have known her since she was quite young and the film company bought a lot of spinning wheels from Frank Herring and Sons Ltd where I work. Ella, who was was almost unrecognisable in her make up, made the part her own and played the young Maleficent beautifully, leading into Angelina Jolie as the adult. Not one of my favourite actresses, I must say she was brilliant in this part. This film was a traditional fairy story with a modern slant and a twist to the well known tale of Sleeping Beauty. Dramatic make up and lighting combined with anger, sadness, obsession, love and a sprinkling of humour combined to take me right back to my childhood and the stories I knew and loved then.

155,troyputland,The Maleficent Magnificent,7,27 April 2015,"Disney has lengthened their stride with Maleficent. It comes 56 years after Sleeping Beauty, and acts like a parallel universe. The story we are all too familiar with has taken a different route. It's comes as both a surprise and a shock to the system. Angelina Jolie, as the magnificent Maleficent, does what she can do best: bring a daunting presence that dominates the screen. With her devilishly black horns and majestic wings, she's got the looks of a villain and the consciousness to do good, that is, until her heart gets broken. Falling in love with a human has its complications. The world in which Maleficent resides is split into two. There's the magical world, containing fairies and all sorts of mythical creatures adopting a humongous forest as their home, and the human world, with a kingdom, a royal family and plenty of knights. The world looks wonderful; it's drenched with all sorts of colours; the fairies' side is incredibly bright, the human's dark and bitter. It's heavy on the CGI and some of it's astonishingly scrappy in places. Sharlto Copley's acting is honourable, his usual South African accent hardly distinguishable. Elle Fanning's Aurora stares in to space, a lot. Her fate is predictable, Maleficent's curse on her is full-proof. Some viewers may relinquish in this new take, but old fans will wish for the same, linear route as the classic.Check out my other reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk",Maleficent

158,monstermayhem32,Great twist on a Disney Classic,9,1 June 2014,"I think Angelina Jolie was born to play maleficent since she plays the role with a sense of innocence and beauty, unlike the 1959 animated film that portrayed her as a villain that wanted sleepy beauty to prick her finger on her 16th birthday as a curse, this film puts a new spin on the character by explaining how she became what she did by facing a betrayal for someone that she cared about rather dearly, even though King Stefan assigns the three fairies to protect aurora played by Elle fanning from maleficent, it turns out that maleficent is more of a guide and mentor to her then those assigned to protect her. I will admit that the computer generated imagery was rather well done but wish the story was a bit longer and would have went into motivation why Steven portrayed maleficent. However I will say unlike the prince waking up aurora from her coma, it turns out that a mothers true love is what ends the curse, I would have to say that it is recommended for those looking at a different spin on a classic",Maleficent
159,ayoreinf,"Two superb acting performances, and great CGs aren't enough",7,8 June 2014,"I have a feeling this review won't win me any popularity contest, as most of the reviewers here seem to love this film. While I do appreciate the amazing performance of Angelina Jolie it seems to me that the director was simply too smitten with her acting and forgot everything else. So we do get the title character spread all over the screen looking amazing, to the tiniest nuances of her character. We also get a very good performance from Elle Fanning who simply radiates innocence and charm. But despite of the two actresses, and despite of the fact that the entire production does look super (CG included) the whole thing doesn't work for a full size movie, since there's too little of everything else. The rest of the characters are either too cartoonish or simply flat and one dimensional. Stefan's character could've been a real wonderful role, but we get only single minded obsession and no real depth. The others get even less only Sam Riley as Diavel manages to show some acting with the very little space that was given to him. And as others have already mentioned here, it's not even all that surprising, as we figure most of the plot twists half way through the film.Once again there was a lot of potential here and most of it was simply wasted.",Maleficent
160,nicolechan916,A little disappointing,6,26 June 2014,"To be honest, I was expecting more from this film. It was kind of a let down. The story itself was all right, but more suited for children. I know it's a Disney movie, but Disney has always been able to make movies that adults could enjoy too. Their most recent hit; Frozen, was enjoyable to pretty much the whole world. And now that I think about it, there was surprisingly no singing in this film. I've just read how this adaptation is different from the Sleeping Beauty film, and I feel that the original story was better.The acting was good, and we did get a sense of the characters and where they came from, but it just felt shallow to me. Angelina Jolie makes a pretty good Maleficent and the three fairies are somewhat like the three stooges; they added a comical element which was a good addition to the film. Also, I give a thumbs up to the chemistry between Maleficent and Diaval.The animation was pretty good as well. The landscapes and scenery had a very fantastical and mystical feel, while the visual effects I feel, could have been better. The actionwas kind of average. Just your normal everyday Hollywood fight that starts with no apparent reason whatsoever.Read more reviews at championangels.wordpress.com",Maleficent

162,D_Burke,"If You're Not Too Attached to Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"", You'll Love ""Maleficent""",7,1 June 2014,"Maleficent has always been my favorite Disney villain, which is even more ironic because ""Sleeping Beauty"" (1959) is one of my least favorite Disney animated films. Sure ""Sleeping Beauty"" was superbly animated, but I doubt I'm the only man who, while watching it on video as a boy, willingly fast-forwarded through the song ""Once Upon A Dream"".The witch Maleficent made ""Sleeping Beauty"" worth watching for anyone with any hint of a rebellious streak. While the good characters went through the motions, Maleficent seemed to be the only character who actually had fun in her role.That's why, when I heard Disney was making an animated film about the origins of that delightful, Gothic sorceress, and it was going to be live action, I was excited. I also can't think of any actress better suited to play Maleficent than Angelina Jolie.Jolie portrays Maleficent in a cool, calculated way that is a lot of fun to watch. When Jolie plays bad, she plays it very well, as evidenced from her Oscar-winning supporting role in ""Girl, Interrupted"" (1999), and a few other roles.While Jolie seldom disappoints in her role, and the impressive set design makes the film unspeakably exquisite, the story, while an original take on the Sleeping Beauty story, may disappoint some Disney purists. The Maleficent origin exposition is indeed a welcome, and surprising, addition to the story. The artistic liberties screenwriter Linda Woolverton takes with the ""good guys"" might take some Disney fans out of the movie.I admit that going into the film, I expected ""Maleficent"" to follow Disney's adaptation of ""Sleeping Beauty"" a little more closely. Specifically, I presumed that the movie would approach Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"" the same way the novel ""Grendel"" by John Gardner told the tale of Beowulf through the perspective of the antagonist.In ""Grendel"", Gardner didn't change the story of Beowulf as it was told in the eponymous, Anglo-Saxon epic poem. The Grendel creature was granted good intentions in that story, but it didn't change the way the humans in the story reacted to him, and his ultimate death.In ""Maleficent"", the original Disney story, and perhaps every other ""Sleeping Beauty"" adaptation, is changed significantly to make Maleficent less ruthless toward the princess Aurora, which may not be a welcome change for some. In the Disney animated movie, Maleficent places a curse on Aurora intending for her to die. In this movie, her words are changed significantly, almost giving Aurora a pass that feels too convenient.Like in the 1959 cartoon, upon being placed under this curse, Aurora's king father sends her to live in the cabin with three magical fairies (Lesley Manville, Imelda Staunton, and Juno Temple). They wear the same colors as their hand-drawn animated predecessors, but are far more comically inept. Perhaps too inept sometimes, as their fighting with one another feels as annoying as certain children throwing tantrums in stores.Plus, Jolie's Maleficent knows where Aurora is raised by Day 1. Although it creates some amusing scenes (such as one where Maleficent makes it rain in the cabin), it may prompt a viewer to ask, ""Why doesn't she just kill the kid if she's so close?"" Disney purists who took comic relief from Aurora's father in the original Disney movie may be sorely disappointed by the turn of the king here who, in this movie, is named Stefan (Sharlto Copely, best known for ""District 9"" (2009)). I actually liked the back story where it's revealed that Stefan, before he was king, had a relationship with young Maleficent (played here captivatingly by Isobelle Molloy).There's an intriguing love story between the two characters, but the fault lies in young Stefan growing apart from Maleficent. It's not bad (story-wise) that the growing apart happens, but rather that it is told by way of a narrator (Janet McTeer), not shown as needed to be.Plus, the way in which Stefan, before he is king, lies to a dying King Henry (Kenneth Cranham) that he killed the sorceress in order to obtain the throne is far too similar to ""Beowulf"" (2007). Because Ray Winstone's eponymous protagonist also claimed to kill a beast who happened to be played by the same actress, I would not be surprised if either director Robert Zemeckis or screenwriters Neil Gaiman & Roger Avary sued for copyright infringement.With all that said about the story, I can't say I was disappointed with the movie, or at least not the same way I was with Tim Burton's ""Alice In Wonderland"" (2010). Both had superb visual effects, were based on Disney animated classics, and were actually written by the same screenwriter.Whereas ""Alice In Wonderland"" told a story that bore no resemblance to any of Lewis Carroll's stories despite having all the same characters, ""Maleficent"" at least got the general structure of ""Sleeping Beauty"" right. If he were alive today, Uncle Walt might not approve of the changes in the story and characters, but he would love what Jolie did with Maleficent, and would marvel at the set and character design.The Walt Disney Company's enormously popular Disney Princess franchise has given them a solid footing in the girl's market. Making a film like ""Maleficent"", in spite of the title character being female, appears to be a far more sensible way to appeal to boys than merely coughing up money to buy other boy-approved franchises (i.e. Marvel comics, Star Wars).Disney already wrote their checks, but developing and rebooting their darker characters is something they should keep doing. If ""Maleficent"" is financially successful, they could make some amazing films based on other villains that would make boys flock to theaters. I wouldn't be against seeing an Ursula movie, or one about Gaston, and that's just for starters.",Maleficent

164,ghost_dog86,Trust No Man,6,31 May 2014,"I can't be the only one who didn't realize Maleficent was a fairy and not a witch, right?! Now that I got that out of the way, on to my review: While more tolerable than 2012's ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" or ""Mirror Mirror"", ""Maleficent"", a retelling of ""Sleeping Beauty"", starring Elle Fanning and Angelina Jolie (in what may be one of her final on-screen performances) will not help the case for live action remakes of classic animated fairy tales.Synopsis: A retelling of ""Sleeping Beauty"", told from Maleficent's point of view; Maleficent played by Jolie, Aurora played by Fanning.The script and creative plot reconstruction from writer Linda Woolverton, is the best aspect of ""Maleficent"".Side Note: I understand that the story of Sleeping Beauty predates Disney. But since ""Maleficent"" is basically Disney remaking Disney, I will be addressing 1959's ""Sleeping Beauty"" as the source material. So, deal with it.The back-story element (how Maleficent came to be seen as a villain) while a bore to sit through, actually injects a refreshing motive, as this film enters its 2nd Act. Even the ending, which randomly sees Angelina Jolie in leather pants, and also holds the most significant plot deviation, works. All of this workson paper. Seeing it all play out in live action is quite a different story. Most of the CGI is simply awful. And in a movie which is composed of 80% CGI, including odd looking CGI creatures, CGI battle sequences and CGI floating people, ""Maleficent"" had me wondering if animation is necessary if only to make stories regarding fantasy more palatable. That said, this is not the biggest directorial flaw in this film. The countless extreme close-ups throughout come off as devastatingly amateurish, giving an unintentional campiness to moments that were meant to be taken seriously.But is visual effects artist/director Robert Stromberg to blame for all of this film's shortcomings? Well, mostly, but the horrendous supporting cast (Fanning not included) doesn't help.As for Mrs. Brad Pitt's performance, I have no complaints. And once this movie gets going (it is an absolute snoozer for the first 30 minutes) and she gets a chance to literally and metaphorically spread her wings and camp it up, Jolie becomes one of the only things keeping the entertainment levels elevated.Final Thought: Anyone who comes out of ""Maleficent"" dismissing it on the basis of story alterations or their personal hatred of Angelina Jolie, should really just get over it. If anything, dismiss this film on its shockingly off-putting visuals. On the plus side, and maybe most importantly, if you're looking for a 97 minute babysitter, ""Maleficent"" is a movie which will keep the attention of most children and/or childlike fans of the outdated ""Sleeping Beauty"". Take that for what it's worth.",Maleficent
165,bhernandez2216,Maleficent,10,22 October 2019,"Maleficent is pretty cool, once you get to know Disney. Angelina Jolie played the best Disney character of all time, best on Sleeping Beauty, but this is a different story about the fairy-witch, mistress of evil: Maleficent. I like it.",Maleficent
166,Chalice_Of_Evil,"Hello, beastie...",8,29 May 2014,"Well, well...let's tell an old story anew - that's what this film intends to do, as we learn via the rather intrusive constantly annoying voice-over (too much narration). Trailers for this film led me to believe it would be quite a dark retelling of the Sleeping Beauty story, and even when it began rather lightheartedly, bright and cheerful, I thought surely the darkness would eventually come. So it was somewhat disappointing that this interpretation never *did* actually get all that dark (although there are some dark moments). Angelina Jolie, without a doubt, MAKES this film. She's so good in it that you forget you're watching Angelina Jolie, rather you're just watching the character of Maleficent herself. This retelling of Sleeping Beauty twists events around to show things from *her* perspective. Jolie, as obvious as it may sound, is magnificent in the role. The evil smile (combined with the words ""There is evil in this world, hatred and revenge..."" followed by her fake pout and ""...oh."") before letting out an evil laugh at the end of one of the first trailers released showed how perfect for the iconic role Angelina was. Her chilling laugh/eerie smile are really something to behold. She looks dangerous, beautiful and evil all at once with her horns, glowing eyes, raised cheekbones (which you just can't stop looking at), long black cloak, high collar and staff. We have Jolie to be thankful for that, as apparently she insisted on maintaining the scary/menacing look of the animated incarnation. We first meet young Maleficent, played by Isobelle Molloy, as a fairy who greets the many varied inhabitants in her forest of a morning cheerily whilst flying about. Molloy does a good job of playing the character before she changes. What brings about the personality shift is her encounter with young Stefan. They quickly become friends, but he eventually leaves and doesn't return until Maleficent is Angelina Jolie size, now an extremely powerful freedom fighter type who speaks/fights for the magical things of her world against man. It is here where she suffers a ruthless betrayal, as grown-up Stefan (Sharlto Copley, adopting a dubious Scottish accent) slips her a sleeping potion, under the guise of friendship, only to cut off/steal her beloved wings and take them back to the King who wanted her dead. While one could interpret Stefan's actions as him trying to save her life the only way he knew how, he clearly intended to kill her, but was just too weak-stomached to go through with it/chickened out at the last minute. Angelina is heartbreaking in the scene where Maleficent discovers a part of her has been taken. You can't help but feel for her from this point on. Here her character is fleshed out, we are given context to her 'evil' and she is presented as not so much a straight-up villain, but instead someone we can sympathise with. While this might upset some, the movie is its own unique spin on the tale, allowing for more depth. Jolie herself admitted her look scared kids on the set and that her daughter, Vivienne, was the only one NOT scared of her, so it makes sense she was chosen to play young Aurora. It definitely helps. The scene between her and her off-screen mother is certainly a memorable one. One of the best aspects of Angie's performance is her deadpan delivery of lines. Maleficent's attitude towards Aurora (whom she calls 'beastie') as an infant, and later as a child, makes for some darkly amusing comments from her - which is needed, given how bright/chipper Aurora's character is once she's grown up to be Elle Fanning. There's not a whole lot to her character, but she plays the part of the naive innocent princess well (there's a funny moment where she thinks Maleficent is her fairy godmother). Despite her cursing Aurora on her christening to prick her finger and fall into a death-like sleep, Maleficent finds herself softening towards her target as she gets to know her (going so far as attempting to revoke her curse). When she's not tugging Sleeping Beauty through the air like a balloon on an invisible string, she's getting into mud-slinging fights with her and other forest critters. Speaking of, the creatures designed for the movie are quite creative-looking and add to the sense of wonder. Maleficent's trusty crow sidekick, Diaval, who she changes into a man (as well as a wolf, horse and dragon) is an interesting character, as played by Sam Riley. They have a fun dynamic, and he serves as a sort of 'conscience' for her. He's even better at taking care of infant Aurora than the three exceedingly annoying fairies/pixies who are tasked with keeping her safe. The less said about them, the better.Aurora and Prince Phillip's 'love story' isn't really much of one. They share a single scene together, then their next encounter is him kissing her to wake her from her cursed sleep at the behest of the annoying trio. At least he voices some reservations about kissing a girl in her sleep he hardly knows, but once he does kiss her, it doesn't work anyway. No, it's Maleficent's maternal bond/friendship with Aurora that does it. Like the movie as a whole, things don't end how you might expect, though I was happy with how they did. The movie looks great, the score is suitably moody, and best of all, it's not drawn-out/overlong. Make sure to stay for Lana Del Rey's haunting new version of 'Once Upon a Dream'. Her voice suits this film perfectly. It's as if Jolie (as Maleficent) herself is singing the song. Like the movie, it feels as if it's from Maleficent's point of view, therefore reflecting her darker/sinister intentions. Again we have Jolie to thank, as she picked Del Rey herself to sing a version of the 1959 Sleeping Beauty's 'Once Upon a Dream' for the film. It'll give you chills/goosebumps for sure.",Maleficent
167,FairlyAnonymous,Poor plot and bad characters ruin a slightly interesting premise.,5,20 December 2014,"First things first: The concept of Maleficent sounded like a bad idea from day one ""Hey, let's make Maleficent a sympathetic human being who wasn't really evil, she was simply ""misunderstood"""". This is a problem already because Maleficent was always a figure of ""pure evil"" in Sleeping Beauty. However, I would be willing to accept this premise if they truly showed Maleficent slowly become the evil fairy that we recognize her as. The concept of seeing a good person become totally evil isn't a bad idea... as long as you go with that concept... which the movie doesn't.The movie follows the perspective of Maleficent and how she ruled over the fairy kingdom which was separated from the human kingdom. Apparently humans and fairies hate each other... with absolutely no explanation for why this conflict exists other than ""reasons"". A young Stefan wanders into the fairy territory and falls in love with the young Maleficent. They are friends for years until Stefan leaves for ""reasons"". This starts to become a pretty consistent theme in the movie which is one of the best reasons why this movie doesn't work:CHARACTERS DON'T DEVELOP. All of the characters in this movie don't receive on-screen character development. They simply receive a five second narration explaining that they had character development. So essentially, all of the characters in this movie can have a 180 in their character arc because the movie will never dedicate any screen time to their motivation. Why did Stefan become a jerk? How did he get into his position? Why did he want to become king? Why did he turn his back on Maleficent? Why did he become so paranoid when clearly Maleficent wasn't out to attack him? All of these important questions are never really answered. The same goes for Aurora. She is about as simple as a character can be. Maleficent befriends Aurora and starts to regret cursing her. This is a slightly interesting premise if... Aurora was an interesting character. When you have a slightly more complex character like Maleficent, why would a complex character relinquish her hard feelings for a one- dimensional character? It doesn't really make sense other than the fact that Maleficent took care of her... so it kind of works and it kind of doesn't.Moving on, the basic theme of this movie is that Maleficent turns evil and then must turn back to good in order to do the right thing. However, there is an issue... Maleficent never ""really"" turned evil in this movie. This is most likely due to the fact that the movie is PG, but other than launching one dude in the air with a vine, she didn't really kill anyone. Some could argue that she killed the people trying to cut down the vines, but the fact that the movie shows them landing on the ground without any vicious thuds and they have a couple of seconds of rolling around on the ground implying that they were still alive. This ruins the movie's entire premise ""Maleficent is good, then turns evil"" but never once in the movie does she do anything truly evil. She only fought off an army that was attacking her first and she cursed Aurora will a spell that could be fought off in revenge for Stefan becoming a jerk. So essentially, Maleficent IS A GOOD GUY THE ENTIRE MOVIE. She is never a ""bad-guy"". She is constantly helping Aurora, she is defending her people, she stays in her territory, and she doesn't even cause any mayhem... she just... stays in her territory... brooding. Yes... because thinking angry thoughts is equivalent to being pure evil.All in all, Maleficent is pretty poorly made from a plot- perspective. The character's are all one-dimensional with zero motivation, and many of the important aspects of the plot are glanced over with a simple narration, instead of actually showing the audience what is happening. The movie treats the audience as if they have zero intelligence because it never establishes characters well. It says, ""Showing character development/character interaction is too long and boring, here, let me just explain to you what their emotions are with a lot of exposition"". Now, the movie does have good animation. The CGI is nice and the special effects (in all departments) really help establish a strong atmosphere for the film. If there is one last gripe I have with the movie, it's that the movie does the whole ""How to Train Your Dragon/Avatar/Iron Man/any modern fantasy movie"" flying scene where we see the main character flying through either mountains, clouds, or over water... in this case all of those. This movie also steals a lot of shots from other movies. There is one scene that is straight out of The Return of the King and it is so obvious it hurts. It is kind of weird how many scenes this movie takes from other films, but I guess it makes sense seeing who directed the movie.All in all, not a very intelligent or well thought out movie. It plays more like a fan-fiction than an actual story or movie. If there is one reason to see the movie, it would be for its visual effects and that's it.",Maleficent

169,MJB784,A split decision,6,21 May 2018,"I found it very frustratingly uneven. Visually the location and production design was fascinating, but the special effects were mostly fake and didn't blend to the performances which were mostly just standing by with nothing the do and the flying scenes with the fairies looked too fake like an old video game sequence. Angelina wasn't that menacing in Maleficent. She played it very hammy where she was over emphasizing the lines and didn't seem that mean. The story is just as uneven since it wants to be both a retelling of Sleeping Beauty and a brand new story about Maleficent so the main character is both Maleficent and Princess Aurora. They also changed some of the story and it made me not sure if certain parts were supposed to be funny or serious and Maleficent as a character was just as unfocused emotionally. Why couldn't they just retell Sleeping Beauty or tell a prequel of Maleficent instead of combining the two? My mind was feeling like I was watching two movies fused together!",Maleficent
170,Dragonsouls,Beautiful production of a dated story,7,4 April 2015,"The passion behind the making of this film is evident in every scene, and its as if the film was made bigger than it was supposed to be, given the fact that it stars an actress (Jolie) who grew up as a fan of Sleeping Beauty. She absolutely loved the original source material so much that she went and funded some of the film herself. Why, she even had her own real-life child cast in the movie.Speaking of Angelina Jolie; wow...she was born for this role. I can't recall the last time an actor portrayed an animated character to such perfection--and with such similarity. Jolie was absolutely beautiful in that costume, make-up and horned-crown. I can only imagine how thrilling it must be for an actor or any person for that matter--to star and produce a remake of a film they grew up loving as a child. I bet the result will always be good in every case. And Maleficent is a result of this. Its a movie that took many months to film and it featured a script that took many drafts to finish. As big as this movie is budget-wise, I thought that the film came off as small at times, like an independent film, with very few extras on the screen at once--except for one scene in the beginning, which featured a large army of soldiers.I do believe the story is a bit dated, and it's a really simple one too. If one were to write a synopsis for this story, that would be the whole story right there. This is the story that de-fanged the fairy, because until Sleeping Beauty came along, fairies were always depicted as malevolent in folklore. I wonder if Disney did the right thing by telling this story from Maleficent's point of view because if I were a kid, I'd be frightened of Jolie's version of this character and as a matter of fact, many children were indeed frightened. Still, even though this film didn't make as much as projected, there was plenty of beauty and intrigue to keep most watching, There was an abundance of emotion in the story, and the love between Maleficent and Aurora was believable and it was felt on screen. But even though the end was predictable for me, I found myself completely glued to the screen due to the beautiful characters, animals, locales, sets and yes...Dragons that graced my HD television. 7/10",Maleficent

172,RichardSRussell-1,An Interesting Frozen-Like Variant on an Old Fairy Tale,7,5 June 2014,"Maleficent (PG, 1:37, Imax, 3-D) — fantasy: fairy tales; biggie; formula; OSIT feministsWell, after only a week, you're probably out of chances to see Maleficent in Imax (as Edge of Tomorrow takes over the big screen at 8 PM), but it'll still be available in 3-D as well as 2-D. IMO, not worth the premium price for either of the frills.I enjoyed Maleficent and give it a 7, but I guess I was hoping for more. In particular, if you saw Super 8, you know what a tremendous talent Elle Fanning is, and that was back in 2011. Here she plays the role of Aurora, the sleeping beauty who's the ostensible central character of the original Grimm Brothers fairy tale, and all she's expected to do is skip about, smiling and perky, looking all dimpled and rosy-cheeked and fresh-faced, and very very blond. With so little to do, she comes off as perhaps a little dim or simple in addition to being cloyingly vapid. But she clearly has a heart of gold, and that endears her to all who meet her.The odd couple here are the super-powerful fairy Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) and the power- obsessed peasant boy Stefan (Sharlto Copley from District 9), denizens of naboring kingdoms with radically different lifestyles. Stefan's is a typical ruff-and-ready, ruthless, medieval human kingdom, while The Moors, where Maleficent hangs out with a host of animated (but universally insignificant) critters, is a literal fairyland. They meet young and hit it off, but as they grow older, Stefan's ambition leads him to betray Maleficent, and he cuts off her wings to present to his king as evidence that he has vanquished the chief defender of the naboring realm.Maleficent, horrified and outraged, waits until Stefan — now elevated to the throne — hosts a christening celebration for his new-born dotter before exacting her revenge, in the form of a curse upon the infant that she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel before sundown on her 16th birthday and fall into a deep sleep, awakenable only by love's true kiss. That's the basic fairy tale, and the rest of the movie is devoted to the untold part of the story, which is not as neat and clean as has come down to us in legend.Suffice it to say that neither Maleficent nor her pet crow are beings you want to be on the bad side of, and Disney pulls out all of its special effect to underline the point. I would've preferred a little more humanity, altho, to be fair, one of the reasons Imax was overkill for this is that much of the screen time is devoted to closeups of the characters. But they're mainly just doing completely in-character line readings.I suppose I shouldn't expect too much realism in what's basically a fairy tale. And it puts a nice feminist gloss on the tired helpless-princess trope. Still, I ended up wanting more.",Maleficent
173,JaydoDre,An unbalanced story and average performances but still good,7,26 December 2014,"When I was a young boy (hold on, I am going somewhere with this) I drew fan comics of Batman. I liked Tim Burton's Batman but my rebellious nature and dislike of authority made me dream that Batman was not just a slave to the people of Gotham. In my comics the authoritarian police was evil and Batman used his fancy toys to slaughter a bunch of them. I had issues... But had I ever brought my unique idea to the big screen, it would probably not have been very popular. I know, because I see Maleficent suffering from a number of issues, despite being a good film overall.This film feels very forced at times, especially in the first half. Angelina Jolie knows her stuff and she is really glorious in all her overacting, but her character is made to turn so sudden and unnatural and a lot of the dialogue given to her is so simple that it seems like the fan who was writing this fan story has not quite found the balance yet between the original material and his vision.The character of Maleficent in Disney's animated film was designed from the start as an evil's character. This film has decided to keep that design and also keep the design of Maleficent's surroundings, constantly bringing in bits and pieces from the original story. So when it then tries to mess with the established design, it just feels odd. On top of the contradicting visual design, Maleficent is simply known to the current generation as cartoonishly evil because it was engraved into our minds from childhood, so seeing the concept meddled with is doubly as weird because of that.After the initial bumpy start, though the flow of the movie does get better but Maleficent does not ever rise above being just good.There are plenty of pretty visuals since there is a whole fairy world, complete with mandatory different colored lights shining in the dark. There is a ton of CGI and we are now entering the age when CGI looks quite good even in an average movie. The things is, we are also entering an age where those of us who have already seen a lot of CGI are also not as impressed by it. Some of us value good characters and good props more.Angelina Jolie acts well and she occupies most of this movie so that is good, but the rest of the characters are very average. None of them act badly, but none of them are memorable either. The story is OK, as you already know what it is and the one twist is also the main premise so you know that too.If you need some movies to watch at a gathering of friends, there is nothing wrong with picking this one. It is acceptable. However, I question how many people will remember it a year from now.",Maleficent
174,happy_hangman,Jolie Rules,7,15 March 2015,"'Maleficent' looks fantastic. The familiar visual motifs of Disney's 1959 'Sleeping Beauty' are tweaked and twisted with obvious glee in Robert Stromberg's current flick, which puts the titular 'Mistress of All Evil' in the spotlight (though she stole the Disney flick from the bland heroine, anyway). Baddies are always more fun, and Angelia Jolie clearly revels in her more malign moments. Interestingly, in providing motivations for her 'fall from grace', this version borrows rather a lot from Celtic mythology (on turning bad, she becomes the Cailleach Bheur of legend (the Winter Queen, who taps the earth with her staff to herald Winter). There's some nice humour, and Stromberg's use of CGI and outlandish creatures never (unlike his work on 'Avatar' and Burton's 'Alice In Wonderland') swamps character. The supporting cast are generally good, though why many of them are adopting dodgy Scottish accents (Sharlto Copley as King Stephan sounds like a cross between Groundskeeper Willie and Scrooge McDuck) – but it's Jolie's film.",Maleficent

176,abouhelier-r,Maleficent,6,31 May 2014,"A ruthless fairy is driven to curse an infant princess only to realise the child may be the only one who can restore peace. I grew up with Disney's old classic films but surprisingly I wasn't really excited to see this film. Robert Stromberg formerly worked as a visual effects supervisor on Avatar (2009), Alice in Wonderland (2010) and many others. For this new Disney production he's for the first time behind the camera. Maleficent is part of the classic tale Sleeping Beauty so it could be dangerous adapting it to the big screen. It must be an iconic actress to embody this iconic villain. And Angelina Jolie is the picture perfect of this character. She nailed it! I have to admit that I am disappointed by this film so far as I expected a little more of wicked and evilly things and less heart melting sequences. Beside Angelina Jolie, I feel like all the characters were ruined. From King Stefan to Aurora and the three fairies. Aurora seems very naive and ""everything is beautiful and I'm pretty!"" which is a bit annoying as her relationship with Maleficent is one of the most important theme of the movie. It's using Sleeping Beauty as a baseline but I'm not sure of how they justified and explained certain things. They find a way to make all sense but it's not systematically the best way. On the plus side, we have to keep in mind that this film is mainly targeting children. That's why it has some morale whether good or bad she is. The best scene is the baptism which is very similar as the fable. There are some very good battle sequences though. They might have tried a little to hard just to focus on Maleficent. Finally, this film is visually appealing but it's not much more than a kids movie. In fact, there is not very emotional weight.Overall, Maleficent is a magical and visually beautiful film destroying some iconic Disney characters with no major substance.",Maleficent
177,mgruebel,Disney did it!,7,9 February 2015,"Maleficent turns the well-worn Sleeping Beauty fairytale on its head. Usually, the bad guys are one-dimensional characters, barely fleshed-out enough to motivate their evil doings. In Disney's original, the bad faerie is not invited to the baptism of the King's daughter, and goes nuts over it.Here, we have a much more complex character. As a young faerie, Maleficient falls in puppy love with a commoner boy who visits her in the fairyland adjacent to the kingdom. But eventually, when the throne can fall into his hands, cutting off her wings to please a dying king is not above the now-grown boy's ambitions to succeed as king. Maleficient curses the daughter of her former amour, but gradually comes to love Aurora, while keeping her alive so she can make it to age 16 despite three very inept fairies. A mother-daughter relationship eventually develops between Maleficent and Aurora, who does not find out until the fateful day of the curse that Maleficent cursed her, after her father cut off Maleficent's wings. However, not even Maleficent can revoke her own curse, which can be broken only by a kiss of true love. When Sleeping Beauty succumbs to the spindle, a handsome and nice prince cannot rescue her, for he knows her not well enough to truly love her, but Maleficent's motherly kiss does.Angelina Jolie pulls this off very well. The special effects are serving the story, rather than driving the story. Many auxiliary characters, from the poor raven helper who gets transformed into helper animals or humans by Maleficent as needed, to the inept trio of fairies, are as enchanting as the scenery.The 7/10 rating on IMDb seems fairly accurate to me in this case: fun fare, well done, but not quite up to the level of true greatness. For me, the main downfall was that the film turned the table too well on the usual one-dimensional characterization of ""the bad guy,"" to make the ""bad guy"" less sympathetic. Here, the first king attacks Maleficent's fairyland without any good reason, then gets all fussed up when he loses. King #2, who loved Maleficent as a boy, trims off her wings, and then acts surprised that she is upset at him. From there he descends into single-minded hatred: driving his men to sleepless labor without reason, sending away his daughter never to see her until she turns 16, babbling to himself in hallucinations while his wife dies. How bad can you get? At the same time, when Maleficient is a little too good for too long, it's time to turn her helper-raven gratuitously into a wolf to get some humans killed. It feels a little too much like the screenwriters were trying to time Maleficent's good-vs-evil balance to keep her ambiguous as a character, while turning the king into a caricature of evil. If the film had succeeded at making both sides more gray than black-and-white (Maleficent), or simply black (the king), this film could have risen to greater heights.As it is, a beautifully imagined spectacle remains, with Jolie stealing the show at most times, and a mix of bright and dark imagery that is at times truly enchanting. The critics, who ended up with a metascore below 60, were a little too harsh in this case.",Maleficent

179,mohit_sinsniwal,Maleficient? More like Magnificent!,8,25 May 2019,"IGNORE THE TRAILER: GO SEE IT!I saw this movie tonight with a friend and it was spectacular. Going in, I was excited as a life-long Disney fan but also expecting a somewhat cheesy good-vs-evil type of movie based on what I had seen in the trailer. I couldn't have been more wrong! Angelina Jolie delivers an amazing performance and makes a well-known, previously rather one- dimensional Disney villain relate-able and more sympathetic, while also managing to look like a convincing, gorgeous, magical creature.The CGI is a tad heavy and a little freaky at times (such as the three coloured pixies/Aunts) but was used, in combination with some amazing sets, to create a fantastic world and creatures which were reminiscent of the beautiful and imaginative work in movies such as ""Hellboy 2"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"". The effort by the art team here really helps to draw you into Maleficent's world at the beginning of the movie and makes you wish you were a kid growing up with this movie as fodder for your imagination.Although Maleficent's character has been humanised in this re-telling, the story really emphasises that she isn't human at all, and explores the ins and outs of her life and how she relates to the humans she encounters.The plot for this movie really fits into the current trend of exploring the anti-hero (Breaking Bad, Hannibal...) and shows that Disney is trying to break with its past depiction of characters being black and white, good or evil, etc.I feel like I am gushing over this film, but as a Disney classic lover I have been truly impressed by what is sure to be a new favourite with kids and adults equally.

I love how this movie, combining live action with CGI, completely re- invented the Sleeping Beauty story allowing Maleficent's character to change throughout the movie giving her more depth as well as portraying the male characters differently from the original fairy tale. I do not wish to put too many details in my review that might spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet but I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone who has fond memories of the original 1950s animated version.

In Sleeping Beauty they are happy and playfully banter with each other while in Maleficent, their 'playful' banter at most points is actually mean and there doesn't seem to be any fondness towards each other.It was on okay film.

183,CMTiago,Maleficent as the hero,8,16 May 2015,"It seems to me that current re imaginings of the fairy tale animated movies done by Disney in the past, will look to modernize the stories as much as possible. This past year we saw one of the most beloved villains of the Disney world become a hero, as her story is told in a whole new light. Watching a show like Once Upon A Time quite regularly, one tends to see these classic tales in different perspectives. For the purpose of the show, it works to create new and exciting story lines. In the case of Maleficent, I felt it makes for a great redemption tale, as the titular character will indeed go through various challenges that will change her. It seemed clear from the beginning that Angelina Jolie was a perfect choice to play the iconic character. However, the rest of the cast also delivered with Elle Fanning's sweetness lighting up Aurora and another intense Sharlto Copley role. While the CGI did bother me with the fairies when they were in their flying forms, the overall result was very eye-pleasing. Much has been said about this movie's message and how it affects young woman who like this sort of movie. I, personally, found the movie entertaining and at least it does inspire woman with confidence.

185,deacon_blues-3,"One prolonged, mammoth fit of PMS!",4,10 December 2014,"They should have entitled this film ""Revenge of the PC PMS."" It was not enough for the scriptwriters to butcher the original fairy tale into something foreign and unrecognizable, but they also displayed the unmitigated hubris to offer this version as the ""real story!"" What a load! This film is moronic from the start, applying the undeniably evil name ""Maleficent"" to the original fairy character before she had even done anything wicked. This is a puzzle whose only answer is either ignorance or a lack of attention to detail. The name ""Maleficent"" is clearly a character description of someone who is both malicious and magnificently powerful. But I suppose such a level of understanding was considered beyond the intelligence of the target audience for this film. Set aside the whole tired and annoying insistence on an earth-spirit, new-age reinterpretation of everything from the original classic story, this Maleficent is a loving innocent little fairy (although she has decidedly demonic horns and bat-like horned wings!) who is jilted by some little jerk named Stephen whom she meets first as a jewel thief. Surprise! The little bandit leads her on and eventually amputates her wings to impress the human king, thus securing the throne for himself. Rather than realize that he was not worth all the trouble anyway and getting on with her life, Maleficent goes into a prolonged hissy-fit and becomes bent on making everyone else as miserable as she is. Why she did not merely use her obviously prodigious magical powers (turning a crow into a man, a wolf, a horse, and finally a dragon, plus growing a giant wall of brambles (to protect her territory, not to keep the hero prince out of the castle where the beauty sleeps, as in the original) to just give herself a new pair of wings and move on with her life, I cannot begin to fathom. Also, someone should have told the scriptwriters that iron is a common, naturally occurring element that Maleficent would have unavoidably encountered constantly in her own realm. Instead, we have this nonsensically applied ""iron allergy"" throughout the film whenever the writers' whim finds it useful to their tortured excuse for a story. Obviously this is intended as a metaphor for the evil of human weapons and warfare, which of course is so foreign to the pure, gentle, loving nature spirits. Another load of PC environmentalist nonsense.Another inconsistency is that, as in the original, the third pixie is interrupted before she is able to bestow her blessing upon the newborn princess. In the classic film, this becomes the saving grace of the story, allowing the third pixie give her the hope of being awakened by the kiss of a hero prince. But in this tortured, convoluted version, the third blessing just goes undone, which makes no sense. Why interrupt the third pixie if you're not going to use it as an essential element to drive the story? This is just poor storytelling, period.Then we have the silly, interminably drawn-out narrative of how the conflicted sorceress enters into a prolonged love-hate relationship with the princess. Maleficent ends up doing all the providing and protecting that the inept trio of pixies are seemingly incapable of. In the crucial ""true love's kiss"" scene, the handsome prince is useless, and it is Maleficent herself who delivers the needed wakeup call. I half expected the soundtrack to break out into a chorus of ""I Kissed a Girl"" in glorious lesbian triumph! On another subject, one of the possible reasons that Maleficent did not just grow a new pair of wings is that her emotional anguish was not about losing her wings, but her broken heart. So far, so good; but in the final act of the film, it suddenly becomes all about the lost wings! Why the wings didn't just reattach themselves right after Stephen removed them is never explained. I guess such a question never occurred to the writers.The fact is that this entire butchery of a story is just a prolonged piece of feminist propaganda, much like the equally twisted ""Frozen"" of recent release. All the male characters are useless at best, and otherwise selfishly and insensitively evil on average. The rampant egotism of our modern culture is obsessed with revising and reinterpreting everything in its own image and according to its own PC understanding. Thus it can learn nothing from the past and is likely to be doomed to eventually repeat all the most foolish and fatal of its mistakes.Leave it to our current self-aggrandizing culture to take a lovely classic tale full of precious moral values and transform it into this narcissistic mess of politically correct, morally ambivalent silliness.I cannot imagine Walt himself having anything to do with this mutilated version of his classic original. But then so much of what has come out lately is aimed merely at the politically correct, airhead segment of of society. Not worthy of serious consideration.Spectacular FX, BTW; but that does not make up for a rotten, worthless story.",Maleficent
186,thepriceofpayne,Not my Malificent,5,30 October 2018,Despite some great performances from Angelina Jolie and Sharlato Copley (as well as Brenton Thwaites and Elle Fanning) Malificent is sadly a butchering of the classic Disney villain by giving us the she was good all along twist that is played out and fairly lame.

187,xlars,Wannabe - but not quite,7,26 June 2014,"Maleficent is the film that was made out of what seems to have been a good idea. The problem, however, with good ideas as such, is that they are very hard to turn into great handiwork. The plot in itself has a promising beginning telling the background story of the evil faerie whom we all know from Walt Disney's variant of the story about Sleeping Beauty, and as far as it goes, the author or whatever has done a great job.The same applies to the idea of how Maleficent lost her wings, and there are plenty Freudian elements woven into the fabric of the story of both Maleficent and later that of Aurora.And even though it is a story of evil, it is not the story of evil, paraphrased from the original story of evil, as set in the Bible, which I as such would not have a problem with, if it weren't for the reason that they've used some of it, and let some hanging in the air.That is the major problem of «Maleficent». There are something missing. Missing from the plot. Missing from the argument, that the story is based and built upon. What is missing though, is difficult to pinpoint, it is almost like sitting down at a table desiring to eat a hotchpotch or a dish of Lobscouse, and noticing with the first mouthful that «something is missing». A spice perhaps? But which specific spice?Sorry, but there ought to be ample possibility to make better work than this.",Maleficent

189,novux,One of the best Disney live action (still) by far,10,24 December 2020,"Something usually criticized at this whole revival era of Disney's classics is the fact that they can be easily (and not fairly) compared to the original ones; in fact, usually these new movies are just a ""copy and paste"" of the classics, making it boring and not original, for example, ""The Lion King (2019)"". On the other hand, these live action movies can be completely new and different, but making it go strongly away from the movie inspiration and goals.It is therefore why I believe Disney is truly messing up at investing in this type of productions, which many of them turn out with horrible critics and miserable box office (sometimes), despise of that, Maleficent (2014) may be the exception of a whole list of disappointments, this movie is visually stunning and innovative with a plot that may regret the original Sleeping Beauty but gladly turning it into an amazing anti hero story instead of your everyday princess tale.Furthermore, Fanning's and Jolie's work is magnificent, they managed to represent the whole idea of their roles just as the classic one, specially it is nice to have an Aurora portrayed by and actress that actually resembles the real (and surprisingly short just like the rest of Disney's princesses) age of the role.

190,tinovalkki,Very entertaining and beautiful,8,3 June 2014,"Disney's Maleficent tells the old fairy tale from new angle. King is no longer good, evil is good and kiss of Prince charming won't wake up the princess. Despite that movie is a very beautiful to watch. Set is extremely sharp and elaborate and original story and it's set is brought so beautifully to silver screen. Disney is distinctly wanted to tell old fairy tale beautifully from new angle and done it successfully. Angelina Jolie is great as a Maleficent, but sadly Elle Fanning as Aurora feels more like giggly moron. Also fussy little fairy's are at least annoying and they are clearly brought just to entertain the youngest audience. Luckily Angelina Jolie's Maleficent carries the movie and make it enjoyable to watch. 3D has once used as it is supposed to and few camera movements are beautiful to watch. Very entertained update for an old fairy tale.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/",Maleficent

I really hope it is well deserved 7/10 rating on IMDb...Here we go, let's start with it! 5 minutes - I already like various magical creatures of the realm. They really nicely done, full of details and great animation.This whole narration and beautiful fairyland reminds me greatly of a FABLE (the game).15minutes- OK... I am impressed and already hooked in :) I really like the story and I am honestly curious what will happen next, the fable very nicely shifts from being happy and colourful to dark and gloomy. This is not another fart from Disney, this thing got a character! I can't stop thinking how would Tim Burton make this movie. Even though it's really nice, I am most certain that Mr TB would make it even better! Yup it is a solid and good movie.

193,EmmaDinkins,A Chix Chat On Film Review: New spin on a classic.,9,2 June 2014,"This film was so creative and imaginative that it made me want to go back and review Sleeping Beauty just to map the correlations; this was a wonderful new spin on an old tale. Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) was not just a one dimensional villain; she was truly relatable and genuinely garnered sympathy for all that she endured. I wasn't surprised that she had been betrayed costing her to lose her wings, that much was fairly clear from the trailer although the extent of the betrayal wasn't clear until I experienced the film. Hell has no fury like a fairy scorned! But anyone who has ever been angry for any reason knows that it is very hard to stay in that place. The passage of time depicted as Aurora (Elle Fanning) grew was the best gauge for the changes in Maleficent's disposition. The story was very engaging to watch as Maleficent also grew. Hopefully, there won't be a crazy Hollywood band wagon of films based on every classic villain's perspective; that would be such a shame and would put me back on my soap box regarding a lack of originality. Shrek did it right and now so has Maleficent. There were so many phenomenal special effects in this film that it's hard to call out some as superior to others. With that being said, whenever Maleficent exhibited her powers the results were awe inspiring, from the floaters, to her in-flight and those amazing battle sequences. The special effects were as much a star of this film as the talented actors. I did feel like some of the magical creatures were recycled from the Spyderwick Chronicles, but most were new creations so that's only a minor infraction. With all the action, an engaging adventure and a female lead, this film is to be enjoyed by all. I'll suffice it to say that this is a great film to kick-off the start to the summer movie season for avid film lovers.",Maleficent

195,gerry_barnaby,"phenomenal film, Angelina Jolie is phenomenal as maleificent",10,28 May 2014,"First thing i will say is i was stunned on just how beautifully made this film was, stunning visual effect & cinematography are outstanding to bring what is a phenomenal fantasy adventure film to life. This isn't the story every one know of sleeping beauty, its told in a different way & it works brilliantly to show a much more detail story of why Maleficent became evil in the first place. Angelina Jolie Stole this film with her presence & outstanding performance as Maleficent in every way possible, she was born to play this role, i love the transference of being a good fairy to become this evil witch like fairy the transaction was flawless you could just see how her demeanor changed over time with the way she performed this role just made the character shine even more better. Not only did she show us just how fantastic of actress she is she also show just how funny she can be as well phenomenal performance. Sharlto Copley done a brilliant job as playing the king Stefan although his character was a little flawed in places but that was down to his characters writing screen portrayal, Elle Fanning playing Auroradoes a pretty good job at playing the princess although she wasn't quiet the co main lead she should of been but that because the whole story is based on maleficent so they could get away with that. Fantasy cant come better than this with some of the most amazing C.G.I effect of lovable character from the fairy tales just amazingly done Special the three fair god mothers played by Lesley Manville, Imelda Staunton & Juno Temple as the best way i can describe them as... is the female version's of the three stooges which was so funny, special some of the scene with maleficent i laugh my head off, as this film does have its comical moments so it not all doom & gloom it has a good story to it. As for the Pg certification do i agree with that no not really has this film does have moment its push's above the PG certification special some of the battle scene & some character lets be honest he would give kids nightmares so in my opinion this should of been a 12A not a PG.In all honest this is a film i recommend watching phenomenal film that stretch the imagination & a whole new modern live action take on the story of sleeping beauty based on the villain of the film.Dislikes : As I've said the only flaw that doesn't make sense is the attitude of the character Stefan played by Sharlto Copley it just didn't make sense for him to be the way he was being because of what happen that the only flaw i saw really.",Maleficent
196,BigWhiskers,"Visually beautiful ,too bad the acting is stale and the story butchered",6,2 June 2014,"I loved the visuals ,even the CGI. Some beautiful shots of Maleficent flying and the magic of the moors. We have fantastic creatures and magical looking castles too. It is a visually beautiful film. Now for the down sides , besides Jolie who steals most of her scenes, the other actors basically phone in their roles, Elle Fanning is a bit too irritatingly sweet in a rather bland portrayal and Sharlto Copley is no more than a grunting bore. The trivia indicates that actors were hired based on the fact they looked like their characters ,Really? Seriously . I didn't think anyone looked like their characters except Jolie and maybe Fanning but that's so stupid , how about seeing if any of these so called lookalikes could act first? That's why God created makeup artists so you could hire actual actors who can act and then change them to look like their characters, And let's not forgot the major changes to the story and the fact some characters names are changed too like the three fairies. Supposedly based on Maleficents point of view , the story goes off on it's own and basically throws out almost everything from the 1950's Sleeping Beauty story. Sure she eventually turns bad , the best scene of course is the curse scene but that is even changed and the end result is not at all what you'd expect. Maleficent loses her cruel evil tones and becomes a somewhat nanny to Aurora and then I was like what in the world are they doing ? That's where it ruins the story, as it is like saying Sleeping Beauty was not the true story , this one is so ignore what you know . The narrator at the end of the movie ends up being Aurora whom I have to suspect sat down with Maleficent one day to pen her autobiography since she wasn't even born when the first half of the story takes place. A shame they had to do that do a classic , Jolie could have really owned this role if they had stuck to what Maleficent was about truly. Instead we are left with disappointment at what could have been,",Maleficent
197,nahumthebest,"Very poorly written story; Angelina Jolie's acting was excellent, but the rest was poor; great animation and special effects",6,25 June 2020,"***SPOILERS***I thought this movie would be excellent. But I was shockingly surprised at how badly the story was written. Here are some examples:-Stefan could have killed Maleficent, but he spared her life. She in return does not return the same kindness and murders him at the end without telling him that her kiss reversed Aurora's curse so he had no reason to be upset anymore. His death was completely needless.-Aurora lives her entire life out in the wild where she was unprotected, when she could have been protected from Maleficent at the castle by the guards. This of course allows for the story's twist to occur (Maleficent develops loves for Aurora so her kiss reverses the curse. And we get a happy ending. But this is complete nonsense. You do not send your baby daughter into the wild away from your castle with hundreds of guards. Nonsense. This is ridiculous.-When Aurora returns to the castle, her father was so dismissive and unloving towards Aurora that it was not believable. She also did not even ask about her mother. It does not make sense that her father does not show any love towards his daughter. This is not believable.Beleficent MURDERS Aurora's father... and Aurora smiles at Beleficent in the end as if her father was not just murdered? This is preposterous.There were a few nice things in this movie:-Angelina Jolie was the saving grace in this film. Her acting was excellent in my opinion. The rest of the cast were flat and immediately forgettable, especially King Stefan who has zero acting ability in this film, and Aurora, whose only good acting was her beautiful smile. They are not worth me looking up their real names.-The twist was nice: we find out the love kiss actually would need to come from Beleficent herself to save Aurora. However, the fact remains that this twist was blatantly and unnaturally FORCED by the story writer Charles Perrault. No King sends their baby daughter to live in the woods near an evil witch with powers where she can have easy access to the child! *Shaking my head*-The final battle was cool. There was a fire-spitting dragon, flying, and overall a cool fight.-Happy ending, except that Aurora's father is murdered in cold blood by Maleficent and Aurora is smiling at Maleficent as if nothing happened. This allows for a FORCED and unnatural happy ending where literally everyone is smiling and is happy.-The animation and special effects were great.Conclusion: outrageously poorly written story with forced events. Angelina Jolie did an excellent job in her role and was the saving grace to this film and the ONLY reason why it is worth a watch - watching her be Maleficent was enjoyable. The main story's twist was good, the final battle was cool and the ending was a happy ending. I will watch the sequel now and hope it is better.6/10",Maleficent
198,vistheindian,Enjoyable twist on a Disney classic,7,31 May 2014,"Quickie Review:Maleficent, one of the most popular Disney villains is brought to life by the brilliant actress Angelina Jolie. This is a live-action variation on the Disney animation Sleeping Beauty. The story is told in Maleficent's point of view, as we are shown how she turns from a fairy to an evil villain, driven to seek vengeance. The absolute gem of this movie is no doubt Angelina Jolie, and how she just embodies both the dark and the light side of Maleficent. Same can't be said about the rest of the cast, as they are all one-note characters. However, Jolie's performance alone is reason enough to catch this on the big screen.Full Review:I am not a huge fan, but I do quite like the original Sleeping Beauty Disney animation. So when I first heard that it was going to be remade with the villain's perspective, I was intrigued. Then I saw Angelina Jolie as Maleficent herself in the first trailer, and I was excited. After watching the movie, I am glad to say that she was indeed the best part of it all.I enjoyed seeing the first act where Maleficent changes from a happy fairy to a vindictive villain. Without giving too much away, there's a tragic event that happens that causes her to change. However, this transformation is not abrupt and with the help of Jolie's talent it feels very natural. You see both sides, good and bad, struggling inside her, which allows the audience to actually empathize with her. This aspect is crucial if a villain focused movie is to work, and they pull it off to great effect. The rest of the movie she has a pet crow called Diaval (Sam Riley), which can turn into a human. Their dynamic together was interesting to watch because it brought out the humanity in Maleficent. The thing is that the movie spends so much effort on humanizing Maleficent that we actually don't really see the truly evil side of her. I would've like to have seen them explore the darker side more, but I guess the PG-rating restricted them to do so.I have praised Jolie a lot because she brought some complexity to the character. Conversely, the other two main actors Elle Fanning as Aurora (a.k.a. Sleeping Beauty) and Sharlto Copley as King Stefan had no depth. Ironically Fanning and Copley feel more cartoonish than real characters. It's a shame because based on their previous films I know they can act much better than they did here. King Stefan is always sad and mopey, while Aurora acts like a hippie raving about how every single thing is so pretty. The most annoying part of the movie has got to be the three fairies. From the Disney animated version I remember them as quite caring of Aurora, but in this movie they are simply dim-witted and irresponsible. Then Prince Phillip (Brenton Thwaites) is shoehorned into the movie because I guess Disney fairy tales dictate there has to be a prince. Due to some liberties taken with the story he is just not needed and pointlessly forced in.This is by no means a perfect movie, there are some faults in it that many would use to tear this movie apart. Then again keeping in mind this is aimed for the families and kids, it is really enjoyable. Even though I don't fit either of those demographics, I still walked away quite satisfied. I should mention that there are in fact a lot of liberties taken with the story. So if you are big fan of the animated version, I am afraid you might not like Maleficent. For the rest of us, despite the flaws there is still plenty to like.",Maleficent
199,CountVladDracula,Charming,9,22 June 2014,"Maleficent is a beautiful movie. It has plot holes that are very easy to poke at but it's still decent and sweet. The ""true love"" aspect felt like a slight rip off of Frozen and I wish they could have given the prince a bigger role and or let there be romantic true love in there somewhere even if it was between Diaval and Maleficent. I freakin' love Diaval by the way.There are a few things I prefer from the earlier script such as king Stefan secretly being half-faery and the bastard of a faery king so Aurura could end up developing her own faery magick (that was in the earlier script but not the finished movie). The three pixies are done better in the movie than in the earlier script though. In the earlier script they were kind of bitchy. Now they are just bungling.Angelina Jolie plays the role so well that I actually felt bad when she woke up with her wings missing. Visually it's gorgeous. The creatures all resemble Brian Froud illustrations. My biggest complaint is Stefan. He was a bit over-the-top. Diaval is my favorite character though. He has this adorable, dysfunctional relationship with Maleficent.For purists to the original fairy tale, the best way to look at it is it's an alternate reality because this is certainly NOT the Maleficent of the animated Sleeping Beauty. The fact that the three pixies don't even have the names from the animated film make that apparent.You do have to shut your mind off a little but it is good enough a movie that you can ignore it's flaws.",Maleficent
200,hoxjennifer,Angelina Jolie is Magnificent!,9,3 June 2014,"Upon seeing the trailers for Maleficent, I was already excited to see it just from the concept of the film - classic fairy tale told from the ""evil villain's"" point of view (which Disney should do more of if they're running out of material). And upon watching Maleficent in theatres last night, I was not disappointed. Angelina Jolie steals the show - she is absolutely perfect for the role, and the make up and costuming on her is just stunning. This movie is thoroughly enjoyable for all ages. This is a love story without the gushy stuff. This is a story about greed, revenge and redemption. Kids and adults alike will to be able to get something out of this film.

201,japamo,"""Sympathy for the Misunderstood Villain"" Trend Finds Its Most Recent Expression in a Radically Altered Fairy Tale",8,26 October 2014,"Arguably, the ""Sympathy for the Misunderstood Villain"" trend first took root in the ""Shrek"" movies. Then, it flourished in other entertaining but emotionally stirring films like ""Megamind"", ""Despicable Me 1 and 2"", ""How to Train Your Dragon 1 and 2"", and ""Wreck-It- Ralph"". I hope the trend continues because it refreshingly reminds us that no one is born ""evil""; rather, ""evil"" develops within initially kind, compassionate people who suffer a grave injustice or injury. The ""evil"" turns out to be bitter resentment, frustration, and fearful vengeance. This adds much-needed dimension and complexity to formerly one-note, stock ""villains"" and evokes hope that the ""villain"" will go back to his/her better ways.This framework envelops Disney's live-action, CGI version of its classic, if slight, fairy-tale ""Sleeping Beauty"", now titled ""Maleficent"" and focuses on the eponymous ""villainess"". We first see Maleficent as a buoyant, sprightly, slightly mischievous young fairy (played in life stages by Ella Purnell and Isobelle Molloy) who flies and sweeps majestically over her enchanted domain and is friend and protector to its inhabitants (who would be quite at home in a ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Harry Potter"" movie). Perhaps she should have been named ""Beneficent"" in the beginning?Anyway, Maleficent's life would be idyllic if not for the hostile human kingdom bordering her world and lorded over by the belligerent, hostile King Henry (Kenneth Cranham). Time and again King Henry attempts to wipe out the enchanted land, but is always thwarted by Maleficent's sorcery and conjuring of powerful defendants like the ent-like (from Tolkien) tree people. Naturally, Maleficent takes a dim view of humans until a teenage boy named ""Stefan"" (Michael Higgins) stumbles into her world. He seems different because he apparently is curious about Maleficent and her world and eager to learn about it. Maleficent obliges and a close friendship, if not romantic relationship, develops.Time relentlessly passes and the now-adult Stefan (Sharlto Copley) leaves Maleficent and her land to learn about the world. The now-adult Maleficent (now played with regal grandeur – and cheekbones that could chop down medium-sized trees- by Angelina Jolie) wistfully but patiently awaits Stefan's return. It is not a happy reunion. Stefan is now corrupted with base human desires and ambitions. These desires and ambitions find a resting place in King Henry, on his deathbed and eager to find a successor among his noble retinue and other followers. King Henry will name as successor the one who will destroy or at least cripple Maleficent. Stefan volunteers. He can't bring himself to kill her as she sleeps, so he decides the next best thing is to cut off her wings, which he sneakily does and brings to King Henry as proof. Stefan succeeds in becoming king.Maleficent shrieks in dismay at her mutilation and descends into bitter resentment and revenge. First she erects a wall of thorns to protect her kingdom and compels the fairyland inhabitants to acknowledge her as queen. Next, she visits Stefan's castle and places the famous sleeping curse on his infant daughter. After her 16th birthday, the princess Aurora (Elle Fanning) will prick her finger on a spinning wheel needle and fall into eternal slumber, only to be broken by ""Love's true kiss"", which Maleficent grimly believes does not exist.To stave off the curse, King Stefan entrusts baby Aurora's care to three earnest but klutzy pixies: Knotgrass (Imelda Staunton), Thistlewit (Juno Temple), and Flittle (Lesley Manville). The pixies spirit off the baby to a remote cottage to escape Maleficent's attention. Of course, Maleficent's no fool and employs a somewhat unwilling shapeshifter named Diaval (Sam Riley) to keep tabs on Aurora. Despite the pixies' inexperience in homemaking, Aurora grows into a radiant, inquisitive, and dauntless young woman. Eventually, Maleficent and Aurora meet. Even though Maleficent loathes and condemns all humans, Aurora breaks through her fierce defenses and reawakens the tenderness and care she once nurtured by truly caring about and absolutely enjoying the magical creatures and their environment, even resolving to look after them. Softened, Maleficent revokes the curse she placed on Aurora and is ready to travel her road to redemption.However, Aurora's pixie foster-parents inadvertently blurt out that she is King Stefan's princess daughter. Aurora visits her father and learns about the curse. Now herself disillusioned, Aurora renounces Maleficent and brings on the curse anyway. Learning from Diaval about this, Maleficent resolves to rescue Aurora. Unfortunately, Stefan has managed to forge weapons from a metal that is impervious even to Maleficent's spells. Are Maleficent, and Diaval, doomed? Will Aurora's sleep be eternal, or can it be broken with the possible help of the handsome Prince Phillip whom Maleficent enchants to accompany her to the castle?""Maleficent"" incorporates all the ""Sleeping Beauty"" elements, even a dragon, and transmogrifies and radically changes them, including profoundly changing the meaning of ""true love's kiss"". The movie, and Jolie, take a forbidding, darkly distrustful character and always manage to make her sympathetic no matter what harsh retribution she plots, because we realize the evil acts come from pain and betrayal and we want her to find her soul again. The journey Maleficent takes to do this is filled with rousing excitement, energetic medieval action, eye-catching special effects, and lush or foreboding but always arresting cinematography. In spite of her formidable character, as the elderly narrator intones, ""Maleficent"", like the rest of us, has both heroic and base qualities. Also like the rest of us, ""Maleficent"" hopes to choose her better nature and earn (back) her (angelic) wings.",Maleficent

203,cattjones,Sleeping Beauty to the Tenth Power,9,31 May 2014,"I expected to see a film about sleeping beauty and I assume that most people expect the same. I was pleasantly surprised to be surprised. The film is not what I expected. I also did not see this film in 3D, which I regretted by the end of the film. I could see moments (a lot of moments) that would have been beneficial if they would have been in 3D. Angelina Jolie (Maleficent) did a brilliant job playing the betrayed fairy. I do have to say that her cheek bones were pointy to the extreme. Elle Fanning (Aurora) is really making a name for herself. I am sure that by now she is tired of playing a younger Dakota. The three baby-sitters in this film Lesley Manville (Flittle), Imelda Staunton (Knotgrass) and Juno Temple (Thistletwit) have to be the worse babysitters on the planet. They were very cute as fairies, but when they became normal, they were just idiots. Watching them as adults was pretty painful and reminded me of the Three Stooges (which I do not like). Sam Riley (Diaval) was my favorite character in this film. I think that he provided a sense of humanity and sensibility as Maleficent's sidekick. The one thing that I did notice while watching the film is that a lot of adults kept getting up and walking out (to go to the restroom, buy more food, whatever). It was as if they were bored because they already knew what was going to happen. I have to say that I felt that way too for a while. I even stepped out to return a call to my mom. Turns out that there is a twist to the story and when that happened, everyone was glued to their seat. I think that the star of this film was the imagery. The creatures and background in this film was really what captured the attention of the audience (myself included). This is a film that I may have to go back and see it in 3D. By the way. at the end of the film all the little kids in the theater applauded, which is always a good sign for a Disney film.",Maleficent

205,mwcrunner,An amazing and different version of the original Sleeping Beauty,10,7 April 2016,Angelina Jolie makes an excellent performance in this version of Sleeping Beauty. This is a whole new look at the original Disney tale. Not only is Maleficent is a villain in this she's also a hero. Of course the real villain in this version of Sleeping Beauty is King Steffon. He fell in love with her as a kid and when he grew up he broke Maleficent's heart and took her wings. This makes sense since Maleficent is actually a fairy who had her wings stolen and it would've made a whole lot more sense if it was actually shown in the original animated version. Also it was Maleficent's love for Aurora to wake her up from the spell and not Prince Phillips. Also King Steffon got what he deserved in the end. All in all this is a great version of the original Disney classic. Definitely 10 out of 10 for this.,Maleficent
206,justbob1982,"Looks stunning, but can't decide what kind of story it is",6,18 October 2015,"Version I saw: Brittany Ferries on-board cinema screeningActors: 6/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 5/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 6/10The problem with Maleficent is that it can't decide what kind of story it wants to be. It draws from three distinct narrative traditions that are at odds with each other, and never truly resolves the conflicts that result.Officially, it is based on Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty', but it takes the opportunity to re-assess the story and twist it by turning the villain Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) into a misunderstood heroine. I support this idea: the existing story wouldn't really work for a modern audience. However, in doing so, it draws on the folk tales which inspired the 1959 film, as well as taking it forward with a post-modern style of re-analysis, and the fact is that the folk tale, Disney adventure and post-modern story are simply too contradictory to sit well alongside each other.Admittedly, they cast the lead role perfectly. One suspects from her executive producer credit that Angelina has been on board since the early stages: she has exactly the kind of star power required to get a project like this off the ground. She lights up the screen with the kind of accustomed charisma earned from being at the very top of the game for 15 years, as well as being one of the acknowledged most beautiful women in the world. Indeed, if anything, she is too radiant, eclipsing even Aurora (Elle Fanning), who is supposed to have magically enhanced beauty.Given that the director Robert Stromberg is a first-timer more experienced in the realms of special effects and art direction, it is no surprise that the look of the film is stunning. The environments constructed are sumptuous, jammed with detail, and invested with all the brightness and energy the latest computer technology can bring to bear.As long as you are willing to live with the thematic drive being all over the place, there are two great reasons to watch this film: Angelina Jolie and the cracking special effects. For me, it came away a bit tarnished, but ultimately positive, on balanced.",Maleficent
207,s_campanale,A Feminist reworking of a classic tale that's no fairy tale but a worthy and daringly offbeat addition to the new fantasy boom.,8,3 June 2014,"""Maleficent"" is the latest in the cycle of ""re-invented fairy tales"" which have been filling our screens (and stages and bookshelves) for the last few years, turning against the cutesy sudsey happy gay clappy versions of yore to return to the darker nature and mythopoeic roots of these stories. This one comes from the same producer who gave us Disney's ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" and ""Oz the Great and Powerful"", two marvellous and engaging movies that have been rare success stories in the otherwise Box Office disappointment laden 'New Fantasy Boom"". Those took the established narratives and made them darker and more psychological, finding good reasons for the classic villains to be who they were. 'Maleficent' on the other hand changes the story completely and tells its own narrative, a sort of 'alternate version' that presents the villain of the piece, evil sorceress Maleficent, as the heroine and King Stephan, the fairies and everyone else as guilty parties. It could be interpreted as her own version of events, a sort of 'The Book of Judas' deal, but the narration turns out to be by Princess Aurora herself. So is everything we are seeing here true or not? Do we trust someone like Maleficent to be 100% honest?The revised storyline begins before the traditional version, with a land split between a human kingdom and a fairy/magical one. Young thief Stephan meets young Maleficent, the guardian fairy who unfortunately looks like a devil (in disguise?) and the two fall in love but then part ways years later. A war breaks out between the two with Maleficent general of the magical armies (tree creatures in cavalry and infantry divisions) giving the humans a drubbing. The enraged king offers his crown to however offs her, and ambitious Stephan woos her and steals her wings (but spares her life) getting the crown and the Princess as his prize. Maleficent turns to the dark side, transforms the fairy land into an oppressive military dictatorship and dons a sinister black costume, from that day forth becoming known as Maleficent (except that she already was! But anyway) She crashes her ex's first child's Christening and does the whole spindle curse thing, the sits back with her Crow/Human assistant Diaval (Sam Riley) to gloat as the three (here) useless fairies try to raise young Aurora, but through a series of accidents becomes attached to her, inevitably seeing what should have been her child as a substitute daughter and annexing the rights of motherhood from her rival. Maelficent's heart starts to warm and she begins to dream of this idyll continuing but her past actions come to bite her on the magical behind. The curse she laid cannot be undone and King Stephan has become mad with grief, guilt and anger and is determined to kill her at any cost. As Aurora slips into a spindle induced coma, 'true loves kiss' comes to mean something quite else, but there is still Stephan and the arsenal he has been building to contend with before the two kingdoms finally become united under one ruler.The scenario plays out more like some 'dark fantasy' version, with a Feminist spin (A Woman's wings clipped by a selfish man!) where men are **&^% (except Crows) and the true love of the fairy tales does not exist. There is also a barely disguised Lesbian element that makes one think this was some odd self-published fan fiction that got picked up and expanded. It spits in the face of the traditional message of the story, which is no bad thing since that message was false and disingenuous but many audience members may not like that all, especially from Disney. Traditionally the home of good wholesome all-American values, the house of mouse seems to have turned into a chapter of the Revolutionary Communist Party of late in both its own and its Marvel outings. One may fancifully imagine the board held hostage somewhere while Radicals direct the day to operations in secret ""Diamonds are Forever"" style, but the truth is probably much more to do with commercial considerations and a cynically planned strategy to follow 'current trends'. Once the dial starts spinning back to more conservative ideas you will see them doing so also.The film looks spectacular and like other movies in the 'New Fantasy Boom' carries the chromosomes of the original 80s fantasy boom within its DNA, right down to its English setting and support cast. The special effects are lovely and the 3D well used. Acting wise it is clearly the Angelina Jolie show and everybody knows it. She gives her character heart but she never truly plays evil because of course this Maleficent is not truly evil, so we see rage and anger but the rest is love, tenderness and regret. She looks the part even with horns and wings, and as many have noted she played an almost identical role in the similarly 'deconstructed' ""Beowulf"" (2007) Elle Fanning is OK as Aurora, but she is just a foil for Maleficent and has barely any scenes that don't play beside her, but then frankly Aurora was never much of a character anyway. Sharlto Copley is a little disappointing as Stephan, perhaps because his meaty scenes were edited out. His Lear-esque descent into madness is interesting but ultimately just a plot device. Sam Riley is good as Maelficent's henchman while Lesley Manville, Juno Temple and Imelda Staunton play the 3 Stooges with wings. Brenton Thwaites comes and goes as the now redundant Prince Phillip while Kenneth Cranham gives some malice to the King who triggers everything off.Too dark, violent and psychologically complex for small children (not the intended target anyway) it is a fascinating piece that you will probably either love or hate.",Maleficent
208,coljam21,Pretty Average to Me,5,30 May 2014,"Well this was another case of the previews being nothing like the movie. The previews made it seem like this was going to be a dark and more mature version of the Disney movie sleeping beauty. The previews made it seem like this version of sleeping beauty would be like Chris Nolan's version of batman. Well sadly it was not. It was the typical movie that you could expect from Disney. It was the usual Disney movie with the pony puff princess flair, very juvenile and not meant for the viewing of anyone above age 10.Jolie is no doubt a force to be reckoned with. She's beautiful and commands attention, but she hardly had any lines. I wish they had given her more lines! I was also excited to see Copley under the direction of someone besides Bloomkamp, but he came off the same way he did in his previous 2 movies. I liked the premise that true love can come from someone other than a handsome prince and Jolie looked amazing in her makeup and costume and Fanning did a great job playing the naïve princess. Overall I thought it was an average movie",Maleficent

210,Holdjerhorses,Total Surprise!,10,30 May 2014,"Didn't expect a masterpiece going in, but exited realizing ""Maleficent"" is one of the best, most beautiful films I've ever experienced.It is superlative in every way; executed with meticulous care by experts at every level: screen writing, casting, art direction, cinematography, production design, producing, lighting design, CGI, stunt coordination, acting and directing.Shot after stunningly lit and composed shot, the film is a visual classic from opening to fadeout. If you know even a few basics of how things are done, there are moments where your jaw drops open - and stays there - in amazed appreciation for what this team accomplishes.It veers delicately, sometimes like lightning, from warmth to laughs to concern to sorrow to tears to majesty and back again; building, building to one moment (just before the magnificent climax) that you suddenly know / hope is coming - about ten seconds before it does - which makes it even more magical and earns your gratitude for what they've done with this timeless fairy tale.Every inch of the huge 3D screen displays an unbelievably rich collaboration in the joys of virtuoso film making destined to last as long as Disney's original, delivered by artists at the top of their crafts.Above them all: the remarkable Angelina Jolie (who also co-executive produced).A milestone in its genre!",Maleficent
211,YJLcool,Maleficent is a bit of a mixed bag...,4,1 June 2014,"In all honesty, Maleficent is a bit of a mixed bag. It's a refreshing and engaging take on a much beloved Disney classic that's full of twists and turns. But sadly, it seems that Disney has re-imagined the 1959 Sleeping Beauty to a whole new level with Maleficent to the point, dare I say, butchered the beloved 1959 classic that most of us hold dear.Despite the similarities...the protruding cheekbones, huge demonic- looking horns, fiery red lips, black cloak and dress, The Mistress of All Evil is vastly different from the original version of her in Sleeping Beauty. In this film, Maleficent is portrayed as a good fairy who rules and protects the Moors, a magical kingdom close to the human kingdom. But she was betrayed and soon she was motivated by hatred, anger and revenge that she placed the curse on Aurora. As years passed by, Maleficent eventually grew to love and care for her that she regretted her actions and tried to undo her curse but she couldn't as the curse is irreversible.The Mistress of All Evil supposed to be a cruel and wicked character, but this film ultimately portrayed her as a 'less evil', misunderstood, more heartfelt and humane character. Aside from that, the thoughts and motivation of other supporting characters (especially the king) and the ending diverts so far from the original source material that it feels like a totally different film. At the same time, because of this diversion, the story becomes rather unpredictable, which is quite exciting (you think you know the story and how it goes later on, but it's not). Because the focus of the film is Maleficent and her relationship with Aurora, the relationship between the three fairies (Flittle, Knotgrass and Thistletwit) and Aurora is underdeveloped and never touched on throughout the film.The film is also full of fantastical scenes and mystical creatures, which should be a visual delight for kids. Another worthy mention is that Angelina Jolie is perfectly cast in the lead role. She embodies the character and makes it her own. She managed to show the different emotional stages of her character vividly. I firmly believe that no other actresses could actually replace her as the character.In many ways, Maleficent exceeded my expectations that I never know I had. Rarely it hurts me to give a low rating not because of poor acting, bad CGI or horrible storytelling, but due to a script that disrespects its source material and an ending that's similar to last year's Disney release. I wished that the story could be more in tune with the original. Why Disney? Why? Why you're doing this?http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/06/movie-review-maleficent.html Rating: 4/10 (I could have easily given this film a 7.5/10...if only I never watched Sleeping Beauty or Frozen)",Maleficent
212,georgecoffeynewyorker,Revengeluf a great one word Summary,9,29 May 2014,"One word comes to mind, when it comes to review this film. Revenge. The whole film featured the entire plot on Revenge. I did however enjoy it to its fullest. The plot was Actually a ""Prequel"" as I like to call it, to the childhood story The Sleeping Beauty. Actually come to think of it, it was actually in he trailer. But anyways, the film featured an evil witch or fairy known as Maleficent(Jolie). She comes across a young lad Stefan(Copley (Later becomes King)) stealing something. They bond in friendship at the very least. After awhile, he gets ""too used"" to her if you know what I mean, and so unfortunately for Maleficent, he ""steals"" her wings. Hearing the cries and obviously painful back of which the wings were attached, went right through me. I feel Oscar worthy. From my understanding, the reason being, he stole the wings was, the Stefan's father the King, King Henry(Cranham) was on his death bed and said to his sons, anyone who kills Maleficent, will be ""worthy"" to his heir ie will take over his Throne ie becoming King. So hence the reason why Stefan stole the wings. So in revenge, Maleficent finds upon a bird known as Diaval(Riley) who turns into(well turns him into a human) and Maleficent asks Diaval to be ""my wings"" as hers was taken. So while he is doing his spying on course, he finds out and of course passes on the information to Maleficent, which is that there is to be a Christening or a ""baby party"" something like that. I joked to my friend beside me, why didn't I get such a celebration. haahah. So anyways, Maleficent in the mean time had found out. So she arrives during the Christening. And casts her spell hence the Chidlhood Tale: Sleeping Beauty. So while Aurora(Fanning) the new baby of King Stefan and his wife Leila was growing up to be of a beautiful girl, Maleficent was rethinking her spell. She even went as far to try and break the spell and reverse it. She had grown bondage to her to the point Aurora thought Maleficent was her ""Fairy Godmother"". Jolie's reply: ""What"" was priceless. haahha. We all had a great laugh, through out the movie too. Aurora found out the truth from the 3 fairies (Flittle(Manville), Knotgrass(Stautnon), Thistletwit(Temple) who reared her. SO naturally Aurora ran back to her pappy, namely the King. He hid her in the dungeon for fear of the spell being brought alive. However it is with great regret that she didn't pay heed and actually headed out and the Spell was enforced when she touched the needle. Maleficent felt this and as such was a poignant moment. The 3 fairies brought Aurora back and put her on the bed, where Prince Phillip(whom Aurora met, while he lost his way to King Stefan) was hoped to be the true love to break the spell. He passionately kissed her, but sadly didn't work. So Maleficent, went up and spoke to her while she was sleeping. It was the true love of Maleficent that brought her out of the sleep. That was really heartwarming. So after a battle, all was well and saved. Overall a highly recommended film.",Maleficent
213,DogFilmCritic,Beneficent,4,2 January 2015,"I don't hate this film, but the idea of giving Maleficent a background story is absurd, she is one of Disney s most iconic villains her name is Maleficent it means doing evil simple as that, theirs no need to stretch a story around it,the movie wants to make it a misjudge character that she was good at the beginning and that events that fold made her evil, all the time her name is Maleficent,when she was a kid her name was beneficent and she changed it when she became ¨evil¨ as the movie wants us to believe i would have bought it, Angelina Jolie is perfect for the role as she actually looks scary and intimidating but i would have expected more from her and actually respecting the source material,the faeries were awful as stupid comic relief,other than that most characters were OK, the visuals were pretty good but coming from Disney they could do a hole lot better, this movie is a hit and miss.",Maleficent
214,pefrss,The kind and caring evil Angelina Jolie in a boring Disney movie,2,12 June 2014,"Summer is here and there is even less in the movie theaters for me to see. Well, I guess that I am not the target audience for Malificent, but I love fairy tales , even at my age. I have to admit that I had never heard of Malificent. I grew up with Little Briar Rose from the Brothers Grimm and in this tale there are thirteen wise women who come to the baptism of the young princess to bestow their gifts on her. The problem in that story was that the King had only twelve golden plates and so he did not invite wise woman no. 13, who showed up anyway and cursed the child and the whole kingdom to fall in a hundred years sleep, once the girl pricked her finger on a spindle. So I was curious to see what evil fairy Angelina Jolie was playing. There was not much evil going on at the beginning of the film and I found it quite boring. I did not think that the visual were so impressive and once the character of Angelina Jolie turned ""evil"" she looked deformed and I spent most of my time wondering how they achieved that very unnatural look. I read reviews before seeing the movie and nearly everybody praised Angelina Jolie and her performance. But I have to say I was only confused. I thought she was supposed to be evil and there was really nothing evil about her. She was angry sometimes, but most of the times she was kind and caring. Now I have to admit that I am a big fan of Angelina Jolie, the person. Everything I read about her, I like. She seems to be intelligent, a good business woman, handles the media very well and does a lot of good things around the world. I even liked her wild youth. But I have yet to see a movie with her which really convinces me. That said, she is the best part of that movie. The rest of it is completely forgettable. And the worst is that the movie is boring. I was not impressed by any of the special effects or fairy characters or any of the other visuals. I caught myself looking at my watch all the time and this movie is only 97 minutes long, but it feels like it is going on forever.",Maleficent

She knew how dangerous it was to interact with a human, but she took the risk and let down her guard down for someone she trusted who betrayed her for a chance at royalty. Unlike, King Stefan once she grew fond of Princess Aurora she tried to revoke the curse and find a solution to end it such as finding true love kiss, so if you ask me she wasn't evil at all she reacted in a way any human would.",Maleficent
216,Kirollos-Noah,An arguably a Halloween movie,7,24 October 2019,"Happy Halloween, and welcome to my review of Maleficent, a movie that people don't really believe that it's a Halloween movie, but still, it has the theme, and the vibes of a Halloween-Family movie.Maleficent was directed by Robert Stromberg, and written by Linda Woolverton. And starring Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning and Sharlto Copley.Maleficent is a re-imagination to Disney's infamous classic movie ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Maleficent"" explores the untold story of Disney's most iconic villain from the classic ""Sleeping Beauty"" and the elements of her betrayal that ultimately turn her pure heart to stone. Driven by revenge and a fierce desire to protect the moors over which she presides, Maleficent cruelly places an irrevocable curse upon the human king's newborn infant Aurora. As the child grows, Aurora is caught in the middle of the seething conflict between the forest kingdom she has grown to love and the human kingdom that holds her legacy. Maleficent realizes that Aurora may hold the key to peace in the land and is forced to take drastic actions that will change both worlds forever.Sleeping Beauty is one of my all-time favorite animated movie, it was beautifully animated, well-written, so self-aware and of course it has lots of memorable characters, and an iconic and memorable villain, Maleficent.Disney understood very well what does Maleficent mean to everybody, and they decided to make a whole movie to tell us the other-side of the story, which wasn't told before, or was told but from another perspective. Of course the movie has its own differences, some people liked it and some people didn't, but loved it or hated it, Angelina Jolie's magnetic performance is the best thing in this movie, she captured the character very well, she knew what she was doing, and you can tell that she did her best to honor the character, and she definitely did, every scene she was in, it was a blast, and fortunately there's a lot of her in this movie!The movie's main focus is on Maleficent, the movie's called Maleficent anyway, so I don't really understand why people didn't like how the movie didn't care about Aurora aka Sleeping Beauty that much, yeah her character isn't that interesting, she was always being fascinated by anything around her, and you could say that it's cliched, and it is, but still the movie is trying to make you feel and care for Maleficent, not Aurora.What makes the movie also works, is that it's visually appealing, the OST also is really cool. The movie is an eye-feast, it's so chilling!Maleficent is nothing near to a flawless movie, they tried to make its flaws so hidden, by Jolie's amazing performance and the visuals, but if you focus a little, the flaws are really obvious, mainly the cliched changes, I don't say that they're not welcome, but they're still so cliched that you could see what's coming a miles away.The young actors, who played young Stefan and young Maleficent, weren't good, also the creatures design was a little bit annoying... Also the three fairies, I didn't like them at all, and unfortunately, there's a little bit too much of them in this movie!I'll be nitpicking too much if I say that sometimes the direction wasn't great, most of the movie, it was beautiful yeah, Stromberg captured lots of scenes right, but some, not that great though!Maleficent is a good movie, with an outstanding performance by it's lead, still so cliched and kinda uneven sometimes, but it's good to watch it around Halloween times with your family, and it definitely has found its fans, and I'm gladly one of them!I'm gonna give Maleficent a B.Happy Halloween, guys, it's getting close, I'll be reviewing a lot of horror and Halloween movies a lot til the end of October, so stick right here if you liked this review! And as always thank you for reading my review.",Maleficent
217,seige-hound,"Visually stunning, with a great lead, and little else.",7,3 June 2014,"I give this a 7 out of 10 just because of the characterization of Maleficent. Angelina Jolie gave a great performance overall, and gave a truly 3 dimensional anti-hero portrayal of the character.HOWEVER...this is one of the most flawed movies (that I still like) that I've ever seen. I personally post my ratings based on my personal enjoyment rather than the technical and objective parts of the movie (If I judged it that way, the score will be much lower) So...here are the problems I have with this movie, both big and small.1. Aurora. I like Elle Fanning as much as the next guy (she's great in Super 8 for instance) but I think Aurora is just a boring character. She's meant to be the prime example of innocence, but she comes off as being an airhead (Like Glenda in Wicked, except a lot less self aware) Speaking of Wicked...2. This movie is to Sleeping Beauty what Wicked is to the Wizard of Oz (or at least it's trying to be, while failing). Disney is really pushing the 'True Love Isn't Always Romantic' envelope here, and although I agree wholeheartedly to this world view, it kinda screws with pre-established stories instead of working alongside them. It's not a 'same story from a different viewpoint' like Wicked was, it's more like '(not so) gritty retelling of classic fairy tale' like Snow White and the Huntsman. Take that as you will.3. MALEFICENT DOESN'T TURN INTO A DRAGON! That was probably the most disappointing part of the movie. You know that menacing, giant dragon that breathes green fire from the original cartoon? You know, the only real reason Sleeping Beauty is so highly regarded? No, she turns HER crow-minion into a dragon. Although admittedly the designs of the crow-creatures is creative, it's just really...eh.4. The Prince is completely useless. In the original, the Prince is kind of a goofy character, who turns into the bad-ass plot device that kills Maleficent and wakes Aurora. In this version, he awkwardly kisses Aurora and then leaves her alone without waking her. Yeah, he's pointless. No real reason to have him.5. Maleficent gives true-love's kiss. Yep. The villain of the original story wakes Aurora in this story. I get it, making her regret cursing Aurora is fine. That's character development, but making her the person that wakes Aurora is silly. It worked well in Frozen, not so well here.6. The Pixies. It's one thing to get Dolores Umbridge to play one of them, but not only are they annoying, but they're also missing for a significant time where they should be going ""OH MY GOSH WHERE IS AURORA?"" They were goofballs in the original story, but they weren't entirely incompetent like they are in this one.The only other aspect of the story that I like besides Angelina Jolie's Maleficent is Stephan, the king. He is interesting. The movie would've been a whole lot more interesting if it was a love-hate story between those two, and the entire Sleeping Beauty part was taken out. Make a 'Fairy vs human' war movie like what it was for the first half hour or so. That was cool.Disney, If by a tiny chance you're reading this review, we get it. You like harking back to your older movies, we get that. Just please, do it justice, do it original, or don't do it at all.(The next live-action Disney Reboot is Cinderella. What is that going to be like I wonder?)",Maleficent
218,kill-the-boxtrolls,This movie is worse than Oz: The Great and Powerful,5,24 September 2014,"While I thought Oz was okay, this movie, unfortunately was a bit worse. I have not seen much of Sleeping Beauty so I do not know what the story's about.I think this movie will be hard for kids to understand and parents must accompany them if they have any questions to ask. It was confusing with pointless occurrences and very boring with some entertaining parts with little plot that seems to go on-and-off, a tale that's similar to Sleeping Beauty. Though, the kiss was not by a true love, it was by Maleficent. So Aurora hates her when she finds out that she's Maleficent but does she actually love her since her true kiss worked?The characters are unmemorable; there is no antagonist until the end, which seems to make little sense with it being more of a slice of life type. And Maleficent's wings are taken away until the end. How could they get taken away? She's a fairy. Maleficent is the worst character that's based on a villain I ever seen, she is not a villain in this one but she has an evil look which makes her saccharine. But some of the actors were cute, others were beautiful.The action and special effects are highly impressive which makes you forget about the pointless things to them. But there are some which play out like a cartoon and others that are just weird.",Maleficent
219,stephenlovelette,"In the Realm of Live Action PG, You Won't Find Much Better",7,27 June 2014,"What is the best feature from the list of Disney Animated Classics?It's an old conundrum.All nostalgia aside, the answer is a five-way tie: Sleeping Beauty (1959), The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992) and Tangled (2009).Because of the similarities between Sleeping Beauty and some of the other greats, like Cinderella (whose got a great publicist) and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (another damsel cursedly dozing), Princess Aurora's misadventure is often forgotten.But hers is a compelling plot; for males and females alike. And it contains one of the most heartwarming notions of the entire Disney canon:Briar Rose (a.k.a. Aurora) and Prince Phillip first meet and fall in love waltzing in a dream.Sleeping Beauty has many additional strengths but one is its antagonist.Maleficent is one of the most compelling villains in the history of animated cinema.Her character is an artistic masterpiece. She is technically, ""The Mistress of All Evil."" More specifically, she's a dark sorceress and an organic incarnation of chaos.She's fundamentally inhuman, you see. Which brings us to a general grievance regarding the live-action reworking of the animated classic.To allow Maleficent a moral dimension is to undermine the fundamental principle driving the original story.But, in the end, this is neither here nor there.I quite enjoy Maleficent.First of all, let's talk a little Angelina Jolie. She's great as the lead; the acting doesn't slip for a minute. Even during the most difficult parts, she's mysterious and menacing. The strains of battle and conducting sorcery oftentimes require wailing in a manner that needs to sound believable. But she delivers every time.Jolie deserves even more rigorous applause because of her role as an executive producer. A live- action retelling of a Disney Animated Classic is exactly the type of movie I'd encourage producers to champion.Good on you, Angelina. Combine this with the achievements of Salt, and we've got an all-star actress in the making.Because of the PG rating, the stakes can only be so high. The filmmakers do an excellent job of hiding that fact.There are several epic battles involving fantastic elements, and they're a sight to behold. Seriously. The fights feel real and devoid of cheese.Unfortunately, the weakest parts of this film fall on the acting performances from the rest of the cast.Elle Fanning's performance as Aurora is not bad; it's just not compelling. Frankly, other than the color of her hair, skin and eyes she doesn't resemble the original character from the animated feature.Sharlto Copley, who I like a lot in Elysium, is a disappointment here as King Stefan.The fairies are humorless and a severe downgrade from the delightful characters in Sleeping Beauty. They're animated in a strikingly human fashion, and it's more off-putting than humanizing.Anyway. Maleficent is a very good movie, that's safe enough for kids.Go out and enjoy while you still can!If you haven't seen it, stop reading here because some spoilers follow.The visuals are excellent; the special effects are sharp and realistic. I love the scene with the dragon.But why do Maleficent's wings suddenly fight to break free of their glass-enclosed prison, seemingly of their own accord?In terms of plot resolutions involving kissing, my count is five: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Sleeping Beauty, Frozen, Snow White and the Huntsman, and Maleficent. Aurora's princely catalyst is just a better version of Snow's.But in Frozen it's Elsa, the loving sister, whose kiss breaks the spell. In Snow White and the Huntsman, it's a different man; the caress of the Huntsman's lips does the trick. And in Maleficent it's the 'Mother's Kiss' which breaks the curse.This is strikingly similar to the 'Daughter's Hug' which Merida uses to save her mother in Brave. As well as Anna's saving grace from Frozen; they just use a different female from the protagonist's immediate family.Finally, Stefan's death is choreographed in a similar manner to that of Gaston from Beauty and the Beast.No?Feel free to let me know what you think.Wink.",Maleficent

222,aldri-feb,Weak version of Sleeping Beauty's tale,5,31 May 2014,"It takes big task to create a movie about evil character which unfortunately ""Maleficent"" doesn't pass it. While the movie was too busy to exploit generosity of Maleficent, the studio seems forgets some details in it. They just leave the origin story of ""Sleeping Beauty"", used the products and manipulated whatever they want so that makes ""Maleficent"" more like another version rather than the untold story of ""Sleeping Beauty"". Maleficent who used to be a scary-dark-fairy at tale, turns into weak personality and sometimes becomes a hero. The writer seems too lazy making character development and prefer pick someone else to be blamed as villain. Robert Stromberg who makes his directorial debut deeply confused with some elements the film have. Though Angelina Jolie's form is undeniably incredible and shines as Maleficent and visual effects are neatly produced, still they couldn't much save this movie from being disappointing. After ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Oz: the Great and Powerful"" and ""Maleficent"" fails to impress, I think Disney should move on from making live-action on popular tale which main purpose only for collecting profit.",Maleficent

Even with horns, wings, and ridiculously blown out, overly dramatic cheek bones, she is very voluptuous. Her Maleficent wasn't brooding enough for my taste, but still amazing.At first I wanted to rip this movie for not having enough depth and being too short, BUT then I thought about it.. Fairy Tales always use simple language, are fairly short, and don't get TOO in depth with characters. When I looked at it that way, this movie nailed it perfectly.I guess I've fallen victim to the Christopher Nolan effect of OVER fleshing out characters so I expect ""reboot"" movies about an old character to be like Nolan's Batman trilogy which goes to great length to tell their ""origins."" If I had to come up with a genre comparison, this movie is FAR superior to ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" in every way except visually.""Maleficent,"" will make a nice addition to my DVD collection when it comes out. The quick running time will make you appreciate Jolie's performance even more because you'll find yourself wanting more.

The rich colors and fantastic creatures made the entire viewing a joy to experience. I was knocked silly by Maleficent's character design, and I was entranced by Elle Fanning's smile. The quiet power of this film builds slowly, as the various events unfold at a regal pace. The filmmakers eschew the usual bombast and frenetic overkill so common in effects-driven blockbusters. The music plays softly in the background, nudging rather than bludgeoning. Children of any age can embrace this wonderful tale of betrayal, vengeance, and redemption.

226,rushknight,Disney no longer believes in true love..,7,28 August 2014,"..or true evil, or good men.To begin, this was a fun movie. I enjoyed it. All the great aspects of a good film are there. Original story, produced well, written reasonably well, acted well (although not much acting was really called for in this).The only downer is getting the not-so-subtle impression that Disney is tired of being ""classic"" and they are now belatedly attempting to rush into ""progressive."" You have the usual modern ideas rammed into this: The evil of MEN (old men, young men are forgiven.. until they get old), the empowerment of women over MEN, the pristine perfection of lands untouched by MEN, the beauty of relationships between parents and children (especially children without fathers, who are MEN), true love (between women).. you get the idea.Now I'm a man and I don't get my hackles raised up often over what I consider petty insults to my gender. But once in a while I find this general mentality quite demeaning, and it escapes me how anyone could see something like this as anything less than a smack-in-the-face to the male gender. It makes me want to rant a little.""Sleeping Beauty"" is one of the greatest love stories ever told, and it has been rewritten to stand on it's own without the presence of good men. No valiant soldiers, no mighty knights, no paragons of justice and honor to proudly ride forth against evil, and no worthy iconic figure to kiss the girl and spark true love! The only man in the entire movie with a decent heart was rushed through his scenes as a shy love-struck child, and quickly removed from any real play in the story.I grew up on Disney. I wanted to be the hero when I was little. Even as I grew older I would still occasionally daydream back to some old Disney film and wonder what I would do as the hero. Wanting to be the hero is every young boy's natural inclination.But Disney is making it very apparent that it doesn't believe in these things anymore. Good against evil? Well that's all relative. Love between a man and women? Thing of the past. Heroism and justice? It's been done.Well, go ahead Disney. Get rid of the old out-dated ideas of manliness and virtue, honor and strength.

227,rodrigoalderete,"""Well,well,well""...",8,26 August 2014,"First of all, the story surprised me a bit: Maleficent's chick bones. The fact she's not a witch, she's a fairy. The villain & hero twist. The prince's kiss didn't work, but a mother's true love kiss bring Aurora's back from her death sleep. After Aurora's waking up and Maleficent got her wings back, the war still going. Why? The king went mad¡¡¡¡ The prince role was very insignificant in this new version, but I like it anyway. Also the king's character was small,a girl grown up away from her parents 16 years and she didn't troubled at all when her father died. Aurora smiles all the time, she's a happy girl and never fall into sadness because a fairy cast spell on her. But SHE SMILES A LOT, I WANTED HER TO SLEEP FOREVER¡¡¡¡ For many people this film was disappointing, NOT FOR ME. I enjoyed very much. The visual effects was stunning, the music,and the credit'song ""Once Upon A Dream"" by Lana Del Rey sounded creepy. So much talk about this movie. I challenged myself to watch it. I really liked.

Angelina's performance is incredible; she has to express a complete set of emotions all condensed in the same movie.

The main actors do a superb job. I did not realize who the actress Maleficent was until the end and without giving her name away, she deserves an Oscar. ""Aurora"" is the sleeping beauty and she certainly convinced me. The storyline is a retelling of the story of Sleeping Beauty. The movie begins with, 'Let me tell you how it REALLY happened...'The colorful sceneries are very realistic and may make one think it actually exists somewhere on earth.In my opinion, it is the next best thing to the Wizard of Oz in the fantasy category.",Maleficent

The effects are great, but the weakness of the film is the poor writing creating character/logical issues.There's too much voice-over that should have been shown in action and dialog. Jolie's acting gets a little weak in spots. Maleficent and King Stefan's characters become muddled, with their overall goals becoming questionable with what we see of their characters. Stefan, in particular, needed more development time to show how he goes from lovable scoundrel to psychopath. He's the biggest problem I saw in the characters. I could go on for a while, but let's keep this short.Kids will probably get through the film carried by the goofy, slapstick scenes sprinkled throughout. Adults will probably notice the messy parts, but there are some nice scenes between Aurora and Maleficent in the last third of the show.

He had no presence, and his South African accent (that sounds vaguely Scot) was distracting - sometimes on, sometimes off. Mr. Copley, who has a fascinating resume, had zero screen presence, or presence at all. His voice is not sonorous - and in fact comes as a bit of shock the first time he speaks. Surrounded by sound, action, and great acting, he comes off as someone who was hired because he was Edna's friend Wilma's friend's husband's boyfriend.Deduction two: The young prince was an underwritten part, plus he looks too much like Robbie Douglas from My Three Sons to be credible.Deduction three: The king has no contact with Aurora during all those years, never checks on her, while leaving her in the care of magnificently incompetent tiny flying fairies?So, a 7.

235,coastdaze,Changing the story for the sake the one of the exec. producers?,7,8 June 2014,"I was definitely looking forward to this story and this actress playing the lead. Jolie does not disappoint, imo. She is beautifully sinister looking although they portrayed her character as a bit weak-minded, gullible and victim-like. I fully expected to see a supremely evil, beautiful and awful Maleficent! Not there. I gather this is because Jolie was an exec producer on the film and she has kids and she probably wanted them to see the flick at some point. So evil had to be turned into a victim. And the good king turned into a selfish, cheating, self-absorbed buffoon.OK, enough of that, now on the to the entertainment value...I loved that part of the movie. The look, the CGI, the costumes, the makeup on Jolie was beautiful. Of course, she's got a good face to work with. I loved that they used that old Sleeping Beauty song that I have loved since I was a kid and saw the animated version.The fight scenes, especially the last one, was awesome and moving. OK, so maybe it wasn't quite spot on in the storyline, but it was entertaining. And when those wings came back to rest on Maleficent's back, I was very moved. So yes, I enjoyed the movie and have come to realize that I must see movies for what they are...vivid imaginings out of someone's mind that are brought to the big screen for sheer entertainment.So unless it's a documentary, I expect a lot of creative license to be taken and therefore I am rarely disappointed these days.",Maleficent

Morality play value 1/10
Yet another insidious effort by the Hollywood Left, now merely one among several movies, series, etc, to convince our most impressionable citizens that good is not really good at all, evil is actually quite good, and getting along is well, shucks, the only thing that matters. From the overriding theme of white oppression to the ultimate revelation that these satanic creatures are merely trying to defend themselves, few stones are left unturned. We even get a few touches of tree hugging, literally, especially when the giant tree is beating up ""evil white lady"" at the end.
Cleverly packaged as yet ANOTHER re-imagining of an old story (big sigh), the appeal to adults is obviously infectious. What possible harm could come from letting our babies get exposed to alternative interpretations of traditional stories?

In fact, he's just obsessed with getting ahead and willing to sacrifice the fairy woman who loves him, Maleficent, by cutting off her wings in order to land the ""top job"" (not quite corporate back-stabbing, but close enough anatomically speaking). We later learn that the one condition that must be met to break Maleficent's curse on his newborn daughter, Aurora, (a kiss from her true love) can never be met because, as Maleficent learned from her betrayal by Aurora's princely father, there is no such thing as true love. The handsome, young prince that Aurora met when he was lost in the forest is unable break her spell with a kiss because he doesn't love her; he's merely infatuated with her. Instead, it's a kiss from Maleficent, who eventually became Aurora's godmother and mentor after she was unable to withdraw her curse, that brings her back to life.

242,Mr_Mirage,Maleficent is Magnificent,10,31 May 2014,"Dark, menacing and possessed of a twisted sense of humor, this film is a visual treat. In fact, the imagery is so intense that the story can be missed. Light streams from a distance, fingers of wispy mist.The story is being casually dismissed by some, but I would point out that it is a fairy tale, a kids movie for adults. Jung would have a field day with the layers on layers of meaning... or just turn off the brain and let the eye candy blow out the walls.It is worth the extra $ for 3-D. The effects are consistently interesting, and only rarely is there the cheap COMING RIGHT AT YOU effect that was old and worn when it was used in the 50's.Jolie, not my favorite actress, caught me so totally off guard that I (yep) forgot it was her. Kudos, and it would actually be a good thing to hear ""And the Oscar goes to..."" This is the second film from Disney that raises the notion of what is meant by ""true love,"" and I for one endorse this. As in Frozen, an enchantment has to be broken by true love, but it is not a romantic love, but a love for another that, in Frozen, calls for a sacrifice and in Maleficent a love that is rooted in a mother/child relationship. One could say that Maleficent is the Evil Stepmother that comes to regret her actions that were formed at an early age and is thus redeemed. Oh, and again, Bad Man Falls To Death.

243,Alise_shenle,Better Than Expected,6,31 May 2014,"I watched this movie twice, and I think it is still pretty entertaining the second time round, so this shows that it is a good movie. We can't blame the plot for its ""loopholes"" or things that don't make sense, because it is based on the stupid fairytale, after all. So Maleficent already tried to build a story based on the really simple original. Firstly, I really like all the actors. Despite Elle Fanning's not really being a stunning beauty (perhaps she has not grown up enough yet), she has this smile that shows she's naive and innocent. Brendon Thwaites (I just saw him in Oculus) was really just acting like a lovestruck boy so he doesn't do much. Diaval was cute, and Angelina Jolie acted really well, both as the innocent fairy, evil witch and loving mother. It was also really satisfying seeing Dolores Umbridge being the old fairy who was bullied by the two younger ones. However, some things are problematic. The ending was also not a plagiarism of Frozen, because Anna and Elsa are sisters so of course they truly love each other, but you don't have to love your enemy's child. 1. Why on earth are the 3 fairies traitors? They suddenly decided to help the King, despite knowing that the King did wrong first, and somemore they still obey his every move and are scared of him? Where are their loyalties? 2. The tyrant King Stefan. Since he is of lowly birth and not even a good King, why doesn't anyone rebel? Hell, even mediocre Kings got overthrown, just look at China's emperors who were birthed by concubines and not the Queen, they had to listen to the ministers. He didn't even love his wife, so why didn't she rebel? 3. The iron part was not really utilised. Why doesn't Maleficent become more wary since she knew Stefan knew iron hurts her? Why didn't Stefan told the old King? 4. Why did the soldiers catapult fire into the trees all at once? A better way would be to experiment using just one. The humans appear to be stupid, they have no advanced weaponry yet still dare to fight against FAIRIES! 5. Why did Stefan become obsessed with killing Malefcent? He didn't even like his own daughter that much, or his wife. So he shouldn't care about his daughter's survival. I think Stefan had a low self-esteem, he is secretly jealous of Maleficent's power. He is also ambitious. However, he should be smarter than that, like remain on Maleficent's good side to ask her to use her magic to help him get the throne or something. Not fight against her, because she will lose. Overall, just watch for Angelina Jolie. She is a good actor and not to mention good-looking. Everyone else is not important.",Maleficent
244,randreww,Half Decent,8,4 November 2014,"Disney have realised that the young audience likes almost anything you lunge at them, & it earns them back the budget in no time by making a half arsed contorted fairy tale with dull forgettable characters, run of the mill effects, & hollow writing. Angelina Jolie however was simply a blast! She understood the role & her facial expressions match the anguish inside her character. This shocked me, as I've seldom appreciated her in the roles she picks. Tombraider.. uh. The 3 fairies are both annoying & pointless. They water down the story. We really don't see any character development at the start, & yet this should set the tone of the film - a story of love & loss. Then we have our first battle sequence to which we have NO hint as to WHY. Why does the King want the fairies dead? Once again, poorly written characters.The CGI is sterile as ever, as are the camera movements & we get a few glimpses of the other creatures! If you have ever seen a film called Legend by Ridley Scott, this film is an insult to the genre by comparison! So much work went in to that film, & it's all so detailed & perfected, where as here everything is rushed so we can get to the 10 minute Dragon sequence they all obviously cherry picked to work on the most. The costume design is impressive though, & what there is of corporeal sets fits in very nicely. But most of the rest is just added on in Green Screen & CGI which reminds you of a constant disconnection from reality. Some of the soundtrack is pleasant, but as per usual.. there's a total lack of melody or theme. I didn't hate the film. If this was based solely on Angelina Jolie's performance, I would give it a 9! Perhaps movie studios should give her some more perspicacious roles to stretch her wings a bit more!! In the end, this is just another kids flick that has come, & shall go just a quickly.

245,FallsDownz,Well Well.... best line ever from Angelina Jolie,6,13 June 2014,"Maleficent is a new Sleeping Beauty movie from Disney which instead the main characters is Maleficent , and it's promise to be something new to be something you never heard before, unfortunately it's true form are nowhere near it's promises .The movie has a lots of problem like the script which is really dull contain with dull one-dimension characters (except Maleficent herself) and the new storyline they promise is nothing new or something that will surprise you at all , in fact they didn't changed much at all from the original sleeping beauty animation .The Director Robert Stromberg are pretty good on visual effects the CG is really cool and beautiful to look at but his directing skills is nowhere near the same level as his visual skills , his directing is pretty dull with no experience and how to telling the story what so ever makes a lot of times in the movie feels boring.but there's a brightside in this movie too and that is Angelina Jolie herself she's perfect in this movie as Malificent her performance is really amazing and i cannot think who better to play as Malificent than her.But that's not enough though with only Jolie and Visual Effects against the boring script , dull characters and dull directing , Maleficent in the end is a movie that has a strong promises but cannot deliver.",Maleficent
246,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Maleficent Review,9,30 May 2014,"Once upon a time, Maleficent was not evil. She was not brash, nor mean-spirited, nor disliked. She was happy and she was beautiful.For obvious reasons, I went into this movie thinking that this story would try to make Maleficent the protagonist, wanting the audience to sympathize with her and somehow providing justification and a blanket acceptance for why she cursed Aurora. And while Disney did a good job of explaining why Maleficent did what she did, the story evolves in such a way that the audience is not expected to be accepting of Maleficent's curse. This movie does not want to convince the audience that there is a better, more understandable side to the story; it is actually quite the opposite. The other side of the story kind of leaves you feeling almost ambivalent but slightly more sympathetic, and I think that was the intention: to just appreciate that there is another important actor in this story whose motives may have been unclear.This story also shows what happens in the sixteen years that lapse between Aurora's birth and when she pricks her finger. Further, it follows almost a more logical, human way of thinking Like, what former credentials do three fairies have that enable them to raise a human child? And why is the crow so dedicated to a witch? As always, true love is tested to its limits, but this is a Disney movie, so there has to be a happy ending If I am being completely honest, Angelina Jolie is far from my favorite actress; however, this is an iconic role that I feel like was made for her. She is absolutely stunning and delivers an awesome performance. Elle Fanning also did a great job playing the open-minded, sheltered Aurora; I tend to forget that Aurora is a sixteen year-old shut-in who is ignorant to the majority of the outside world, but it was refreshing to see Elle's acting as Aurora reacts to many experiences for the first time.I have to mention the artistry that went into this movie as well. The detail—from the castle, to the creatures, to the fairy wings—was spectacular. I saw it in IMAX 3D, so it was that much more visually stunning. I definitely recommend seeing it in 3D at the very least if you can.",Maleficent
247,Sweetigal85,Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,10,27 May 2018,"I really think that this is Angelina Jolie's BEST role. I feel that this movie obliterated the original book and Disney animated version of the story. I am a huge fan of backstory and it was simply amazing to discover how Maleficent became the ""villain"" of Sleeping Beauty.""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."" It is impossible to not relate to Maleficent after what Stefan does to her. Who wouldn't want revenge? This movie is amazing because in the original we have no idea why she crashes the christening and curses the child, she just seems pure evil for no reason. Where is the fun or poetry in that?Her chemistry with Aurora was beautiful, I have never seen such an enchanting relationship between two non-related people. She clearly comes to view Aurora as the daughter she never had and who she would have had with Stefan had he not betrayed her. It was so poetic how when she tried to undo the curse while Aurora was sleeping that it wouldn't work because her hatred of Stefan and his family was deeper at the time of the curse than her present love for Aurora is. I was hoping it would be her true love's kiss that broke the spell, that was a stunning twist.It is also beautiful that Stefan is the one who robbed Maleficent of her wings and Aurora, his daughter who she cursed out of spite, is the one who returns her wings and thus her life to her. I loved the crow that she turned into a man and ultimately befriended, that was a magnificent addition. It was so cute how much he cared for Aurora and how loyal he was to his mistress. I like to believe that they ended up together in the end when they are seen soaring through the sky together.Stefan's death is very poetic because he is falling from grace and he tried so hard and sacrificed his former life and love to get atop his glowing pedestal as King. The only thing that struck me as kind of odd was that there were no other fairies who seemed to resemble Maleficent. The rest of them were all lesser creatures and not humanoids. Maybe the rest of them had fled and chose to stay in the shadows of the fairy world when Maleficent took over. And I guess Angelina would have been a scene stealer anyway so they didn't feel like more fairies like her would be necessary.Hands down one of my favorite movies EVER and definitely the best depiction of a Disney ""villain""",Maleficent
248,pinkled5,Very Flawed With Moments of Brilliance,7,31 May 2014,"Taken as a whole, the movie was rather underwhelming. However, mixed in with the many disappointments are moments of brilliance.THE GOOD: Angelina Jolie is absolutely BRILLIANT as Maleficent. Not only does she fit the part well she gives an amazing performance. Every moment she is on the screen she is wonderful. Also, the character which she plays, Maleficent, is both interesting and intriguing. Really great character arch there.My kids absolutely loved the movie. My 9 year old daughter even applauded at the end (and a few people joined her) and my 8 year old son said he loved it.THE BAD: The absolute worst was the voice over narration throughout the movie. There's a reason why there's a rule in the movie business that you shouldn't use it, because it smacks of lazy script writing. When you tell the audience instead of showing them it cripples the entertainment value of the film. Also, all the other characters were rather uninteresting, especially Aurora. Although my 8 year old son loved the movie he proclaimed that ""Aurora was boring!"" I agreed. The CGI was not up to snuff and was even distracting at times. Additionally, there were several scenes that I found cringe worthy, which was the result of some poor direction and weak screen writing.",Maleficent
249,maatmouse-1,Not your conventional fairy tale,7,11 December 2014,"Having seen the original Sleeping Beauty, I really wondered what this film was going to be like. Previous reviews had been glowing, but I wanted to judge for myself. Maleficent starts out with the young winged girl of the title establishing herself as a 'Guardian of the Marshland' in a land dominated by a somewhat unpleasant King, played by Kenneth Cranham. Maleficent meets up with a young man wandering around in the forest and they become very friendly but other matters are calling the said young man and he soon leaves the Marshland and Maleficent behind. That is the crux of this story: how people grow and change, not always for the better.King Henry decides to wage war on the Marshland but is defeated and his pride sorely bruised by Maleficent, who leads her land and its strange mixture of creatures against his army. In anger and brutal retaliation, Henry declares on his death bed that anyone who can kill or maim Maleficent will win his kingdom. Cue: the young man and Maleficent's former friend, now an ambitious fella. He capitalises on his friendship with Maleficent and strikes her a terrible blow, failing to realise what an enemy he has made in the process.From this point on, we are on familiar territory. Wronged fairy woman is waiting for her chance to get back at her former 'friend'. It comes in the form of the King Stefan's new daughter, the beautiful Aurora. Maleficent, who has not been invited to this particular presentation, arrives anyway and puts a 'curse' on the child which is that on her 16th birthday she shall prick her finger and fall into a deathlike sleep until true love's kiss wakes her up. Angered by what Maleficent has done, Stefan takes preventative measures. Aurora is moved to the forest to be taken care of by 3 fairies who grow to normal human size. All the spinning wheels in the land are put in a room and locked away and Maleficent is to be found and killed. Maleficent, her power much stronger than ever, responds by building a wall of thorns around her home. The rest differs from Disney's interpretation of this tale, quite a lot. Maleficent stays around Aurora and starts to help with her growing up and education, unwittingly. In time, Aurora grows up and Maleficent starts to realise that the baby she once cursed is not a bad person and shouldn't be blamed or held accountable for her father's terrible deeds.The ending to this film is not what you'd expect. Yes, Prince Charming comes along but he doesn't figure very highly in this film at all. It is Maleficent who realises that she is really Aurora's friend and true guardian.Once again, Angelina Jolie dominates this film from the start. She is beautifully cast and the script lends her character a wonderful, dry sense of humour. She revels in the good fairy wronged and 'gone bad' role. Sam Riley is also very good. The only sour note in this film isn't the women at all, but the way the film makers have made the men quite unpleasant. Sharlto Copley plays Stefan with a terrible purpose of violence and Kenneth Cranham makes a fairly horrid King. The only 2 better male parts in this are Prince Philip who doesn't do much and Maleficent's shapeshifting helper.",Maleficent

The film starts rather slow but grows to be more than a simple fantasy story about a well-meaning fairy gone rogue to a good one again. Aside from a few shoddy moments from Sharlto Copley as King Stefan, the acting is superb, led by Angelina Jolie as the titular character, who outshines everything in the movie including the overused and often obvious CGI. Aurora, played by Elle Fanning and the innocent child of the King, provides the emotional base through which she and Maleficent grow as characters. Fanning is a great companion aside Jolie, portraying the innocence and complexity faced by Aurora as she becomes aware of her world and the curse residing within her. The weakness of Maleficent is its sloppy direction and tone. Nevertheless, Maleficent is carried by the empowering themes it explored and the standout acting from the actors.7/10",Maleficent

So Malefiston, decide to take revenge, first makes a sex toy from a crow, and the curse Ugly Pitt newborn daughter Aurora. She is adopted to defy the course, by 3 fairies who looks more like the dumb 3 Stygian witches from Clash of the Titans, than Perrault Saviour fairy. The fairies aren't respected on films. In Disney's Cinderella (1950) and Sleeping Beauty (1959), as Peu d'Ane (1970) and The Slipper and the Rose (1976) are goofy, but in this adaptation the stupidity is in a new level. In fact is Maleficent who is the one that raised the girl. Finally Maleficent regrets her curse, but still kills the King. And Aurora receive an important lesson, her husband should be a hot but dumb sex toy, without any ambitions.- Angelina Jolie as Maleficent, isn't credible when she tries to portray the good fairy, but excellent, magnetic and scene stealer when she is doing villainies.- Jolie also benefited of the study of all Pitt Exes, she has the cold evil bitchiness of Paltrow, the weirdness of Lewis, the slutty of Robin Givens and the big horns of Jen Aniston. Also add that autobiographical elements like in the first draw of the story, Stephen was her half brother, Maleficent practices Zoofilia and lesbianism and her guilty pleasure are chains. Also she looks hot in leather. To sum up the camera just loves her and rocks in the role. With Jolie, also steal scenes as her zoophytic sex toy, Sam Riley. The rest unfortunately not good. Coplay is just too Grey and unattractive Elle Fanning dumb and lesser attractive than Martha Bush in Neglige.- All the time I questioned about why she was cast as Aurora and not a more beauty and hot actress like Margot Robbie or Emily Browning, or even Juno Temple is a better option for Aurora.- And then I realized that Angelina Jolie is the producer. She even order to change her younger version (India Eisley x Ella Prunell) for being too attractive.- Because in this film the only dreaming beauty here is Jolie, the rest snore",Maleficent
254,CinemaCocoa,Disney DESTROYS one of the iconic greats in villainy!,3,11 July 2014,"Is there any better example of missing the point than this? Maleficent: ""I am the Queen of All Evil"" - Sleeping Beauty 1959. Now, Maleficent is a Paragon of True Love.When the realm of fairies and the world of humans fall into war, Maleficent, one of the most powerful of fairies, strives to protect her lands. Her childhood love for Prince Stephen is betrayed when he rises to power, and in a fit of rage she curses his newborn child Aurora to die before her sixteenth birthday. However as Aurora grows up in seclusion Maleficent questions her own actions... while King Stephen becomes wrathful.This film is blasphemous to the titular character. My childhood felt butchered by the film's end.First, you must appreciate how hard it is for me to say that... I went into this film with only quiet scepticism and I had done away with my doubts. But Sleeping Beauty is my favourite Disney film. Why? Not for the archetypal characters or accident prone fairies, no, for Maleficent herself. Sure, she has no motive and is simply an antagonist. But she is one of the greats in film villainy: terrible, wrathful and cruel, giving some of animation's most haunting moments in the process.2014's Maleficent begins with a rosy-cheeked, innocent little fairy girl Maleficent.Okay, okay, I can restrain myself... This is partly expected from today's Disney and I stomached Boba Fett being a kid didn't I? (not really) Everything will go wrong and the true Maleficent will bloom before my eyes! Nope.This film's brazenly confident narration tells me: ""So you think you know the tale?"" Well yes, in fact I do; it is my favourite tale. Well, turns out I don't know it at all when they make stuff up! Maleficent does not follow 1959 Sleeping Beauty's foundation at all. I don't know the fairytale you say, Disney? Let's see... How about I research the Sleeping Beauty tale just now... maybe Maleficent is telling the true tale, maybe I've gravely misjudged the source material. Nope. Turns out nothing in this film is from the source material! The 1959 animation has far, far more references to the original tale (and I am taking into account the multiple renditions of the fairytale) Come on, Disney! Don't you dare rewrite your history and proclaim it is wrong. Don't you dare assume to teach the true fairytale if you have no desire to even come close to it! Most of all, don't you dare make a film about a villain if you have no intention of going through with it!This film is about Maleficent (a fabrication of Disney, incidentally) but while we get a character who looks and sounds like her, she is acting out being a misunderstood, repressed fairy, fighting an evil King. How, I am desperate to know, can Disney take their most EVIL character and make her a noble, tragic soul that I should feel sympathy for?? Why has Disney taken their own creation, after decades of cementing her place as a grand villain, and turned her into a heroine?God, this film... It could have been good, no it could have been glorious, if it had simply kept the character unchanged. It boggles my mind why they did it. Angelina Jolie is exceptional, I love her as an actress and she is the perfect fit for Maleficent. The special effects are good and there's heaps of atmosphere, her ent-like tree soldiers are awesome as well. The three fairies weren't bad either (apart from being given the wrong names!) they were always ditsy, and King Stephen's fear and paranoia was great, it was an actual improvement on the 1959 animation; a father would be consumed with guilt and fear in those circumstances.But damn did they screw.up.everything.else. By the halfway mark I was bored, and by the end I had ceased caring. What a tragic waste of Jolie's perfect talents. I would not be surprised if Walt Disney himself is turning in his grave.This is simply a creative decision, probably by committee, that I absolutely cannot understand.",Maleficent
255,videodrome1234,Almost....,5,30 May 2014,"Angelina Jolie has kind of retired from acting. Unfortunately. She's one of this era's best actresses but she barley takes on any roles and she hasn't acted since the mediocre The Tourist. She directed and it wasn't half bad. If you have been lucky enough to have seen In The Land of Blood and Honey then you know what I mean and her second direction is just waiting to be released. I guess she has to raise the 6 kids out of something so she can't always do art films, and because she is a mom getting into the Disney world is kind of a given, when you get to play one of the most grand characters. The plans for the film had been made a while ago, I don't know whose idea it was but it's not bad. Take a classic Disney film, in our case Sleeping Beauty, and breaking tradition put the bad guy center stage, I would assume that the studio heads ate up the idea, I get why. Of course the film only works if you get the right actress to play her. Jolie's casting was a given. Then they just needed a professional director and scriptwriter a bunch of money and we can kind of guess that it'll work. And does it? Well sort of. Okay so the film isn't bad, this summer's films are filled with better and better productions. Blockbuster after blockbuster and none of them are big disappointments. The same goes for Malefincent. I wasn't disappointed, but is that enough? That's kind of the question. First off Robert Stromberg has two Oscar's for Art direction but he's never directed before but he does his job well, he spent the 200 mill. wisely. The film is visually pleasing. It's not too long and it keeps up the pace the whole time, it's entertaining. The script also landed in the hands of a professional. Linda Wolverton wrote the script with the same stability she showed during Lion King and Beauty and the Beast. You really can't criticize the actors either. Jolie is a one woman show and she carries the production. The only drawback with this is that Elle Fanning isn't even on the same playing field as Jolie. Besides her maybe Imelda Staunton stands out. So yeah everything is done professionally, unfortunately only one thing made it go off course, and that's that it was made by Disney. That's it's biggest problem, and Disney is true to form, the film isn't brave enough. When all is said and done Maleficent is the bad guy, but not here, here she's just misunderstood. Disney can't allow a really bad character to be the main in its film. The only thing wrong with this that with a little courage this could have been the best Disney fairytale ever, the way it is, it's just good. There are other things wrong with it too, the prince's character is not just bad, there really isn't a point to him at all and the King's and Maleficent's hatred is not developed and the way and when Malefincent uses magic has no logic, but those were just small mistakes, that I don't think will really trip up viewers Oh and Lana Del Ray's version of I know you haunting. All in all I think everyone who like Disney films and wants to watch a family pic will like it, if you're not a big fan they you may fell like something is missing. My disappointment steams from the fact that it could have been better. But that's the difference between a 7 and a 10 point film. 7/10 https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1",Maleficent

257,CalvinValjean,Eventually the Spell Wears Off...,4,15 May 2017,"This is one of the few examples of a film that I've really gone back on and changed my mind about. I don't usually pull a complete 180 on my opinion of a film, but this one did it.I love Disney's original SLEEPING BEAUTY from 1959; one of the studio's most gorgeous- looking films with a hypnotic, poetic quality, and a strong villain. When I saw MALEFICENT for the first time, I fell for its spell. I liked that here was a live-action fairy tale movie that WASN'T about big CGI-battles (there's only one small battle at the very beginning). Here was a movie that showed the dark side of fairy tales (even having a subtextual date-rape scene) with a slower pace, more visual-oriented storytelling, and had a Feminist message. Plus I liked Angelina Jolie and her dynamic with her servant Diaval (Sam Riley). I even bought the Blu-Ray.But with each repeat viewing I began to find more flaws in the film. One is the complete destruction of the characters of the three fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merriweather (they change the names to Flittle, Knotgrass, and Thistletwit for some reason, but whatever. It's basically those characters). They are turned into complete idiots. The Nostalgia Critic actually worded it best: it feels as if the screenwriter of this film had a personal vendetta against the creator of those characters. I can understand that in order to make Maleficent seem like the heroine of the story, the movie has to downplay these fairies, but it's pushed much too far. They come off grotesquely stupid and incapable of raising a child. We see almost no interaction between them and Aurora.Speaking of Aurora, Elle Fanning is horribly bland. This is supposed to be the most beautiful princess to ever live, and she offers little in terms of character or personality. Believe it or not, the animated version of the character actually had more screen presence with her ethereal singing voice. Another problem with the story is the pace: there is a 16-year gap in the story where nothing happens. The entire middle act of the film is just Maleficent watching Aurora grow, the two bond, and 16 years pass within the story with little conflict. The film tries hard to compensate for this lack of progression by inserting lots of filler of King Stefan going mad. Even at a mere 88-minute runtime, the film seems dragged out. It's really hard to make a story compelling when the plot literally has to stop and not move forward for 16 years until it can progress.Prince Philip is truly given nothing to do. The movie is trying to go for the same message as FROZEN; the ""true love"" of the story is between two women (in this case a mother and daughter-figure) instead of romance. But while I can appreciate this modern take on the fairy tale narrative, it's just so sloppily done to the point that Philip is a non-character who gets kicked out of the movie. When he shows up again at the very end, it feels like a tacked-on ""Oh yeah, we forgot about him"" moment. FROZEN was much smarter in its subversive take on the genre.The 1959 animated film is not intended to be realistic. It embraces the fact that it's a fairy tale and has all the Hollywood and Disney archetypes of the 1950's. Sure, it wasn't big on character development, but it had some nice magical moments. You could enjoy the whimsy of Aurora and Philip meeting and falling in love, the humor of the three fairies, and the menace of Maleficent. It was a pure fairy tale.But this film, made for a 2014 audience, is slightly harder to pigeon-hole. It's not quite sure if it wants to be a pure fairy tale that throws logic completely to the wind or if it wants to be a more adult, gritty, realistic, and sophisticated take on the story. Once you look beyond the performances of Jolie and Riley, the only two actors in the movie who are actually engaging, you're left with a pretty meh story.By the third time I saw the film, my problems with it were so large that I realized I would probably not be likely to watch it again, and ended up selling the Blu-Ray to someone. And that perfectly sums up MALEFICENT: it casts a spell on you once, but it soon wears off once you start thinking too much.",Maleficent

I'm glad I'm not always right.The film is magical, with the fantasy world it's set in and the creatures that inhabit it seeming like a place that could actually exist (and if it did exist, I'd want to go there). The CGI was top-notch and the overall designs in every area of the film spectacular.The highlight for me was James Newton Howards score: truly epic and complementary, hitting every beat with certainty (I will be listening to it over and over again).Angelina Jolie even surprised me, for I've sworn off of her films for a while now.

262,agblum,"A Nice, Charming Movie",9,14 December 2014,"""Maleficent"" is a live-action re-imaging of ""Sleeping Beauty"", that like the Broadway Musical, ""Wicked"" based on ""The Wizard of Oz,"" tells the story from the perspective of the villain or antagonist – in this case Maleficent, played by Angelina Jolie. Without going into detail, the first 1/3rd of the movie chronicles the character of Maleficent's background, and how she came into contact with Stefan, played by Shartlo Copley, who goes onto to father of Sleeping Beauty herself, Aurora, played by Ellen Fanning. That portion of the movie shows what drives Maleficent to act in the manner in which she does, and in telling it from the perspective of her background, empathy is created for her. Overall, I enjoyed the movie very much, and found it very charming. Angelia Jolie plays the character very well, and the rest of the cast pretty much follows suit. The Visuals Effects while not always perfect, for the most part of well done. It is not outstanding, but for fans of the story, and if you have any affinity for fantasy in general – It's a nice movie. 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars.",Maleficent

What a teachable moment for our children and teens! It teaches us what it means to really be a hero. It reminds us all that the spiritual world around us, as well as the natural world, are quite diverse and amazingly beautiful, indeed!Maleficent is a scathing indictment of materialism and the abuse of power.

It ended up being to 2/3 a typical fairy tale story and to 1/3 an attempt of a character study around a well known villain. However, they make the same mistake as so many other studios/directors and underestimate the kids ability to understand a story with depth. Overall it simplifies the new angle of Maleficent too much, which takes away quite a bit of the intriguing idea to make the villain the protagonist with a redemption arc. Besides the flaws with the concept, the visuals are great and the acting around Jolie is decent. It's not a must-see movie but still quite entertaining for the whole family if your kids are a bit older.",Maleficent
266,yannigk,Maleficent gives me mixed feelings,7,18 June 2014,"The Maleficent I know is like Disney's version of Joker. She's evil, for no apparent reason. She just is.This Maleficent, on the other hand, gives you an idea why she's evil.Spoiler: I don't like it.I don't like the fact that she's actually a good fairy, actually misunderstood, actually regretted her evil doings.I understand that this is a re-imagining and it's a good one at that. It gives a different perspective, like how there's always two sides to a story.But is it necessary? No.I didn't necessarily have to know why Joker is Joker, why he had to be Batman's nemesis, why he had to be crazy. He just is. He's the villain, he's the bad guy. Sure sometimes it's nice to know a villain's motivation, and in the Dark Knight, as twisted as it sounds, Joker had a motivation, he wanted to show the world that people are evil too and can destroy one another if survival is at stake.Now, Maleficent? She's a women who got cheated, had a moment of anger, and made terrible choices. She's not really a villain, just a victim who got lost.Sure, if this story was an original story, I'd have accepted it for what it is, but for me personally, the Sleeping Beauty story is so much ingrained in my mind that somehow I'm unable to accept this second view.So, it's not really the filmmaker's fault, just my own, as a biased audience.In conclusion, for you who's planning to watch it: forget Sleeping Beauty. Remember, this movie is called Maleficent, not Sleeping Beauty's Villain. Understand that you will be standing on her side, that you'll be told a story from her point of view.Personally I like the evil one better.. one who said ""You didn't invite me to a party? I'll curse the baby. That'll show you.""On another note, I wished the filmmakers would've develop more about Aurora and Phillip.

She walks the fine line perfectly between playing a character who's viewed as the villain yet she plays her with a depth that rounds out to a vastly more sympathetic portrayal.Elle Fanning was perfectly cast as sweet Aurora who's naivety is played with grace and honesty rather than as a bubble head who can't think for herself. I also loved Sam Riley as Maleficent's right hand ""man"" (or whatever he morphed into) because he too wasn't a two-dimensional bad-guy dimwit.Sharlto Copley as King Stefan was brilliant casting as well because he pretty much became the part of the humble man who changed drastically as the film progressed. He's one of those under-the-radar actors who has real talent to play any role, though he does shine in the darker ones for certain.There are some pretty cool twists in this version of Sleeping Beauty that I liked even more than the original telling and the special effects are fantastic.

271,mpurvismattp,WRONG!!! Disney just crapped out another live action turd.,3,27 July 2015,"I had to write a review of this movie to tell all of u out in IMDb land how terrifically horrendous this so called ""re-boot"" of the classic Disney fairy tale ""Sleeping Beauty"" is. The original beloved film, created in the golden age of the studios animation department is basically told to shut the Hell up and not get in the way of this new ""touchy feely"" version of every kid gets a trophy style movie making. This of course is supposed to appeal to as many people as possible while not scaring one child (cus ya know how fragile our youth are today, God forbid) while at the same time not showing any creativity, accuracy or entertainment, not even slightly. Now I'm not trying to say that this new film couldn't or shouldn't have the right to change a few things. After all it's a live action film and many decades have passed since the original was released. We would expect a few new or different things story wise and perhaps character wise but what we got was a totally different and in my opinion bland, heartless shell of the original film that at no point in the two hours I sat watching thought it added anything to the ""Sleeping Beauty"" story nor did it honor the Maleficent that we all loved to hate in the classic film. Jolie looks the part at least but the way the writers absolutely robbed the title character of her dastardly ways, and turned her from the evil sorcerous we came to love into some misunderstood fairy that lost her wings, this was just reaching too far for me. Losing her wings made her mad but never at any point slightly turned her to the dark side, wtf? The three fairies in the original film are not as magically gifted as Maleficent but are able minded and capable of some pretty nifty tricks when they need them and most importantly they are caring surrogate parents who deeply love Rose (Princess Aurora) like their own daughter. The new film makes them out to be idiots who have little reason for even being there. The creators also replace the fairies tender and loving relationship with a guilt ridden Maleficent who steps in as the one who cares for Rose, once again, wtf? Lastly King Stefan is not the caring and kind father of Princess Aurora who reluctantly gave his daughter up to hopefully spare her life and avoid Maleficent's evil birthday curse of death. The curse that one of the fairies finds a loophole for with her blessing of eternal sleep that can be lifted with a kiss of true love and which gives Aurora a sliver of a chance if she were to prick her finger on the spinning wheel as Maleficent had hoped. Every good character in this new film is changed to make them look incompetent, mean spirited, greedy or all of the above. This is to make Maleficent look like a victim of circumstance and more likable. The thing is she's not supposed to be likable, she's the villain remember? Bad job by Disney's live action department again (John Carter, The Lone Ranger, Alice in Wonderland, etc) and a bad movie is the outcome...again. Chances are its been a while since you've seen the original so please just go watch that and don't bother with this new ""installment."" Sometimes Disney has no shame when it comes to defiling the landmark pictures and characters that built their mighty empire. It seems that nothing is sacred and cheapening the great stories of their past is often dismissed or completely ignored as long as it makes a profit while doing so. It's not global famine or the end of the world of course but I think they should treat the works of their forefathers with a lot more respect and I find it a bit sad.",Maleficent

I liked the play of dark and light. There were ominous scenes interspersed with colorful, playful ones - a metaphor for Maleficent's dual personality perhaps.The biggest drawback? The story. My biggest ""fear"" going in was the obvious fact (judging from the trailers) that the film makers were going to turn Maleficent into a sympathetic character. They did that in spades, to an almost nightmarish neo-feminist ret-con level by rendering Maleficent into not just a sympathetic character, but a jilted lover, victim and full on hero of the Sleeping Beauty saga. Every male character was rendered callow or completely neutered. Maleficent, perhaps the greatest full-on villain in the Disney oeuvre, absolutely relishing in her wickedness, was forever altered into just another boring ""warrior queen."" We no longer have a personae we ""love to hate"" - we have a misunderstood soul we ""feel bad for."" But she does get a happy ending...Anyway, the absolute best reason to see this movie is Angelina Jolie. I've been a fan for ages, and this once again illustrates why.

Maleficent is a Clichéd, Poorly written and just outright boring film. Yes, the visuals were impressive and yes Angelina Jolie was the right choice for Maleficent but this movie had so many flaws it was just horrible. To begin with the dialogue, Maleficent's dialogue was enjoyable, but everyone else was just garbage. Stephan- Garbage, Aurora- Garbage, Everyone else- GARBAGE. And even when they said something it was cliché after cliché after cliché, i even started raising my hand when they said something clichéd. Don't think i was surprised by how the dialogue and story were just poorly written i knew who was behind this, her name- Linda Woolverton, she also wrote the 2010 Alice in Wonderland which was clichéd and poorly written. I can use one word to describe the story and dialogue and that word is poor. Onto direction and this is what i will say i was dazzled by the colours and the clichéd creatures- not, the visuals were great just everything was so clichéd that at least two times throughout the movie i really wanted to walk out of the cinema. Also the camera angles and shots in Maleficent are different to what we normally see, now this both made me interested and annoyed, yes some of the camera angles were interesting but it did get a little bit annoying after time, in some shots it just felt as if the director was saying 'i know nothing is happening, but just look at Jolie!' To sum it up Annoying and Clichéd. Onto acting, and i am going to say Angelina Jolie was by far the actress most suited to playing Maleficent, she looked the part and really soaked up her character. Elle Fanning- She was okay, she got annoying after a while as her whole character was 'oh, look everything is pretty, i'm pretty'. Other characters such as Stefan and the fairies were annoying for the whole movie, but whenever Jolie came on screen i was like 'alright lets see something happen'- basically i am trying to say that if Jolie wasn't in the scene i was bored, so really the acting was okay. I will quickly skip through the music and editing, the music was entertaining and kept me interested, the editing was strange in some areas, but for the most part it was fine. To conclude my review i was really hoping that the start to the summer blockbuster season would be better but i suppose my hopes now lie with X-Men, Planet of the Apes and How to Train Your Dragon 2, to sum it all up, Maleficent is a highly clichéd and a very boring movie. 5/10",Maleficent

Fabulous detail in the costumes; all the wonderfully delightful creatures of the ""enchanted"" forest were fabulously executed. Great for adults and kids alike. And did I mention the score? It's beautiful.One thing I did not like, in relation to the film, was how the pronunciation of Maleficent was done (in the film trailers, promos, etc.). In the original Sleeping Beauty (1959), Maleficent was pronounced 'MaLIFecent'. In this new film, why change the pronunciation? It sounded so strange every time I heard 'MaLEFFicent'.",Maleficent
276,soniakakoly,It could have been better as a musical,8,18 August 2020,The actors were great. The casting was appropriate. The story is heart touching. But the usage of music would have made it cross 1 billion .Disney is doing an incredible job.,Maleficent
277,maxskyfan-9,Most Unexpected,8,28 September 2014,"PlotThis movie takes a different look at Maleficent (Isobelle Molloy) and starts the story long before there is any malice in her heart. When the tale begins she is just one of many fairies that live in her magical land. She spends most days flying around and mending broken branches. Then one day she meets a boy named Stefan who has ventured into her woods and has taken something that didn't belong to him. Maleficent takes the object back and returns it. Stefan finds her peculiar, yet spends a great deal of time with her until one day he just stopped coming to see her at all. When Stefan (Sharlto Copley) comes back to Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) as a man he is there under false pretenses. Stefan had been promised the kingship if he would defeat Maleficent who has become a powerful guardian of her lands, but at the moment of truth he cannot strike her down so he removes her wings instead and returns to his kingdom with his prize. Years later Stefan marries and has a daughter. It is at this moment that Maleficent swoops down on them with a vengeance.Character DevelopmentBecause there are so many time jumps it really is not fair to fault the acting for not showing much character development. First you have Maleficent and Stefan when they are teenagers and then a scene later they are 20 years older. For Aurora we have 3 people playing her. There are a few developments between Maleficent and Stefan and that speak volumes to who they truly are, but the story was not told in manner that would reach any deeper. Piggybacking on top of performances can only get you so far. Because after you have taken that 20 year jump in time it is not that much longer before there is another 16. People on screen might show emotions, only it isn't entirely clear how they got them.ActingMost of the acting was well done, though this wasn't really a movie for great acting; much of the delights in this film are from the spectacle of witchcraft known as special effects. The pages of the script just gobbled down this brew wantonly. Looking the part for the actor was far greater of importance than what was being said. There aren't any real face-to-face conversations with any to characters. At one point in the film Angelina Jolie's character spells a crow into a man and then directs him about doing her bidding. That is how everyone here goes about their business, directed, preforming a function, just another cog in the machine. Nothing had to be explained. Things happened because they must happen. It was willed that way after all. There is no second guessing it.OverviewRight from the opening title I knew things were set up to be different and I was only surprised to find how different the story would end up being. Great pains were given to find a fresh perspective on this very old story and I believe Disney has done it. I admit there were times that I thought the direction was all wrong, that poetic license has been taken too far, but I have seen worst results. To say anymore would give too much away. Fear not, because the elements of a fairy tale are here, they have just been rearranged very differently. I didn't see this one coming.",Maleficent
278,kajalkashsinha,Interesting,8,14 March 2021,Angelina jolie ruled the show. Her Acting was quite good . Specially a scene where her wings cut off you will actually fell bad for her character. I will say f@@k old sleeping beauty watch this one. Good and evil all in one character. I enjoyed watching it. Bond between aurora and maleficent is so good and unexpected. Loved it,Maleficent
279,jdavisjdavis,"A ""What if it were real"" Fairytale",9,29 December 2014,"The younger me would not have liked this, because I never liked remakes that changed the story. But the older me likes it quite a bit. Even more so that I'm reading the ""original unedited 1st edition"" Grimm Fairy Tales (in English) while I still read the lighter and newer versions of the same tales to my kids. So I get it now in more ways than one that there can be many versions of one story. Some of the old fairy tales don't really teach nice things to kids, so the stories get changed in modern day prints. Not only that, but even back in the 1800's when the Grimm brothers were writing the stories down after traveling around and gathering the verbally handed down stories, there are often two (or more) versions of the same story at that time floating around! So there is no perfectly ""correct"" version that exists that anyone can put a finger on to begin with.This movie aims to approach a fairytale, a story that is obviously fabricated or exaggerated to the point of not being realistic, in a more realistic manner. Realistic in the sense of motivation, humanity, and plot I mean to say. It is still very much a fairy tale about magic and literal fairies, but it's something to watch and think about from a new angle. If you loved the first one, and I did as a very small child, then see this one not as a remake but as a completely different version of the same story. A ""what if"". Great stuff.",Maleficent

You want revenge, it's got you covered. They took an old classic and gave it a nice twist. They brought the story to life and gave it flare. The movie is not dull at all. Seeing how Stephan's love turns to hate was great. How they showed him become the monster was classic. Angelina Jolie acting was on point. She played the part of the scorned fairy so well. You emphasized with her story. I wanted her to get revenge against Stephan. The girl who played snow white fit the ideal character. Her smile and demeanor showed caring and wonder. You believed the fairy land was real. I have nothing negative to say about this movie. It's a nice take on an old story.",Maleficent
282,philipposathina,A surprising twist to a popular fairy-tale...,8,26 December 2016,"...and not only. The film takes a fairy tale and turns it into a a story which though using all kinds of everything we find in fairy tales (fairies, elves, kings, queens, curses, spells, castles, palaces, knights etc. etc) it leaves out all the rest of things most fairy tales are actually made of, and that is over-simplicity not only far as their characters but also their plot itself are concerned; In most -if not in every single fairy-tale there are the good guys and the bad guys, the good things and the bad things and a direct naive message of what is good and what is bad. Maleficent lacks over-simplicity, and given a fairy-tale story, it talks about situations and feelings we're very likely to come across in our everyday real life: Greediness, love, betrayal, desperation, anger, revenge,repentance, regret, affection. Above all, it demystifies something that most fairy tales take for granted thus introducing their usually very young, innocent readers to a mentality which fully perverts reality and the existing real world. And that is ""Love"" as illustrated in this kind of stories. ""You live in a fairy-tale"" we often say to make someone see things clearly and not covered with the stardust fairy-tales have talked him into. Well, debunking the myth of ""real love"" fairy tales are often about, ""Maleficent"" makes a daring innovation like one i think we have never come across in a fairy-tale before. This, along with the rest of the above mentioned deep, complex -and absolutely real- human feelings it talks about, is -among others -what makes this fairy-tale movie unique and worth watching even by the ones who are not fond of this kind of films. No need to mention the excellent photographic work, the magnificent and utmost convincing visual effects,the imposing music as well as Angelina herself, who as Maleficent, builds a really touching character.",Maleficent
283,vampiri,solid acting,9,28 May 2014,"Recently there's been an influx in fairytale Movies and television series, i.e. Snow White and the Huntsman and Once Upon a Time, and other fairytale-like Movies, i.e. Oz the Great and the Powerful and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Most of them have done really well, and much due to charm and people's fondness of traditional good versus evil.Plot: ambitious servant to the king sees his Chance to become king. Though successful, an evil curse is cast on his daughter...Maleficent is no different from the above mentioned in style, nor in story. It is less ""grown-up"" than Snow White and the Huntsman, but darker than Once upon a Time. What separates this Movie from the others is the fabulous acting from every single actor/-ress (well, the major parts anyway).I have never been a fan of Angelina Jolie nor Sam Riley (Control and Brighton Beach). The former mostly a bimbo with occasional parts in entertaining action Movies, the latter a stiff and boring actor in mostly flat Movies. But boy, do they deliver here!! Jolie's performance is outstanding and you could really see that she enjoyed her part which also is very far from what she has done Before. Riley has also outdone himself. Besides his performance in Control I'd say he's a mediocre actor, but here he has really found a perfect part to portray and manages to find the precise level of acting, meaning, neither over nor under acting.Elle Fanning is Young and will have a fantastic career, she is really good here and her smile is a killer and really captures the innocent girl/princess.Charlto Copley is a tricky actor. His style is weird and sometimes he is good and sometimes he is bad. Here he is somewhere in between and does not manage to convince, I feel he might be somewhat miscast.Now I have said a lot about the acting, and this not without a reason. Maleficent skyrockets much due to the acting. The story is much too common and much of the details have been borrowed from Once Upon a Time.The CGI work is really good and the details in the fairyland are top class.I can't give it 10 out of 10 because it lacks that last bit which make a Movie a masterpiece.If you like fairytale-like Movies like the ones I mentioned above you will enjoy Maleficent.I give it 9 out of 10. I hope Jolie gets more serious parts now, she deserves it after her performance here.",Maleficent

But I did not like this movie at all. I don't even think that this movie was all that great from the beginning. Aside from Angelina Jolie's performance is the ""Mistress of all Evil"", this really wasn't a good movie at all. If you liked this movie, more credit to you. But me?! I don't ever want to think about or revisit this movie ever again. But what was really disappointing about this movie was the fact that Maleficent didn't turn into a dragon in this movie. The one element that made her character more interesting to watch in the original, they took it away from her in this movie.Yeah, I think Wicked was far better than this movie. Oh well, here's to you, ""Maleficent 2"".5 out of 10.",Maleficent
285,noway234-1,"Maleficent, The Big Green Softie",1,26 June 2014,"Does anyone even remember the original Sleeping Beauty? I do, it was my favorite Disney movie as a child. I had an old VHS copy that I would watch every week, in love with the visuals and the dialog and every character. Maleficent was always my favorite villain, she was pure evil but reveled in it. She was joyous in just destroying a kingdom for no other reason than ""I didn't get an invite to a party"". She was the most evil character ever, her first action on screen was to attempt to kill a child. She was amazing. When I heard there was a movie about her, I was pumped. A full hour and a half showing Maleficent being evil, she would chew scenery and give us a fun thrill ride of a movie, it would be a departure for Disney but it'd be fun and epic in scope. I was prepared for fun.I walked into the cinema and took my seat and was ready for fun... 5 minutes in, Maleficent has magically healed a tree and I realized the folly of my choice in movie. They took Disney's greatest villain, someone who was the purest of evil and loved it, and they turned her into a wood nymph that got raped by the prince and had a bad day. That's it, the wing cutting scene is a metaphor for Rape. That's not my interpretation, that was what they intended! The scene everyone was looking forward too (The curse scene) was an almost perfect recreation of the original movie and I was prepared to love it... and then, instead of Maleficent cursing Aurora to die, she cursed her with the threat of a coma. I'm sorry, that's not scary. The entire reason that Aurora had to be taken from the kingdom was because Maleficent had cursed her to die, Maryweather came up with the hail Mary pass of 'sleep' but they took her into the forest just in case Maryweather's spell didn't work. Here, they do it because they have too.Oh, did I forget to mention that Maleficent spends the entire movie knowing exactly where Aurora is (Which in the original movie, she didn't, it was a plot point and everything) and even saves her life several times? They took the greatest Disney villain of all time, and literally had her pulling people's pigtails with magic.Don't even get me started on the stupid ending, which is stupid and offensive in so many ways (The least of which is what it did to the story of Sleeping Beauty)I have heard people say that it's a fun movie. I'm sorry, I spent all of it with my head in my hands wanting it to stop because it hurt to see a character I loved completely destroyed. This movie had the potential to be great, it had the potential to be something different. It was Wicked, except Wicked had the smarts to realize that yes, this character is Evil and while you can love her, she has to die at the end. Thankyou Disney for ruining my favorite childhood villain.",Maleficent

287,angie_l,Plot holes in a completely new version of Sleeping Beauty,3,30 December 2014,"Overall, the movie was OK and I don't regret watching it. It was entertaining and beautifully shot even if many scenes were referential to other movies. As for the acting, Elle Fanning was OK as Aurora though the character felt a bit empty but to be fair, there wasn't much in the script to work with. I wish she had a little more to her than childish goodness. There actually wasn't much for any of the actors to work with. I won't lie, I'm no fan of Jolie's acting, she comes across as haughty in every role, humility and vulnerability are completely outside her range. But, her haughtiness works here and she was good as Maleficent except in the scenes where she was supposed to be angry. I got no hint of her anger, fire, or passion, she was merely shouting. I wanted to feel her rage.Biggest problem with the movie is the number of plot holes. There is no real explanation given for why the Moors and the kingdom of men are enemies. The king decides to attack for virtually no reason. The relationship between Stefan and Maleficent is graced over and yet this relationship goes to the core of Maleficent's being. We also see nothing of Stefan's life so we are unable to fully understand his actions and motivations. Stefan becomes mad and paranoid with no real love for his daughter and that just sort of happens. I could go on and on about things left with little explanation.Another major problem I had was the previews of the movie lied to me in a big way. The movie wasn't a retelling of Sleeping Beauty from Mealficent's point of view, it was an entirely new story. I wanted to find out why Maleficent was evil - the maleficent I know and love/hate or hate/love. I wanted to see Maleficent's evil with new understanding. Let's face it, Maleficent was nowhere near evil in this movie, she's angry for a moment and that's it... which lead me to imagine other ways to tell the story. Perhaps, humans had seriously wronged her. Aurora was the child born to unite the 2 warring kingdoms of men and that Maleficent's plan was to stop this union for real substantial reasons - The story could have been easily told with a new perspective while being seamlessly woven into the known fairy tale. Every story has two sides, right? In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this movie. If they were going to deviate so much from the known Disney or Perrault version, they could have fleshed out the story a little (lot) more.",Maleficent
288,Junreviews,Watch it with your own eyes,10,15 June 2014,"Went to the theater, expecting to experience the dark side of Angelina Jolie who plays a vengeful fairy with lofty wings and left the theater feeling astonished by how beautifully the movie has changed my perspective towards the antagonist.The remake of the classic Disney movie, ""Sleeping Beauty"" timely and soundly pans out by wonderfully depicting both beautiful and gloomy sides of fairy land of Maleficent that feud with selfish humans. The Visual effects and acting are so magnificent that mysterious creatures and the cast look totally in sync. The plot naturally goes along with coherent and succinct narrations that add an in-depth storytelling. Not to mention a good composition that captures significant moments without boredom. There are a lot more to feel, enjoy, and learn from what I would call, ""One of the most underrated movies of the year"" based on how the score is given. Not a Disney movie fan? Doesn't like a female protagonist? I don't think it will matter because once you start watching, you will be mesmerized by the imposing world and the ambivalent emotion of Maleficent.",Maleficent

She is the one, and only, Mistress of all Evil who was scorned by being the only one not invited to the coronation of Princess Aurora, with knowing nothing but evil, hatred and a willingness to make those who stand against her suffer. This movie however makes her a sensitive victim, a dark fairy with a heart and one who IS NOT evil and was scorned by the man she loved, and who stole her wings. Its dumb. Angelina does a fine job though.",Maleficent
290,omega_work,Keep telling yourself it is a kids movie and you'll enjoy it,5,21 August 2014,"I saw this movie for a second time yesterday and I had to keep reminding myself it was meant for children so I wouldn't get too angry.Since this will contain spoilers I should probably warn you up front about that but I won't.Strangely the first thing that stood out to me was that the battle sequence near the beginning had more on-screen violence than in all of the ""Hunger Games"" movies combined. So that was a point in the movie's favour.That being said, this war begins because a greedy King decides he wants to take over this magical land and wages war on them. Apparently this King has never heard of sending a scout in first to get intel; instead he comes out to a place for whose inhabitants he has no information about, with an army behind him.There are two very good things about this movie before I get to the main problems.1. Angelina Jolie. She was very believable in a preposterous film. She felt genuine from start to finish and also revitalized my interest in seeing her naked.2. The music score. It was a tad over the top at times, but generally complimented the film.So this lad named Stephan stumbles into the mystical realm and meets Maleficent where they fall in love. But he decides that living in a castle is more valuable to him than spending his life with Maleficent and leaves her. He's a dummy but there are lots of dummies in the world so that's perfectly plausible.After the King is mortally wounded in the previously mentioned war, he tells his minions that whomever kills Maleficent will earn his crown. Stephan uses this as inspiration to betray the one he formerly loved. But he cannot bring himself to kill her, only chops off her wings to pretend he killed her. And that's where the real problems begin...Shortly after his coronation, King Stephan announces to the kingdom that his child will be born, and who shows up to crash the celebration, but Maleficent... the one that he had claimed to have killed in order to win the crown, so shouldn't he be immediately stripped of his royalty?Once his daughter is cursed the King decides that the best course of action is to send his baby into the care of three inept (and poorly rendered) fairies whom he just met and didn't seem to even like. This was a tough one for me to get past.As Aurora grows up for some reason Maleficent decides to keep a close watch on her and makes up for the shortcomings of the fairies by making sure the child is safe, not really sure why she would do this to a child she just cursed.A sort of mother-daughter relationship forms between the two of them, which is fairly nice but perhaps a little too rushed in an already short film. Then comes Prince Philip out of nowhere, a kid who looks like a member of One Direction, but my 11-year-old daughter thought he was ugly.Supposedly Philip is en route to the castle when he happens upon Aurora, and after their cutesy meeting says that he will come back after he's been to the castle.Aurora learns about her past, that she's cursed by Maleficent and returns to the castle where her father lovingly greets her by sticking her in room from which she easily escapes and pricks her finger on a spindle that exists for reasons unknown.Maleficent decides she must try to break the sleeping spell with the help of the prince, who she intercepts while he's seeking out Aurora (presumably on his way home from his trip to the castle).Maleficent and her man-bird sneak into the castle with ease toting along ""sleeping handsome"", then basically dump him into Aurora's lap. When Prince Philip comes to and realizes he's in the castle he says this is where he was meant to be -- but wait, wasn't the only reason he was in the forest when he was captured because he was coming back FROM the castle?Once the Auror's sleeping spell is broken, she and Maleficent try to escape the castle we get into the mandatory final showdown, which is all well and good except for one major problem... during the battle Aurora hides in a random room in the castle, which conveniently, of every room in this massive castle, happens to be the very room where Maleficent's wings are kept. Apparently the writers missed the lesson where you are taught that lucky coincidences should NEVER save the heroes in the end.The rest plays out as you would expect with the evil King being killed, Maleficent being redeemed and Aurora with her loving Prince becomes the queen of the two realms. We are then told by the narrator that now you know the ""real"" story. But hold on a minute... if this is the real story, who would have documented and passed down the inaccurate version that had been told up to this point?The evil King is dead so he and his followers wouldn't have.Aurora is the loved queen now so her loyal subjects wouldn't have.Maleficent would not have shined a bright light on her misdeeds.The only solution to this I could come up with was this: After the events of the film, Philip has an affair with Maleficent and then he and Aurora go through an ugly divorce and custody battle, during which time Philip brainwashes his children into believing that Aurora is brainless and Maleficent is a heartless bitch and then they pass on that version of the story through time.Either that is the plan or the writers just had no idea what they were doing.",Maleficent
291,michael-sengwah,Too Predictable Twisted Plot,5,4 June 2014,"Disney thinks that to recycle the twisted plot idea just as in Frozen might work well for another time in this long lasting childhood fantasy, but it is a huge disappointment considering that the secret has already revealed from the beginning of the film. The lazy style of telling the story through narration, putting too much attention on unnecessary parts but neglecting the main root of the story and weak scores are the three major drawbacks. The tale of sleeping beauty can venture into a more darker experience but the intention just to target family audiences has made the film overall a huge let down. However, the magnificent performance from Angelina Jolie is extremely awesome as she is able to manage well the different immediate moods change of her character throughout the whole film.",Maleficent
292,AkelaLoneWolf,Brilliant alternate version of Sleeping Beauty,8,22 June 2014,"It is heartening to see Disney finally on par with its creative and resourceful counterparts (Pixar and Dreamworks, to name but two) and starting to produce new adaptations of well-known fairy tales. This trend can be seen from some of the more recent animations like Tangled and the must-see Frozen - the ""twist-in-the-tale"" aside, the message and moral of these tales are appropriately adjusted to target the audience of the modern age. Gone are the long wait for Prince Charming to save the damsel in distress and save the day, and princesses must learn to fend for themselves (I can't help wondering if this type of self-reliant princess is based on Princess Fiona in Shrek). Angelina Jolie excels herself in the role of Maleficient and lends a dark evil sensual side to this traditional villain; rendering her extreme angst and vindictive actions understandable - in fact, all her vengeful malice should be condoned, considering it was humans wronging her in the first place. Though I doubt if this movie is appropriate for children with its poignant take-home messages, this is also the down side to this new genre of ""rewritten fairy tales"".",Maleficent

295,MovieNinjaGuy,Magnificent,10,2 June 2014,"This truly was one of the best cinema experiences of my life. The last time I've seen movies I felt so engaged with were those in The Dark Knight trilogy.The story is simple as you would expect from a fairy tale but it unravels really well and there are a few little twists as in the same unexpected way in Frozen which gives this film a great 21st century edge I think. It feels like a culmination of 100 years of fantasy story telling but with a modern day feel.I usually don't like movies that fall in the genre defined as fantasy. Can't stand Harry Potter and The Lord of The Rings films I've only ever watched once and never wanted to see again or even give The Hobbit a go. I was Tolkiened out after 10 hours, seriously.But Maleficent felt like a breathe of fresh air from the beautiful opening scenes of Jolie's character proving her wonder of flight, (Seriously this was far more awe inspiriting than ANYTHING in Man of Steel!) to the beautiful amazing fairy world created in the film which made the film feel like a blend between live action and animation like I've never seen before. The 3D and lighting effects seemed to top Avatar in places.Jolie's character with raven wings is beautifully brought to live. When she uses her magic spell powers in the castle on Aurora I felt like it was happening in the same room. A shout out to the sound department for turning things up to eleven. Wow. Angelina Jolie was perfectly cast and I can't remember her being in something that suited her so well before. She even deserves an Oscar nod I'd say. Her character development, although perhaps simply is beautifully executed in this film. You want her to succeed and you understand her somewhat evil thoughts at times too. It all makes perfect sense.The flow of effects and real life action is splendidly done I think. The dragon scene at the end really had me in awe. There were several moments I really thought ""And that too?! Wow"". I was left speechless during the climax.It's a dark film in places and maybe not quite right for younger kids I think but still an essential viewing for any Disney/fantasy story loving movie fan and along side Frozen shows that Disney still reigns supreme. The film seemed to eat up Shrek and spit it out with a more serious, engaging but still wonderful tone. And give us something much memorable in the process.This has to be the best live action film Disney has ever produced using its own studio name.The only negatives I can perhaps think of are: -It was a little unclear to me that Aurora's spell at first could not be undone when Maleficent tried to use her powers in the cabin. Some clearer echoes to ""cannot be undone"" could have been included here. I actually think those echoes were there but still just a tiny bit vague. -There was perhaps not enough play of the 3 fairies protecting Aurora. They seemed to let her wander off a little too easy. Maybe just an extra scene could have fixed that and seemed to make it have some more sense. -I recognised Sharlto Copley in the role of Stefan even though I knew nothing other than Angelina Jolie is in this before seeing this film. His Scottish accent was almost perfect. I could slightly hear his South African accent in places so just a tiny criticism of that. But he was cast perfectly as Stefan I think.Despite a few things I can point out this film gets top marks from me as in comparison to everything else these days it was perfect I thought.I seriously had lost some hope for Hollywood after seeing some duds (how can Godzilla and Edge of Tomorrow seriously get the same/higher ratings - they feel so over-hyped to me in comparison to this beautiful piece of cinema, and that's not the genre/target age I'm talking about just the execution, engagement and story telling capabilities of the film makers). For the last few months I started to think would there ever be a movie that uses a lot of CGI I could engage with again? Hell yeah! Disney saves the day!One I'll be seeing again and can't wait for the Blu Ray.Truly Wonderful.",Maleficent
296,Dory_Darko,Don't believe the hate; Maleficent is magnificent.,9,4 June 2014,"Today, June 4, I went to see Maleficent on the birthday of its star, Angelina Jolie. In itself, nothing more than a funny coincidence, although when you think about it, it is customary for someone who is celebrating their birthday, to hand out treats. And boy, this was the best treat ever.Three reasons why I was completely stoked to see Maleficent after hearing about it for the first time about a year and a half ago: 1) I love Angelina. 2) I love Sleeping Beauty. 3) Maleficent is my favourite fairy tale villain of all time. On the other hand, I was also a little wary of the way they had apparently altered the story. See, if there is one thing I hate in films, it's when they explain and justify the motives and reasons why a certain character is ""bad"". I for one believe that some people are just plain evil and that's the way it is. And going into this persons' childhood and explaining how bad everything was (or something to that effect) only works to weaken that characters' force. Now, I don't know why a somewhat clichéd story about the love and betrayal of a young Maleficent (who apparently used to be good and pure-hearted), worked here, but somehow it just did. It completely surprised me, to be honest. I'm usually allergic to this kind of fluff, but it worked! Maleficents' back-story actually intrigued me, moved me even. And it succeeded at what it was supposed to do in the first place: it made Maleficent human.In the end though, they could have written any kind of story about what is undoubtedly Disney's most beloved villainess, it never would have been raised to an above-par level without its most crucial element: Angelina Jolie. I might sound biased because I'm such a fan, but I am perfectly able to look at her performances in a critical way, and I can only say this about her performance as Maleficent: she was in one word, perfect. I honestly can't imagine any other actress who could have approached this role with the same flawless combination of properties (short of maybe Charlize Theron): she is beautiful and very charismatic, yet at the same time undeniably cruel and cold. She was everything I had hoped this real life characterization of Maleficent would be, and then some. Compliments also go out to the three other main actors in this film. First to Elle Fanning, for being very convincing as the young princess Aurora. She is sweet, lovely and kind and she has the right personality to play this famous princess just the way she should be. Second, to Sam Riley, who was a pleasant surprise as Maleficents' pet raven Diaval in human form. I was thus far unfamiliar with his work, but he was very well suited to his role and I enjoyed watching him. Last, but certainly not least, Sharlto Copley, who has already thrilled me with his performances in District 9 and Elysium, and who has now definitely made a fan out of me. His range is awesome and he was totally terrifying as Stefan.OK, there are some things you have to look past. My first, and most blatant, issue with this film is: if young Maleficent was a good, pure- hearted girl, then why did she, as an innocent 10-year-old, already have evil-looking horns, devilish wings and is she called ""Maleficent""? Right Secondly, I found the three pixies to be very unconvincing and even somewhat annoying CGI-wise. Overall the special effects are well done but the pixies were definitely an eyesore. The dragon in the end also looked a bit unreal. That being said, Maleficents' costumes and make-up were absolutely stunning. I just couldn't get enough of gazing at her intricate headdresses and beautiful gowns. The costume and styling department really deserve top credit and I truly hope there will be some awards for them in the near future. The music was also great, with flawless scoring by James Newton Howard and a terrific rendition of ""Once upon a dream"" by Lana Del Rey over the end credits. Also, awesome battle scenes and action sequences galore!Going into this film, I thought it would be nothing more than a so-so, kind of fun summer flick. A 6.5/7 maybe. Sometimes, I love it when I'm wrong. Out of the three films that I've seen at the cinema over the last week (the other two being X-Men and Godzilla, both disappointments) I can tell you, Maleficent was by far the most gratifying. Perhaps because I had relatively low expectations, perhaps because it was simply that good.One serious warning for the rough, rugged men out there: this film features pixies, fairies, sparkly thingies and magical fluff out the wazoo. If you're going to see this, do it for Angelina. If not, treat this film like kryptonite. You will thank me later.To everyone else: go see this film. It will rock your socks off. Maleficent is magnificent.",Maleficent
297,marcusman48,Maleficent is dead - and we have killed her!,3,13 June 2014,"I have not felt this betrayed by a motion picture in literally years. What's especially sad is that I really, REALLY wanted to see it (and to like it, which I still would if it didn't stir up so much rage within me), and, while harboring no illusions that it would be great, I was sure it would be at least good. But SLEEPING BEAUTY (1959) is one of Disney's most perfect animated films and an indelible memory from my childhood. It was unique for its era: not so much Disney, per se, as it was ""Rankin-Bass does Disney and does a damned fine job of it."" It was my LORD OF THE RINGS when I was growing up. Now it is garbage, all thanks to MALEFICENT.I hope that Walt Disney Pictures are pleased with themselves. They've taken one of the their greatest female villains - no, one of THE greatest female villains, Disney or not - and reduced her to an ice queen with a particularly bad case of PMS. For years Disney has been ruining other people's ideas; now they're ruining their own ideas as well. As Maleficent herself once said, I was left staring in shock and thinking: ""No! It cannot be!""",Maleficent
298,Hunt2546,Intellectual pablum,2,7 November 2014,"Superb technical craft manages to disguise for about an hour the utter banality and PC drivel of this feminist agitprop version of Sleeping Beauty. It's particularly disappointing because the cover art shows a horned Angelina Jolie looking like Faye Dunaway on steroids, and Jolie does give a camp romp a la Dunaway or any of several other screen divas of malfeasance. But the feminist screenwriter can never make any sense of the story in any save political terms--male patriarchy bad, except for a prince who looks like a eunuch--while Maleficent, horns and all, comes out, I suppose, for female empowerment. Lots of bad decisions--besides using this script--occlude the thing as well. I think it was a bad idea to have Maleficent actually engage in combat with the forces of maledom, like a Superhero. It just looks goofy. The story is rewired grotesquely to accommodate the correct point of view with King Stefan (SPOLER) emerging for no reason except that thing between his legs, as the villain. Also gone are the core elements that make the story so endearing--the 100 year curse, the swarming thorn forest that hides the castle until Prince Charming hacks through it, and Maleficient's metamorphosis into a dragon. There is a dragon, but now he's a good dragon, that is, a contributor to NOW with an autographed pic of Bela Abzug on his wall, like the movie surrounding him, a need to vandalize the classics for this year's fashions. In fact so ridiculous is this one that Sleeping Veauty is only asleep for about 46 seconds!",Maleficent
299,NBates1,A Very Nice Movie. Jolie is Amazing!,10,3 June 2014,"I loved this version of the tale very much. The acting was fantastic, and Angelina Jolie was spell- binding in the lead (this was HER movie), and Elle Fanning was also very good in her role. The story was very good and flowed properly (in my opinion) and I loved the three main characters. I think they could have found a better actor to play King Stefan and that the three pixies should have stayed as they were in the original. The visual effects were stunning and it was a real treat to watch, even if it was in 2D (I can't stand 3D). It was very nice how they explored the relationship of Maleficent and Aurora. The battles were really great and I loved the way they made her a fighter. The narration wasn't as bad as people said. I actually think that the fact that Diaval turned into the dragon makes more sense to THIS movie as she could turn him into anything she wants. I really loved the moments that she was evil in, but my two favorite scenes were the christening and the kiss, which was a very nice twist. Somehow, Maleficent being redeemed works for this movie. All in all, I enjoyed the movie very much.",Maleficent
300,tangojazz,"The Gloria Steinem version of ""Sleeping Beauty?""",10,31 May 2014,"So, watch out, all you guys out there! ""Maleficent"" is the ""Gloria Steinem"", women's liberation, revised version of ""Sleeping Beauty"". And it's great! A movie told from a women's point of view. Pretty refreshing, I would say, for an industry that still won't make a stand alone ""Wonder Woman"" movie(probably due to sexism). I was surprised by Angelina Jolie's acting in the movie, she showed a great range and depth that I had never seen in her before. Also, some parts of ""Maleficent"" reminded me of other movies and possibilities. Angelina's flying sequences reminded me of the movie ""Man of Steel"". Angelina as ""Super Woman"" or ""Wonder Woman?"" Or Angelina as an ""X-Woman?"" The special effects, or fantasy effects if you want to be specific, were incredible, they pulled me into the movie from the first scene and left me there. The girl playing ""Sleeping Beauty"", Elle Fanning, portrayed Naivete and Innocence to the hilt. This movie was a good compromise between the adult and children's audience. If ""Maleficent"" had gone too far in the direction of either group, it wouldn't have been as good (or as popular). In ending, I would say it is a great movie, the best movie Disney has ever done, but if you're a guy (like I am) be aware that the movie has a definite opinion about the empowerment of women.

301,spitfire2356,What audience?,2,5 September 2015,"First; I would like to complement the photography and CGI effects. Simply stunning - even if I only saw it in flat format. I am sure 3D was magical. Second; Angelina is superb as the betrayed angst ridden revengeful elf-witch which redeems herself. Her body and face are 'naturally' made up to be other-worldly looking. Bravo. The superlatives earn the 'deux points'. It is all downhill from here. Aurora is portrayed as a plain village idiot with an age of 6 though approaching her 16th birthday. She is soppy as cold soup and zaps away any magic from the movie . I understand nobody wanted to play second fiddle to Angelina - but there seems to have been a stampede. The king is just plain incompetent at being a father, king, warrior, and at destroying spindles and wings. He is incompetent at being evil - just contemptibly irritating. His choice of baby sitters proves the point. The fairies are beyond dumb, dumber and dumbest to be funny. The sidekick raven-man is a non-starter as a character. The prince Charming fizzled as a footnote to the story. Without character interaction, no story holds any interest whatsoever - ask my grandma. A timeless tale was savagely pruned to the trunk. Finally; just who was this movie aimed at?? It is too violent for kids.(PG my foot) It is too boring for adults. The 'twist' on the story could be seen a mile off. I was left with a bad feeling that this movie was a poorly disguised feminist vehicle.",Maleficent
302,PadmeAgnes,Magnificent Maleficent,8,10 July 2014,"Maleficent was once a beautiful fairy till the day her wings were stolen from her ...Whilst Sleeping Beauty is a story based on the idea that pure innocence can't be defeated by evil and will be saved by love. Maleficent is based on the believe that love can heal the wounds of innocence lost. This concept is far more intriguing and human than the sugar sweetness of the original fairytale. Losing ones love, ones power and then regaining it, means inner struggle between keeping once ingrained negative emotions and embracing the enlightened path of love. Never thought about how Maleficent became evil. As a child I assumed the evil witch was just evil. This adaptation made me again realize how much we take for absolute truth without asking questions. An eye opener teaching me a lesson in compassion.However, it was not only the story that was amazing. Angelina Jolie was powerful yet vulnerable; elegantly evil and gloriously loving. The 15 year old Aurora is sweet and has a lovely smile. Noticed that the 5 year old Aurora is named Pitt-Jolie?I wasn't impressed though with the king and the young Maleficent but the costumes were beautiful, medieval fantasy, and the settings were fabulous with CGI that wasn't overwhelming. This movie brought a fantasy world alive without too much emphasis. Just in love with it and can't get enough of looking at the trailer. Hope the Blue Ray is on the market soon !",Maleficent
303,eline-hoskens,This movie succeeds in what Frozen tried to do,9,6 June 2014,"I was definitely curious about this spin-off of a Disney Classic and thought the idea of Angelina Jolie as Malificent intriguing. She naturally possesses this 'cold beauty', as I like to call it, that both Malificent and the queen from Snow White had in the early animations; the kind of taut beauty that has the potential to invoke awe.I saw the movie on big screen and I'm planning to do so again. This is the first movie in months that struck me with a well-developed and touching story, awesome visuals and subtle charming performances like Angelina's and Elle's. The ending was somewhat predictable after Frozen but - regardless of who came up with the idea first - with the build-up of this movie, it really worked! If they can make an audience feel for one of the most (in)famous villains from fairy tale land, they must have done a great job. The moors and all its creatures proved fantastic design and enormous skill. Unless you still believe in the old emotionless-puppets-are-more-credible-than-cgi mind trick, you'll have to admit it's gorgeous! Especially after reading a (very poorly argued) negative review from Empire my expectations had decreased before I watched Malificent. But from the moment the movie drew me in, I was blown away by all the talent this Disney spin-off displays.I am surprised a movie like Frozen gets so many hysteric fans while compared to this movie, it had a sloppy and chaotic storyline and little plausible development in its main and minor characters. Malificent, on the contrary, goes through a very credible emotional journey which makes you sympathize with her. Even during the famous cursing scene, you're on her side. King Stefan's betrayal is heart-breaking and Malificent's grieve, afterwards developed into thirst for revenge, is tragic. Without wanting to take Sleeping Beauty too much for granted, it provides a wonderful spin-off with its own original twists. (So it doesn't copy the original story exactly... Big deal.) Still, it takes small elements you remember from the original movie, like the constantly fighting and clumsy fairies, and uses it in advantage of its own story. It also refers to the original versions of famous scenes like the cursing scene and the pricking scene and visual elements like the birthday cake with a wink. And it dares to make Aurora and Filip look and sound like the teenagers they are. This alternative take on Sleeping Beauty is definitely worth seeing several times (preferably on big screen). In my opinion its emotional impact even transcends the classic animation's.",Maleficent

305,acanacox,All star points go to Angelina,3,7 October 2020,"My favorite Disney princess, villian, prince, artistic Disney film brought to life~ which no one asked for~ neither did I! I knew it was going to be a disaster~ you.dont.ever.recreate.a.brilliant.classic with realism~ especially when you mess up the whole movie script! The only Part I truly enjoyed was angelinas part. The famous quote ""well well....., oh dear, listen well all of you-"". That scene and her script lines was the only part I enjoyed until they just decided to add useless lines for her. Shes absolutely stunning looking so huge props to her makeup artists!
Gahhhhhhhh they ruined everything about aurora!!!!! Absolute favorite princess doesn't come close to this actress's portrayal! I've seen Disney land character auroras that looked sooo much better and sorry~ prettier than this girl! ""Gold of sunshine in her hair~ lips that shame the red red rose""....nothing that fits that into this random girl! No clothes that resemble her outfit in the cartoon version! Give me SOMETHING that makes me think ""yea that's Aurora""! Her demeanor is nothing like that of the cartoon version! Belle in the realistic version was more alike of her cartoon self than this girl!
Stupid crow part, stupid first kiss, stupid fight with the dragon, and of course the ending is nothing like the cartoon. I was incredibly incredibly dissatisfied that they didn't have the ""once apon a dream"" SINGING in the movie but only in the credits. The most well known song in that movie and they don't put it in~ yea yea yea it's about Maleficent, but at the same time aurora has basically more screen time.

306,bononista,B e a u t i f u l l y T o l d,10,30 May 2014,"I'm not a Disney Fan. I never cared for the Princess themed films. I never understood why the Queen in Snow White or Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty were at all threatened in beauty or charm or intellect by the youth in each film.This film is absolutely brilliant. It finally shows a view that makes sense from a story telling stand point, it shows the grace and charm of a character who is not a ""princess"" (by title), and it has a clear beginning, middle and end for all motivation on the part of principle characters.This might be one of the single best narrated film in the entire history of Disney, and perhaps of all time. This might be the single best character actress performance by Angelina Jolie since Gia, or possibly of her entire career. This cast might be the most simplistic yet perfect cast ever put together to tell a small story in a tremendously beautiful way, with universal messages that cross all relationships.I knew I would appreciate Jolie on the big screen. What I didn't know is that the story is, by it's telling in this film, NOW a 'classic"" story. Anything including the original animated version pales by comparison.I can't say it's the greatest film I've seen or the best this year or any of those things because it can not be put into any of those categories nor compared to any other film.This film, in some way, I believe simply by the story itself, and how it is told, stands apart from any film I've seen in quite possibly decades.I saw it, went out to the box office, got another ticket, and saw it again. And I plan to see it again if possible. I saw the 2D version.I am not a 3D or IMAX person, and I am not a fan of blu-ray, but THIS FILM needs to be seen in any and all formats. If you thought the Lord of the Rings films or the Hobbit films were beautifully done, THEY can't even be compared to the telling of this tale.Maleficent might be the most brilliantly told story I've seen in my entire life (and I've seen many many films in many genres). I want to read it as it is told in the film, and I think in the telling this version is the only version need ever be told.Absolutely magnificent. I'm spellbound.",Maleficent
307,Imaculata,"Not as good as I hoped, better than people say",6,3 June 2014,"I have very mixed feelings about this movie. It has gorgeous visuals and an amazing performance by Angelina Jolie, yet all the other actors pale in comparison, and are miscast. Plus the effects dominate the film too much. But worst of all, is that the story is a mess, it breaks completely with the original tale of Sleeping Beauty near the end. Oh, and it rips off the ending to Snow White and the Huntsman. Having a twist near the end is nice, but we have seen this exact same twist several times now in better movies. And it's painfully obvious that they've borrowed heavily from Snow White and the Huntsman, but to also steal the twist ending? On the other hand, the 3D works great. But I can't help but feel this movie would have benefited from more real sets and costumes, rather than having so many CGI backdrops and creatures. It's overkill, and it takes you out of the story. It also feels like they've rewritten the ending at the last moment. There are several plot points from the original fairy tale that are set up, and left completely unresolved. For example, the entire kingdom falling into a deep slumber is a pretty important plot point to just leave out completely. It's basically one of the most well known parts of the fairy tale, and they even set it up, and then leave it out. Why? What happened when they wrote this? It's such a shame, because when Angelina does play evil, she's epic. What a waste.Every other character besides Maleficent is completely flat. It's really easy to make Maleficent seem like the hero, when everyone else is a cardboard cut out, and acts like either a fool or a jerk. They really did not spend any time fleshing out any of the other characters.This is not a movie you need to see in the theater. It won't ruin your evening either, but it had the potential to be so much more.",Maleficent
308,cubsckc,Good Adaptation Considering Audience,8,1 June 2014,"I was actually pretty surprised at the critics reaction to Maleficent. However, I'm glad at the success of the film despite the critical reviews. The one thing that one must look at when looking at this film is the fact that the film is trying to obtain two audiences. For one, the darkness of the film is something that has made many movies awesome. However, the film also struggles to maintain its child audience for revenue. As such, I think its unfair to overlook at what the film is trying to do. For one, it didn't fail with its capture of the audiences it was trying to attract.Though some of my critical response does go to the fact that I thought the movie wasn't dark enough, I still understand why it went the way it did. A lot of these critiques say that the film isn't dark enough but also said that Tim Burton's Batman was too dark for children. Angelina Jolie's acting was terrific. I could definitely see genuine emotions with the conflicting two feelings she had throughout the movie. The special effects were also very cool, and though I didn't see it in 3D, I think that it would be worth a 3D experience. The story line was very good as well. I believe that it was forced in one way in order to keep most audiences happy. Without ruining anything, Maleficent is seen as good but her story is explained to the actions that she did. Because of this I would have liked to see her evil go full throttle throughout the film. For those that have not seen it, I think its interesting what you think will happen in the film when I mentioned that this film was located for target audiences... hint: its a Disney film. There's also a nice ""Frozen"" moment at the end which I like despite the fact I don't particularly like ""Frozen.""As a result, I think the movie definitely had potential to be an extraordinary film. I'm not sure if it was and maybe it was changed. Or perhaps it was Disney's plan from the start. However, it was still a great watch. I have a good collection of fantasy films, and I would definitely add this one to it.",Maleficent

The storyline is amazing. It the best storyline that re-tell the story from a different view that suppose to be the behind-the-story of classic Sleeping Beauty. It is so realistic and heartwarming at the same time with a lot of amazing twisted.It was all the answers to the classic Sleeping Beauty, why Maleficent cursed the baby and why she is evil and why to every questions we should have doubted for the original story. It was about hatred and vengeance that Maleficent get from being betray and also the regret that she had from doing things from her hatred. And it's real. We do so many things when we're full of hatred that we would actually regret later on.And the twists was amazing. We would never expect past relationship between Maleficent and king Stefan. And the twist of true love kiss as well. Of course, Maleficent would never hold on to the cliché true love kiss from Aurora and the prince from just 10 minutes of seeing each other. Maleficent is about motherly love and the white spot inside the black heart of Mistress of all evil.About casts, there is not a single person in the planet that would pull off the character Maleficent other than Angelina Jolie. Her performance as Maleficent is just magnificent. From her evil laugh to her painful cry, Angelina is just the best and only Maleficent and she just stole the whole movie.Her scene where she cried after being betrayed by the Stefan is just wonderful and the best scene of all is where she hold Viviane (her biological daughter as young Aurora) for the first time. It was just heart touching and funny at the same time.Elle is also the perfect cast for Aurora as well. Being able to portray an innocent, curious, feminine but realistic at the same time is just incredible. And her laugh, her smile and her cry after knowing about Maleficent is awesome.The scenery of the film is amazing. The special effects and the set of the film is wonderful. Its the only film that show a fairytale-like world but in realistic view.The customs was awesome. Maleficent's horns and wings are so so amazing. There must be like 10 different horns, but all of them looks awesome with the outfits and occasions.P.S: And for those reviewers and critics who had been dissing about Maleficent being a big ""disappointment"". First of all, you're annoying. Just because you can't write bad things about amazing movies that everyone love DOES NOT mean you're an amazing critic. Secondly, the film was amazing, unless you're the kind of people who would only watch cheapskate comedy and annoying (TOO-MUCH) action movies. And finally, you're not 10 years old. Grow up.

The CGI was flawless and at some points it felt like you were actually flying around the theater with Maleficent herself. Now, the story was pretty good. I was more impressed with the beginning in seeing how Maleficent actually came to be Maleficent, but some point towards the middle of the film I found myself utterly confused. Confused because of just how much the plot differed from the original Sleeping Beauty. I mean Maleficent, as we've seen her, was ruthless and wouldn't care for any living creature. She's too lenient in this one and although I loved the role reversals, making good appear evil and evil appear good, there is still such thing as going too far. If you've seen the original Sleeping Beauty, don't expect the same story because you will be very disappointed. The character casting was flawless, but the character development not so much. All in all, it can't live up to the original Sleeping Beauty, as expected, but I'm going to give it a 6/10 star rating for casting, cinematography, the first 10 seconds of the movie and CGI.

While the movie lacks in visuals unlike Alice and Oz, it made up through the unstoppable force known is Angelina Jolie. Angelina Jolie's portrayal of the good turned evil turned good fairy deserves much acclaim. She is able to portray every emotion perfectly. Elle Fanning is also able to portray an innocent Aurora wonderfully. As with the blockbuster hit Frozen, which descipt's true love between sisters, the concept of true love here is shown through a mother-daughter like relationship. While distancing itself from the conventional idea of true love into something more universal, I hope Disney does not completely forget about the classic true love.

312,keith-w8888,Where did you get that hat?,3,11 June 2014,"Not unlike the tourist, this movie appears to be created as a showpiece for Angelina Jolie to the almost exclusion of everyone else. Granted Elle Fanning is the (original) title character - who does a great job of embodying the naive optimism of youth - but Jolie gets more coverage than Fanning all the way through. The plot - or perhaps storyline is a better description - lumbers along with the speed and grace of a tree sloth with arthritis. It doesn't have far to travel because so little happens in the 97 minutes of its unfolding. Special effects were not bad, musical score was great, the supporting actors added some entertainment outside of the innumerable Jolie face shots. I know she's a big name, but why would a director or a producer for that matter allow themselves to be coerced into transforming something which could have been a great remake into something so tedious and devoid of live. Let's compare it for a moment to Snow White and the Huntsman where Charlize Thuron's evil Queen was a towering inferno of rage and jealousy - whereas this travesty of Angelina Jolie's character is neither one thing or the other. It's all very well to bang on about anti heroes but she lacked conviction both as the vengeful fairy and as the born again fairy godmother. I can understand that without clear direction it would be easy enough to miss the mark in one direction of the character spectrum, but to miss the mark in both directions is kind of inexcusable, especially since she misses the mark by such a long way. I can't even see who the movie is targeted at?

313,jacob-m-ford97,Maleficent Review,7,31 May 2014,"Maleficent, directed by Robert Strombeg, is a retelling of the well- known fairytale Sleeping Beauty. In this film, we take a look at this story from the perspective of the character typically portrayed as the villain. At the start, we meet Maleficent as a young fairy girl living in the magical wilderness, flying on her majestic wings, healing broken trees, and living life to the fullest with various fascinating mystical creatures. After falling in love with a young human boy, something which is forbidden, we flash forward to Maleficent as an adult. After she is betrayed by someone she cares for dearly, Maleficent transforms into the evil, vengeful witch known so well as the villain from the classic Disney fairytale, and rather abruptly I must add. The story unfolds as Stromberg and screenwriter Linda Woolverton both follow the old fairytale, while also taking many liberties along the way, as we watch Maleficent and Aurora learn about magic, life, and the real meaning of true love.Angelina Jolie headlines this film playing the title role. Jolie does an excellent job with her portrayal, making references to the original animated character while also adding more consistent and modern themes to the part. I almost feel bad for Jolie, as she was sort of paddling upstream with this character. The way Stromberg decided to cut and play Jolie's acting sequences, while also letting the atrocious leather pants of costume designer Anna Sheppard find their way onto the screen, brought down the quality of this performance. Also starring is Elle Fanning in the role of Aurora. Fanning is a young actress with still plenty much to learn, so it is not surprising that few risks were taken on her part, as the character resulted rather blandly. Still, she played the part as she should, and we were left with Aurora as we have always known – unfortunately, this is completely unlike the rest of the film. Also starring are a miscast Sharlto Copley as Aurora's father, Sam Riley as a confusing Diaval, and Imelda Staunton, Leslie Manville, and Juno Temple, as the funny and very inconsistent pixies.The sole fault of this film comes from director Robert Stromberg; unfortunately for a movie, that is the worst place to have your mistake be. Linda Woolverton gave him a screenplay that, sure it had its faults, but was overall a perfect script for this type of movie. It almost felt that Stromberg, a two-time Oscar winning Art Director, didn't know what to do half the time. The dialogue and essential storytelling were rushed, the only plot development coming from narration, while random flying scenes other beautiful sights were sustained. This can be good, just not in a movie containing a story so intricate cut down to under 100 minutes. As soon as I felt like I had gotten to know Jolie's Maleficent she had already overcome her difficulties and was beginning to receive closure, while the majority of the other characters were still meaningless to me as the credits rolled. I'm not simply saying that I wished for this film to have been longer, but that Stromberg had done more with these characters so that I could have loved them. It also seemed that Stromberg didn't know how he wanted his viewers to feel walking out of the theater. I was unable to tell if this movie was supposed to be dark and make me feel depressed or scared, or if it was intended to be a happy children's film that would make me laugh at the simplest thing. As a result of this confusion, I left the theater feeling neither way. Which, may just be the perfect example of an imperfect movie. Disney seems to be on a similar streak with a bunch of their ideas, and Maleficent is a combination of those. Grasping the feelings of Snow White and the Huntsman while taking Frozen-like twists. Overall, Maleficent was quite enjoyable, it is definitely worth the watch. It caters to both child audiences and more mature viewers, however it also fails by being sometimes undesirable to both. I give Maleficent a disappointed 7.0/10.",Maleficent

315,isabelle-frater,Good retelling with a twist,8,17 August 2014,"Besides superhero movies, the latest trend seems to be fairy tale retelling. Maleficent tells the story of Sleeping Beauty from the evil fairy's perspective. Even just reading that, it's obvious that she's not as evil here as she was in the original story. I like these sorts of retellings. The ""evil"" characters become three dimensional, instead of just the two dimensions that we used to get. Most of the time in real life people have their reasons for doing what they do. Also, sometimes the real villain is not the one you would first pick out to be. Without spoiling too much, I liked her reasons for doing what she did, and I also liked the way they resolved it.Angelina Jolie was of course great in her role as the title character. She could be great in her fury, and in her soft moments. I didn't expect anything less of her. Elle Fanning I haven't seen in many things before. Looking at her list of appearances, I saw a lot of shows that I watch, but she wasn't memorable to me. In her role as Aurora she takes a bit of a back seat, since this Sleeping Beauty version isn't about Sleeping Beauty, but I liked her as Aurora. She had genuine smiles and laughter in her eyes.I like how they did the kiss. Without spoiling the story, I'll just have to say that I never liked that in the original story. In most versions of the story the Prince either only sees her once, or never until he kisses her. He doesn't know her very well. He may feel that he loves her, but it doesn't feel deep. Also, romantic love can fade. However, there is one kind of love that once is born, never goes away. That really is true love.Overall, 8 stars. I'm tempted to give 10, but the reason why I'm not is that on the one hand it's too short. Maybe because it's meant for children, and they figure that without singing that's the only amount of time kids can sit still. I would have also liked to see more story. However, great movie, definitely recommend it to adults as well.Cross-posted at http://unapologetic-reviews.blogspot.com, where you can find more reviews.",Maleficent
316,nightcrawlercyp-311-219346,misandric feminist crap,1,26 April 2015,"The way the movies twists everything makes me cringe. Notice how maleficent looks exactly like a demon. Also notice how everyone repeats that there is no such thing as true love. Not that the original story was about true love (the prince rapes the princess and her twin children wake her up; oh and the prince is already married), but it is a product at its age. An interest thing is how the fairies and magical creatures are presented as good. Even if some worshiped them, they were never seen as actually good. They varied from impish and benign to evil. They had an interesting habit of stealing children, making people sick and basically doing evil stuff if anyone upset them. The people from ancient times feared them and had varied customs to keep them pacified, some involving giving them gifts. he whole story is started because a fairy believes that she had be deprived from her offerings. They have a mobster mentality. Also interesting enough all men are seen as incompetent or evil. This movie is full of man hate feminist propaganda and is a piece of utter garbage despite the great acting of the actors and the great imagery.",Maleficent
317,sastorytellerfilms,Better than the animated film...a masterpiece....,10,15 June 2014,"Wife took me to see this just now on father's day. This is a cinematic masterpiece of storytelling. A film of visual beauty and fantasy. Takes you to that place The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings does with it's cinematography and music score. Angelina Jolie is magnificent and is still one of the top 10 greatest actresses in film. She delivers a grabbing emotional edge of both good and evil. I can't say anything more or it will be a spoiler but this movie will take you places few dare to take on chance on. This movie does not follow the standard predictable formula and it's nice to see a story that reinvents itself in a classic way. I will say this to all of the critics bashing this film ""retire and do us all a favor"". We need more films like this and Disney is blowing the lid off the honey pot and proving that we want more films like this with both story and visual effects. Steven Spielberg and other filmmaking legends should be so proud they are becoming more involved to set the industry back on track the way it should be. So much ""trash"" coming out to make studio money and leaving audiences simply drained of hollow storytelling. Bravo Disney and you guys keep doing them all like this and I promise you the money will come as a reward for it. This movie is right up there with Oz the Great and Powerful, Lord of the Rings, and other classic fantasy films. I will definitely be adding the director along with Angelina to my list of favorite producers and directors. This is exactly how you do it folks. This is filmmaking at it's absolute best. Malificient is a moving, gutsy, imaginative, visually stunning piece of priceless art. Anything lower than 10 stars feels like madness to me. Thank you for this film. ~ S A Storyteller",Maleficent

320,jessbir-23618,angelina jolie,7,17 July 2019,Angelina Jolie is an incredible actress which this movie more than shows. the first time I saw this movie she actually made me cry in some very emotional scenes because of her flawless acting. Elle fanning is wonderful as the beautiful princess aurora. I found the story here very captivating and beautiful the movie is dark but still full of magic and wonder I have watched it 5 times since it came out and I still enjoy it very much its simply a great film.,Maleficent
321,Amonute-Matoaka,And Sleeping Beauty will never be the same.,7,5 June 2014,"I went into the theatre expecting to watch a mediocre film. I was so wrong. For such a type of film, it was spectacular. And I say such a type of film, because you don't go into the theatre to watch a remake of Sleeping Beauty and expect a film with the depth of Fellini. It's a blockbuster for crying out loud. The only reason I gave it a 9 out of 10 is because I wanted to see some more character development. I understand that's not the point of the film, but I believe it would have been an excellent movie if it had allowed its characters to evolve more.Still, the characters were interesting, the plot surprising and the cgi very good. It was a little cheesy at some points, but it's a fairytale and, to me, the cheesiness added to the general dreamy atmosphere. The cinematographer worked wonders too. As did the make-up artist and the costume designer. But this is a Disney film after all, so I wasn't surprised finding these points perfectly done.It was also so very refreshing watching yet another film where women are portrayed as complex characters and not as simple stereotypes (super- villain extraordinaire, damsel in distress e.t.c.) and their relationship with the men in their lives is that of equality and companionship. Keep going Disney.Angelina Jolie was amazing. She owned the screen. I found myself cheering for her from the moment she appeared. And that's a big deal because Maleficent scared the bejesus out of me when I was a little girl. I'll never watch Sleeping Beauty the same way again thanks to her.P.S I would have given it an 8 out of 10 but for the rape allegory. I was shocked and pained. It was marvelously done. People were actually crying when the scene played. They were crying for the lost wings of a fairy. If that's not successful performance, script and direction, I don't know what is.",Maleficent
322,dramafreak42,Powerful Set Up that Loses Steam,5,3 March 2015,"It's amazing how many 1 or 10 star reviews there seem to be. Clearly a polarizing film. And as is so often the case, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.There's a bold and daring revisionist film in here, but it becomes more and more muddled as the story progresses. The first 30 minutes or so devotes itself to a single mission: making the actions we've seen Maleficent take in the original ""Sleeping Beauty"" appear to be fully justified. And you know what? It works. With a new back story linking her to Aurora's father, this has suddenly become a female empowerment revenge story, almost akin to a high fantasy take on ""Kill Bill."" Unfortunately once it crosses over into the events of the animated version we already know, things start to go awry. If the film had the guts to stick with how it started, and justify Maleficent but keep her just as harsh as we've always known her, then it could have truly been something incredible. The problem is that approach ultimately wouldn't be family friendly, and this is Disney after all. So we end up with bonding between Maleficent and Aurora and a continuing softening of Maleficent as a character. This might have worked if the film hadn't succeeded so well in justifying the evil version early on. It tries to have it both ways: ""She totally had a good reason for being so bad... but wait, she also wasn't as bad as you thought!"" It's this attempt at a middle ground that robs the film of its initial power and leaves it feeling like the watered down version of a decent idea. For her part, Jolie really owns this role and is without a doubt the best thing that the film has going for it. The rest of the cast is serviceable, but the characters aside from Maleficent haven't been given much more dimension than they had in animated form (some even made more one dimensional in some cases.) The use of CGI is excessive, but at the same time the shots are beautifully composed so it kind of balances out.In the end, if this was going to be done somebody other than Disney should have done it. This really needed to be done by somebody who didn't care about tainting a family friendly legacy, because it's that fear that feels like it holds the film back from what it otherwise might have been. It's not bad by any stretch, but it feels fundamentally compromised at its core.",Maleficent
323,jukangliwayway,"Maleficent is not terrible, but this could have been better. Way better than the lackluster spectacle (forgive the oxymoron) that it actually is.",6,4 July 2014,"I gotta be honest, the film in totality felt rushed & uneven. Visually speaking, the CGI overload was distracting. It's not bad, better than Jack the Giant Slayer that's for sure, but the overall flavor felt so cluttered and artificial. The Moors creatures are adorable though! There are several factors that made this movie disappointing, if not a failure, but the ultimate crime they did in this big-budgeted fumble of a movie is the overuse of narration. I could only take so much storytelling from a boring voice and several minutes into the movie I was sitting, my mind slowly getting numb, while the lady next to me was busily munching on her extra crunchy corn chips, and I wonder - does Hollywood really think that the audience are stupid? Everything is spoon-fed. Please SHOW, don't tell. Considering it's Stromberg's directorialdebut, maybe it's his way of avoiding the seemingly intimidating task of just doing a few minutes worth of montage. I'm pretty sure half of the film would be unnecessary if they did less narration. That way, Stromberg could have added more interaction between Maleficent and Sleeping Beauty - I totally enjoyed Vivienne's scene with Jolie, and I would have appreciated more scenes like that. As the credits rolled, I felt nothing. In fact, I have forgotten half of the film already. The first act was kind of shaky for me, like I wasn't too sure what to feel - should I be bored or what? I really didn't know. Add in Sharlto Copley's weird accent that was so distracting that if it's possible to reach in and grab his messy hair I would have - so I could've karate-chopped his Adam's apple! I don't know if he really has some foreign accent in real life, but it's like he's destined to play characters with weird distracting squeaky voices/accents. Yeah, he totally ruined the Oldboy remake for me. Elle Fanning, while being a good actress in her other films, seemed to pale in comparison whenever she's sharing screen time with Jolie. It also seems like she was just an afterthought when they made the screenplay - like ""oh wait, we forgot to add Sleeping Beauty! You know, the actual protagonist in the story?"" Yeah. Her character was so dry, Fanning really couldn't do much but skip-pity hop in the moors playing with troll-like creatures. Baby Aurora had more character development than her. It felt like a big chunk of the film was spent showing Maleficent blowing some fairy dust and making people sleep and make them float around like puppets. The ending was so blah I just wanted to get out of the cinema already. I mean what's up with (spoilers alert) pretty boy prince (who can't act even if a machine gun is pointed at him) making gooey eyes with the newly-crowned Not-so-sleepy-Sleeping Beauty after we have established the fact that his kiss didn't pass the ""true love kiss""? I don't know what that means, except that maybe there really is no true love except parental love, so why not marry the first handsome prince to come our way? I don't know. I didn't get that.I still feel that despite the shaky direction and screenplay (not to mention the sometimes cringe-worthy script) it's still one of the better re-telling of a classic fairy tale. The sole reason for that is Angelina Jolie as the titular character. Suffice to say, she owned this role! I do think that this movie doesn't deserve her, but it's really nice to see her play a role that only the likes of Johnny Depp might consider, and kick ass with the limp material they provided her with. Without her, this film would be total trash. At least now we know she can do quirky costumed character roles. I could easily get lost and forget about the effects and side characters just by looking at her expressions. Okay, I admit that when she wailed a few times I thought it was a bit cheesy. But damn it she saved this film even if the jilted lover angle is so clichéd!Maleficent is not terrible. But with its huge budget and one of the biggest A-listers in the universe as the lead with a bunch of little popular names around her, and some seasoned technical people behind the camera/script, this could have been better. Way better than the lackluster spectacle (forgive the oxymoron) that it actually is.",Maleficent

325,WilliamOTyler,"A spotlight on Angelina Jolie, but not much else.",7,28 January 2016,"Maleficent is arguably Disney's most iconic villain, so it's no big surprise that when the mouse house decided to do a movie reminiscent of Broadway's Wicked, retelling one of their classic fairy tales from the point of view of the villain, they would choose the evil fairy. She definitely is poised enough to hold her own movie, especially with the help of the bone structure and natural talent of Angelina Jolie, but even with an almost solid story and a fantastical landscape, Maleficent's movie falls slightly short of being the fully fierce dragon you expect it to be.First time director Robert Stromberg creates a beautiful enchantment of a movie that bridges daydreams with nightmares. The film's lavish look showcases Stromberg's eye for visual effects and is extreme at points, but at least extremely good. Coupled with a dark James Newton Howard soundtrack and a story that was apparently helped on by an uncredited Paul Dini, you'd think you'd have instant success! And you almost do.As the title character, Maleficent's side of the well-known Sleeping Beauty story clearly focuses on her, and Angelina Jolie portrays the character to a T! This film is a spotlight for both Jolie and the character of Maleficent at the same time. Every move, physically and mentally, makes sense. She has a way of channeling the character we already know while adding to her and creating something altogether new, looking absolutely incredible the entire time. Maleficent's style and design are just spectacular, from the horns and cheekbones to the costumes and wings. The audience really gets to know her as they watch her deal with the situations arising around her, and one can tell her mood just by the colors and textures she adorns herself with.But while Maleficent herself stands horns above the competition, no other character is really fleshed out. There is enough story to understand everyone else's motivations, but not enough screen time for you to care about their respective outcomes. This could be a deliberate attempt to have one side with Maleficent's cause, but more so it feels like an unfortunate side effect of the biggest downside in the entire movie: the editing and pacing.While several scenes are presented as epic moments, the filler in-between them comes off like a series of unfinished vignettes, almost like watching a montage of clips from a movie rather than watching the entire movie itself. A lot of time period is covered from beginning to end in this film and a longer running time would have helped to properly progress everyone's story, including Maleficent's, in a more organic and emotional way. It seems like some character development happens off screen because of this, even though all the integral information we need for the movie is indeed presented to us.Even while feeling a little rushed, Maleficent is still quite entertaining and Angelina Jolie is simply captivating. The landscapes, costumes, soundtrack, visual effects and story all meld into a strange but sensationally good time. The movie manages to take the Disney classic and twist it into something rigid wrapped in fetish that is sure to get the attention of today's audience. I'm interested to see what is next for Stromberg's directing eye.",Maleficent

328,kevinthecritic,"""Maleficent"" is Not Magnificent, But Worth Seeing",5,1 July 2018,"2.5 out of 5 stars (decent)Disney has been around for a long time, bringing us animated classics like Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin, and Tarzan. Of course, those films were in the 1990s, the ""Disney Renaissance,"" a time when Disney could do no wrong. Disney's newest trick has been to re-tell its classic animated films with a darker touch, as well as in live action, since live action appeals to a larger audience. In 2010, Disney teamed with director Tim Burton to present a re-tooled Alice in Wonderland, which, while a financial success (so much so that a sequel is in the works), was not a critical hit. Maleficent will likely follow the same path as Alice, but I liked Maleficent more. Maleficent is a dark (for Disney), sometimes funny fantasy telling the Sleeping Beauty story from the point of view of its villainess, Maleficent. Is it a new Disney classic? No, but it is entertaining.In this interpretation, Maleficent (played devilishly well by Angelina Jolie) was once a good fairy who became close friends with a human, young Stefan (Sharlto Copley of District 9). Their relationship blossomed through adolescence, when the war between humans and fairies reignited, forcing their lives down separate paths. As they matured, each became a leader in their kingdoms. They met again when the aging human king offered his throne to whoever vanquished Maleficent. Stefan betrayed both Maleficent and the king, leaving her alive, but bitter, while he ascended to the throne.Years later, Maleficent has a chance for revenge when she learns that Stefan is christening his baby daughter, Aurora (played as a teen by Elle Fanning). Maleficent crashes the affair, cursing her to ""fall into a sleep-like state!"" on her 16th birthday when she pricks her finger on a spinning wheel. (It's as if Disney is afraid to use the word ""die"" nowadays.) Furious, Stefan tells his guards to burn every spinning wheel and sends Aurora to live in seclusion with three fairies (Lesley Manville, Juno Temple, and the extremely underused Imelda Staunton), who wouldn't look out of place on one of those never-ending Real Housewives TV shows. Since none of these three imbeciles possess the means to properly raise a child, Maleficent is forced to play fairy godmother in order to keep the child alive long enough to meet her demise. The relationships between all the players of this game change and twist as the child grows.Maleficent has many good qualities. Angelina Jolie is a fantastic choice for the role, giving it her all, as always. The cinematography and visuals are astounding, and the action scenes are exciting. The computer-generated creatures are entertaining without resorting to crude jokes or bathroom humor. If the film is nominated for anything, it will be in the effects category.Sadly, other parts of the movie are not as well done. Sharlto Copley is extremely miscast and completely unbelievable as a ruler of this beautiful land, there to yell for the entirety of his time on screen. Elle Fanning plays the role with a little more ditziness than I would have liked, but at least she's not one of those teenagers who are full of angst. No Bella Swan complex here. The three fairies are some of the most annoying creatures ever to come out of a Disney movie. While their brief bickering was funny in the original, here it makes you want to kill them, and not in a love-to-hate way.It was very hard for me to tell the age group for which this film was designed. It has Jolie, who treats the role with the seriousness it deserves, but no adult with half of their brain cells working will find the fairies funny. Also, the prince that Aurora is supposed to fall in love with is a huge throwaway character, only there for a couple of awkwardly scripted scenes. The script is the biggest problem. It switches from good, moderately dark scenes to ""funny"" ones to calm the kids down. The kids in our theater were not scared by this at all. The opening and the climax mirror the previews for the film, but the middle needed some re-writes. No offense to Linda Woolverton (who also wrote Alice in Wonderland) but she should seriously consider finding a writing partner. So far, her writing career has consisted of extremely high-concept ideas that end up being half-baked. All in all, Maleficent is worth seeing and an interesting take on the story, but don't expect anything magical.Rated PG for Sequences of Fantasy Action and Violence, Including Frightening Images",Maleficent

330,jul-kinnear,Wasted Potential,6,16 June 2014,"Long ago, in the final year of the 1950s, there was Sleeping Beauty, the sixteenth of Walt Disney's animated children's tales. The film told the story of the princess Aurora, cursed into unnatural slumber by the vindictive fairy Maleficent– considered by many to be one of Disney's greatest villains.Fifty-five years later, under the first-time direction of Robert Stromberg , the self-titled ""mistress of all evil"" gets her own movie – complete with some good ideas, a nice plot twist, lots of unanswered questions, and a heap of wasted potential.Show, don't tell, is one of the basic commandments of storytelling, whether on paper or on screen, and it's broken into tiny shards like the frailest of magic mirrors by Stromberg and his scriptwriter Linda Woolverton. By using a completely unnecessary narration throughout the movie, Stromberg repeatedly refuses to let his characters speak - or even emote - for themselves. Worse yet, he barely lets them speak to each other. The title character (Angelina Jolie) is driven to revenge by her lover's betrayal, yet there's no time given to showing their relationship. We're permitted a chirrupy scene when they first meet, and a brief -- nearly dialogue-free -- view of a really bad breakup, but that's it. Sharlto Copley's King Stefan - the cause of our poor dark fairy's grief - gets three scenes with her, and a couple more briefly terrorizing his subjects, and nothing else. He's absolutely essential to the plot, and his psychological turmoil is an obvious counterpoint to Maleficent's own, but no one could be bothered to give him any time to do it in. He barely has any dialogue.Dialogue in general is in maddeningly short supply in this fantasy world, as are characters to speak it. Much of the the film's hour and a half run-time is spent with Ms. Jolie and her prosthetically enhanced cheekbones, but we never learn all that much about her character, because personality is largely displayed through interaction and conversation, and over the course of the entire movie, Maleficent actually talks with only four different characters. The same is true of Princess Aurora (Elle Fanning), and the raven-man Diaval (Sam Riley). These three are our protagonists, yet they barely really speak to each other. When they do, it's often not that all that meaningful or all that much. It's as if Woolverton was paying for dialogue by the word.The lack of verbiage brings with it some significant story gaps. With the exception of her avian sidekick, we never find out what the other inhabitants of her magical realm think of Maleficent's actions, or of the Humans who periodically attack their borders. We are never shown (or even told) why three bumbling fairies break ranks to protect the child of their queen's worst enemy, or why said enemy even let them into his castle in the first place. Maleficent's magical abilities are left frustratingly undefined: She can telekinetically toss people around like leaves, and make them fall asleep at will, yet falls back on physical combat on at least two occasions. She can levitate objects and people, and change one creature into another, yet never uses these ability on herself - even when it would be incredibly useful.And why, oh why, is the forest she lives in called ""The Moors""?The pity is, there's actually a lot of good stuff buried in this movie. There are some interesting revisions of the old story, nothing is dull, the main character is - despite everything - engaging and visually striking, (actually, visuals in general are another area where the movie does pretty well) and there's a wonderfully refreshing twist on one of the best-known fairytale scenes in history. There's nothing too violent or frightening for a young audience, yet little that feels overtly 'kiddie'. It's precisely because the movie has so much going for it that its shortcomings are so frustrating. It's not terrible, but it could have been really good.",Maleficent
331,xylophone59,Was happy to see it twice in a week at the cinema.,7,20 June 2014,"I saw it twice because here in the Philippines I can afford it and because my wife missed it the first time. Angelina of course was excellent. I liked the acting of the fairies who were looking after the cursed princess. By coincidence I was reading Shakespeare's Midsummers Nights Dream the same week and there were parallels. I guess one would never say the dialogue was as good but that would be unfair. I enjoyed the non-American accents. Angelina's English accent was good. As a non American I can tell you that a lot of American actors are not good at disguising their natural accents. I was impressed she could do it at all (like Meryl Streep even gets the difference between an Australian accent and a New Zealand accent); Angelina is not quite as good as Meryl but I thought she did well. I liked it when she called stuff out in an imperious voice; the girl can act. She is very charismatic as we all know and I wonder why she ever wasted her talents on drivel like Mr and Mrs Smith. She was the standout in the movie as you would expect. The special effects were very good. Perhaps they reverted a little too often to the shots of the cottage and the castle. I thought the children actors at the start did very well indeed. I would have liked more of the brighter scenes to overcome the overwhelming impressions of darkness. The second time I saw it, it seemed a lot shorter. The pathos was good in the relationship between the two major female characters. The wings on Maleficent the child at the start were very impressive and I enjoyed the dreamlike special effects as they were somehow believable. Not a movie where you exit going ""wow"" but you do come out well entertained and feeling you got good value for your money. I was happy to see it twice.",Maleficent

Angelina Jolie's British accent was ""ok"" and she brings a very half-assed performance to one of Disney's most iconic antagonists. The Fanning sister playing Aurora was awful, she was way too over the top and whimsical, nothing was special about her and nothing seemed special about her and she always looked high. The king was awful, I couldn't here anything over his accent and I didn't understand his story arc, he just turns crazy.And then there where the fairies. Oh God. The writers must have really not liked the fairies in the original films because they are just the biggest idiots you will ever see in a film, so stupid that its actually kind of insulting.The CGI is bad, really really bad. It would have passed maybye in 2002 but when you look at today and consider that Disney was behind this film (meaning it must have had at least a decent budget) it does not hold up today.The film's only saving grace is that Jolie looks cool as Malificent.

333,ace_nair,The Other Story,7,23 November 2014,"Most of us know the story of the Disney version of the Brothers Grimm/Charles Pereault story 'Sleeping Beauty'. The evil witch who cast the spell on the princess Aurora (referred to as Sleeping Beauty) is Maleficent and is supposedly done away with in the Disney story.However, Disney decided that the story could use a different perspective and offered us a version of the events from the witch's point of view. Angeline Jolie in her first movie in 4 years plays the dark fairy Maleficent and the story develops on how her estranged friendship with the neighboring prince turns her from a fairy (pure heart) to a so called witch (heart of stone). Some of the original plots remain in the story but what is interesting here is the expansion of Maleficent's world and how she changes with time. The portrayal by the various actors playing Aurora comes off well and not very cheesy as in the case with these kinds of movies. The animation and special effects are very slick and blend well in the proceedings.Jolie does an exceptionally great job as the tortured fairy and this role looks like it has been waiting in the wings for her. I can't think of any of the modern actress who could have done this role any better. Elle Fanning as Aurora brings in a deep sense of innocence to her character. Sharlto Copley on the other hand looked a bit out of place in the film. Brenton Thwaites who plays the prince who supposedly has to wake the sleeping princess from her curse looked like he dropped in from 1600s. Apart from these 4 characters, we have 3 fairies, Sam Riley as Maleficent's sidekick and some animated troll like creatures who contribute to the proceedings.This is an interesting movie for adults and kids alike.",Maleficent
334,pux420,Changed my life.,10,24 October 2015,"I laughed, I cried.No good place to start here. why its groundbreaking? first of all the 2 worlds the mores and the land of the filthy humans. it perfectly personifies greedy American capitalism but in a cool medieval setting. and the fairies are good hippies.if i could sum up the movie in 1 word it would be love. I've always enjoyed fantasy stories by women more than men. this movie is definitely very feminist but in a good way. every single male character is portrayed as a bumbling moron.what really puts this film over the top tho is Angelina and her costume. my gad she just looked spot on and the special effects compliment her appearance even more. this fairy tale doesn't quite follow traditional formula. some dislike this, i don't i actually cried.I've heard rumours of a sequel, but honestly they set the bar much too high on this first film. by far the best fantasy movie every made.",Maleficent

This film has been out for years and I've only just watched it and I feel ashamed I hadn't bothered sooner!-The Screenplay
-The Cast
-The 'From a Different Angle' Story
-The Shock KissAbsolutely brilliant! I can't fault it!
In that case it really should be a 10...........my only struggle was the fact I've rated Avengers: Endgame a 10 and for that reason I cannot justify any higher and I'm sorry haha
Giving this film a 9 though, in my view of films, is basically a perfect score for me! So it's all positive!!P.s. I have noticed most reviews are pretty good, and the ones that aren't, seem to be people taking it WAY too seriously! 😂😂 ignore them please. It's fantastic I promise. #NoSpoilersHere",Maleficent
338,h-80434,It's a good adaptation,8,18 March 2020,"Although the animation version has been greatly changed from Aurora's perspective to maleficent's, the story is still very good. Maleficent's characters are good, but Aurora's father is bad. By the way, Angelina Jolie is so beautiful.",Maleficent
339,Emberweave,Linda Woolverton is no Angela Carter,1,16 June 2014,"I've always felt Angelina Jolie was a walking, talking cartoon character, so her casting was well done. She was physically right for Maleficent. I'm still not completely sure they used prosthetics on her cheekbones. At times she made me think of the movie ""The Hunger."" I looked forward to enjoying this movie very much and was greatly disappointed.The entire story is weak. I studied fairy tales in grad school and the archetypes have all been watered down to the point they are no longer dynamic and effective. Instead they merely serve to accentuate how weak and poorly constructed the story is. I was surprised the movie was only about 90 minutes as it felt like over two hours. Despite being a ""modern"" move, sexism is rampant in all the portrayals, so there is equality in the sense that both male and female stereotypes are awful. The boards are full of arguments about them, so I won't bother to list any here. There was a feeling of ""Sleeping Beauty meets Fatal Attraction"" and also, because of the way the voice-over narration by the adult Aurora was done, a feeling of ""Sleeping Beauty meets Call the Midwife."" Nothing felt original. Even the battle scenes seemed like ""Lord of the Rings Lite"".On a positive note, the fairy forest was beautifully realized and truly gorgeous.However, as CGI technology rapidly progresses, it seems like acting styles are totally regressing back to the Delsarte method of fixed poses and expressions: Here is Maleficent looking pensive, here she is contemplative, here she is vengefully triumphant, etc. It's like all these young male actors who continue to mistake grinding their teeth to flex their jaw muscles for actual acting: here's the hero looking determined. Or does he have a seed stuck in his molars? If that passes for acting, my horse should be a star. No one gives a very good performance in this movie. Most of the blame is on the writing because there is little for the actors to work with, yet none of the actors seem to be trying very hard to rise above the material either. Stefan is bland and weak and boring; the three fairies are just buffoons (and their CGI is so creepy and fake looking they would've done better just shrinking the three actresses down to scale); the prince is nothing but an ineffectual pretty boy; Aurora, instead of coming off as happy, care-free and innocent, comes across as lobotomized; and the raven in human form looks like a cross between Eddie Munster and what Michael Jackson would've turned into had he lived, (Why the open shirt to the waist? A raven doesn't have a white belly, so it's not representative of the bird).The late British writer, Angela Carter, wrote a book called ""The Bloody Chamber"" which gives a radical feminist take on classic fairy tales. Over thirty years later, her book is still controversial, but at least it's interesting. Linda Woolverton fails miserably in her attempt to take up Carter's mantel. The characters are all too wishy-washy for a proper fairy tale and the story itself is so poorly constructed and developed that the logical flaws in the story become all too apparent.Disney is now obviously done with creative story telling and is blatantly going for their target audience of uncritical eight year old girls who will buy all the dolls and dresses for this movie. It's not even worth buying or renting on DVD.",Maleficent
340,stephen-435-741964,Rated M ... for Morons,1,8 December 2018,"After you suffer through the first 15 mins of sugar sweet Disneyfication, you are teased with a change of direction that suggests this might actually be an adult tale of substance.There's a great fight scene, a moment of reunification, and then a fairly blunt message - you loved a man and he ran off to pursue his own ambitions ... that's when you should have woken up to yourself honey and moved on. But you accepted him back and he drugged you and physically violated you. Moral of the story - men who love you aren't to be trusted if they come crawling back.Now I like that message, there's truth in it. After the physical violation we should have seen immediate, harsh, magic enriched vengeance. But instead we get a thinly veneered, alternative Maleficent/Sleeping Beauty story that's drawn out by pointless attempts at slapstick fairy humour, and more coatings of Disney sugar.Eventually Aurora turns 16 and the tale plays out predictably. And since simple twists to the tale have already been made, the clever true love twist is just as predictable as everything else in this movie.Angelina Jolie was an Executive Producer so when you are paying for your own movie I guess you are entitled to make whatever you want. But in the end this movie was pointless. A waste of Jolie's talents and a waste of the viewers time.",Maleficent
341,nikjwil,"I'm sure the ""truth"" is in the middle",8,30 September 2018,"I'm sure many reviews on here cast are in either huge fandom or huge dislike for this movie. I will always cherish Sleeping Beauty from my childhood. The animation, and the idea of being a beautiful princess caught hold of my 4 year old heart. 
I would've loved to see a retelling of Sleeping Beauty giving Aurora the depth she deserved. She was portrayed as young, innocent and adorably happy with no scars from being without her mother and having an unraveling father...yet the movie has time constraints. I think a 14th century 16-year old would be somewhere in the middle. Maybe not as grown up as the cartoon, but more adult than the live action. But she was darling. 
I ADORED prince Phillip. I am so excited for the sequel to see his character develop. I loved his line ""I wouldn't feel right kissing her.. we only met once..""
I saw this twice, and easily recognized the theme of consent, and the way it ravages even the strongest woman. But it's not overt and it can be interpreted as only what is shown on the surface. That's what is applaudable. The viewer can see what they want. 
I saw no man-bashing...I saw war and I saw two essential, good and main characters portrayed by men. 
I was sad by how evil Stephan was made out to be.. but he was driven by fear and power.. I mean, it was the Middle Ages, I felt like he was probably the most realistic out of all the characters. The fear and power driving him to madness seemed very Game of Thrones. 
The three good fairies taking care of the baby about breaks my heart. I prefer their cartoon versions so much more! ""2 eggs.. fold in gently."" 
""It's got to have a hole in the bottom! That's for the feet to go through."" 
Great movie, though. Jolie of course, is made to be Maleficent.",Maleficent
342,AntonFokker,Absolutely nothing from what I expected (in a good way),5,31 May 2014,"At the moment that I wrote this review I have just seen the movie. So this is an first impression review.I am, like most people, a fan of the original 1959 Disney classic 'Sleeping Beauty', and consider Maleficent as one of the most evil villains ever created by Disney. So I have no idea what to expect of this film with Angelina Jolie playing the title character. In the end, it was an enjoyable movie.As the plot of the movie, they changed Maleficents personality from just evil, to misunderstood, what is very interesting to me (you won't see the story of the original 1959 movie, only small scenes and the' once upon a dream' song at the end credits). She was in her childhood a good fairy, but was later betrayed by her lover, the later king Stefan (the real bad guy in this movie), who had stolen her wings in order to be king. She is slowly chancing into the villain we know from the first movie, seeking revenge to king Stefan and finds her crow (now a human character) later in the process. We later see an recreation of the scene in the original movie when Maleficent cursed the young Aurora.Let's talk about the best thing in this movie: Angelina Jolie playing the title character. She just is Maleficent. In the scene in which she cursed the young princes, it was like she came straight from the original movie, she even has the same creepy laugh.King Stefan was also different from the original, as the person who was the reason why Maleficent cursed his daughter. In this movie you see him becoming obsessed by Maleficent, what is turning him insane. That is what would happen to someone after 16 years of fear, that is something what was missing in the original movie.But this movie is not without it's flaws. The actress who plays Aurora is pretty bland. The three fairy's, the second best thing in the 1959 movie, are nothing from what they are in the original. And they misused prince Phillip in this movie. One thing I was really disappointed by was that Maleficent herself didn't turn into a dragon, instead her crow became one.In total, it is a good movie, but the original 1959 movie is more superior to this film. I recommend fans of the original to watch this movie, but they must not expect the original story. It is not even close to that.",Maleficent

Would been interesting to see more backstory.But sadly it fails three good faires are nothing but idiots who doesn't care for aurora who care about saving their own skins. Prince Philip this time around he has zero personality compare to original he bearly appeared.The main villain is worst with zero motivation I dont recommend watching this disney just go back making animation these live actions remakes getting less creatively.,Maleficent

346,lekavalio,all about Angelina,8,10 June 2014,"I was sceptical about this new Disney film being somewhat frustrated with the recent trend of taking classical tales and distorting them beyond recognition. I was however quite smitten with the trailer and decided to watch it anyway.I am glad I did. It was a very pleasant experience from start to end. The revisionist approach to the classical fairy tale of sleeping beauty shifts the focus from the fair maiden to the evil-doer (as the name states) witch (in this case a harpy looking, horned fairy). While I have a few gripes with the way this change was executed, the overall result was very good and convincing and the reasoning used makes perfect sense.The film is rather the visual feast with many effects, flights through beautiful scenery, magical creatures and an impressive palette of colours but the most stunning element has to be Angelina Jolie herself. Maleficent could be THE best role of her up to date career that fully showcases her natural looks as well as her acting skills. She does an excellent job at portraying the dual nature of Maleficent, a character torn between good and evil, love and revenge. For all the action this film has to offer, the best scenes are Angelina's close ups, where her nocturnal sensuality fills the screen and one can get lost in the battle between shadow and light that takes part around those magnetic eyes. During those scenes I was reminded of a charm that directors knew how to capture from old Hollywood divas and contemporary films seem to be missing. I am talking about that Lauren Bacall, Greta Garbo, Kathleen Turner type of charm, that look that lets the viewer project all their desires and fantasies on that face on the screen, and then they carry that image with them wherever they go. Maleficent is a film with a sturdy plot but in reality structured around Angelina Jolie and as such there are points where it is unbalanced and a bit unfair to the other characters. The king, the prince, the crow and Aurora as well as all the secondary or tertiary magical creatures that inhabited those magical lands were mere sketches, occupying only the margins of what was essentially Maleficent's/Angelina's huge portrait. Because of that there where several scenes that felt like a grand illusion rather than an interaction between characters, as if the central character (usually Maleficent) was tripping. In some parts of the film the mechanism of a narrator is employed to cover the shortcomings in character development and bridge the gaps in plot.Even with those imperfections though the movie is very good and a worthy addition to the fantasy/fairy tale genre. A director's cut with some extra scenes dedicated on secondary characters would be perfect!",Maleficent
347,evan-pahl,Well well...,3,6 October 2020,"This is a fresh take on a classic Disney story and it's villain, but that's about where the praise ends.
It's hard to imagine how such a pedestrian effort could have been put into this movie on all accounts from director to make-up; at some point you would have to think, ""Someone had to have realized what was going wrong and said 'stop it!'"" This movie should had so much potential but is just a train wreck.
Its script and writing seemed incredibly lazy for having easy source material to build from. It feels empty and adds nothing but an orgin story and back story that just is low quality filler. This movie should have been PG-13 and faced an identity crisis being marketed for the younger audience.
Angelina Jolie should have been phenomenal in the main role, but her acting is so painstakingly two-dimensional one would almost think she awasn't trying. And it seems it wore off on every actor that played a part in it. At times it felt like watching a poor theater production, with is no gusto behind any acting. This movie is cringy to watch for most of its run time, and won't be remembered by its acting.
CGI is absolutely garbage in action sequences, and creatures made with CGI creates eye sores and nightmares, not because the story is scary, but because they look like they belong in a Guiermo del Torro movie before a Disney movie.
Among how terrible the prosthetic cheeks looked, how bad the lighting on acting stages was, this movie had no sound to it
I'll need to give some slack to Robert Stromberg because it was his directoral debut, but I'm not really sure what he was going for. He should stick to production designer jobs. This movie should have been a cakewalk for a him but he botched it.",Maleficent
348,RTTerry,"Stunning to watch, but misses the mark",6,10 June 2014,"Briefly – this is one of the more visually stunning movies to watch. The graphics and CGI scenes are remarkable, but the storyline falls short and tends to stumble over itself too many times throughout the plot.I don't understand why it is that Hollywood, or perhaps it's Disney, that seems so intent on retelling stories and twisting the plot around. Villains in movies are meant to be villains – leave them as such and please stop trying to re-cast them as somewhat good or simply shaded characters to feel better about yourself, and them. If you want to put the evil-doers in a 'good' light – then come up with a whole new original tale! In the case of re-telling Sleeping Beauty, Maleficent starts out as such a promising film, and then decides to make sudden changes, for no apparent reason. The plot ends up becoming too confusing, frustrating and much to 'wait a second...!!!!'Had Disneystuck to the original storyline – which we were all waiting to see – oh how wonderful this film could've been! What's next  suddenly Disney is going to make the wicked stepmother in Cinderella the true 'good-fairy', and Cinderella is now the spoiled brat?

The story is definitely for family, it's a story about love from a pure-heart- turned-to-evil fairy to a princess who she think as her own child.. An interesting character comes from Diaval, with a strong and lovely performance from Elle Fanning as Aurora, while Sharlto Copley failed to shine in this movie with a wrong casting for Philips' character since they didn't cast a handsome boy as a prince but they cast One Direction's personnel (I'm just kidding)..

What should have been an origin story turned into a total watering down and ""reimagining"" of the Sleeping Beauty story. The writers took Maleficent and turned a powerful sorcerous into a watered down fairy who was betrayed and bitter. She puts the curse on Aurora as revenge, but ends up being a silent guardian of the child? Developed a motherly love for her? That is not the story! I know true loves kiss from a handsome prince is not in vogue right now, that it's all about girl power and the power of love between ""sisters"", but that's not what this fairy tale is supposed to be about.Maleficent is supposed to be bad.

351,thimage,Where has the story gone?,3,31 May 2014,"I saw the trailer, expecting this to be an extraordinary movie. Angelina Jolie's looks is perfect for the part. The effects promised to be nothing short of awesome and the glimpse at the dragon woke up delightful memories of fear from the day I saw the original cartoon movie with my mom a long time ago. I bought the tickets to see it in 3D with my daughters and I could anticipate the atmosphere of malevolence from the dark Maleficent. Then it all changed. In the name of ""doing something different"" and to ""surprise the audience"", the screenplay writers threw a wonderfully balanced story out the window, and decided to make a nonsensical parody instead. Who do they think they are? to second guess writers that have thrilled whole generations of people and produce this garbage in the name of the box office? Not only did they alter the essence of the story, but they made a total confusion out of the message of good versus evil. -""what?""... ""bad is good and good is bad?""... ""or is it good sometimes and bad in others?""... What will the kids think? Do the screenplay writers really expect that the kids will readily understand how despair and betrayal can turn someone into a vengeful person? Does it even have a place in this story? Of course not! Kids may need to be taught reality in real life, but when they are told a story taking place in an imaginary world, they expect something straightforward so that a message stands clearly out. The only good thing that can come out of this is that someone, somewhere, makes a remix of this movie the way it should be done, filling the blanks with the original cartoon masterpiece. Shame on you Disney studios. Watch ""Snow White and the hunter"", and learn how a classic story should be told... and especially: how far it can be altered without losing its essence.",Maleficent

353,pratikshya-mishra72,Beautiful retelling of the fairy tale 'Sleeping Beauty'.,9,28 January 2015,"It focuses on the villain's back story- the black fairy, Maleficent. Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future. Every antagonist has a back story, as no one is evil without reason. She's the hero and she's the villain of this tale. I just loved this perspective. The entire idea of 'true love' as shown in the movie is just so befitting. We find it where we least expect it. Loved the movie.Maleficent was a fairy, enchantingly beautiful. She had big wings, strong and powerful. They took her far above the clouds, against the winds, beyond her land. She was betrayed by the king she loved, who stole her wings, leaving her weak and in pain. Consumed by anger, hatred, and revenge, she cursed his baby daughter an irreversible fate that no force in the world can break except true love's kiss.Aurora grew up gracefully and lovingly under the watchful eyes of Maleficent. She thought her to be her fairy godmother. Maleficent was curious, why was she so drawn to the young girl, her enemy's daughter. Aurora was what was left of Maleficent's malevolent heart. Her dark self showed the warmth and care only around Aurora. I just loved the equation Aurora shared with Maleficent, unaware of the curse that she had cast upon her. Maleficent's futile try to break her own curse and save Aurora was heart wrenching. The climax and the ending here was far better than the original version of 'Sleeping Beauty'.Angelina Jolie's acting is amazing, breathtaking, magnificent and spectacular. I loved her character. She portrayed such depth with a mask-like straight face, that's worthy of applaud. I liked her get up, especially those horns. They did add a lot of strength and might to her character. I liked the narrator, the voice behind the scenes, who explained the passage of time and changing of seasons. I can see this movie again and again.

Just make a PG13 or R rated film for adults if you want to make these emo-dark violent kids movies.The distracting discount Michael Bay King AKA Sharlto Copley (who is actually a great actor in most films) is not even sleep walking or phoning in this movie, he acts as if he does not even remember how to act or that a camera is rolling and that he is being paid MILLIONS of dollars to do the simple task of reciting words written on a page for him, which is his profession. He is terrible and it is offensive how terrible his performance is knowing that he CAN in fact act, so this recent trend of talented celebrities *AHEM, BRUCE WILLIS...HARRISON FORD...ANTHONY HOPKINS...DE NIRO...PACINO ETC -- Need to either retire with their gobs of money and accomplishments or start doing what they are paid very well to do and ACT for jebus sake.Where did the CGI budget go? This looks worse than a SCI FI Channel show. It looks worse than the BIBLE series on History Channel, and at least that used bad CGI only for establishing shots. The intro to this film looks like a failed PIXAR studios test short from the 1980s or something...why are they charging us 10 dollars to see something they cannot afford to produce better than an old episode of Flash Gordan? Insult to injury.And this is PG and people across the globe are going to think it is child friendly. Well..not really. Is child abuse funny? Women getting smacked around by men? Battles and men on fire? A man being killed by a long fall to his death? A man asking other soldiers to bring him a woman's head? Yeah...classic Disney stories for the children.A random afterthought love interest who of course does not truly love sleeping beauty since he exchanged only, hmmm, FIVE LINES OF Cliché DIALOGUE WITH HER>>> Resulting in true love being only from adopted mommy Angelina kissing her forehead. WHAT IS THIS GARBAGE? Is this some twist of an already bizarre message? I will not even get into the absurd villain and his ridiculously inconsistent behavior which is a huge plot hole...hell I am sick of even talking about this garbage.SO MAKE UP YOUR MIND Hollywood. Is every movie dark or is it happy? Does it always either have to be Dark Knight Dark or Iron Man Irony?

355,flblueeyedboy,Mrs. Jolie at her absolute best,10,13 March 2015,"First off, the graphics and twist on the story are absolutely astonishing. Who would think to turn Maleficent into a misunderstood, scorned fairy warrior? Well, Disney, of course! Angelina is by far the best woman ever to play the role, live-action or voice-over. Elle is good as Aurora, but her sister Dakota could have possibly played it better. All in all, the story is still amazing.Sharlto Copley can play as good a bad guy as the best of them, even when he's the opposite in real life. But all other facts aside, the plot, execution, and storyline twists are out of this world, making a lovable version of Maleficent that the whole family will enjoy.

356,xx-slay-n-xx,A Half-Hearted Jaunted into Well-Trod Territory,5,27 February 2020,"By this point, we all know that there is a good and a bad way to make a children's movie. There is Wall-E (2008), and there is Boss Baby (2017). Pixar (generally) gets it right, and Illumination can hit or miss. You need to strike a balance. You want to be cute but not juvenile, funny but not slap-stick, and silly while also mature. It can be a difficult balance to get exactly right, with many films leaning too far one way or the other. When creating a film to appeal to children, you must, almost mandatorily, appeal to their parents as well, who are paying for the tickets, buying the popcorn, and driving their child to the movie theater. Maleficent seems to balance on this line in a lackadaisical fashion.Now, this raises a further question: Is Maleficent, in fact, a children's movie? The story itself is obviously much older, going all the way back to the 1300s from Giambattista Basile, who surely didn't intend it to be consumed exclusively by children (hence the casual mentions of sleep-assault (though perhaps that's what children listened to in the 1300s, who am I to say)). The 1959 version has it's elements of mild horror, but overall it would be suitable for most kids, as won't wrack the brains of any adults. The 2014 version, told from the antagonists perspective, maintains that style, and with the PG rating and lack of any blood or curse words, you wouldn't be wrong to take your niece and nephew to see it on the big screen. In my view, this movie appeals largely to children, thus making it a kids movie.So, where does it go wrong? Let's start with the plot line, and the main problem. Unless you've been under a rock for the past 700 years, no spoiler tags should be necessary. The back-stabbing king tricks Maleficent, steals her wings and is rewarded with the throne. Maleficent gets her revenge by cursing his first born, whereupon the lovely young Aurora falls into an unbreakable coma on her 16th birthday, only to be undone by the True Love's Kiss™. In the original story, and in the 1959 animation, this is a problem. In this movie (this is the part where the real spoilers begin), it may as well have not happened at all. It was infuriating to watch the build up of the past 70 minutes culminate in the most basic of triviality. Aurora predictably pricks her finger and falls into her deep sleep, and is there for maybe one hour? Two tops? What was the point? Shortly after falling into her sleep, she is awakened, not by a lovely prince this time, but by the kiss of Maleficent, who has now begun to love Aurora as her own daughter after secretly taking care of her in the magical forest.This reversal of the narrative delivers us two cliches that are as pandering as you can be. Firstly, the person who caused the problem in the first place is the one to solve the problem (see Megamind (2010), Moana (2016), Frozen (2013)). Secondly, perhaps you would call it a reverse-cliche, the true love comes not from a romantic partner, but from familial bonds (again, see Frozen). I guess Disney felt it was their duty to try to disrupt the hegemony of handsome princes by using the same exact major plot point in movies just 6 months apart from one another.These are the types of plot points that children do not care about, or do not understand, but that parents pick up on and leaves them scratching their heads. Of course, their are all the parents who are happy enough to just make their kids smile and leave the theater with neither an opinion nor a memory of what they just watched, but if apathy is the best we can hope for from the adult audience then we aren't really trying very hard. Everyone knows the story of Sleeping Beauty, and everyone knows that the deep-sleep is coming, and to just have some hand-waving to make it disappear makes the whole movie leading up to it seem pointless. This, along with some other rather glaring plot holes and a generally predictable journey makes the story unengaging and boring.The acting is another thing that we need to grapple with here. If one-dimensionality is flat and boring, then the other side of the spectrum must be four-dimensionality, taking it too far. This movie has both. On one side we have Aurora (played by Elle Fanning) who might as well be a mannequin with how much she added to the plot, and the three dim-witted pixies, Flittle, Knotgrass and Thistlewit (played by Lesley Manville, Imelda Staunton, and Juno Temple respectively) who are our three-stooges providing us with banal slap-stick comedy. On the other side is Maleficent (played by Angelina Jolie) and Stefan (played by Sharlto Copley) who provide sometimes convincing performances that go totally off the rails in times of heated emotional moments. Something about the way Jolie screams in furious anger makes me laugh more than it does make me afraid.This movie has every element that will make a film look good on the surface. But we already knew we were going to get that. It's a Disney film, and Disney always knows how to make some acceptable, if not wonderful just with their costume design, animation and scoring. When you release ten films in a calendar year, obviously not every one of them is going to blow you out of the water, and the producers are likely more than happy when a middling film receives a small amount of press acclaim but triples its budget in the box office. And so I once again leave this film thinking, was that it? I yearn for something more because I know what is possible. For every Maleficent, there is Pirates of the Carribean or Toy Story that hits you on all the fronts and is a magical journey for those of any age.I can appreciate when a director and writer choose to take a different approach. Having a film from the point of view of the antagonist wasn't easy until recently (especially with a children's film). And shying away from the frivolous and expected love angle is better than constantly trying to drive home the cliche. However, there is a right way to do it that can leave the audience with something to remember instead of something that is simply inoffensive and easy. I'm not saying I have the magic formula. Perhaps no one does (except Steven Spielberg of course). I haven't seen the sequel yet, it's next on my list now that it's out on Blu-Ray. I don't have high hopes, but I am always happy to have my preconceptions overturned. For now I'll comfort myself with some Jack Sparrow and Mike Wazowski.",Maleficent
357,jaesqueda,Big Movie,10,7 June 2014,"The first reason for see this movie, is Angelina Jolie, but all in this movie is incredible: dressing, images, music, story, Visual effects. A different story. In this movie you found why Maleficient go to the castle, also you understand the roles of other characters. The voice of Angelina Jolie is attractive, but at the same time you feel fear about her. Most of us, knew about this story when we were children. But is fantastic watch this movie now in real action. We could talk about this movie like feminist. I watch this movie twice, and i suggest all my family go to watch it. Sincerely, I hope Disney did this with all their classic movie.",Maleficent
358,beebeedoo,What took me so long!,8,22 May 2017,"Possible spoiler......Review by Caron Hernandez: I was obsessed with Sleeping Beauty as a child, now I love this account of Malificent's story. I don't know what made me hesitant to watch this, Angelina Jolie did a fantastic job as Malificent, as did all of the actors/actresses. The portrayal of Aurora's father was a turn as far as a villain. He only had himself to blame. The ""true love's kiss"" was also unexpected. Some of the reviewers compare this to the original animated story, big mistake. You also read too much into the story. If you analyze this fairy tale in such a manner that you find it offensive, how do you enjoy movies at all? Lighten up! And remember, this isn't a remake or the story of Aurora, the Sleeping Beauty, the movie is called ""Malificent"". All in all, I would recommend this movie to friends and family.",Maleficent

A twist on the tale we all know, and I think I prefer this version. It can be a bit too dark for young children, so I would recommend 8+ due to violence. Angelina Jolie was fantastic as Maleficent. I can't imagine another actress that would do as well in the roll. Her character goes from being caring to angry to evil, but always having some sort of compassion. I would have liked to have seen more detail about the relationship between Stefan and Maleficent. I felt as if the film had to be shortened for some reason and they chose to remove that detail, which I feel could have made the movie a bit more powerful.",Maleficent
360,theicon87,'Maleficent' doesn't put you to sleep,8,12 July 2014,"I generally tend to stay away from live action films by Disney. Such films as ""Enchanted"" (2007), and the other happy-go-lucky princess stories do nothing for me. If I'm going to watch a flick of this content and material, I think it goes over easier as an animated cartoon. Real people in these stories make the cheesiness of it all really hard to swallow. But when I first caught wind of a film based on Maleficent from the 1959 animated motion picture ""Sleeping Beauty"", my eagerness shifted up and down. Upon hearing the news, I was worried as to how it would turn out. Then, I saw pictures of how Angelina Jolie looks in the role, and I wasn't so skeptical anymore as much as curious. And after opening last weekend to generally negative reviews, my hopes circled the drain. Despite what others said, I still felt the need to give this one a watch. I mean, I've waited this long to see it, just to turn around and not watch it because of what other people said? No way. And I'm glad that I thought for myself, because regardless of any negative reviews I've heard, I actually liked ""Maleficent"" more than I expected to. And I'm not being biased because of my crush on Angelina. In fact, while I think she's undeniably attractive, I haven't really liked her since ""Wanted"" (2008). But her portrayal as dark and brooding Maleficent is rather nicely played. This take on the story kinda slips through the back door, and retells you the story you already know, only in a different way and with more twists. While it's not overly complex or intricate, you've gotta remember that it's only a PG movie, and is meant to attract children over adults. In this version, we find Maleficent as much of a villain as a hero.Stefan (Sharlto Copley) is as sympathetic as he is cowardly. He's a bureaucrat who wants to gain kingship, but has to betray Maleficent by cutting off her wings. The whole first part of the movie shows you Maleficent as a child, growing up over the years as a very powerful and joyous fairy. Once betrayed and de-winged by Stefan, she becomes fueled by rage and revenge, turning her positive aura into one of darkness and sorrow. Years after Stefan becomes king, he has a newborn baby daughter named Aurora, and in midst of celebrating her birth, Maleficent crashes the party and curses Aurora so that on her sixteenth birthday she'll be put into a deep sleep that only true loves kiss can cure. However, Maleficent doesn't believe in true love, so she's essentially damning Aurora for life. Stefan, in worry for his daughter's life, sends her away with three pixies until her 16th birthday. Only thing is, these pixies have never looked after a human life before. So they're terrible parental figures, and almost starve Aurora to death because they don't know how to feed her. So Maleficent steps in and kinda sorta raises her behind the three pixies backs. In doing so, we see the good side of Maleficent that shows us she's not all bad, she's just hurting emotionally from the trauma done unto her. Once Maleficent grows close to an older Aurora (Elle Fanning), she decides she made a mistake in cursing her. When Maleficent realizes she can't take back the curse put on Aurora, it becomes a battle against the clock as Aurora's about to turn 16, and the curse will be fulfilled. So the question is, can she be saved, or does true love really not exist? Let me put it to you this way without giving away any spoilers: it's a Disney movie. So you tell me what you think the answer to that question is...In the end, ""Maleficent"" is a fun origin story. And it's one that I can see myself watching a few more times. When I have kids, I'm sure I'll have them watch it too. Even though it can be scary at times, for children especially. I'm not saying it doesn't have its flaws, and I'm not saying it's perfect by any means. But I am saying that it's fun, entertaining, and worth at least one watch.",Maleficent
361,edgeoflight,"A Poignant, Modern and Relevant Adaptation",10,28 October 2020,"Unlike the usual Disney remake, this movie has a point. It allows you to rediscover a classic story but with a much more fleshed out antagonist and a touching twist.Those who criticized the movie as feminist drivel missed the point, and I say that as a man who despises clunky feminism for the sake of feminism. The movie is not about feminism, it's about forgiveness and true love. Maleficent does not behave any better with the fairies and Aurora than her valet or the men she flings around.As for the acting, Angelina Jolie carries the film greatly. She performs her role with absolute conviction and puts her soul in it. So does Elle Fanning (Aurora) with unparalleled feistiness and freshness. The chemistry between the two is uplifting and touching.The CGI is a bit overwhelming at times but it adds to the sentimental and fantasy atmosphere of the movie.But most of all, the changes made to the original story are what makes this movie worth watching. Maleficent is no longer a one dimensional villain but a caring creature who was betrayed and attains peace and forgiveness owing to her relationship with her godchild. The evolution of this relationship born in hatred but evolving into caring and ultimately love feels moving and sincere; leading to quite a surprising finale that brings to shame the original outcome of the story. It's no longer about romantic love, it's about humane love. And this concludes my review: this film was a pleasant surprise and a fresh take on an eternal classic. Worth a watch or two!",Maleficent

364,ElPresidenteObamame,"Here we go now, entertain us...",3,15 December 2016,"This is supposed to be about sleeping beauty? That's what I felt like by the 30 minute mark. The script was an unimaginative dung heap. The executives in charge of this joke should be running a car wash not a movie studio. I'm pretty sure the costume director just went into a Parties R' Us and bought some plastic jewelry for use in this shamefully bad film. The 3D ""characters"" all looked like rejects from a digital dustbin that got gathered up and reused as filler. Yes there were some decent special effects and some okay scenes but nothing remotely memorable, except for the hilarity of its badness. Yet again Hollywood hires hacks to write, direct, and act, and then prays that the 3D studio can save another one of their farces from crumbling under the weight of its own ineptitude. It was kind of like seeing an alternate universe where Disney is a company that was started by Michael Bay and everything they ever did is reduced to a shallow spectacle.You can't really pin down what the problem with this movie is except to say that the whole thing just doesn't work. Half of it seems to come out of let field and it seems to go on forever, and do nothing, while still feeling rushed and poorly explained.There was a time when Disney meant quality, now its more of a warning label.

366,scherfcom,Nice fairy tale ... Maleficent not so evil after all,9,31 May 2014,"This is actually an excellent flick for kids teaching some core values of forgiveness, acceptance, repentance and redemption, while on the other hand it shows selfishness and greed in some (especially ""King"" Stefan) and the devastating consequences and destruction of such behavior.I think the younger Maleficent shouldn't have had horns and should not have been called ""Maleficent"" (Evil) at that point, because she was quite innocent. Even later, after the heartache and the ""hardening"" circumstances, Maleficent wasn't really that evil and displayed forgiveness, sorrow and wanting to do good. Sure, a bit of revenge, but not malicious revenge but rather from a broken heart.It's actually a kind of love story and then it also shows the reality of life that we all need and want to be loved, have friends, and want to forgive to be accepted and that it's painful to be betrayed and rejected and stabbed in the back by the people we love. It shows that some people have selfish ambitions and that in the world we're easily deceived by the spirit of the world.Angelina Jolie did a wonderful job as always and true she's in virtually every frame of this picture as the title indicates. This story deviates quite a bit from the original story, but it doesn't matter as it's more about Maleficent than the Sleeping Beauty, and this Maleficent is also different than the original story as Maleficent is even kind and has empathy which in the original story you won't find.Cinematography was also very good with the CGI effects. Casting was a bit lacking, especially for the role of Stefan, but overall it doesn't take too much away from the quality of this film. It's well worth seeing and I enjoyed it.",Maleficent

Well of course there are so many other movies that shows her brilliance but Maleficent will stand out for so many reasons. First of all the whole look of the character and then the performance, the nuisances of the character and the quirky and the wicked evil act everything just was hundred fold in effect.If you watch the movie, you will not stray anywhere from Angelina Jolie. Her screen presence is so much powerful that everything else actually fades away in comparison.Well having said lets discuss other aspects of the movie, Plot is brilliantly developed only to be enhanced with performances by the actors present including Vivienne Jolie-Pitt (Angelina's real life daughter, even if it was for 5 minutes).

No amount of visual effects or talent from Angelina Jolie can save this train wreck though, as the whole movie is nothing but a overlong, ridiculously heavy handed effort to beat the viewer over the head with a radical feminist message of hate towards all men. Maleficent is not evil at all you see. For she is female. So she is merely misunderstood and a victim of injustice.

373,DFClayton,"Evil, Greed, Love, Redemption, and Other Morals",10,15 June 2014,"It's always refreshing to see the backstory of how evil develops. In past days it was too easy to show the simplistic ""Snidely Whiplash"" versions of villains twirling their handlebar mustaches. It's even better when the villains redeems themselves. And the cherry on top is when a 53 old moviegoer can enjoy the same film among a theatre full of children albeit the crying babies. (Note to parents: don't rule out giving your bundles of joy just a very tiny bit of Night-Time Tylenol about an hour before the movie starts. They're too young to remember being there anyway, and everyone else doesn't have to hear their screeching, thanks).In the tradition of those writers who helped bring to the screen the latest versions of: Darth Vader, Dr. Baltar, and Mila Kunis's witch: Theodora, They've shown, very effectively, the complicated layers of how evil develops from otherwise good souls. Such is the case in this departure from the original sleeping beauty re-imagining. Angelina's winged Maleficent starts as a loving but aggressive protector of her home. But like two of the above mentioned characters, betrayal and heartbreak provide the catalyst of transformation from peace and love to revenge and hate. Then, to vindicate the audience from having any misplaced empathy is, the redemption. The catalyst for this is the love between Maleficent and Aurora played by Elle Fanning who adopts her as her ""Fairy God Mother."" This is quite a departure from the animated version I saw some 43 years ago which was 12 years after its 1959 release. And Angelina's version of Maleficent is equally as different from Eleanor Audley's (voiced) version. Not to disparage the original, I like this story re-told, much better. I can remember not being that impressed at 10 as I am by this latest version. Other moral lessons such as the effects of greed, ambition, fear, etc. are well taught without the unnecessarily preachy exposition. To me this makes a film experience that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. This is one the better efforts put forth by Disney. Let's hope the tradition continues with the upcoming Star Wars features.

374,PetalsAndThorns,"Fanciful, beautiful, exciting, and fun : an instant favourite!",8,16 June 2014,"With faeries, shapeshifters, enchanted forests, and Angelina Jolie being a bada** in sexy fantasy costumes with horns... what's not to love?! I was anxiously awaiting its release all year, as Maleficent has always been one of my favourite villains, and I must say, it far surpassed all of my expectations.I saw it in 3D, which was great fun... though sadly, no theatre in my area is showing it in English, so I cannot properly comment on the original scripted dialogue and the quality of voice acting from the original cast, but the French dub wasn't too bad (for a dub), and I can say that the physical language of the film is really well done; Jolie's performance, in particular, was absolutely captivating! In his directorial debut, Robert Stromberg's well-seasoned talents as a visual effects artist (90+ credits, to date, with a heavy emphasis on matte painting) were certainly put to good use. The effects nearly steal the show from Jolie, with lots of faeryland splendour and sparkle, beautiful landscapes, and adorable creatures. There's so much to see, and all of it is delightful.Much to my surprise, the story is quite different from Disney's original Sleeping Beauty (on which this film is inspired, both as a prequel and a re-telling.) Although I'm a fan of the original, I am pleased with several of the changes, including what is, in my opinion, a much more appropriate and relevant moral (particularly for young ladies.) Bravo.It remains a family film, though the story is darker than the original, and even brutal in one scene (I was not alone in gasping aloud!) One should be advised of the potential scariness for very young / sensitive viewers.The characterisation is much more sophisticated than one might expect from a typical Disney film, and certainly more so than the original 1950's animated Sleeping Beauty. I found that most of the main characters have much more dynamic personalities, as compared to their original counter-parts, and although they retain a certain archetype, no one is completely flat and mono-chromatic, and they even evolve (as real people do), throughout the course of story.Maleficent is not a musical (thankfully). The film's score isn't particularly noteworthy (aha, see what I did there?) but there is a slightly strange, though not all together unpleasant, version of Sleeping Beauty's signature song Once Upon A Dream, sung by Lana Del Rey, that plays through the credits. If you're a Del Rey fan, you'll be pleased, and if not... well... most people don't care about the credits anyway, so hopefully, you're one of them.The costumes and wardrobe, especially for Maleficent, are fantastic. I really enjoyed the re-imagined costumes for the 3 good faeries (so much fine detail!) There are a lot of winged characters in this tale (yay!) and each one is uniquely designed and detailed.I highly recommend Maleficent to anyone who loves a visually-stunning fantasy adventure and strong female leads.",Maleficent

376,Blazs91,Another attempt by Disney to keep its name in shine.,5,28 September 2014,"Multitude of mixed emotions were circulating inside me, when I got myself in a comfy chair in the cinema hall, because there was another Disney film on the list. I've read numerous laudatory reviews, so my expectations were more or less positive about the creation. But the result seem to be a bit disappointing (again).It's well-known, that the protagonist of the whole fairy tale is the long-expected-to-see"" Maleficient starring Angelina Jolie. Websites and internet blogs were excessively flooded with praising comments emphasizing that this movie is the actress' long-expected and notable return on the canvas. So many people sang odes about her magnificent performance, and the echo of the fans' colossal applause thundered through the ether.However, I do not completely agree with this! I think her performance was quite run-of-the-mill, and knowing the fact that she keeps an Oscar on the bracket, I got myself really surprised, when people point out this particular film. But really, I can understand the poor performance because throughout the whole film there wasn't really an appropriate moment when she had only a tiny spark of the chance of demonstrating her true skills. During the first third of the film we can see colossal forward jumps on the time-line of the story in short time periods, which were not really easy to follow. And the actual real-time events are painfully sluggish, and it was further enhanced by the bored voice of the narrator.When the film reaches its critical point, Jolie transforms into the thing that she has to. And that is the point when the events get a bit slower rhythm finally. It was kind of a feeling that the writer wanted to process a large-scale story thus making the movie a bit overloaded, because 1,5 hours runtime seem to be too short for this purpose.Right at the beginning of the film we get the other protagonist introduced who will be the primary source of all the further conflicts throughout the movie. BUT! I consider simply outrageous, that we haven't been given any useful information about him, exact that he is related to the original evil"" king. He fell in love with Maleficient, and movie would like to paint a picture of the true epic love and devotion at front of our eyes. But we barley get a little info about the male member of the romance, so it won't brighten up that why they love each other? We won't be able to answer this simply question. And that was the actual point, from when I couldn't take the movie seriously enough.The story left enough free room for three fairies, who were so incredibly annoying characters, that it's hard task to find adequate words to describe correctly. I don't know if the characters were originally intended to be like that, or simply the actresses played over their roles, but I'd have kicked them in the cheeks every time they appeared on the silver screen. In addition the way that the young teen girl brings to life another protagonist is incredibly stupid and far-fetched. Sorry people, I didn't have the intention to give such poor grade to this movie, but believe the disappointment hurts ME the mostThe film has some cliché either. About the half we have a guess about how it will end. This film again tries to emphasize the far over-hyped basic intrinsic human values. But this is no problem for me, seeing the fact that we facing a Disney. But the movie is constructed in such an awkward way, that after watching the whole screen-play will generate a thought in our mind: We have already seen it once"".But the movie also got some unquestionably positive attributes. Considering that 1,5 hours runtime motion picture is generously stuffed with vast amount of CGI, it could be purely classified as an animated film. However, I wasn't confused about that for a tiny moment, and it didn't dropped me out of the magical world of the movie, because the computer rendered images are undoubtedly fantastic! The imaginary is so beautiful, that occasionally I could have believed it more true and real, than some actors/actresses' far-fetched and ridiculous performance. So I bow my head before the 3D animator guys! Excellent job!Otherwise, the movie is mostly managed to be cozy, and it has the ability to enchant the audience, and pull them inside the supernatural land. So overall, the entire film is adequately entertaining, but due to the teeming poor acting and storyline inaccuracy, I only dare to classify the movie mid-range. And I feel so sorry about that! I've been hoping for a real adventure by Disney, but this time I've slightly got it.Sorry folks for depreciating the movie, but unfortunately this is the ugly truth for meThanks for spending your precious free time with reading my review! Hope you liked it!",Maleficent
377,pmullan-54285,"Wicked, but with Maleficent",9,21 June 2016,"""Maleficent""Angelina Jolie is Maleficent, but she is no longer the nasty and sophisticated demon that was considered to be one of the best villains that Disney ever made, but she is now a misunderstood fairy who had been robbed of her wings and shoved into the battle that man brought upon her. But, it turns out that, when she curses the Princess Aurora on the day of her birth, she grows to like Aurora (Played by Elle Fanning) over the 16 years that she watches her. The three fairies are considered to be too thick to look after her and so Maleficent looks after the girl and even raises her. Okay, this is one of my biggest issues with the film, couldn't there be another way around Maleficent looking after Aurora than just having the fairies be thick? Couldn't she just talk to her or look after her when the fairies let her walk around the place, like in the original? There are so many ways around this topic, but they went the silly route. Negatives aside, I quite like the film. Angelina Jolie is not an actress that I'm familiar with, but she enlightened me in this movie. She looks the part and sounds the part, but the sympathetic approach can turn some people off when the original Maleficent is taken into account. No doubt, I love the original, but the new is also very good for me to see. I guess I like both original and new. Princess Aurora is considered to be one of the worst aspects of the original Sleeping Beauty, but I have been an Aurora fan since day one.

378,nunonegro,"Not the connection with ""Sleeping Beauty"" I was expecting",6,2 January 2016,"I was thrilled to see this movie. An adaptation of a classic Disney movie, with a different point-of-view. I think this movie has 2 completely distinct parts. In the first part of the movie, it starts building character: we understand Maleficent's origins and her story. We understand her role in Moors. We understand metal hurts her.The second part of the story is where I think it starts to fall. When the Three fairies come to visit princess aurora, I felt I was traveling in time, watching that memorable scene from sleeping beauty. Even the lines were similar. But the fact than Maleficent cast a completely ""weak"" spell, in a ""sleep-like-death"", only awaken by the true loves kiss ... i think it was when I understand they didn't put the effort to make Maleficent a true villain. Even more annoying the fact that the third fairy didn't give Aurora a present; And the fairies where not in the ""correct"" order, which was a simple thing to make. By the way, the three fairies are flat characters: They don't evolve - in 16 years, they are still clumsy. In ""in Sleeping Beauty"", they make the effort to even change the name of the child. In this movie, they left a child outside and try to sleep while Aurora is crying.Moving forward in the movie, I think in the end, when Maleficent kiss is the one that awakens was a bit predictable. When they make a similar situation in Frozen, it was unexpected. Now, I was deciding who was going to wake her up: if Maleficent, or if it was Dieval. In conclusion, They made A spectacular job in the animations, in creating a story between Maleficent and King Stefan. Angelina Jolie plays her role incredibly well. However I felt disappointed because some simple things could improve the movie. As a last opinion, I want to say I was expecting a stronger connection with ""Sleeping Beauty"". I think they made it in the beginning, but in the end we don't see it.",Maleficent
379,feae-72598,True Love,8,27 July 2016,"Maleficent is one of the best beautiful and unexpected movies I've ever seen. Maleficent has really warm heart, so in this tale we can't think actions of Maleficent as just the revenge. This is unexpected content. The country where Maleficent and other strange creatures live is so maic world and the soundtrack is so nice. So, girls definitely are attracted with a view of the world. This film shows the processes of feelings like adorable and anxiety, so people who watch Maleficent can understand how people love someone. The expressions of actors have deep meanings and skill, so I enjoy watching Maleficent. The time watch this film will be something special, so I recommend this heart warming movie.",Maleficent
380,Thehagengnome,it's another Disney movie.,7,4 June 2014,"this is another one of those movies where you know what's gonna happen most of the time. but this time i actually got surprised on some specific occasions, which was a breath of fresh air, in my opinion. when you sit down and prepare to watch a Disney movie, you have certain expectations about how the movie is going to be. when i sat down to watch this movie, i had those same expectations from Disney. but i was pleasantly surprised when Disney for once actually did something different with the story. the plot was intriguing enough, i did like the good/evil concept that was going on through the movie. but i have to say, Angelina Jolie is definitely the highlight of this movie. she outplays everyone else, without doubt. i like the new take on the ""sleeping beauty"" story. i think they pulled of the concept decently well. but then again, you have that predictable world that Disney loves to create, and that may be fine for all the kids, but i just want something more original from Disney. i know that that's the Disney trademark, but i don't enjoy it that much. but in this movie, Disney did go towards a more original storyline, which is really positive.overall, this movie is another one of those predictable Disney movies, but with some new additions. so if you have a kid, then i think he will like this movie a lot, it's a great ""family"" movie. but for people like me,who likes creativity form movies (even Disney) are most likely going to find this movie to be averagely good, with some goodies along the way.hope you found this review helpful :)",Maleficent
381,brycecab,"""Fairy"" satisfying and pleasing surprise!!",9,22 November 2014,"Sleeping Beauty, known as one of the greatest Disney classics ever, was one of my favorite Disney classics as a child. I remember glimpses of my childhood. I remember watching it with my aunt while my parents were at work. I liked it. The characters, the cinematography, the theme, the music, and most importantly the villain. The character, Maleficent, was very interesting to me when I was a child. As a kid, I thought that she was just doing what bad guys do those days, do something evil without any valid reason. Years passed by and I heard that there was going to be a film based and focusing on Maleficent herself. I was very interested with the concept of the summary. Maleficent, a character with great power, was getting her own live-action film. When I saw the trailers, I was fairly satisfied.Robert Stromberg, the director of this film, did an amazing job bringing Maleficent to life. I liked the way the movie was presented. It gave a somewhat Tim Burton feel to it when watching the trailers but I was quite amazed with what it was. The CGI was very pleasing and satisfying. The cast was exceptionally good. Angelina Jolie as Maleficent was the perfect role for the actress after her break. It made her comeback seem very different. Elle Fanning was also a very pleasing Princess Aurora. With Sharlto Copley I wouldn't say his performance was great but fairly good enough. I am not sure if this is considered a spoiler or whatever but I loved the twist in this fairytale. The story and history between Maleficent and Stefan was well- thought out.Overall, a satisfying fantasy based around true love with an incredible twist.",Maleficent

I give this three stars maimly because of my favorite actress is in it and as always does a great job, and that would be Imelda Staunton. Other than this, I would rate this movie but one star. I was looking forward to a fresh interpretation of the Bible story, instead was treated to this. I like well told stories but this should have been returned to the writer and put the money to better use. Sorry Mrs. Pitt it at least appeared the you were trying. Thanks, but I will not rent this one and waste more money. The producers spent a fortune on this and they will get their money back before its all over, but they should look at Disney classics and even movies that have been churned out after Disney's demise at a fraction of the cost and have been very successful, from ""Toy Story"" miniseries to the Lion King remake.""

383,williamzoran,I saw it twice this evening.,10,29 May 2014,Needless to say I loved it. I totally bought Maleficent's journey and one scene where you feel her loss and pain I was a blubbering mess. The first twenty minutes of the film I could put on auto repeat and just watch over and over. Really beautiful. The twist on the tale made a lot of sense. Jolie is both beautiful and amazingly talented.Likewise Elle Fanning. Fanning reminds me a little of Leonardo DiCaprio in that DiCaprio always looks too young to bring the gravitas his roles demand and yet he never fails to disappoint. Elle will be over time one of the great actresses imo. I'm going to become addicted to this.,Maleficent

I was mesmerized from the very first moments and I could no longer let go. I love fairy tales and the different ways that they can be interpreted, including the back stories the characters might have. So, when I first heard of Maleficent, I had very high expectations. I must say, the movie and the acting have exceeded all that I've been expecting. Maleficent is a very complex character and I've been overjoyed to see her truly come alive in the big screen. A. Jolie is perfect for the role and I cannot imagine anyone else doing as a great job as she has. I laughed and I cried throughout the entire movie. I was truly touched by the story of Maleficent, the idea behind it, the drive and the priceless acting. It is a beautiful rendition of the classic tale, taken from a completely different angle. While I would not recommend it to the youngest of us due to the general concept and the cruelty (albeit a very truthful depiction of human nature, still slightly harsh to watch), I am positive everyone else will enjoy this original version of Sleeping Beauty and will be captivated by the magnificent acting of A. Jolie as well as other actors right to the very end.",Maleficent
385,Natenbox62,"Not bad but not great either, it was okay",4,16 November 2014,"(Aug 19, 2016): This was my old review of Maleficent, I made this review back when I used to make a butt load of reviews for this site (2014). Looking back at it now, this was by far the worst review I've ever done during that time. As for my honest opinion on the film itself,I don't like it. My current score for it is a 4/10.(old review, Nov. 17, 2014): I finally saw it after renting it at Redbox, and all that buzz everyone had talked about, the ads playing so much, and making a lot of money, I was pretty much ready to see it on my Blu-Ray player. All I'm gonna say is this.....it was okay. Not great but good enough for a rental.The pros:Angelina Jolie's performance as the titular character, Maleficent (the most well known villain in Disney history) was perfect. She knows on what she's doing, every spoken delivery is spot on, and does feel like she was born to play as a live action version of Maleficent. The effects look great, action scenes were good enough. The tone is fine where it needs to be, and there were some changes from Sleeping Beauty that were okay enough for me. And the other cast were decent for the most part.Now, the cons:The biggest problem that I have with it really is just that how mashes with Sleeping Beauty and this one in a not so perfect way. It does kinda distracted me sometimes where they mentioned some stuff here from the 1959 Disney animated film that it supposed to have a twist on. The fairies were annoying. I mean like Jar Jar Binks annoying. Sharlto Copley did kinda felt phoned in here. And that the misleading marketing did kinda ruined the film for me. It was marketed to be like a dark version of Sleeping Beauty, but it's not. Stuff like that did ruined my experience.Even with those big problems that I have with it, the movie is still entertaining regardless of its flaws. It might not be as good as everyone says it is but I think it's a good rental movie for your day. It might be on Netflix at some day, who knows, you might like it more than I do. And I think that's about it really. It was okay.6/10",Maleficent
386,sethfan,Excellent re-imagining,9,1 June 2014,"As a huge fan of the original Sleeping Beauty I really needed this to meet my expectations...and it did not disappoint! It stumbles to get going, but once Jolie enters it becomes a gripping fairytale adventure! The scene where Maleficent places the curse on Aurora is almost lifted right out of the original. After that though, it becomes its own version. Don't worry, all of the original ""pieces"" are there, but re-sewn into a different story quilt. It's fun to pick out the 1959 elements and see how they are re-imagined here. I always wondered how Maleficent communicated with her raven...that's explained here. Neat. The interaction between Aurora and Maleficent is a brilliant plot device. It allows for a deeper storyline and character development. Personally I don't think Elle Fanning is well suited as Aurora. She isn't strong enough and, frankly, not pretty enough. But Angelina Jolie is spot on! She captures all the nuances and conflicting emotions of Maleficent and creates a much more complex character. Over all, what they did to Sleeping Beauty here works so much better than how they re-imagined Alice in Wonderland a few years back. One thing...for a PG rating it's quite dark and violent. Granted it's fantasy violence but still, it should be PG13.",Maleficent

389,Apologi,Steaming pile of feminist propaganda,4,7 February 2016,"In this Disney movie men are burned alive, used as slingshots, bashed, blown, stomped by giant trees and in general subjected to all kind of cruelty. This is fun, however, as all men are evil, albeit for two wimpy exceptions (of which one is actually a crow).One should never trust men. Men are incapable of true love. According to this movie the only reason men approach women is to use them as a stepping stone to benefits. Men are greedy thieves, who lust for possession precious stones and valuables, whereas women merely admire their beauty in the nature. (How did I laugh at this vision, as in real life it is usually women, who use their sexuality on men to get glittery things).In this movie there is no positive portrayal of male-female relationships or family life. In the first such relationship the man cuts off the fairy's wings (implied rape). In the second relationship (king Stefan and her queen) the queen is a passive background figure given only one scene. In the third one the prince is a wimp bereft of personality, so it remains for Maleficent to save the day (and kill the evil king). Princess Aurora is raised by three fairies and the ever-guarding Maleficent. Maleficent's parents are dead. And the princess's will be soon, too, by Maleficent. Women don't need men as parental figures, as men can only violate women. True love can be given to a young girl only by a strong, latex-clad, female authority. Yes: you can see what I am aiming at: Maleficient comes close to a lesbian fantasy. The single point where a man (who is evil) is required, is to give seed. After that the three fairy women and the strong female (who replaces the mother that lives with an evil man in an evil traditional marriage) will take care of the upbringing of young Aurora, to make sure she has no contact with men.Some might consider their seclusion a stupid decision, as after all a true love's kiss is what is required to wake Aurora from inevitable doom. One could think that it would be good for Aurora to live among other youth of her age, so that there would at least be the chance of forming an equal and mutually respectful, loving relationship with a good young man. But as we now know and as the movie has taught us: there are no loving, equal and mutually respectful relationships between men and women (as all men are evil). Therefore young women must be protected from men and taught to hate them, so that there is no possibility of an evil man breaking a woman's heart. Fortunately, however, true love can be found between the latex-clad horny female and the young girl. This love is so natural, that despite Maleficient being a scary dark horned creature who actually cursed the little child, Aurora could not but love her and pursue her company already as an infant. Their love story is as inevitable and as magical as if it were written in the stars.So, Maleficient should be good material for those parents who wish to prepare their girls for their older female lover already at an early age. For others... well, my 8 year old boy was so annoyed with the portrayal of men as evil as well as an evil creature being made good (he has seen Sleeping Beauty), that he did not bother to watch the movie to the end.I could have written a lot also from the perspective how an interesting Disney villain is destroyed in the movie, but others have written a lot about that. It would perhaps indeed be wise (though probably beyond their wisdom) for the script writers to ask, why the title character of the movie is named ""Maleficient"", i.e. in Latin: evil-doer; one who does evil, if she actually is not evil, or does not begin as evil. What kind of parent would name one's child evil-doer? Except, if malice was indeed somehow respected and natural within that species or culture? Could we next get some kind of Disney film portraying Satan as a hero - who inexplicably just happens to be named Satan? Or perhaps a remodeling of Star Wars to tell how Darth Vader is actually a nice guy, whose peaceful and beautiful Empire full of magical creatures is attacked by the evil Rebels that wish to rob its riches? Please, Disney..? I can see endless possibilities with this approach. Perhaps give us the evil Allied vs. benevolent Nazis? Or Snow White, the seven She-Dwarfs and the evil King?",Maleficent
390,Stachehunter-857-73111,The Deconstruction of Maleficent,2,19 June 2014,"So, Disney ambushes Gregory Maguire, the author of ""Wicked"" in this tepid retelling of ""Sleeping Beauty"" and the unnecessary explanation for the actions of the exquisite villain we love to hate, Maleficent.Maguire had a brilliant idea once upon a time, his speculation about a wicked woman's progression towards very bad behavior and the reasons behind that transformation changed fairy tales forever. Maguire caught lightening in a bottle, using complex characters and situations to explain a life that ended with a bucket of water. ""Wicked"" had everything that ""Maleficent"" does not: compelling characters and a sturdy plot which gave the characters room to move and grow. ""Maleficent"" is the Dollar General version of ""Wicked"". For it's tedious running time of 90-some minutes, it plods along throwing 200 million dollars of CGI imagery at you, which is evidently supposed to divert you from noticing the plot holes and jaw-droppingly abysmal dialog. It feels padded out in many places. It's stingy in the extreme and comes across like a puppy that's peed on the carpet. You can't hate a puppy, all cuteness and earnest contrition for the wet spot. ""Maleficent"" wants your love so badly it's willing to humiliate the best villain Disney ever had.We love Maleficent simply because she's bad to the bone. Why should we care what happened to her back in the day? Great villains are often just what they appear to be, corrupt individuals who take pleasure in the suffering of others. The original Maleficent owned her darkness, and in the end, died for it. This new, terrible ""explanation"" for old Mal's bitchery was given to us by the horrid Linda Woolverton's screenplay (Woolverton also scribbled the wretched screenplay for Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland). This reimagining of why the old girl was such a meanie nearly turns Disney's Grande Dame of Evil into June Cleaver. All that was missing was a string of everyday pearls and a frilly apron. Let's not talk about the three fairies or the weak retelling of the famous pink/blue fight between them. I wanted to spray them with Raid and watch them die. Now that's evil.Evidently, the backbone Disney showed in 1959 allowing Maleficent to invoke ""all the powers of Hell"" in her dragon transformation is all gone. Being a real meanie is bad these days. No one is accountable for doing bad things, they're just misunderstood. Being a meanie doesn't sell merchandise. Being a meanie and dying when you finally get caught doesn't allow for a sequel. Get ready for ""Maleficent 2: Forest Frolics"". Two stars, one for each of Angelina Jolie's cheekbone prosthetics. A truly depressing film from a once innovative studio.",Maleficent

The film lacks the real magical charm like in the Czech fairy tale films of the 60s and 70s, that is unfortunately generally very rare in modern US productions (exception f.e. 'Legend'). But Maleficient is quite cheap CGI Hocus-Pocus and far from being a magical experience that it should be.

397,xmichaelraine,"Visually engaging, but not much more.",6,3 June 2014,"Before we dive into this movie and break it down completely, there's one thing I feel is necessary to know before anything else; Especially for parents: This movie is NOT appropriate for children under 10 years old. I mean seriously, the battle scenes in this film rival that of 'The Lord of the Rings' in ferocity. Alongside other disturbing plot suggestions like murder, imprisonment, and even sexual abuse. Surround all of this with a clunky storyline and very sloppy editing and honestly I fail to find purpose in this film. No doubt it helms very impressive visuals, and Angelina Jolie is nothing short of marvelous. However in my eyes, I would have preferred left this character to be known as she was. And that was one ruthless villain. Because this movie is begging you to feel otherwise. I'm of the opinion that when you have a villain as notorious in Disneys' catalog as Maleficent is; Why try to change that? There's nothing wrong with a fantastic villain. Think about a 'Batman' film doing a retread of the story of the 'Joker' and how he was just 'misunderstood' and never really wanted to hurt anyone. It would be for one really strange, and most importantly completely unnecessary. Let villains be villains. There are lessons to be learned when good triumphs over evil like in 'Sleeping Beauty'. You don't need to try and recreate the legacy of a beloved character by totally changing what was so beloved about them for all these years. People love Maleficent because she is such a great villain. Not because she's just a 'scary looking sweetheart' deep down.The film is brought to the screen by first-time director Robert Stromberg, who is a notable production designer for films like 'Avatar' (2009), Alice in Wonderland (2010), and most recently 'Oz the Great and Powerful' (2013). This is important to know, because there are definitely visuals here that have been borrowed from those mentioned films. It's less 'magical' and more 'haunting'. It's not that the visuals aren't impressive, however nothing beats the feeling of classic Disney animation, like that in 'Sleeping Beauty'. And the direction definitely feels it's lacking in experience. The movie just sort of feels as a lot of small bits spliced together. No real continuity.It isn't an absolute failure, but I can't say it's an absolute must see. Angelina Jolie brings her all to the role, and she is quite enchanting at times. Sadly not even she can bring the movie together. It's a messy film that I stand by saying shouldn't have been made; At least not with this story arc. I attended the early screening with a fellow blogger Tori Michel (www.thetvmom.com) who writes much more frequently about children's movies, television and games. I asked almost immediately after ""Was it just me, or is that a little too extreme for kids under 10?"". She reassured me that I wasn't alone there. Perhaps hardcore Disney fans will enjoy it more than I did. I fail to find justification for it. Visit my blog 614moviebuff.blogspot.com",Maleficent
398,flarepunk,"No, Disney, No",1,20 July 2015,"I am a Disney fan. A pure Disney fan. Currently, I have taken it upon myself to watch every animated feature Disney produced in preparation for going to Disney World in August. I know information about nearly every film, flaws, mistakes, how they did certain things, who voiced what parts, etc. I love Disney.I love Sleeping Beauty the most of all this Disney films for one reason - the art style. It is beautiful. Eyvind Earle was phenomenal as the art director, and I believe Walt's decision to create a ""moving tapestry"" as it was described, created some of the most under-appreciated sequences in the movie (ie the opening sequence was originally going to be much more like the ""Belle"" in the opening of Beauty and the Beast, and the cake baking scene with the three fairies was originally going to end in an explosion) Regardless, this movie touched a part of my artistic mind (I'm an illustrator) and opened the door for me as an artist to view the Disney films in a different light.When I heard that they were making a live-action retelling of it, from Maleficent's perspective, I was elated. Learning that this was likely due to the popularity of ""Wicked"" I was even more elated. I had read the book (NOT the play) and had loved the treatment Elphaba received. I was only concerned, at the time, about one thing - how were they going to recreate the iconic art-style in alive-action retelling?That was the least of my concerns when exiting the theater.This ""retelling"" was not a retelling a la Wicked or even Snow White and the Huntsman, it was through and through a love story, akin to Frozen. In fact, it WAS Frozen, again - with the same twist ending that already feels cliché because Disney did it in two films back to back. What's the problem? Maleficent is not Maleficent, the fairies are not the fairies, Phillip is shoe-horned in, and Stefan is the villain because despite trying to give the original villain dimension, we still need a one-dimensional villain. This is a ""lover scorned"" story. Maleficent is mad a Stefan so she ""curses"" his child. I put curses in quotes because she softens it so much, it may as well be a bedtime story. That's right, in this version, SHE makes it a death-like sleep, so the fairies do nothing. Strike one. The fairies? They must have gotten the lobotomized versions of the fairies for this film, who have no plan, no knowledge (despite being self-described as ""good with children"") and no understanding of what they need to do as guardians of a child. Strike two. The movie shoe-horns in Prince Phillip as a pretty boy cameo with no real purpose.Maleficent, in the end, turns her RAVEN into a dragon (because... why?) Strike three After this, she is a horned catwoman in latex fighting the ""real"" villain, Stefan, to his death, and the entire story is stupid, botched, and boring. Out of strikes, you should die nowWhy anyone likes this movie or thinks it is not cliché is beyond me. It is the epitome of cliché as it is a replicated storyline from Frozen. ""Familial"" love is true love, here, again. What this fails to understand is what made Wicked actually INTERESTING was not the complete change of the character of the Wicked Witch, but the explanation behind it. Elphaba still does all the things she ever DID do in the canon of the stories and the movie. She is angry at Dorothy for killing her sister and taking the shoes. Without context, and from Doroty's perspective, she seems evil. From HER perspective, and WITH context, it's not less WRONG that she's mad at Dorothy, but you understand why she IS. At the core, you must not change the actions the character makes in explaining how the character was ""not so evil"" without completely changing the reasons WHY the character was then called evil, negating the reason for the original story or the retelling altogether.",Maleficent
399,edgamu,Pretty bad (lost of spoilers),3,7 June 2014,"It is so disappointing to see a real classic destroyed by the same people that own the right to preserve it. ""Sleeping Beauty"" (1959) stands among all Disney films because of its great characters, incredible art (all the landscapes drawn by Eyvind Earle are legendary) and because Disney wisely used Tchaikovsky's ballet score.Well, ""Maleficent"" has no personality at all. I must admit that Jolie fits the role perfectly but, sadly, her character is so bad developed that it hurts. King Stefan is such an idiot, with no depth at all. And that also hurts, because in the 1959 film he is a good king. Fanning does not give any charm to Aurora, the public does not fall in love with her. Regarding the art direction, well, at the beginning the film is a kind of ""Dark Crystal/Tinkerbell"" movie, then it turns into ""Lord of the Rings"". It would have been great that this film would have an original art direction to honor the animated film.The story is so rushed, Aurora sleeps like 15 minutes and the she wakes up to help Maleficent kill his father, and she gets real happy afterwards. it is a shame, really.",Maleficent

But give Angelina Jolie 200 million dollars and she'll give you one of the greatest films ever made. I'm not kidding, this is like a perfect motion picture with every aspect of it done right. Not only is it a visual master piece, but the story line and acting are of extremely high caliber. You can tell that Angelina put her heart and soul into making this film. I believe her acting alone she should win an academy award, and while they are handing them out the computer graphic design people should win for their hard work. So if you can, try to see Maleficent in 3D, it will blow you away.",Maleficent

406,shoktart,Enchanting + Timeless Masterpiece,10,2 June 2014,"This movie was SO good. SO stylish. SO eerie. SO haunting. SO mesmerizing/magical. SO ENCHANTING!!!! The atmosphere created by the wonderful music and excellent cinematography really had a timeless feel about it. Almost as if the Angelina Jolie version of that character had always existed from the very beginning. And that's really what the entire movie was hinged on. She WAS Maleficent in every possible way.Angelina Jolie was amazing. It was a flawless performance. Every sound she made, even the slightest utterance was perfect. Her movements and facial expressions were absolutely stunning.My favorite thing about movies is being able to escape into another world. And this movie did a great job at making me feel like that. It was the perfect blend of old and modern. Timeless is really the best way to describe it. It felt nostalgic while at the same time fresh. I felt like I did when I was a kid going to Disneyland for the first time. Some might complain that the movie was a little too ""Disneyland""; and while it's true that at times during the movie I felt like the scene I just experienced with the visuals & music would be perfect in a new Disneyland ride/world, that doesn't bother me. Disneyland isn't all Dumbo rides and Mickey Mouse. Some of my fondest memories of Disneyland are the darker and more haunting aspects. This fit right in with those feeling.All the performances in the movie were spot on. Elle Fanning was completely adorable and innocent as Aurora. Manville, Staunton & Temple were great as the three fairies. Riley delivered the perfect blend of humor & wit with dark undertones as Diaval. And I thought Copley was a great Stefan.I really only have one slight complaint. And it's not even for me. I don't know if anyone else has ever felt this before, but sometimes I don't wish something for myself, but simply because I think it would have made it easier for others to enjoy the movie. So, for the sake of others who needed it, I wish the movie had a little more scenes with Maleficent & Stefan early on in the movie. More screen time showing their relationship blossom and more obvious character development and screen time overall of Stefan would probably have enhanced the emotional connection for most of the audience during the emotional scenes throughout the movie.And maybe these scenes will be included in the director's cut.However, for myself, I thought the movie was perfect. But I'm a little different. I prefer subtle over obvious. I love character development, but at times less is more. When there is a narrator, like there was for this movie, sometimes a simple line by the narrator can tell the audience just as much as a 5 minute scene. I understand the reason why the director chose to keep the movie tight. This was the story told in the viewpoint and perspective of Maleficent. Plain and simple. This was HER story. We were told just enough of what we needed to know about the other characters, their motivations, etc... in order to form an emotional connection while at the same time always completely focused on Maleficent.Would I have been disappointed with an additional 10 minutes of back story involving Stefan? No. But I understand the benefit of keeping the movie shorter/tighter. The one thing no one can complain about is that the movie lost its focus. It was extremely tight. Some might say too tight. But I enjoyed it. I was completely sucked into her story. Less of everyone else allowed for more of Angelina Jolie's portrayal of that amazing, complex, multi-faceted and enchanting character of Maleficent.This really was one of the most enchanting movies I've ever scene. I loved every single moment. The music was engrossing and the visuals haunting. I give it a 10/10. I think those who wished there was additional writing regarding character development have completely valid desires. However, I hope that in time the movie will be appreciated for what it is.",Maleficent

I couldn't think of anyone else doing this role as well as she did. If I were on the board of the Academy Awards, I'd happily nominate her for an Oscar.The film is really good, but you have to watch it as it's own entity. You can't think about what you already know from ""Sleeping Beauty."" This is a completely different story. Everything you love from ""Sleeping Beauty"" is here, but not in the same way. It kind of reminds me of how it is when I watch ""Once Upon A Time."" Forget what you already know and just enjoy this!",Maleficent
409,IAmMrDexB,Complete lack of darkness,3,31 May 2014,"I am very mixed about this film. Firstly, as many critics have singled out, I must praise Angelica's acting, mainly as the first good, then evil Maleficent. Now, while I could feel a little sorry for her being unable to bring this curse off Aurora, having to see, one of my best villains, Maleficent turn back into good is just unnatural. It ends up looking like a beloved Disney film that has been changed for the sake of young girls, who is only a little part of the audience, avoiding simple but effective scares and risks, basically throwing out what many Disney fans remember about Sleeping Beauty. Parts of the film echoes parts of Wicked and Frozen. Of course, most people don't rush into romantic relationships but seeing Disney seemingly apologise for making traditional relationships in past films happen, even though this is what happened in the era the film is set, is just horrid. I mean no offence to Frozen at all, since it is one of my most favourite Disney films of all time. But stealing the concept of real ""true love"" from Frozen is pathetic. If it wasn't for Disney with its stupid audience research, it could have easily looked even further into the darkness of Maleficent, which is almost no such thing in this film.",Maleficent

She made a gorgeous evil Fairy Godmother. I loved that this film gave a character that is supposed to be evil a new insight in to why she became wicked. Not only did the film give a reason of why she went from being peaceful to evil it gave Maleficent a chance to redeem herself. Not many films or even in life are people given that opportunity. I heard some bad comments on this film and so I thought film was not going to be as good as I imagined it to be. But to my surprise the film was excellent. It had many unexpected plot twists, a lot of action, and showed a different take on the definition of true love. Both young and mature audiences will appreciate this story brought to life via film. Great views on greed and great references on how society can and should live together in harmonious relationships.",Maleficent

I've got to say , I'm quite surprised this movie has SO many positive reviews and about the fact that i did NOT find it enjoyable AT ALL....to me this version of 'the fairy tale' was boring its very end.The whole movie was so focused just around Angelina Jolie's character ,'maleficent' ..that i cant even remember seeing any other character on screen for more than a short 5 minutes...including 'Aurora'. Even though she gave a stunning performance and excellently portrayed her role...the story came through being way to boring and wanting by the end.To me the plot was too predictable and i really feel like I'm speaking for a lot of people when i say this. (The stranger sitting next to me actually recited line after line even before the character did..seriously , i know ! Lol ) And the fact that it was 3-D really was even more disappointing ...

413,rinkutiwari1,Nice movie,8,10 June 2014,"I saw this movie tonight with a friend and it was spectacular. Going in, I was excited as a life-long Disney fan but also expecting a somewhat cheesy good-vs-evil type of movie based on what I had seen in the trailer. I couldn't have been more wrong! Angelina Jolie delivers an amazing performance and makes a well-known, previously rather one- dimensional Disney villain relate-able and more sympathetic, while also managing to look like a convincing, gorgeous, magical creature. Although Maleficent's character has been humanized in this re-telling, the story really emphasizes that she isn't human at all, and explores the ins and outs of her life and how she relates to the humans she encounters. Maleficent is about what happens when your Prince turns into a Frog. It's the personal, inner journey to recover from a physical trauma and emotional betrayal by those who are closest to us and who we trust the most. It's about how to survive that type of horrific evil without becoming evil yourself. It's message is that profound.",Maleficent
414,kunagueroooooo,Just what the doctor ordered,9,4 June 2019,"I came to this film, not liking Disney since the mid-70's, all the re-workings and re-imaginings rubbish. Then there's the politically correct nonsense of the noughties and now. Also I disliked Angelina Jolie with a passion, couldn't act her way out of a brown paper bag. So to be fair I wasn't expecting much if I managed to stay awake throughout it.
Well I will eat my words now, it's freekin' awesome. Everything about it makes you want to watch it again. All the actors and actresses were excellent. The CGI/animation was top draw, the storyline was beautifully told, and the live scenes blended in perfectly with the CGI/animation.There were however two flaws in the film (3 if you include, it was over way too soon). The first flaw has to be there (the secret doorway) but did it have to be so blatantly thrown in there (oh what's this behind that massive blanket draped on the wall, oh its an unlocked door in my locked room). The second flaw should never have been there. The story is about Maleficent (obv.) and Sleeping Beauty, and herein lies the flaw. Elle Fanning is very pretty, no doubt but beauty, no sorry. Of all the beautiful actresses in Hollywood (and there is plenty) they pick a pretty one. One can only assume the head of the casting dept. had Elle Fanning's agent on speed dial.That aside, the film is a must see, so go see it ;)",Maleficent

417,lesburton,A story with a serious identity crisis,4,6 June 2014,"Sleeping Beauty is indeed a very old story, one that was originally created by the Brothers Grimm. This story on the other hand is one that tries to give a new take on the traditional telling of Sleeping Beauty. Does it succeed? You can decide...I, on the other hand, was left very confused on what this story was trying to accomplish. I completely understand the angle of not needing to have the young prince coming in and saving the day, but to have the villain (or a least the villain from the Disney classic version of the film)be the hero seems kind of odd to me. If she isn't at all bad, which is what this film is trying to say, then what is she. In this fairy tale world, what is her purpose then? This very quickly came off as a female empowerment film in practically every aspect of the story. She doesn't need a man to save her at the end. Maleficent doesn't need the love a man to raise Aurora, this motherless child. All Aurora really needed was the unconditional, love of another women, like Maleficent. Men are the real bad guys right? That's why they're called ""Bad guys"" not ""Bad Women"". Anyway, I digress, so is this story trying dismiss the original story of Sleeping Beauty? Was there something wrong with the original story that this new telling needed to correct? Is this the new direction Disney wants to go down? The Wicked Step-mother was really just a product of her husband and she has learned that from seeing Cinderella grow up to become a great. Let's see the perspective of the hunters from Bambi to show the family that they were planning on feeding with the deers.What I'm trying to say is that I don't know what this story is trying to accomplish by being retold in this manner. The only reason I can figure out is that Disney is doing everything humanly possible to make sure their image is as squeaky clean as possible. By human two POV's of their stories, there is no way that they can be described as dark in any way. This is very problematic to me in a very important way. A film like this makes it seem like, all evil needs to be given a chance explain itself. This is confusing. Their needs to be an evil in the story, especially for a fairy tale such as this one. Evil must exist to realize there is a battle between good and evil. the point is completely taken away when you show that the side that was evil wasn't actually evil at all. I mean she did one evil thing in the movie and immediately regretted it. In this sense, we could say that every villain can be redone as long as they felt really bad about it afterwords.You might notice that I didn't mention the acting or the visual effects. That's because the story seemed so overwhelmingly problematic that it felt wasted on such an awful story. I'm sure I'll get flack for having these feelings towards the film but whatever. If you enjoyed it then congratulations, you did something I couldn't do.",Maleficent
418,jjvz1989-224-63907,Maleficent is the exact opposite of all the hype,4,13 June 2014,"I went to watch this film because of all the hype and the reviews deeming it to be magnificent, either they are mistaken or I am mistaken. The film starts off with the fairy ""Maleficent"" being the most kindest and good hearted fairy of them all finding a man in her side of the woods, she happens to fall for him spectacularly. Right of the bat, we have a problem here as the definition of the word ""maleficent"" is ""doing evil or harm"" or ""harmfully malicious"", her name is absolute irony as she is never portrayed to be as such but rather a woman scorned, who's only fault was that she fell in love.In this adaptation of the story, Maleficent falls for king Stefan but is betrayed by him. He cuts off her wings after she falls asleep, she wakes up with her wings gone as well as Stefan nowhere to be found. I strongly believe that this is meant to be commentary on the concept of premarital sex. Maleficent instantaneously develops regret and anger towards Stefan, so much so that she is willing to curse his daughter at birth.Maleficent also grows to regret this as she starts to realize that his daughter is nothing like him. This part of the film does not really make sense as it happens so quickly and with haste that you don't really get the time to understand why, the princess comes across as dim witted and of low intelligence rather than a loving person.Maleficent's curse can only be broken by true love's first kiss. At the start of the film, you can already predict the outcome of this statement as there is no such thing as true love's kiss according to Maleficent. Yes, it is exactly what you think, that is the ""plot-twist"", it is as cringe-worthy as it sounds. the only way they could have made this scene more cheesy is by playing savage garden's ""truly, madly, deeply"" in the background. ( if you have not guessed it as of yet, Maleficent's kiss awakens her from the curse.) The CGI of the film varies from scene to scene with portions of absolute beauty to scenes more at home in a commercial than in a big budget film. The dark scenes are beautifully rendered and the lighter scenes are badly done, it feels like they were running low on cash somewhere during production.Angelina Jolie looks perfect as Maleficent and the general costume design is brilliant, this is the only aspect of the film that I can give true praise. However the costumes alone cannot act, at times I did not feel like I was watching a film bur rather a ""days of our lives"" episode based on sleeping beauty, that is how bad the acting seemed to me.Now I am not a Disney fan but there has been Disney films that I enjoyed, I thought that this film would appeal to Disney film fanatics. My girlfriend happens to be a Disney fan of note, I wanted to walk out but remained seated as not to spoil her evening, I thought she was enjoying the film. The first thing she said to me after the film was that ""that film was horrible"". If you are still not convinced, her sister's television is always on the Disney channel and enjoys repeat viewings of the classics regularly. She found it laughable.I really looked forward to the whole premise, the idea of a film based on an antagonist of note and seen out of their viewpoint . Sadly this is not what this film is, it might have started out with this premise but somewhere along the line they chickened out and rather gave us a film where they change her into the misunderstood hero of the film. Do yourself a favor and skip this, if you have a Disney craving rather buy or rent the dvds, stream or download (legally, of course) the classics, you will be more satisfied with that experience.",Maleficent
419,reclined,"more like ""malevolent"" (to the original)",3,8 June 2014,"The closing credit's lazy version of the classic ""Once Upon a Dream"" theme-song actually echoed how I felt after leaving this movie: drained and disappointed. If the movie is billed as a prequel of sorts to the original or at least Maleficent's version of the story, there are too many plot-holes and disappointments.I'l start though, with its few redemptions:1.) It's nice to see a maternal relationship between Maleficent and Aurora, but it makes no sense compared to the original storyline.2.) The few minutes of screen time we have for the 3 fairy godmothers are enjoyable.3.) The relationship between Maleficent and her raven-like servant is entertaining at times.4.) It's nice to see that Prince Philip (as poorly as he is casted) doesn't just get to have the princess at the end of the story. Again, though, this makes no sense compared to the original.Now the bad...1.) The backstory of how Maleficent becomes evil and vengeful before Aurora's coronation misleads the audience into thinking that the Aurora part of the story will have some kind of connected flow to the original. It clearly doesn't.a.) In the original, a major conflict is Maleficent's inability to locate Aurora's sanctuary in the forest. In this adaptation, Maleficent finds her right away. So much for the 16th-birthday suspense in the original.b.) King Stephan quickly but very inexplicably devolves from a father to a tyrant in the new movie. If his long-lost daughter returns to him after 16 years of exile, wouldn't he be a little happier to see her and not just lock her away (a la Rapunzel) in a castle room?c.) The forest-meeting between Prince Phillip and Aurora makes much more sense in the original. He was at her coronation and knows ""once upon a dream"" that they will be together. In this newer adaption, he just finds her by ""getting lost"" in the forest. How can he do that when Maleficinet has placed an ""impenetrable"" thornbush-wall around the entire Moorsland which even the king's best guards can't enter?d.) Maleficent's magic can put anyone to sleep on a moment's notice. Why, then, when she is freed from the iron net in the castle-battle does she not place a quick spell upon the king and guards once she arises (by replaced wings) to escape them more easily?e.) She also has a perfect opportunity to create her goblin-like guards (from the original) from the soldiers who try to burn down her thornbush-wall, but that would then, of course, require her to actually use them to help her find Aurora as in the original. These guards work well on a comic-relief level in the original, but no need for them here?2.) Teenage Aurora arguably looks and sings much more like an adult in the original, but the new casting choice for Aurora looks and sounds much more juvenile than that. If the ""Once Upon a Dream"" song and dance is such an iconic part of the original, Disney really misses that opportunity by poor casting here. The girl doesn't sing nor dance.3.) Again, very minimal screen time is given to the 3 fairy godmothers. If they are the protectors of Aurora in the original and are the most entertaining ones in the story (remember the pink/ blue battles?), why on earth do they get such little inclusion here? It just becomes a dramatic convenience for Aurora to feel closer to Maleficent as her ""actual"" fairy godmother, I guess. Cute idea, but too far from the original.4.) I should leave a Disney movie (or at least a Disney adaptation) feeling nostalgic for and still connected to the original-- not disappointed that the adaptation is so far removed from the original storyline. Maybe the filmmakers are hoping for an audience who hasn't seen the original Sleeping Beauty and who will therefore be too naive to notice the difference. However, they could have done a much better job with the storyline's logic, the casting choices, and the overall connectedness to make the audience feel that investing in or looking back at the original would be a happy and fun thing to do-- not a personal mission to prove to themselves why you still can't beat the original.",Maleficent

I really felt sympathy for Maleficent and understood why she did the things she did. I also liked the fact that I didn't completely hate any of the characters. Now, while it didn't stick to the original Disney ending, it had a satisfying ending to the movie. Also, I didn't see it in 3D, but could tell that it would definitely have been worth the extra money.All the actors did a really great job. Angelina Jolie was excellent as Maleficent. She was able to stay true to the original character and still give her own spin on it as well. She also gave depth to her. Elle Fanning did great as Aurora.

422,brookewhite1998,Interesting Idea Went HORRIBLE,1,8 November 2014,"I have seen lots of movies that have made me sad, angry and offended. Never though have I walked out of a movie though until this happened. I wasn't the only one though. My group of friends and I went to see this movie hoping it would depict the great evil Maleficent we all know and love! Instead when we get to the parts where she and Aurora becomes friends we all agreed to leave and buy to tickets to go see X-Men again. What have you done Disney? You turned one of your best evil villains and make her not evil for the reason why she is evil? Wouldn't that be like if Scar became Simba's cool uncle, Ursula wanting to help Ariel out of kindness or make Gaston the Best Man and Belle's wedding?! THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN! Plus why do we need some twirling mustache evil villain? And one more thing Disney you're not going to be arrested for trying to follow the fairytale story with females! Look I know they want the female to be more and do more than when people think Disney Princess but does every Disney movie now need to completely re-work the story in order to do that?! Enchanted did it decent but Tangled, Frozen and now this?! These stories have been told for centuries you're just trying to follow them and tell them the true story. The actors are great, the action is fun and the effects are good but that's it. Just think in ten years time. Which story will you remember most? Sleeping Beauty or Maleficent? The only benefit this movie will eve get for me and my friends is to remind us we have the original Sleeping Beauty to watch so we never, ever, ever, EVER have to watch this again! Amen to that!",Maleficent
423,watchthisspacefilmmagazi,Easy entertainment,7,14 December 2014,"So I've heard a lot about this film as its been around for a while, always sounded a tad immature to me, so I stayed clear of it until now. I succummed when looking through the iTunes film library and after a while of not being able to decide what to watch, as often happens, I settled for Maleficent (2014) out of sheer frustration.Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) is a fairy charged with protecting her homeland populated by various mythical creatures. She, since childhood, has been in love with a human and they became best friends. When the human king leads his army against the mythical folk he comes into contact with Maleficent and places a bounty on her head. The film follows her decent into evil and revenge, showing us a side to an age old story we haven't seen before, the story of Sleeping Beauty and the woman who cursed her.As you can imagine, the story of Sleeping Beauty isn't something that grabbed me being that everyone knows this story, it has been told over and over again. However I did liked the idea of it being told from another perspective with an adult and slightly darker character as the lead.Angelina Jolie plays the fairy Maleficent and I have to say, did a great job. She has the great ability of being able to play a variety of different characters with conviction. She played the happy love-struck fairy very well, but even better was her portrayal of a woman's decent into evil and revenge due to the betrayal of a man. Now this is one woman I wouldn't like to get on the wrong side of!Everything was very picturesque and 'Disney' just without the animation, but that worked in this film's favour. The battle scenes were excellent, seeing trees that look slightly like Sauron from Lord of the Rings, completely destroy armies of men. Seeing colossal worms made out of vines tearing through enemy lines was truly enjoyable as we all love to see a good fight. But even with all of those special effects I have to say the most enjoyable aspect of the film, for me, was watching the relationship grow between Maleficent and Aurora (Elle Fanning) aka Sleeping Beauty. This was an unexpected pleasure and I really found myself caring about what happened to them.The only problem I had with the film was Sharlto Copley who played Stefan who's performance I thought was awful. He seemed wooden, sounded like he was reading from a script and didn't believe or connect with a single word he said. This is a problem for me as every time he spoke it took me out of the film and reminded me that it was, in fact, a film. With the talent of Angelina and the rest of the cast, who I have to say were great, especially Sam Riley who was an unexpected delight, and the massive budget this film must have had that they could have found someone better to play the deranged king.But that case of bad acting aside, I really rather enjoyed the film. I am a fan of the fantasy genre anyway as that is the genre of books I almost exclusively read, so found all the creatures in Maleficent's kingdom great fun. Overall I thought it was an enjoyable film, one I probably wouldn't watch again but that is not to say I wouldn't recommend it to someone for an easy Sunday afternoon film.",Maleficent
424,johnhempel,Good enough for Oscar material !,10,15 March 2015,"This is more of an adult version of sleeping beauty with an added twist that makes it more interesting to watch. Angelina Jolie is an actress who can say so much and convey so much emotion with just a look. For me, it's one of the best Disney films ever made. It had much more depth and emotion than the original version. I feel that the movie as well as the acting was very much underrated. So many people that I have spoken to feel the same way about this movie. There is a message in this movie that I haven't heard mentioned by anybody. It is, to be careful of what you say or do out of anger or hatefulness, because you can't take some things back.",Maleficent

Tell us the story of the evil Maleficent and put in the good characters in which the public can identify itself. It could have been a slightly more adult and disturbing movie, Disney could dare a little more.But no, they decided to make her some kind of Mary Poppins with horns. Later on in the movie she turns into Catwoman... and not into the huge dragon? Ok Disney, didn't you feel ashamed of all this?The whole plot is very silly.The only positive thing about this movie is how perfect Angelina Jolie looked as Maleficent.P.S.

430,phxphil,Not a Good Movie for Children,1,22 February 2015,"How Disney could take a classic story involving a wonderfully evil character and make her into a victim of male abuse is beyond me. It's a terribly misguided attempt to influence our daughters to mistrust and find fault with men. Even the wonderful fairies in the original story who saved, protected, provided love and a good upbringing for Snow White, have those outstanding feminine qualities taken away from them. They are reduced to bumbling caretakers who watch over her until Maleficent finds her and eventually becomes her benefactor.I don't think, we as a society, should try to right a wrong with another wrong. If the powerful women in Hollywood think that Hollywood produces movies that portray women in less than desirable ways there is no reason to counter attack with this awful story aimed at the impressionable psyche of our children. If you have concerns about your daughters and sons viewing a story about abusive men and psychologically damaged women getting revenge stay away from this movie.

In Maleficient, she's fully aware that she's playing for children but her role isn't a cutesy one. She's a larger-than-life figure who feels the most human emotions and experiences - hope; self-awareness; betrayal; tragedy; conflict; love found, lost and rediscovered - and she plays it all with great drama and intensity.

The general public is so brainwashed and desensitized these days that they will not understand that this movie is mocking God by glorifying the Luciferian archetype - how many parents will even realize that what they are putting in front of their children's minds is blatant satanic mind control.The film makers are pushing a satanic Gnostic belief system onto innocent unsuspecting minds. Gnosticism teaches that Lucifer is not bad - this philosophy is an occult inversion of Christian teaching.Early experience has an important influence on adult behaviour.When the children watching this sort of material grow up they will easily accept occult themes because they have sentimental,warm memories of films like this.

Even though Angelina Jolie was born for the role of Maleficent, I always felt bad that she's a sympathetic character instead of a villain. The backstory before her wings chopped off was nice and the medieval setting of Scotland looks nice. It's still shameful how they ruined some enjoyable characters: First Prince Phillip becomes a bland character, King Hubert, Lord Duke (Announcer), and Sir Minstrel (lackey) are absent, the 3 Good Fairies (Merryweather, Flora, and Fauna) became idiots and people call them the Three Stooges, and worst of all, King Stefan becomes the villain by taking away his parenting nature and humor (Skumps in the final cut and It Happens I have a Picture from the original cut/demo recording). I consider it the wrong kind of feminism since it did not benefit the idea that everyone is treated equally regardless of what they are. The idea of King Stefan rewritten as a villain is one of the reasons why I will NOT watch this garbage ever again! They treat it as the real story when they're ignoring real facts of the original animated film.",Maleficent

439,collie-12,1959's Sleeping Beauty is much better,3,4 August 2014,"I did not find it to be ""the worst film ever"" as I have seen others here call it, but it certainly was a disappointment. I wondered how many of the people writing negative reviews here, calling the film feminist and anti-male were men. I, however, am NOT a man, and I even always considered myself a bit of a feminist, but I still did not like this film.First—It's not that I hate old tales turned upside down—not if they are done with skill. There is a great essay by Ruth Dorgan titled ""Jack the Giantmugger"" which turns Jack and the Beanstalk inside-out. But she does it WITHOUT changing any of the story's facts; she just gives them a new perspective. ""Maleficent"" (2014) does not. In the far better Disney film ""Sleeping Beauty"" (1959), it is the third fairy who softens Maleficent's curse turning the death sentence into only a long sleep. In ALL previous versions it is the last good fairy who steps forward to undo as much of the curse as possible. That is a major plot point—one this new film disregards! Here it is Maleficent herself who says the girl shall sleep until awakened by true love's kiss—which if you get the foreshadowing of the gift young Stefan gave Maleficent, you know is an ironic 'catch-22.' Now let's cut to the ""true love's kiss"" bit. That IS Disney's line, by the way. It's not in either Grimm or Perrault's versions. They merely say a king's son will awaken her after 100 years; there was no mention of ""true love"" as a condition. (For the record, Grimms' Snow White wakes when the apple becomes dislodged when the prince orders her casket moved—sorry folks, but there's no first love's kiss in that one either.) Now I liked the film ""Frozen"" because it seemed fresh and original. Concerning that movie's twist, I did not see it coming. This time I saw it coming from a mile away. It was no-longer fresh; it was predictable. And far worse than being merely predictable, it seemed heavy-handed and downright preachy. While I do not believe a woman needs a man to make her complete, Disney does seem to be trying awfully hard lately to drill into young girls' heads that they should not dream about their handsome prince, or at any rate certainly don't count on him to save you. I don't know; maybe that is a good lesson for young girls to learn after all, but must they be taught it at the expense of ruining your own masterpiece? Why do you want to negate your own masterpiece, Disney? ""Frozen"" is a new story. ""Maleficent,"" however, boldly claims to be a retelling of Sleeping Beauty which dares to say that this is the 'true' version and we should disregard the old story we once thought was true. That struck me as very impudent.I also did not like how this film totally destroyed characters I had known and loved from the 1959 version—namely the three good fairies: Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. They were sweet and funny, lovable and endearing. These fairies were mere twits. I think they were supposed to be funny, but I did not find them so. I found them to be silly, annoying, selfish, and extremely disappointing.Thirdly from a purely artistic point-of-view, this film is inferior to the 1959 version. The 1959 version was hand-drawn. This is just more of the same old CGI jazz one sees everywhere these days. It is becoming very boring. But what is more important is the time and detail that went into the 1959 film. Eyvind Earle's elaborate backgrounds—inspired by medieval paintings—took seven to ten times as long to draw as the cells for other Disney cartoon features. The drawing alone was so painstakingly done that it took 5 years! And the '59 music was magnificent—and why shouldn't it be since the composer was no other than Peter Ilyich Tchaikosky? Lastly, what's in a name? Well, Maleficent's name means ""harmfully malicious"" or ""causing evil"" according to dictionary.com, and its origin dates back to the late 1600s. It's Latin; Disney did not invent it. The word is closely akin to such words as malevolent, malice, malicious—you get the picture, don't you? If she suppose to start out so nice and only turned evil after being betrayed by one she trusted, why was she called Maleficent from the beginning? I know no one cares about etymology these days, but really they should.Now in all fairness to the film, it wasn't all bad. I rather like Jolie's performance. When Aurora tells her she knows who she is, that she's her fairy godmother, Jolie's reaction was perfect. She's both appalled and slightly amused by it—little does she realize at the time that she has indeed become just that. And it was nice how Jolie gradually came to love the child she originally hated. Some of the negative criticism I read here was uncalled for as well: while Stefan's character could use a lot more development, Stefan does have an understandable motivation to betray Maleficent—he wants to be king. Heck, he told us that the first time we met him. His evilness does not come out of nowhere, and he is not 100% heartless. His first intention was to kill her which he could not bring himself to do. I thought his stealing her wings was his trying to be as kind as possible—considering his greedy lust for power. Incidentally, I thought this Stefan would have been more at home in Game of Thrones than Sleeping Beauty. And yes, I suppose this act could be regarded as a type of rape, as some people here have written, but that is reaching a bit now, isn't it?Villains can be fun and fascinating. Why make one of the greatest Disney villains ever into the film's hero?",Maleficent

It is an excellent piece of fiction, and superbly produced and well-acted. But the embedded message is laden with blasphemy (or simply subtle mockery of the entity that some people know as God), and sympathy with the entity that some people know as Satan and empathy with Satan's claims about God.Angelina Jolie represents Satan. I leave the rest for smart people to decipher and recognize.By the way, these comments have nothing to do with a specific religion and the writer is not even a Christian. Even an atheist who heard the few stories told about what happened between God and Satan can still understand what I'm talking about, and in the end, all versions can be fiction to him or her; understanding that this is a ""version of Satan's story"", an alternative version to empathize with the entity, is enough.",Maleficent

442,anda-alexandra-86,"I Know You, I Walked With You Once Upon A Dream",10,10 November 2015,"I do not know about you, but I was raised with a lot of Disney movies and I always loved fairy tales. For me all magical things looked so much out of reach yet fascinating. Animations would keep me locked tight in front of the TV and I would spend hours looking in the fairytale books that my mother and my grandparents would provide. My personal favourite was always Belle - a nerd yet a lovely young woman with a will of its own. But when it came to evil, Maleficent was the best. From her wardrobe to the way she walked and spoke, she was a menace! And that black raven-like crow was as terrifying! I love the fact that in the movie Maleficent the cast was selected especially to resemble to the original animation that Disney has created. The sets, the costumes, the way they walk and talk... everything was done so it would look as much as possible to the old Disney tale, yet since the very beginning Aurora's voice (which is the narrator and the Sleeping Beauty in one) tells us that the story we heard is not quite right... The movie Maleficent starts with the story of a beautiful small fairy with strong big wings, that falls in love with a poor dirty old boy who was trying to steal a stone. The fairy is Maleficent and the boy will grow up to be a king: King Stefan. They both represent the 2 world colliding: the real world and the land of fairies and all magical creatures.Maleficent befriends Stefan and on her 16th birthday, she receives her ""true loves kiss"" from Stefan (wickedly enough, when she casts the curse upon baby Aurora, she sets up the doom at the exact time when she had her first kiss: the sunset of the day of her 16th birthday!). But as we all know, the human beings are small and wicked and frail compared to the other creatures upon this earth, so Stefan's will to raise himself from the status of poor boy is more important so he sees less and less of Maleficent. Years fly by and we fast forward to a grown-up Maleficent, in all her beauty - huge horns and impressive large wings that can take her up into the sky, where she would soar above the world, on the wings of the wind alone...The King of the Human Realm attacks The Land Of Magic, The Land of Fairies, and Maleficent stands guard, as we find out that she was named protector of the land, due to her strenght and knowledge. Along with her tree-friends (which remind me of the Ents from my beloved LOTR) and other magical creatures, she faces the king in battle and wins. On his dying bed, the king promises his daughters hand and the kingdom as a reward to get the fairy that defied him killed. Stefan, his servant, hears that and goes to Maleficent with the thought to kill her. He sets her asleep with a drink and sweet words of love, but when he sees her he cannot go through so he chooses middle ground by just cutting off her wings with iron (yes, iron apparently in this movie, works like Kryptonite upon Superman!).A most disturbing and heartbreaking scene arises when Maleficent wakes up. As she screams and mourns on the moors she screams and mourns not only for the lost wings, her lost freedom, her ability to move and be up there on the top of the world... she screams and mourns for the loss of a friend, for Stefan's betrayal and for her broken heart. All done in the night, with making her fall asleep so she would not feel a thing, all resembles very much with a rape - which is quite distressing, considering this is rated as PG.Henceforward the movie turns dark as the sad queen arises. As Stefan is crowned king, due to Maleficent's lost wings, she takes over the land of fairies and becomes their dark queen. Sadness creeps in the land and all laughter is gone when she turns by. We see glimpes of good in her. Once seeing a peasant trying to kill a dark crow that tried to get close to her, she saves him and makes him her companion - his name is Diaval and he gets to change his appearance with just a flick of Maleficent's finger ;) and I must admit he is the nicest addition to the story! Maleficent's crow companion is named Diaval (pronounced similarly to 'devil') and in the Disney cartoon version Maleficent's crow companion is named Diablo (a word meaning 'devil'). In Irish lore crows are associated with the winged battle goddesses the Morrigan (they sound similar, as well, to Maleficent). In most all other lore crows are associated with death, the dead, and trickery. Thus, they can be ""devilish"" birds. Diaval becomes her wings and he brings her news from across the real, news of Stefan being king - news of Stefan getting married - news of Stefan having a baby girl now, named Aurora. As rage boils inside Maleficent she decides she must make her entrance to the palace and show herself to the world, in all her glory, and make Stefan pay for the wings he stole.",Maleficent
443,gopijahi_551,Simply Superb. Will go watch again for all the awesomeness again.,10,2 June 2014,"Awwww.. Maleficent.. It should be called magnificent.. I never liked Disney movies that much because they have always showed love at first sight thing and that concept itself bugs me a lot. But since Frozen, I started liking Disney after like forever(I liked Disney at Lion King times. Mostly because I was a kid at that time). I must say they have changed Sleeping beauty story a lot for this film and that's the whole reason I liked it. The concept of a random prince coming and kissing a girl sort of gives me creeps always. The motherly love shown in this film really melted my heart like butter on a pan. Showing both innocent and dark side and finally mother side of Maleficent really made me warm and fuzzy. I don't want to give away a lot of spoilers. But trust me when I say that all the kids must watch this film to get a feeling of what true love is. The story is great, background music is apt, cast is wonderful, CGI is awesome, showing that every person have inner demons and angels is really what i liked in this film.

First, we must be willing to face and embrace every dark aspect of ourselves, no matter how large we imagine our imperfections to be, no matter how great our sense of shame over our past mistakes may be. Secondly, to love one who is at first difficult to love also requires that we soften ourselves enough to be changed. If we go the distance in learning how to love in this way, the process will always transform us for the better.Unfortunately, we do not have a lot of examples in our culture's movies, books, or stories of what such a transformational act of love looks like. Fortunately, Disney's film Maleficent gives us such an example. To all who participated in the production of this film I say, Well done! Beautiful story, beautiful imagery, beautifully acted, and beautifully produced. I felt my heart was glowing as I left the movie theater.",Maleficent
445,khalidabusamra,perfect example of why Jolie is one of the most in-demand actors on the planet,8,2 June 2014,"This Disney production Maleficent, directed by Robert Stomberg, reimagines the Sleeping Beauty fairytale. The evil fairy queen (Angelina Jolie) is no longer the bad guy. She is instead the good fairy who is scorned and deceived by the man she loves (Sharlto Copley). THell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Well, the adage stands true for fairies too. Her mind turns to revenge and she curses the Princess – the daughter of the above mentioned man – and then sets about making her life miserable. But she is no longer the one-dimensional villain we knew, instead she is a fully grown woman who has loved and lost. Does she succeed in her professed intention? Therein lies the tale.Her silken smooth performance is the highlight of the film. In fact, there is nothing much in the film once we discount Jolie's inspired take on the woman who loses love and gradually finds it again. She makes the transformation believable. And don't we all love the wicked Jolie who goes bad with a twinkle in her eye. Her black-clad and horned form makes everyone else, include Elle Fanning as Aurora, pale into insignificance. And when she has her wings, the film soars! I thought it was awesome! Great visual effects and a new twist on a classic favorite. Both versions work and it gives you a look at both sides. Jolie was a prefect choice and her mannerisms and cold stare really worked well. The only negatives I can say are, I wish the 3 fairies had more screen time as they were a good comedy break from the overall dark tone of the film. Other than that it was a great film.",Maleficent
446,KaylaMaster,Another modern attempt to slam men (and fathers) & blur good and evil....,5,17 July 2014,"I knew it would happen. Eventually, the evil queen in Sleeping Beauty would be made to be ultimately sympathetic. We just can't leave well enough alone. I know, I know, people aren't all good or all bad. We want to make them ""complex characters."" If that's so, how come there was no redemption for Aurora's father? He was complex too. He could have done worse (trying not to spoil too much) but tried to have it both ways. Regardless of what he did, there was no redemption for him. He was simply bitter and evil. I wanted to like this movie but I detest these Hollywood ""improvements"" on much loved fairy tales. We grew out of them and learned to see them for what they were......tales. Now however, there is no childhood, no decent fathers, and no clear right and wrong. Though visually, a beautiful film for the most part (except for Jolie's pointy cheekbones) it was a disappointment. I didn't feel like cheering in the end and poor Aurora never much missed her Dad. In the end, the movie just became another forgettable Hollywood cliché.",Maleficent
447,romessanadeem,"Maleficent: Part-time Prankster, Full-time Babysitter",5,1 December 2015,"I didn't really hear a whole lot of good things about Maleficent and so I didn't bother watching it for quite a long time. But I figured, it's Angelina Jolie, there's going to be a dragon (seeing as how it's a remake of Sleeping Beauty) and it was 12 am on a Monday and I needed to watch something short but entertaining. The very first thing I noticed right off the bat in the beginning of the film i.e. the fact that the movie, for lack of a better word, is childish. There's ""I am Groot"" like creatures and odd toad like mini ogres, swamps and marshes that apparently smell like unicorn glitter and sunshine, seeing as how there's other creatures living quite contently in it. The whole scene initially of Angelina Jolie flying about the magical land was reminiscent of something I watched in a Tinkerbell movie as a child.The movie proceeds to tell, or rather to retell, Maleficent's story. One thing leads to another, Angelina Jolie loses something precious to her after a boy she loves betrays her in order to become king, getting us back on track to the story we grew up with, when she shows up at the King's daughter's birth to curse her. The King sends the girl, Aurora, away to live in the depths of the forest (which is in no way problematic) with three incompetent pixies. Somewhere along the way, we also find out that iron burns fairies. Well, if that's true Maleficent should disintegrate into bits by the irony of her situation.Turns out, the Kings decision to have three retarded pixies taking care of his child is generally a poor life choice as they let an infant child cry, scream and starve. And so, (surprise surprise) an unlikely bond begins to form between Aurora and Maleficent as she begins to take care of her. Aurora grows to be an unnaturally chirpy girl and ends up trusting just about everyone and everything, whether it be a woman with horns growing out of her head or an opposite sex person with whom she should really know nothing about. Another thing I couldn't help but notice was that the editing was far from great. It wasn't anything in particular, but telling enough for me to have made that conclusion. Moreover some things in the movie were just poorly executed; Maleficent's abrupt domination and the woodland creatures sudden subservience, the dragon transformation, the stab at doing the whole imitation of a popular recent animated Disney film, and last but not least, the gloriously villainous Maleficent's transformation into part-time prankster and full-time babysitter.In conclusion, Maleficent does carry some visual and dramatic impact, Angelina Jolie looks magnificent and some viewers may find the retelling of the classic charming and intriguing. It does, after all, have tremendous potential, imaginative and creative imagery, and in an ideal world, it should have been a mix between ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""Alice in Wonderland."" Unfortunately, Angelina Jolie's eyebrows seem better crafted than this movie itself.",Maleficent
448,ian_calders,The irony is strong in this one,1,8 April 2017,"To be fair to this film it is well directed and.. well that's it really. The irony is that this film seems to be a response to claims of sexism directed at previous Disney films but in response they have produced the most sexist film you are ever likely to see. Simply put all the men in this film are portrayed in an unremittingly bad way except for the 'happy slave', because good men do whatever they are told. There is not one good character in this film.The film tries to forgive the actions of the 'evil Maleficent' and this is certainly what the audience is supposed to feel. Her terrible actions are justified by being in response to what is clearly a date rape. But how can her actions be justified when she takes revenge on the child of her attacker? As for the princess herself, she is a paper thin character who seems to forgive Maleficent far too easily after discovering that her father (predictably) doesn't show any love for her (the same father that hid every spinning wheel in the country).The final message of this film is that the only 'true' love is between two women as men are clearly incapable of love even when that is between a father and his daughter.

Jolie gives a magnetic performance that holds your attention captive every moment she is on screen and her nuanced facial expressions speak volumes. In this fairy tale world things play out unexpectedly and if I had one criticism it would be in the portrayal of the true villain of the film. Clearly the focus was on Maleficent and how she chooses to deal with an egregious wrong against her but the story of the one who wronged her feels a bit truncated and clunky. Whereas everything about Maleficent is show not tell, as it should be, we are just told about the villain and don't really have an understanding of why he is who he is. The ending is emotionally satisfying and the film sustains a compelling charm even in the darkest moments.",Maleficent
452,Picses17017,"Not suitable for..... well, anybody",2,15 September 2014,"Does highly paid cast means good movie?The high rating of this movie represents the biased minds of reviewers towards famous cast. It certainly does not deserve 7.2 rating. Twilight series (which I really hated) was better than this. This movie is a piece of epic failure and is undoubtedly, one of worst movies of this years to date.There was no such thing even close to, what we call, good acting. The movie was unable to develop any interest during whole of its running time. I kept guessing there might be some twist or action coming up because of the high ratings. But, I was left with an anger that I wasted my time.It is clear to me now that Angelina Jolie lacks voice talent. She does not have any face expressions and most of her movies are over-rated.2 stars for...... a slightly better graphics.Movie lovers.... avoid it. Not recommended to anybody.",Maleficent
453,macca197338,A Good Night Out,7,29 May 2014,"I went to the Cinema last night with the Wife and the Kids on the UK opening night for this movie.I certainly enjoyed it and to quote my kids:The 8 year old: ""It was great, it looked beautiful"" The 13 year old: ""Yeah it was good, predictable though""I think that sums it up, it's beautifully made, laden with good quality CGI, expansive outdoors views, highly imaginative fantasy terrain which makes the magical element believable and acting that is a cut above the norm throughout. The story ticks along at a good pace without dwelling long enough for you to get bored, but ultimately it is predictable.The story line is the only real problem with the film, which whilst a radically different take on the traditional ""Sleeping Beauty"" tale, is ultimately a safe steady affair with no real surprises or shocks. As a result this movie will never rise above mediocrity and therefore the tag of just being ""enjoyable"".So its worth spending your money to see in the cinema and to pay the extra for the 3D. It may even be worth buying the DVD for your 8 year old daughter. But although I enjoyed it and I am glad that I went, I doubt I will be watching it again for a while.",Maleficent
454,anime_queeny,A few flaws but overall it was good,7,28 May 2014,"So, I had the pleasure of attending the advanced screening of Maleficent and I must say that this movie wasn't too bad.Basic run down of the movie...a young fairy girl with beautiful wings, meets a young thief boy and together they form a loving bond with Maleficent experiencing her first kiss of true love. As Maleficent grows into a beautiful adult fairy, she awaits the return of her love. When they finally reunite it does not end well and thus the story of Maleficents rage and her reason for becoming the villain of this story, PLUS the story of the Sleeping Beauty story begins.Angelina Jolie did an amazing and stunning job of Maleficent...When she's on screen she is a joy to watch! But, for me that's all there was to the movie...Angelina made this movie...that and visually the film was stunning but there were a couple of holes in the story and some changes to a traditional story that I'm not so fond of.Unfortunately, I'm a bit of traditionalist...My all time favourite animated Disney film is: Sleeping Beauty. If you're a gigantic fan of the animated film and expect the live action rendition to be similar (like they've portrayed it through trailers) you might be a little bit disappointed.Firstly, I don't really get why the King has such a vengeful hate against Maleficent...if you watch the story at the start there was no reason for him to hate her and he basically caused and created what Maleficent shouldn't have been. In the end, there was so much violence and hate towards Maleficent I couldn't bear to watch it was really sad.Secondly, I'm not a huge fan of the actress that plays Aurora. She's a pretty girl but she just didn't bring anything special to the screen.Thirdly, there was no ""love story"" between Aurora and Prince Phillip...In fact, it felt like Prince Phillip was just in the story for the sake of being there because everyone knows there is a Prince Phillip that saves Aurora from her sleeping slumber...or does he?Finally, many people will disagree with this but I thought Maleficents powers could have been stronger. She does possess great power and uses it well but it's kind of flat. This is just me comparing the animated Maleficent to the live action one. I'm just being picky...It was a good attempt to modernise and recreate and invent a new way of telling a story about Sleeping Beauty and I absolutely loved Angelina Jolie as Maleficent...But, there are flaws and it's hard to ignore them.Don't bother watching this film in 3D either because there isn't much excitement or enough things in the film to make it pop out. Enjoy the visuals and story of the film without the need of the silly 3D glasses.7/10",Maleficent
455,dolphin305,Great story!,10,30 May 2014,"I really enjoyed the turn around of this story. Watching the Disney ""Sleeping Beauty"" movie, I always saw Maleficent as nothing more than an evil character. In this movie, though, I saw a whole other side of her; I actually felt sorry for her. She seemed like any other woman, simply betrayed by her boyfriend.I enjoyed Maleficent's connection with Aurora. It was great that, although she wasn't able to, Maleficent tried to remove the curse, and later she was desperate to get Prince Phillipe to Aurora. She simply needed an angel, a pure hearted person to help her get rid of the darkness in her heart.",Maleficent
456,billyboi21,A Refreshing Re-tell with an Incredible twist,8,25 November 2014,"I like it when the whole fairy tale characters and the environment were made real in the film. Angelina was so believable and carried on the role with glamour and fierce at the same time. But what really got me is how the story was re-told in a completely different point of view: the villain's, which I think made the story possess some sense of depth. Although this kind of approach is already familiar to some such as, the TV series 'One Upon A Time' wherein the writers give a completely different approach in retelling the story of each fairy tale character.And I think, emphasizing on what really behind the story we've all been told as kids is what's really capturing and refreshing to the mind of the viewers. Eg., how a 'true love's kiss' could break the spell (who possessed the curse-breaking kiss) and who is the real sleeping beauty in a metaphorical sense.I was never a fan of sleeping beauty. But now, I am..",Maleficent
457,natpereyra,"Surprising, Disney is evolving... FINALLY!",7,7 September 2014,"Honestly, I was reluctant to watch this movie, but I'm glad I finally did, it was worthy indeed. Never thought Disney will do a story like this, and moreover knowing the 'original' one.It's definitely humanized, real, and showing how every being has both sides, 'good and evil' (if you believe in these specific terms), more accurate: Yin and Yang. Letting the truth unfolding itself: the relativism of action.Angelina was wonderful as almost always, and Elle was fresh, candid and above the character (I'm liking her each time I see her)...I do recommend it without a bit of doubt. Those giving distasteful reviews are the ones living in the past or just haters, jeee ;P But for real, I don't think they understood the big step and risk that Disney took on this film, getting away from the same old and boring love fairy tale story and it's gratefully appreciate it. Hope this comment has been helpful and that you understand and enjoy this kind of down to earth movie with a big touch of magic ;D",Maleficent
458,afreimann,SPOILER ALERT: Jolie's character is Oscar-worthy. Best Actress.,8,18 June 2015,"I recently saw this movie and enjoyed it quite a bit. Refreshingly, the viewer gets to see the Sleeping Beauty fairy-tale from a completely different point of view. There is plenty of CGI, but it's all very well-done and only enhances the viewer's visual experience. Though I have no respect for Angelina Jolie as a human being (Brad & Jennifer, remember???) I must admit that her performance in this role is flawless. Literally, perfect. She does such an amazing job as Maleficent that I, for one, couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. ****SPOILER ALERT!!!***** Please stop reading here if you've not yet seen the movie. One of the scenes I find most compelling and believable is when a battle-weary Maleficent awakes to find that her wings have been stolen. Jolie's heartbroken keening is as real as obvious emotional pain gets. For that scene alone, she deserved the Best Actress Oscar, hands down. Please exercise caution when viewing with smaller children because there is a considerable amount of violence, perhaps a bit much for some small viewers. Overall, this movie is well worth the time you'll spend of your life to see it. And, it's good enough that you will probably want to see it more than once.",Maleficent
459,AmorLucis,Stunning Revolutionary Game Changer in the Fairy Tale Genre,10,31 May 2014,"This film is a TRUE fairy tale. It's dark. It's raw. And it's written from the dark, raw experience of women. Maleficent is about what happens when your Prince turns into a Frog. It's the personal, inner journey to recover from a physical trauma and emotional betrayal by those who are closest to us and who we trust the most. It's about how to survive that type of horrific evil without becoming evil yourself. It's message is that profound.The critics complaining about this film want ""fairy tales"" to stay in the same ""one-love-fits-all"" mode where people are either good or evil and that all one needs is to find ""romantic"" love and marry a ""good"" Prince or Princess, and you will live ""happily ever after,"" safe from any pain or sorrow. But real life is a lot messier than that.It's actually evidence of how rare it is to see women's unfiltered subjective emotional landscape portrayed on film that it seems many of the critics cannot even wrap their brains around it! No matter. This film is so sensually visually stunning and viscerally emotionally cathartic that sheer word of mouth enthusiasm is going to make this a blockbuster, no matter what the critics say.And it's equally rare to see a protagonist whose inner landscape is more complex than simply extracting revenge, destroying their enemies and...roll credits. People are more complicated than THAT fairy tale we are sold in every other ""action"" and ""adventure"" film that only serves to reinforce the psychopathic values of revenge and bravado.Sometimes a film is so ahead of its time that the critics are behind and so philosophically deep that it's message is incomprehensible to the more superficial among us. This is one such film.Woolverton and Jolie have crafted a masterpiece.Don't miss it.",Maleficent
460,ljmendones,"Everything is perfect, except for the FAIRIES.",9,11 June 2014,"Epic. Legendary. Maleficent is one of the best Disney Movies there is, it shows how evil the human greed and selfishness can change a person's way of life. For Angelina Jolie, she is the best actress to portray Maleficent, I can't imagine this film if another actress portrayed it. The graphics were absolutely stunning and almost real, at the first scenes of the movie, where Maleficent still had wings, its like a battle between nature and humanity which is relevant today. Elle Fanning was very much adorable and good, not great, not bad, but good. The movie shows that we humans are very weak when we are in front of a decision to betray your friend or to be with her and be happy. It gives us a lesson that, there is goodness before evil, there is an angel before a devil and tells a story that certain points in our life can change who we are, just like when Stefan removed the wings of Maleficent in the beginning, when evil Maleficent turns into a good Maleficent when she saw goodness in Aurora. And it also shows that before we make a decision we must be fully-committed to that decision so you won't regret it later, like when Maleficent said ""I REVOKE THE CURSE! LET IT BE KNOWN!"" when she wants to save Aurora. Everything was great and perfect, except for the Fairies. Their names shouldn't have changed! It should've still remained to Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, but their names CHANGED! And it was hard to pronounce, and I hate how they neglected Aurora when she almost fell in a cliff, when they left her in the yard. But the casting for the pink fairy was PERFECT! IDK the name of the actress who played Umbridge in HP5 but she was perfect! It made me see a diff. light on her. Umbridge was truly a remarkable actress, from a villain that we hated in Harry Potter to a good fairy in Maleficent. And besides of the fairies, one thing I hated is the casting of the PRINCE! When I saw the Prince, I was very hesitant to believe that he was a prince. But overall the film was great and awesome! (ESP. WHEN MALEFICENT GETS HER WINGS BACK AND FIGHTS, AND WHEN SHE ENTERS THE PARTY) I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERY Disney CLASSICS LOVER TO WATCH MALEFICENT WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. It has no disgusting scenes, all child- friendly but still awesome! HOPE YOU ALL GUYS LIKE IT. :) MALEFICENT! MALEFICENT! MALEFICENT!",Maleficent

The story is not deep, actually, it's very shallow. You will know how the movie will end just by watching the first 10 minutes of it and that is very disappointing. But on the other hand the visual effects were amazing and i enjoyed the natural scenes and 3D effects. When you watch this movie do not expect to watch a ""Lord of the rings"" kind of movies. Just expect a ""300"" kind, where the story does not matter and the visuals are what really matters.

463,clirby,A Child's Treasury of Rape Stories.,1,19 February 2015,"The charming trailer looked so promising but the film turned out utterly disappointing. Let me first apologise for the spoilers here, there's no way I could review this film without any. This reimagining of the classic Sleeping Beauty turns out to be just another Disney film where ultimately, the evil ones win and the ones the writers decide are the good guys live happily ever after. Just that they've turned the actual good guys into bad and bad ones into good. Any hope of finally seeing the real evil win for once is totally out the window. More unfortunately, there is just no magic in this one.First of all, magnificent performance by the beautiful Angelina Jolie as the titular protagonist. Absolutely charming and elegant, very strong on screen presence, basically she's the main reason why this film can't be considered a complete disaster. Just too bad she's not as evil as she's supposed to be here. Maleficent is portrayed as a powerful but kindhearted winged fairy who turns (slightly) evil and lives only for revenge after Stefan, played by Sharlto Copley (Elysium, District 9), abuses her love for him and steals her wings back to the castle to be the successor of the king. Hey, doesn't that sound familiar? Theodora in Oz the Great and Powerful anyone? However, her extreme evilness is shortlived in the film. She turns into a forgiving, caring and loving stalker to King Stefan's daughter, Aurora a.k.a. the eventual Sleeping Beauty. Awww, such a nice heroic ""Mistress of All Evil"". Not every story is how it was told, huh? Please, I'd rather go back to the original one. Makes no real difference.And on top of that, the length of the movie is actually too short for its concept. I was not emotionally engaged by the relationships between the characters at all. We all know what a great actor Sharlto Copley could be, but his lack of screen time makes Stefan quite a forced villain here. Poor script and rush development on the characters and their relationships are one of the worse combinations of disasters in film. And then the ending, well, if you've seen Frozen, you'd most likely be able to predict what's going to happen from miles away. I'm sorry, Robert Stromberg, but this isn't a very good directorial debut for you. It's pretty blur and dark in normal format. Might be good in 3D, I don't know. But the visuals are pretty spectacular, the cinematography is fantastic and the music score is brilliant as well. So the film does have a few upsides.After two Snow White film adaptations (Mirror, Mirror and Snow White & the Huntsman), Jack the Giant Slayer, Hansel and Gretel, one Oz prequel and this dross, all of which are quite rubbish, it's safe to say that Hollywood may never get gritty live action rehashes of classic fairy tales right. Why? They don't have to put the heart into the writing 'cause as long as it appears to be great visually, people would pay for it anyway.Final Ruling: The surprisingly long run of entertaining summer movies has finally come to an end, thanks to this surprisingly disappointing Disney film. However, the general audience, mostly kids and girls, will likely enjoy the film regardless of its obvious flaws.",Maleficent

This shows that representation in this very eye catching and terrific take of the classic anti hero.Angelina Jolie was an excellent choice for the lead role of Maleficent and she certainly shows off her skills as an actress in this fine film.

At times I wished I could go to sleep forever, or indeed, would this movie make me go to sleep forever.Annoying characters are prevalent throughout, I really wanted Aurora to get hurt by the end she was so unbelievably a pain in the backside.Angelina Jolie barely holds this thing together and it all feels rushed, to the point where the main event of the whole film barley lasts 30 seconds.Special effects are average, and those little fairies would get their wings clipped anywhere else with their rotten chat.All in all a total waste of time, not sure who's giving this decent ratings, but they need to wake up and smell the coffee.3/10 - but just for the special effects.",Maleficent

I saw it in regular format and I expect that it may have been a little better in 3D. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and although the audience was very mixed age wise there was a significant amount of applause at the end of the film and more than a few that remained to watch the credits scroll by.

470,Hendrik_Numiah,Beautiful and beautifully performed,9,9 September 2014,"I don't quite understand where most of the naysayers are coming from. This movie is obviously not meant to follow the exact story of Sleeping Beauty! Makes me wonder why people are that narrow minded they can't understand that.To the movie it is! As the title states, a beauty! From the first minutes on you get lured into a highly crafted fairy world. And with little effort you can imagine yourself being there or wishing you were part of it. The CGI's are of exceptional quality, sometimes making you guess if what you see is real or animated. Not being a big fan of Angelina I went in a little biased. Was I wrong! She performed the stars out of the sky imho. Cold when she needed to be cold, and warm when she meant to be fuzzy. The way she pronounced ""Beasty"" made me glow and tingly all over. Elle Fanning is turning out to be a great actress with a great future ahead. Not dull at all. The make-up is from another world as well. The brute forms and the deep red lips (MAC) indented my retinas for the rest of my life.Story wise it's very entertaining as well. You get dragged into the story from the get go and it won't release you till the end. Of course it's a fairy tale. And as usual all fairy tales have a happy ending. We all know that going in.

472,BoyWiththeGreenHair,"Wicked meets Mommie Dearest, with ""Frozen"" flavor",5,10 June 2014,"""Sleeping Beauty,"" like ""Fantasia,"" would take several decades to ""catch on"" with audiences. It took decades to materialize, stunted first by WWII, and then by Walt Disney's venturing into other projects (ex. Wonderful World of Disney, Disneyland, Live Action, etc.). The final product would be a box office bomb, in the long run gaining no favors with Walt Disney who would look back on the project with negative memories. How ironic that one of the top moneymakers of the summer is a takeoff of this initially ill-received classic. The lingering question, however, is ""does Maleficent measure up to the original material?"" Short answer, no.I'll preface this by saying, ""I know, it isn't supposed to be a remake of the animated film."" I'm also aware of the fact that Angelina Jolie allegedly agreed to the production at the behest of her son, and so any serious or considerably ""dark"" adaptation was unlikely from the start, and my initial expectation wasn't high. What really marked a change in my expectation was upon learning that Linda Woolverton was brought on board as the screenwriter. With this knowledge I came to expect more than just ""a blockbuster,"" but rather a sophisticated piece of storytelling with both a thought-provoking message and first-class dialogue. And, don't get me wrong, at first I wasn't disappointed. The opening lines are sheer poetry. As such, I was willing to hold my nose and tolerate the opening image of a ""toddler Maleficent."" The establishment of Maleficent's back-story at least isn't unbearable, but is mildly interesting, in all its absurdity. But, by the time the story kicks into high gear, they've lost me, and I get the impression I wasn't alone. Woolverton and the other filmmakers on board are seriously asking us to believe, in a matter of speaking, that Maleficent is basically some Sorority girl Stefan slept with in College, before subjecting her to a panty raid that made his reputation and traumatized her, leading her to cyber-stalk him and his daughter for decades.The segue from Maleficent's backstory into the main action is on its own rife with some bizarre changes that are clumsy enough for a writer with Woolverton's level of experience to know not to make them. You wonder why the third fairy's incantation ""gift"" to the Princess is cut off at all, if Maleficent is only going to soften the curse for the King, herself.We're also asked to believe that if it hadn't been for Maleficent, the constant squabbling and inability to cooperate between the three fairies would have literally doomed the child from the start; a sign of disrespect to the original story.Aurora might get all the merchandising, and Phillip might awaken her from her sleep, but the heroes of the film are without a doubt the fairies. They're the ones who make the sacrifices, act on their own initiative, and take the risks in the film, surpassing even Mulan for spunk. And, so to reduce them to mere caricatures; bumbling female counterparts to the Three Stooges whose recklessness endangers the life of the princess, is a gigantic middle finger to the original source. Ironically the most enjoyable moments in the film come from the comic relief provided Staunton, Manville, and Temple. These actresses seem to have an understanding that this ""retelling,"" as Wolverton puts it, isn't to be taken seriously. They see the humor in the material and exploit it for all its worth with astute effectiveness.The direction King Stefan has been taken in is an interesting one which should have been explored with more depth. His performance, on its own merit, is seasoned and well done. The fault lies squarely on the writers' laziness to depict him as a one-note character whose obsession blinds him to all else. His decline into madness is entirely unconvincing; too abrupt and sudden to be accepted by the audience, even if it is meant to be a deterioration of sixteen years. By the end Copley has been reduced to overacting to the point where his menace is as comical as the fairies' bickering.Elle Fanning is entirely wrong for the part of Aurora. Aurora is perhaps the original film's most valued asset. She moves like a princess, she sings like a princess, and she carries herself like a princess, even if she doesn't know she is one. Elle Fanning comes off as confused, bored, and uninspired, almost literally wandering in and out of scenes with little rhyme or reason. If at least, the ""Fairy Godmother"" line was funny the first time, cute the second, but for the umpteenth time, pretty tired. This is the third Disney film, to my knowledge, which takes a shot at the ""love at first sight"" concept through the failure of the ""handsome prince"" to awaken the Princess with ""true love's first kiss,"" the other two being ""Frozen"" and ""Enchanted."" This is getting to be more than formulaic. I get it; ""love at first sight"" is unrealistic. But, its representative of a time when courtly love was a fixture in Western society, when marriage was a political tool. ""Love at first sight"" is no longer promoted in society at large, and therefore the satire falls flat as a result. Woolverton twice questions as to whether we, the audience, know the story of Sleeping Beauty as well as we think we do. But, by the film's end, I can only wonder how well Woolverton herself knows the story.",Maleficent
473,crithaslife,Plot holes and bad performances,4,31 December 2014,"Kind of strange movie. First we see a little fairy, very happy and cheerful playing with creatures and loving a random thief. Then she gets fooled by the same child who has now become a greedy man and wants the throne and has her wings cut off. So she becomes REALLYYY angry. Therefore she curses the new king's young child. Okay acceptable so far. That fairy queen, all she does for 16 years is making the three babysitting fairies' lives miserable? And then she becomes a good fairy again because what?? She sees the little child playing with the creatures? And because she sees that she is happy?? How can she trust a human after what happened to her and have true love for the girl and no vengeful thoughts?? I mean, she is supposed to be evil come on...The greedy man who seduces her after a long time, instead of killing her, he decides to cut her wings? His love doesn't let him kill her but he can cut her wings without remorse? She is the most badass fairy being able to transform that guy into a dragon but when she is surrounded she can't do anything to just escape at least? That scene was so forced in order to make the drama with the wings-getting- attached-again.Angelina Jolie's performance was okay I guess and fit the role. Sharlto Copley on the other hand was very unconvincing as he unsuccessfully tried to be mad and bad at the same time. Elle Fanning was also okay but nothing special. I don't know if she has talent but, taking her beauty into account, I'm pretty sure she will have a promising career as a Hollywood actress in the future.Overall not a film that makes you want to stop watching before it ends but it's a medium-to-bad-quality film in all aspects. 4/10",Maleficent
474,oceanofblue,What to do with this one?,4,3 July 2014,"No, seriously, what to do with this one? I admit that I am a huge fan of the original Disney-story of Maleficent and of the character of Maleficent itself. I am not a Disney-puritan however and I like to keep an open mind in re-telling stories.Since they promised us that we we're able to learn more of Maleficent and how she became ""The mistress of all evil"" I was excited and so eager to go see it. So when the big night of world premiere had arrived I was there front row.The opening monologue was somehow cliché and told to many times before to actually be worthy of being used (that all men were bad people and they wanted war and so on). However, to be used as a setting, it was okay. I wasn't surprised to see her as a good fairy first, after all, it was the story of the creation of her being evil. The war between the guardians and men was well done and a great starter for what was about to come. At least I thought so. But when Stephan, a squire, had the chance to become king by betraying Maleficent you knew how the story would go. Right? Think again. Let's go fast forward. Maleficent is betrayed, Stephan becomes king, king gets daughter, three good fairies bestow a gift on the child, Maleficent curses her... Stop! Until this point, everything was just like in the original movie. Even some quotes were exactly like the classic and I was on the edge of my seat. I adored Angelina Jolie as Maleficent up to that point.Now, this is where things are going from bad to worse. Nothing of the classic remains at his stake. Maleficent knows where Aurora is from day one, in the classic: she was furious of not knowing where she was after almost sixteen years. The three fairies (who has changed names apparently: what was wrong with Merryweather?)were incapable of taking care of Aurora letting her starve to death or almost fall of a cliff. Maleficent had to save her from being killed by those three. Think that's bad? It can get worse. When Aurora grows older she eventually becomes friends with Maleficent and Maleficent even wants to reverse the curse. No, no and no. Mistress of all evil? Come on, she developing a mother feeling about Aurora which she lovingly calls her little beastie.Prince Philip, where is he? Where's the handsome prince she met once upon a dream? Just came by on his horse apparently for a miserable five minutes. Oh, but he will come save the day on the end. You wait.Aurora's returned to her father and instead of embracing his daughter he locks her up as he is trying to kill Maleficent, almost driven insane by the thought of it.Fast forwarding to the scene of it all. The true love's kiss. The prince, brought in by Maleficent (come on, really?) kisses her... And nothing happens. It is Maleficent who accidentally awakens Aurora by kissing her on the forehead. No come on, don't do that. Than we get a battle scene between Maleficent and Stephan. The raven turns into the dragon (no way in hell). And surprisingly Maleficent wins the fight, is alive and kicking whilst Stephan falls to his death. Ending with the movie that Aurora becomes queen of the fairyland with maleficent by her side.Now, OK guys, I really do keep an open mind in re-telling the stories, but this is absolutely ridiculous. And I feel so sorry for Angelina Jolie who is just simply stunning as Maleficent. I'd only wish the directors stayed true to the actual story, the actual characters and the actual setting. If they did, they had gold in their hands. But now, the only thing that is keeping this whole movie at his feet is just the pure good acting by Angelina Jolie. If anybody else had played Maleficent in this setting with this script, it would be the very first time I had to call a Disney-movie an abomination and not worthy to be purchased.",Maleficent
475,cuckovvanja,"Beautiful, Bit Weird but outstanding (Spoiler)!",10,8 June 2014,"I watched this movie and I loved it. I don't know why all the negative responds to this movie. The movie is like sleeping beauty to the tenth power and plus so much more. Maleficent tells a new kind of story and every single cast member is born for his role. The part I liked most about this film was the visual (3D) effects, they were amazing. It is a beautiful story. It it not only connected to sleeping beauty it is also connected to life. How Maleficent and King Stefan were in love and how he betrayed her and he got greedy. She gets hurt and betrayed by the one she loves and trusts and in some points we all get hurt in our life. This film is full of beautiful creatures and lands. The movies is just magical in every single way.I think they should have changed the name into Magnificent. So basically my advice to you is : IGNORE THE TRAILER, GO SEE IT!",Maleficent
476,evanlyn,"""Stunning visuals, but cliché story"" // Maleficent (2014)",8,6 June 2014,"You know the tale. Since 1959, Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"" has told the story of how the evil Maleficent curses princess Aurora to prick her finger on a spinning wheel and fall into a death- like sleep, only to be awoken by a true love's kiss. ""Maleficent"" tells the story you were not told: the story behind the Mistress of Evil.In ""Maleficent"", we see the iconic character grow up from a young and naive girl with wings, to a vengeful, cold and evil witch – without wings. Maleficent grows up as a faerie in the Moors, the magical kingdom right next to the human one. There is no love lost between the magical creatures and the humans, until one day a boy shows up in the Moors. Young Maleficent falls in love with Stefan, but ultimately, he betrays her and takes her wings from her. She then transforms into the Maleficent you know, and secretly love, and even beyond that.This updated version of the classic shows you how closely Maleficent and Aurora are intertwined. In the classic, Maleficent is just the evil with who can magically turn into a dragon at the end of the film and ultimately dies. But in ""Maleficent"", she is Aurora's guardian angel. Maleficent takes care of the girl and when the two finally meet in person, a friendship emerges. Aurora calls Maleficent her faerie godmother and after a while, Maleficent realizes she loves the girl she originally cursed.Angelina Jolie, who portrays the title-role in ""Maleficent"", really captures Maleficent's essence and transformed the classic cartoon character in a real person, with motives for her iconic evil actions. The Maleficent from the original cartoon film was just plain evil – like all bad guys in Disney films. But the reason behind Maleficent's evilness was never explained and in this new version, it is. When Maleficent was younger, she fell in love with a boy named Stefan. But he had grand ambitions and betrayed Maleficent to become king: he took her wings from her.Jolie splendidly portrays a young Maleficent, who transforms from a young, naive, but strong fairy into a heart-broken and betrayed young woman, without wings. She makes Maleficent real and relatable, something she never was in the cartoon. ""I do think no one else could have played Maleficent,"" Elle Fanning says of Jolie to Vogue UK.Elle Fanning, what's not to love about this young actress? She's young, she's fresh, she's talented and she has a contagious laughter. Fanning is the perfect cast for princess Aurora.To IndieWire the actress says she grew up watching the classic ""Sleeping Beauty"": ""Yes, it's my favorite one! I thought I related her to the most because I had the long blonde hair. Cinderella had the bangs. I was like, ""Aurora is like me!"" She was mine, haha.""The visuals are absolutely stunning. Director Robert Stromberg, who is also the production designer of visual effect-heavy films like Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" and James Cameron's ""Avatar"", does a fantastic job in creating the magical world of the Moors and the characters that originate from this world. For example, the three faeries that take care of Aurora until she turns sixteen, are beautifully computer animated from actresses Imelda Staunton, Lesley Manville and Juno Temple.The costumes and make-up are perfect. Jolie does not look like an exact copy of the cartoon character of Maleficent: she is a new and better version. ""The whole concept of how Maleficent would look came very much from Angelina (Jolie),"" costume designer Anna Sheppard says to National Post. ""She was very much into this character and there wasn't strict guidance from the studio to create this character and costume and makeup."" Rumor has it that Jolie's costume was too frightening for the young actresses who were supposed to play a five year old Aurora. Luckily, Jolie found the solution in her own trailer: her daughter Vivienne. The scene were mother and daughter play opposite each other, automatically brings a smile to your face. Maleficent's opposite Aurora has also very opposite costumes. This emphasizes the differences between the two characters beautifully. ""I wanted her very nymph-like, someone who is very innocent, simple and very fluid,"" Sheppard says. ""And also very different from anyone else in the movie.""Unfortunately, the story of ""Maleficent"" was not that original. Obviously, it was a good decision to write a new story on Maleficent's background and her relationship to Aurora – but her history was too cliché. Of course Maleficent had a romantic history with Aurora's father! Of course he broke her heart and thus drove her to taking revenge on his daughter with another woman! It just feels too cliché and too obvious that Maleficent turned evil because of a broken heart. Maleficent's back-story would be much stronger if something else turned her dark.However, there was also a very positive side of this new take on the story. You know how Aurora falls into a death-like sleep and is kissed awake by her true love prince Philip. But, in ""Maleficent"", Aurora does not wake up after the prince kisses her, but after Maleficent's kiss on her forehead. To collider.com, Elle Fanning says: ""It's more of a maternal love and a friendship love that wins out, over a romantic love with a guy. That was a nice take on it.""I did not know this when I walked into the cinema, but apparently ""Maleficent"" is in 3D. The 3D, however, is absolutely unnecessary. I cannot think of one scene or feature in the film that would have required 3D-glasses – the visuals are already stunning without 3D and in my opinion, it has been a waste of budget. This money could have been better spent, on writing a better background story, perhaps.",Maleficent
477,bsingh_p,Great! Story showed what true love really is!,8,25 October 2014,"Pros: The change of Story -This film is great as it approaches the take on Maleficent in a more realistic way compared to the Disney Animation movie Sleeping Beauty. It was interesting to show Maleficent as the hero in the end and that she delivered true love's kiss to Anora and not the prince.It would have been stupid to show the prince kiss her and let that be true love, because its unrealistic as he didn't know her and therefore is not true love. The story showed what true love is - Maleficent cared about Anora and understood her. So, that was interesting and well done. Cons: 1. Well the story did good on the change but it felt fast paced and unstructured, and more could have been shown in there. 2. The world felt small and restricted the people involved. For instance, the prince came from another kingdom which was never shown. 3. The action scenes were boring, especially the last scene with the dragon. In the Disney Animation the dragon scene was made to feel epic and huge but here it felt small and really rushed. There was no suspense in the scene.Overall:I liked it! It was Great, could have been better though.",Maleficent
478,steve-ziker,"A ""Sleeping Beauty"" that's NOT for Kids!",8,1 June 2014,"Like most of the reviews so far, I can acknowledge that Angeline Jolie was the perfect Actress for this role and that the Visuals were as stunning as anything from Avatar. And, while not expecting much from this upside down and backwards reboot of the ""Sleeping Beauty"" fairy tale, I was pleasantly surprised by the time the credits rolled. That said, this movie is DEFINITELY not for young children! I would have given the movie a PG-13 rating for the scary scenes which occurred frequently throughout the movie. Unfortunately, in today's world of PG-13 acceptance of nudity and sex scenes and foul language, the PG-13 would not be appropriate for mere scariness for young kids. I noticed a real scarceness of very young children in the showing that I attended with my wife and in discussions with the Theater Manager, she noted that there have not been many young children at the Friday and Saturday viewings. This is NOT Disney for the young set! They will be too frightened at the scary bits and they won't understand the basic story line at all. This is a very Dark, Brothers Grimm style fairy Tale. In my view, it works very well for Adults and any teens who are not bored by the whole Disney thing, so get a baby sitter for the little ones and go see this movie without them!",Maleficent
479,Mneo,7 points for it's apparently too childish for children over 7,7,2 July 2014,"For those who haven't yet seen it, it's a darn sight better than other blockbusters around this time when summer break is around the corner, ""Godzilla"",""Transformers 4"" touting only action scenes because those special effects set them back a mint, though it's also much more of a sight for sore eyes.Yet the transition of Maleficent from a villain to an antihero looks still out of place after all the rigmarole of King Stefan's painstaking revenge for Maleficent's spell on his newborn daughter, which makes little sense considering his frivolous decision to choose maybe the most unlikely babysitters that are the three pixies to tend to Aurora, who would have died a much earlier premature death had Maleficent not been there.And when the prince came nowhere close to the ending of our old fairy tale, in his place, Maleficent kissed Aurora awake, and the crow-man murmured ""true love"", it was absolutely dream-shattering for kids and augurs well for a larger lesbian community in the decade to come, the crow-man might as well have taken out and waved a rainbow flag, shouting ""It's never true when it's not gay!"", ripping his clothes off, unhooking his bra, otherwise the message is just too subtle for kids.After all, it's a good movie. The first half hour was dreamy and hypnotizing, the rest of it so hypnotizing that my eyelids felt heavy.",Maleficent
480,duchessofpercy,A Dark Feminist's Fairy Tale... Not fit for children.,3,15 January 2015,"The only thing worth seeing, in this movie, is the CGI. It is beautifully done. Although, I found the 3 fairies quite disturbing looking creatures and thus very unsettling... I would give it an 8 for the CGI. But the movie... Well, that's quite another story.They haven't 'respected the classic' the original story. If so, Maleficent would be evil. The original is a story of good vs. evil, right vs. might and a lesson that love conquers all. But rather than that simple formula... THIS is a story of a jilted/betrayed lover who seeks revenge through an innocent child. To me... that is NOT respecting the original story AND it didn't bring us what we 'love about this story'. It isn't 'a different, but classic fairy tale'. The formula for a 'Classic' fairy tale is that there are no muddled lines between good and evil. This one muddles all the way through.I didn't see ANYTHING in this movie that was even remotely reminiscent of the original. Only the names and the spindle. It was just a dark and horrible story... I wouldn't bring my kids to see it. This isn't a lesson of good's triumph over evil... this is some sort of warped tale of psychological excuses for bad or deviant behavior. Instead of teaching children right is right and wrong is wrong... it teaches that wrong can be right just so long as the person doing wrong thinks it's fair or even worse... can't be helped. This anti-hero worship mentality is not what ANY child needs and is the ruin of our society. ""Let's root for the bad guy! Let's understand the bad guy! The bad guy IS the hero!"" ""No one is truly bad... everyone who does evil has a 'backstory' that made them that way. Pity the refuse of society. The things they do are either learned or they were born that way... but either way... they are justified or can't help it. We should never blame or judge anyone's behavior as truly bad, because they must have a reason for being this way that could not be avoided. Don't blame me... others actions MADE me do it. I am right in whatever I do, when I feel I have been wronged. Two wrongs don't make it right, it makes it fair. Everything is excusable so long as I can think of an excuse.""So, first, she is right to want revenge and then she was right for trying to undo it and then she was right to defend herself. It would seem she is always right regardless because, right is perceived and judged against the emotion of the day... so long as she 'felt' it was right, at the time... she was never wrong. No matter what she was doing... she was always right. She was just a victim of some selfish man. ""Men are putzes and men are evil."" Show me one decent male role model in this story. Her companion was a weak tool governed by her, his apparent 'feminine side' was his only saving grace. The prince was just a pretty face, shallow and likely governed by his hormones. The king was a user, a phony... governed by his greed. The message here is... ""Women don't need men. Men are motivated and controlled by their lusts and women are motivated by their heart and purest emotions. Women should be strong and not be fooled by a man's affections. When people do bad, it must have been for a good reason and really isn't wrong of them. Bad behavior doesn't warrant our anger or judgement but begs our understanding and compassion. Any attempt at a classic good vs. evil concept... only seems to appear in this movie in the vein of ""women being good and strong vs men being evil and weak"". To conclude this story, somehow, meant to convey that 'Love conquers all' is a sham. This movie is pure feminist and thug raising tripe. This movie is unfit for children. No 'beauty' appears in this dark tale... Alas! It must have been 'sleeping'.﻿I am certain Mr. Walt Disney is rolling over in his grave... AGAIN and AGAIN over stuff like this.This totally DESTROYED the Disney Original... It basically told every viewer, flat out... You were lied to. The first story was just a pack of lies your parents told you, they have been lying about Maleficent for ages. Poor Maleficent... Evil parents! What other lies have your parents told you? Santa? The Easter Bunny? How dare they make you believe in fictitious characters and happily ever afters... they don't exist. Bad is good and good is bad and everything your parents try to tell you is a lie. Mr. Disney would have NEVER done that and certainly NEVER would have approved. Fantasies, hopes, dreams, imaginations and the innocence of children was to be protected and encouraged at all costs.",Maleficent
481,Cconfehr,"Beautiful costumes, scenes and a fresh look at Sleeping Beauty.",5,14 July 2014,"The movie was beautiful, Angleina Jolie's cheekbones are magnificent, her horns are envy worthy and I am really enjoying how Disney is starting to show the Villains side of the story. Oh and not to mention Maleficent's leather outfit at the end. I mean... If anything is a ""must see"" in the movie, it is that outfit.Maleficent is about a fairy (named Maleficent) who, as a child, meets a human boy (Stefan). They spend a lot of time together while growing up and learn to trust each other. When Stefan is grown, he stops coming to visit her. The next time he sees her is in a battle, years later, when the corrupt King tries to invade the beautiful land that she and the rest of the magical creatures live in. During the battle, Maleficent defeats the King and before he dies he claims ""Whoever kills Maleficent will be my successor."" Well, Stefan  knows he can regain her trust and kill her to become King.  He then drugs her and attempts to kill her but cannot. His solution to still be the Kings successor? Take her wings from her and offer them to the King.So from there, they fight. And this is where the story of Sleeping Beauty comes in. Idk - it was good, the interactions between Aurora and Maleficent are funny and sweet. But it felt very rushed and almost too ""Disney"". There's a really intense scene where Maleficent is choking someone and there is a really long pause for effect and she says ""IT'S. OVER."" Now, I would typically expect some sort of profanity or a stronger line than that, but that's what they went with. So.Oh. And the crow is hilarious. Moral of the story: don't cast a spell that ""nothing on earth can break"" and there's always two sides to a story.If you like Disney, go see it. If there are other movies you want to see (Chef, 22 Jump Street, How to Train Your Dragon 2, A million Ways to Die in the West, Million Dollar Arm, Jersey Boys, Neighbors, Blended, Spider Man, The Other Woman...)

I based everything solely on the commercials so I was very surprised by a lot of the twists in the movie. It shows how she was BEFORE she became the ""evil"" Maleficent.There were also a lot of scenes in the film that cracked me up, like when she would put the sleeping spell on people who annoyed her...that was hilarious just how the people would slowly begin floating away as they slept.Anyway, great movie and I would recommend it to anyone.

Disney's new re-telling of sleeping beauty is really nice. The movie won't match the grandeur of The Lord of the Rings! But isn't as bad as John Carter too. The movie is a heart warming re-telling of Sleeping beauty who when turns sixteen will sleep forever and will only be awaken by kiss of true love.

484,flagmichael,... like a woman scorned.,9,9 June 2014,"Disney, right? I expected a pleasant movie with two-dimensional characters and maybe a nice soundtrack. A wicked villain was a foregone conclusion. What I saw was something very different, very much darker, with genuine human meaning. Wickedness is one thing, but this is a study in the contagion of sheer evil feeding on very normal human emotions. My wife and I watched it partly to see if it was okay for our grandchildren, who are okay with Godzilla and Jurassic Park. Hah! A battle scene had already convinced us the wee ones were not ready yet, but later scenes, including one of unvarnished horror, makes this movie under-rated at PG... I don't recommend it for teens under 16. But for adults it is a great film. The same human passions make it fascinating and Angelina Jolie delivers the performance beautifully. Of course the visual effects are stunning, but even there the characters' emotions come through. What hath Disney wrought? We have always assumed a G rating for Disney films but this is several steps into the darkness. As with Breaking Bad, I find myself wishing it were not done so very well.",Maleficent
485,miguel-p-fernandes,Not even Jolie can save this disgrace,2,30 June 2014,"I went into this movie thinking it would be a nice movie from Disney, since I had heard it was a darker adaptation from the classic Sleeping Beauty, from the perspective of the villain. And I still think it's a great idea and still expect to see the same thing with other classics, even if in this case the idea was very poorly executed.Starting with the director, it was a risky bet by Disney, because Robert Stromberg had never directed a movie (his work is almost exclusively visual effects). And it didn't pay off. Even though he did a good job adapting from the original story, there were some parts where the story and some actions from the characters didn't make sense at all. Then the acting was also sad. Bad acting from the three fairies (Lesley Manville, Imelda Staunton, Juno Temple) and from all the male characters, especially Sharlto Copley. Angelina Jolie did a good job. Not her best, of course, but a solid acting.The idea of Maleficient was to tell the story of Sleeping Beauty from the perspective of Maleficient, but it didn't even give depth to the character! There are holes on the story and that hurts it pretty bad.The images and effects were also very average and not good enough for 2014.Overall, the movie wasn't appealing at all and the story, acting, and effects were weak. However, I applaud the idea and hope Disney learns from this movie's mistakes and do more of these kind of movies, but much better.",Maleficent

Angelina Jolie delivers one of the most interesting performances ever portraying the titled character. Based on Disney's Sleeping Beauty, Maleficent is one of the most iconic villains ever to grace the screens during its classic run in the late 50's. This time Maleficent takes center stage as the main character which shows us what lead her to proclaimed herself as the Mistress of All Evil. Don't get confuse with the whole fairy with angel wings though, but do enjoy the rich visuals and fantastic creatures shown in this film. I've seen my fair share of winged characters in other films before and met with either disappointment or mediocre response but none had offer so far, one of the most breath taking flight sequence I had ever seen. In this film, Maleficent loves flying and she shows it. Don't get too surprise if you catch a moment of Maleficent in superhero mode. Her means for this were well justified. So for those of you who enjoyed watching 'Mirror Mirror', 'Snow White and the Huntsman' and 'Alice in Wonderland' this is definitely the movie to get your fairy tale fix.",Maleficent

I don't have to say a single word about people like Anastacia Jelly or Ally Winning or whoever the actresses were... it doesn't really matter - they disappeared in it. All I need to say is: if you're into fairy tales, GO WATCH IT!I went to see the 3D version. I, the big, fat, bearded and balding guy, started bawling in the beginning, bawled out of sorrow, bawled out of happiness, bawled out of distress. I nearly walked out because I couldn't stand the suspension! To tell the truth, my body ached afterwards - I had been tense the entire film, muttering ""no no no no no"" and ""f--- f--- f--- f--- f---"" under my breath, grimacing, smiling, crying, going ""awwww""...This is the most adorable story I've ever been told. So adorable that after the film I took a walk around the square, called two friends who had seen it... and walked right back into the cinema and watched the 2D version.

Well....I think most of us who loved this movie absolutley sympathized and felt like protecting her when she had her wings torn apart. Then and there, Maleficent won my bleeding heart. This is easily one of my top 5 favorite fantasy films by now. The fantasy scenery is completely magical. Angelina Jolie interpreted both the characters vulnerability and strength perfectly. The plot was exceptional as I could not guess what would happen next when I first saw it. I could see a correlation to real life heartbreak and how we evolve to ""something else"", maybe even a villain, from there.

First why is King Stefan evil? why did he send Aurora to live with the three fairies until she is 16? is he crazy? the curse stated that she will go into a sleep like death when she is 16 so why the hell will he send his daughter away all those years and never even visit her? he could have made her live with them until she is 16 and protected her in the castle or told the fairies to come and protect her on that day.and coming to the fairies they portray them as idiots! the good fairies are idiots? and Prince Philip is not the true love of Aurora? what nonsense! finally the motherly kiss of Maleficent lifts the curse? she put it on in the first place!and finally Maleficent kills Stefan (Aurora's father) and Aurora is happy about that? what the hell?Really a silly movie, I gave it 2/10 just because of the CGI which Hollywood seem to think that this will save all movies not good writing and casting!",Maleficent

Ultimately the characters, and the world they inhabit are just not like able enough, something Disney usually does very well. A decent enough way to pass a quiet evening, but not memorable or moving or even thrilling, just okay. The look of the film resembles a Lord of the rings movie mixed in with something like Alice in Wonderland, even similar looking creatures. So its sort of nothing new, neither is the all too familiar checklist of computer generated effects, armies and battles and enormous castles, and fire and dragons and flying through obstacles at high speed.

495,StrongRex,This is NOT Maleficent,1,1 June 2014,"I was genuinely excited to hear that Disney was going to make a film about Maleficent, my favorite Disney villain of all time. I was interested in knowing the 'why' behind her actions in Sleeping Beauty, since we never really got to see that. I will say that the cinematography is amazing. I will also say that while Angelina Jolie was not my first choice, she had the look, her costume was spot-on, and there are moments where you can see where she is at least trying to play this role correctly (and really, who could replace Eleanor Audley?). But one thing I've noticed over the past 10-15 years is that animation and design seem to be their main focus, rather than story or character development. In the movie, Maleficent's back story was incredibly rushed. So much for going into depth on why Maleficent is the way she is.This movie does not explain why Maleficent is the way she is. Disney is showing us a completely different character while giving her the same name as Disney's most iconic villain. Now they're trying to say that Maleficent is a misunderstood character who becomes evil. But that never happens. She becomes angry and bitter, but not evil. Maleficent in this movie is not even a misunderstood, sympathetic character. She is a total victim who never becomes evil at all.Oh, she does do one evil thing; she does still curse King Stefan's baby out of revenge. And she has second thoughts about it two seconds afterward. See? Not evil at all. And while I'm at it, I should mention my distaste for the way she cursed Aurora: Disney completely lowered the stakes by having Maleficent utter the words ""sleep-like death"" and be the one to offer the cure of True Love's kiss. No! It's MERRYWEATHER that counters the DEATH curse in order to save Aurora's life! Oh, Maleficent may say later that she doesn't believe True Love exists, but that's a matter of opinion isn't it? Again, LOWERS THE STAKES.And what was Linda Woolverton thinking when she took King Stefan and the three fairies completely out of character and gives them a complete 180 in order to make Maleficent look good? If you're going to show us the point of view of a famous villain, it's okay to give them layers and gray areas in order to make them more interesting and multi- dimensional, even to show they weren't always evil. But NOT to say they were never evil at all; that just completely defeats the point of the character! Same with the good guys; they may have their own flaws, show that they have their own prejudices, or that everything they did wasn't perfect. But NOT to say ""the good guys were really EVIL OR STUPID!""The fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather (I refuse to call them by their new names) are NOTHING like they were in Sleeping Beauty, and this is a big deal. In Sleeping Beauty, say what you will about their flaws but their ultimate motivation was keeping Aurora SAFE. At least they tried, even if they failed! Maleficent (2014) portrays them as nothing more than stupid buffoons who only care about saving their own skins. Aurora was just a means to an end for them; they have no relationship with her like they do in the original. The movie also took away their own personalities, so they are no different from each other. I can't even keep track of which fairy has which name! Watching them on screen with everything they say or do was as cringe worthy as I expected it to be. King Stefan has to be one of worst written villains I have seen in a while. He has no real motivation for what he does; we see him as having nothing in the beginning, and then the movie glosses over his relationship with Maleficent in order to ""get to the good part"" where he steals her wings in order to be king. After that, he wages war on Maleficent for cursing his daughter, and yet he only looks at Aurora as afterthought property. Why is he even after Maleficent then? What else has she done to him other than cursing his daughter?Elle Fanning as Aurora was very impressive. I do think she gave the character more of a personality that was lacking in the original, and she stole the film in every scene she was in. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to save the movie, nor were Maleficent's interactions with Diaval, as enjoyable as they were. And of course, Maleficent does not turn into a dragon in this movie. I have to ask; why, Disney? You knew how loved of a villain Maleficent is, and her being a dragon is one of the many reasons why. Also, we live in an age where technology and special effects are abundant; you didn't use the opportunity to see how your most iconic villain looks as a dragon when done with live-action CGI? Why would you waste a perfectly good opportunity like that? Besides the fact that Maleficent is not evil in this film, she also is very wimpy and pathetic. She can't do ANYTHING. When we see her fight an army at the beginning, all she does is fly around and slap a few soldiers with her wings. The tree monsters did most of her fighting for her. In Sleeping Beauty, she could transport herself to another place in a matter of seconds, she could shoot lightning from her staff, and she could transform into another form other than her own. She didn't do any of that in this movie. Just like with Alice in Wonderland, Disney wasted a perfectly good opportunity to effectively adapt their animated work to the live-action screen. Maleficent may not be the absolute worst movie I've seen, but it's definitely in my bottom list now.",Maleficent
496,Movie_Fanatic_Down_Under,Maleficent? More like Magnificent!,9,28 May 2014,"IGNORE THE TRAILER: GO SEE IT!I saw this movie tonight with a friend and it was spectacular. Going in, I was excited as a life-long Disney fan but also expecting a somewhat cheesy good-vs-evil type of movie based on what I had seen in the trailer. I couldn't have been more wrong! Angelina Jolie delivers an amazing performance and makes a well-known, previously rather one- dimensional Disney villain relate-able and more sympathetic, while also managing to look like a convincing, gorgeous, magical creature.The CGI is a tad heavy and a little freaky at times (such as the three coloured pixies/Aunts) but was used, in combination with some amazing sets, to create a fantastic world and creatures which were reminiscent of the beautiful and imaginative work in movies such as ""Hellboy 2"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"". The effort by the art team here really helps to draw you into Maleficent's world at the beginning of the movie and makes you wish you were a kid growing up with this movie as fodder for your imagination.Although Maleficent's character has been humanised in this re-telling, the story really emphasises that she isn't human at all, and explores the ins and outs of her life and how she relates to the humans she encounters.The plot for this movie really fits into the current trend of exploring the anti-hero (Breaking Bad, Hannibal...) and shows that Disney is trying to break with its past depiction of characters being black and white, good or evil, etc.I feel like I am gushing over this film, but as a Disney classic lover I have been truly impressed by what is sure to be a new favourite with kids and adults equally. I do expect some controversy over parts of the film but I won't discuss those here.",Maleficent
497,radulovicka,Great expectations...,5,22 August 2014,"As a true Disney child, I used to watch Sleeping Beauty over and over again, till I knew all the lines and all the songs by heart. It remains one of my favorite cartoons of all time. Having said that, I had high expectations from Maleficent. I was disappointed. As a prequel to the original story, we were expecting some major alterations to take place, in accordance with contemporary mass Hollywood agenda of lightweight storytelling, resulting in huge summer box office success and even bigger revenues from popcorn sales. Let me start of by saying how plastic-y and CGI-heavy the visuals were. Even by fairytale standards, they were absolutely unrealistic and unconvincing, as was pretty much everything else in the movie. Character development was almost non-existent, despite a few twists which were to be anticipated mere seconds before they were revealed on screen, leaving the atmosphere of utter discontent and ultimately posing a question ""Who is supposed to be the target audience?"". For example, King Stefan and the three fairy godmothers were so naively and superficially depicted that it almost reached a point of absurd. They were by far the biggest disappointment. Casting Jolie as Maleficent proved to be a good choice from the visual point of view - she is stunning, but her acting wasn't so pleasing. Fanning's Aurora is sweet and innocent and it would've been a delight to have more of her on-screen presence, but only if it was followed by a decent plot. With the original Sleeping Beauty you knew what to expect - it's a cartoon, so it must be for children, right? But even so, the cartoon is still a masterpiece, cleverly and charmingly combining the everyday goofiness of the characters together with the ultimate evil, followed by a classic true love theme, and lastly an amazing soundtrack, making it a joyful experience for viewers of any age. In my opinion, not only does ""Maleficent"" lack charisma, but is also insecure about its genre, making it an in-between-type-of-movie - not entirely for children nor the adults. I pains me to see that a story with such potential for serious re-interpretation is diluted down to a mediocre and worn out tale of war between good and evil, when in fact it could have been a masterpiece. If only Hollywood would grew a pair...",Maleficent
498,wlsanders,Protecting?,8,13 July 2019,"I LOVE stories that show the villain's side of what happened. The fact that Maleficent's (not Philip's) kiss is what wakes Aurora is the same as that Elsa's love (not Hans') is what thaws Anna in Frozen.
One thing that TOTALLY confuses me: after the King's decree, Stefen tells Maleficent he had to warn her. This implies that he cut off her wings to PROTECT her (to convince everyone else that she was dead, so that no one else would kill her). However, when she shows up at Aurora's christening, he doesn't TELL HER THIS; instead, he says ""You weren't wanted.""",Maleficent
499,StepsCheerBSB,Different Adaptation,7,26 December 2014,"I was very excited to see this film but didn't have the time to see it in theaters. I rented the movie tonight and got upset towards the end of the film. I'm a fan of Angelina Jolie and have watched several of her interviews on television and can say that I know her values. I can tell that a lot of her values were implemented in this version of ""Sleeping Beauty."" There were many deviations from the 1959 cartoon version of ""Sleeping Beauty"" to the point I may have to re-watch the original film. I don't want to give too many spoilers away but there are at least three major plot twists that are not correlated with the Disney adaptation. This bothered me because I grew up with this movie and to change something as major as ""True Love's Kiss"" is what makes it a different film. As a filmmaker, if you're going to do a reboot/prequel/spin-off (or whatever you want to call it) at least have all the major elements the same so that it flows with the original film. I will say, they do mention that it's ""not exactly how you remembered/heard it"" which would be fine if the changes were subtle like in the movie ""Ever After.""Going back to Angelina's values, I remember reading that she doesn't like to play the villain in films because of her children. In this film, *spoiler alert* she plays both hero and villain. The reason I wanted to watch this film in the first place was to see her be the bad guy. Everyone loves a good villain. On a positive note, I did like the reasoning behind Maleficent having a grudge against Aurora. The writers made the grudge personal versus on a whim. The writers also did a good job with connecting everything together; they made Maleficent a fairy instead of an evil sorceress which explains her horns. However, I would have liked to have seen more background on Maleficent,*spoilers* they could have elaborated on how she became a fairy, the protector of Moors, how her parents died, what makes her sensitive to iron, can she only shift change animals, etc. Overall, just keep an open mind and that this movie would probably be considered a reboot more than a spin-off.",Maleficent
500,Ayla_Pendragon,Great surprise,9,24 December 2017,Must see. Was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. I loved Elle Fanning in the role of Aurora.

501,temp-544-612798,Because it can't be HER fault,1,29 June 2014,"The first thing you notice is that females are universally portrayed as the source of good and happy and light, and the more effeminate the character the better. Masculine qualities are invariably associated with greed, anger, pettiness and violence, and the more masculine the character the more corrupt. Reminded me of Elfquest.There is a tendency in modern entertainment (such as Broadway's ""Wicked"") to portray evil by men as internally motivated, and evil by women as externally provoked. It's not HER fault she did X, it was the only option available to her because of what HE did. It's not that SHE was power-hungry and caused pain to retain her power. She's just misunderstood, and once we embrace the feminine superiority the world will be a better place.Retelling the story would be pointless, so I won't include any spoilers. What matters is the overarching theme. This message is wrapped up in a cacophony of sparkle & wide-angle camera work, but it's still a feminist fantasy in which girls are smarter & stronger than boys; the feminine is divine and the masculine must be destroyed.",Maleficent
502,roy_meyer,"Nice Epic, Way to many Visual Effects, And of course Angelina Jolie",6,29 May 2014,"I have got to say at first that I watched ""Maleficent"" only because of Angelina Jolie even though I'm not a big fan of fantasies movies (To say the least). As a remake of a Disney film, the result is much better than Disney others remakes (״Alice in wonderland״, ״Oz the great and the powerful"" that were awful). The plot of the movie is nice, the screenplay is a great mess, almost everything does not make scene ,the direction is quite not good, and... The Visual Effects were way too many than needed, way too many. Angelina Jolie as usual (and even more) was great (not as good as her performance in ""Changeling"", ""Girl, Interrupted"", but still, her acting is great, she's acting the character has written for her. Elle Fanning was very very bad, wired smile on her face in every single scene. In the start of the movie it seems to be a lame remake, but later it becomes to a great drama with a complex main character (maledicent) that make the movie more interesting.Bottom line, the film was good because of Angelina Jolie and a nice plot, (the idea of the plot is great but the screenplay itself is lame) and was not good because of too many Visual Effects for all the Action-Fantasies fans (Lord of the rings, The Hobbit) this film is good, for all the others this movie is nice.",Maleficent
503,vob,I Don't Think it Could Be Better,10,23 August 2014,"It seems every film Angelina Jolie is in, they get progressively better.Angelina played the part with such a beautifully placid air, the hesitancy to smile as a wronged soul, then the ever-so slight curl of a smile breaking the corner of her lips as she watched Aurora's mud fight, brings much more joy to the viewer than had she broken out in raucous laughter. Brilliantly acted.The rest of the film is impeccably done, the 3d, CGI, the set and costume design, the fantasy figures, some beautiful, some goofy and humorous.The acting was good enough to have you believing what you were watching, and that is the important part. You find yourself moving through moments of tears, moments of joy. Thoroughly enjoyed the film.Well done Roth Films and Kudos to Disney for their usual great taste in fun.",Maleficent
504,jakenathanasher,"If You Appreciate the Original Disney Animation, Do Yourself a Favor, and Don't Watch This Crap.",2,25 December 2014,"Maleficent was marvelously shot, with beautiful effects and a dark and dreary setting, that let you escape from your normal everyday world, it even had some good performances, but besides that, don't even waste a dollar at redbox to see this piece of crap. What in the world got into their head, that made them warn to change the original character? In order to change that character, they had to reroute the entire storyline, and transform beloved strong willed characters into weak and stupid characters, or good willed characters into evil one dimensions ions psychopaths, and make a very important character pretty much pointless to the story.Okay, FROM HERE ON THERE ARE SPOILERS. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE, DO NOT READ ON.Maleficent was changed into a weak and clichéd piece of crap character, to try in promote strong female roles in other films, but she was only taken to a deeper level of weakness. In the original, she was strong and evil, and she didn't have to have a back story because her story wasn't the main story. She even turned into a stinking dragon. In this version, she was symbolically raped, then she went all stereotypical and cliché strong girl on us and decided to get revenge on her ex lover, only this time she just cursed his daughter. Come on, I mean, that's not even exact revenge, that's just stupidity. If I were her, I'd've killed the sucker immediately and just not worry about the daughter. And then, she tries to help the girl age cursed by attempting to break it. How does being an antagonist with a heart of gold translate with audiences? Uh, not very well. On top of that, they changed her into a hero halfway through for no good reason at all except to make Disney happy so it's not like ultra dark. Unfortunately, while doing this, they ruined the dragon. Not only was Maleficent not the one that transformed into the dragon, it only took the soldiers like a total of 30 seconds to bring it down. I mean, seriously, I counted. Then to top off this review, I can't forget Prince Phillip, the strong hearted Prince who comes to save his true love for the evil sorceress. Only in this version, he's a random guy who says hello to Aurora once, then gets this absurd infatuation with her, and gets it into his head that he wants to kiss her. Then there's Stephan and the fairies, which if you've seen the movie, don't even need an explanation.",Maleficent

This is a story from Maleficent's side, and most likely it's the right one. ( it make more sense, at least ) .There are no bad side in this story, they all have their own reason and it all make sense now. Angelina Jolie is perfect for the role, and her acting was really good. Really convincing.However, there are one big part that a bit surprising though, when you learn about the real ""true love kiss"" , i think i understand that Disney want to change our perspective about true love , its not coming from random guy that you just met once, ya its love at first sight and everything, But, true love its much more deep than that. Maybe from some people , you'll find it disturbing or maybe it destroy your childhood, but i guess, this is the real one.I can wrap up this movie with one quote "" Sometimes the nicest people you meet are covered in Tattoos"" Maleficent , 8/10",Maleficent

I honestly expected a movie like the Snow White adaptation with Charlize Theron and instead it was twice as entertaining, and quadrupled in meaning. Its twist on what true love really is, just melted me. I haven't loved a movie this much in a long time. It also renewed my subscription as an Angelina fan. I haven't been interested in many of her flicks since Changeling. She truly is an exceptional woman. A face, performance, and wardrobe so menacing, yet her eyes still managed to convince you otherwise. The innocence of Elle Fanning as an actress had me choked up half the time.

I can never watch the original again without shouting ""That's not how it happened!"" It looked fantastic. The magical world looked magical.

A movie with fairytale that has a life lessons and morale. With comedy and a nice action, you got yourself an entertaining fantasy movie for the summer.The only thing that bothered me is the last half hour of the movie, is really seems like they made it fast forward and everything seems in place and that you kinda hope what happened.

Those stories cannot be distorted because you cannot change archetypes, but Disney (Modern Disney) continues to ignore that. On an unconscious level you feel disturbed by that distorsion and on the long distance, distorted archetypes generates even many issues in society.This story, as all the fairy tales, is about good vs evil, there is no space for ambiguity.Ambiguous characters can be interesting, but if you want To talk about them, then create original stories for them, don't try to change the sacred role of the archetypes in collective unconscious.Walt Disney, the man, would be very disappointed.I give to this movie 4 and not 1 just because of the the good technical part of it and some good acting performances.",Maleficent

There were a lot of interesting twists and i couldn't take my eyes off the screen at all, and I usually do. I think that this movie is very pure and meaningful and it shows a lot of humans' vulnerabilities which we are no longer exposed to, at least not in a descent interesting way like this one. It is more like an experience than just a movie to kill some extra time with. I will admit that some scenes were beautifully surprising and some were just too expected, but it wasn't boring at all to spend that night watching it. I even had good dreams that night !

And she doesn't even turn into a dragon, her raven guy-person turns into a dragon. I wanted to see more of Jolie as Maleficent because she is a good Maleficent. But I guess I wanted the movie to be sleeping beauty but through Maleficent's eyes, and they didn't so I'm kind of pissed they turned the greatest villain of all time into someone who's loves and cares. I get it, Disney wanted to make a new Maleficent, a one that loves. And I guess that makes sense, I just hope that Maleficent 2 is gonna be better and that she returns to her evil state.

I think Disney let its imagination run wild while writing Maleficent. I would've liked it better had it been a standalone film, promoted as loosely based on Sleeping Beauty, because it just goes against the 1959 film. I expected it to be written in the same world as Sleeping Beauty, telling Maleficent's tale while the incidents from Sleeping Beauty took place in the background. Without giving away spoilers I want to point out that a lot of the characters had been changed completely, so much so that they weren't the same characters anymore, and I found it rather disappointing.Angelina Jolie is amazing in the role. She has such a powerful screen presence. They could've made much better use of her by writing a better film. Her pet crow (Sam Riley) is a nice touch. Elle Fanning brings a refreshing innocence to Jolie's jadedness. Apart from that, the film certainly looks beautiful and the background score adds a lot of depth and darkness.",Maleficent

However, it is not enough for me to give this movie a better rating. Yes, the story is acceptable: Maleficent started good, got betrayed, became evil and seek revenge, softened by princess, and became heroine at the end. These plot points are good enough but the substance in between is quite mediocre. For instance, when Maleficent found out Aurora's hiding place, she was almost immediately charmed by her just by watching her sleep, walk, eat, etc. There was absolutely nothing Aurora did (maybe except for a hug) that would have been special enough to alter the supposedly evil Maleficent sentiments. If it were that easy, Maleficent would not have carried out the curse once she had a look at cute little baby Aurora in her crib at the Christening. Another example would be the meeting of Prince Philip and Aurora. First we recall the original film that provided a great dance routine between Aurora and the forest owl in costume, then replaced with the real prince, while singing one of Disney's greatest songs. That's great film making, and not like this movie with just ""Hi"", ""where are you from"", ""I got lost"", etc. I do, however, have to give some credit to Angelina's acting. In the scene at Aurora's christening, the way she talked, I could vividly see the images in the original animated film. Unfortunately, Angelina was not given decent material to work with. I simply cannot recall a single dialog in the entire movie that is creative or inspiring. Quite dull, to be honest. Mr. Walt Disney, I am so sorry that you have to see this from above.",Maleficent

There's a lot of talent here to work with, unfortunately it was all wasted. The movie looks fake and fabricated, which of course it was. There was little real cinematic effort, with every environment and most of the characters being CGI there was very little for the actors to interact with. As a result we, the audience, get yet another generic and artificial theme park ride. Sadly we get so many of those nowadays that instead of making us smile they make us sick.I think the movie was ultimately about women empowerment, which worked perfectly fine in Frozen.

519,emmasophia,Such a wonderful story!,10,15 December 2014,"I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie and I am glad to see Angelina Jolie in this role. She was pretty amazing. I haven't been impressed with Jolie's recent work and this was definitely a breath of fresh air. I loved the way they told the back story of Maleficent. I wouldn't have loved it as much if they didn't do such a great job at explaining Maleficent's change to evil. Had it been all based on jealousy - i.e. Stefan didn't marry her and became king and married someone else instead - I think it wouldn't have had as much depth as it did here. Maleficent was a kind fairy. Even though Stefan and her dated for what it appears to be several years and Stefan left and didn't come back for a long time, Maleficent still forgave Stefan and talked with him all night when he did return. Her evil heart did not stem from some lost love, rather, it was the betrayal of her love to Stefan plus his heinous act of cutting off her wings. Who wouldn't be angry at that?! I don't blame her!Aurora was also well written. She was not just some doormat princess character like in Sleeping Beauty. It was such a sweet setup of how Maleficent came to truly love and care for Aurora. Maleficent watched over Aurora all her life (as opposed to some one off meeting that Maleficent had with Aurora like Aurora saved her life or something lame like that and changed Maleficent's mind). I loved the nickname of ""beastie"" so much! it was so fitting and so cute! You can feel the genuine love between Aurora and Maleficent and it just made it so much special when Maleficent's kiss woke Aurora. I truly loved that the movie did not focus on Maleficent being an evil person. Amazing movie! Much better than expected!",Maleficent
520,GazDutlow,If only her movie was as sharp as her cheekbones...,3,2 October 2014,"""Well, well"" - Hearing Angelina Jolie utter those words had me excited. Maleficent is a sight to behold. She's tall, menacing, strong and subtly powerful. Alas, If only her movie was as sharp as her cheekbones. A lot has happened on the journey from script to screen, and the film has suffered for it. We are left with the shreds of rewrites.'Maleficent' is the latest in the line of post-""Wicked"" take on stories, where the villain gets the chance to reveal the motivation behind their actions. Except this isn't Maleficent's account of 'Sleeping Beauty' - this is a completely different tale. And frankly, a tale I don't care for.The film ticks off its mandatory checklist: Spinning Wheel - check. (Spoilers ahead) In a shockingly emotional turn of events, the film successfully gives Maleficent reason for her villainy. The film treads an unexpected and on-point metaphor for rape, which catapults us into that iconic Christening scene from the animated film. Jolie is perfect in these scenes. Maleficent's curse is delivered with strength, gusto and conviction. But this conviction for the original tale doesn't last long enough. After comfortably placing the audience within the context of 'Sleeping Beauty', the film sharply deviates from its source and leaves the audience stranded.Three Fairies - check. Why tarnish what we loved so dearly? Disney's three endearing fairies (Flora, Fauna and Merryweather) are replaced by ridiculously unfunny pixies (Knotgrass, Flittle and Thistlewit). They're weak, stupid and mean. Who would have thought Aurora was entrusted to these three for protection? The three pixies don't care for the baby, and so instead of searching for 16 years for the one she cursed, Maleficent finds herself watching over Aurora (Elle Fanning) as her reluctant Fairy Godmother. Scratching your head yet? True loves kiss - check. The film wastes too much time showing fairies slapping one another (yes, it's that variety of comedy) to properly set up the love story between Prince Phillip and Aurora. The writers think it suitable to set up a 'surprise' ending, whereby Phillip's kiss does not work in awakening the Princess. I don't have to reveal who does wake the sleeping beauty, but its a cheap resolution that has become a new cliché.So in an misguided effort in juggling the roles of the characters, 'Maleficent' has ended up being terribly muddled. Most notably the pixies and King Stefan; who after not seeing his daughter for 16 years, banishes her to her bedroom with not so much as an hello, before acting out violently against one said pixie.Jolie and Fanning do well with what they're given, but what is given is not what was wanted. Where is the evil Maleficent we loved? All that is left with an ill-judged feminist romance. 'Maleficent' is an adult film (correctly rated M for its themes and violence) that has childish characters that could only appeal to four-year-olds. It is indeed a Sleeping Beauty - a visually superb film that failed to awake to the possibilities of what it could have been.",Maleficent
521,RayPereira30,Maleficent,10,19 August 2014,"This film had so much energy! The way Angelina aced her STRONG AMAZING performance did this film's justice. She pushed herself to build a relationship with Maleficent. Although critics were skeptical , The film itself has made $745 Million, most likely for Jolie's performance. I loved her in this film, she is the only reason I choose to see this film again and again! Oscar Nomiantion is for sure worthy for her role! Elle Fanning gave a sweet yet stunning performance also, she gave Aurora what she needed. For fans who have not yet seen this film, if you are expecting the orinal , you will be let down. This is showing the film from a new point of view.",Maleficent
522,mehdi_assad,An average flick With some good animations,5,12 June 2014,"Well i went into maleficent with not so much hope , that is i considered it a good popcorn flick , but to be honest its an average movie with some good graphics , going back to its demerits the script was poor with some dumb one liners , Angelina Jolie was just OK with only some few good lines , side cast was totally average ,i cannot even make comments on the story as the original holds a special place in my heart, 2 much graphics , 3D was just OK . in the end i can only advise film makers to refrain them selves from remaking or using the names of Disney greats...................... 5/10 ...........................",Maleficent
523,alwynhuk,Great movie,9,28 May 2014,"I have waited a long time for this film and it did not disappoint!The film is very entertaining with stunning visuals and impressive action scenes. This is definitely Angelina's film and she is incredible as Maleficent.Supporting cast are also impressive and Elle was perfect casting for Aurora. The 3d was also good and really did enhance many scenes. The score by James Newton Howard really blew me away and adds magic to the film.My screening was all made up of adults which surprised me. The trailers for the film really give the film a dark tone, however the actual film has many light Disney moments. I highly recommend this film and the 3d is worth paying a bit extra!",Maleficent
524,hammerofthehouse,Its a different take on a classic but a future classic in its own right,10,7 June 2014,"I don't understand why some reviewers feel the need to slam Disney for "" butchering a classic"". Folks, I understand that there is love for the 1959 version of Sleeping Beauty. My daughter and I have seen that picture a hundred times and adore it. We looked forward to watching Maleficent with great eagerness and despite not being an exact replica of the original, it was phenomenal! At 7 yrs old, my daughter absolutely loved it, even more than Sleeping Beauty she said. I have to agree with her. The original was a cartoon and was nothing more than the tired story of a young princess being saved by a prince. This new movie Maleficent tells a much more intriguing and moving story, and does it with more action, better special effect (of course) and better acting. Both movies were enjoyable, but obviously very different. Why can't a movie be made differently and still be as great or better? Why can't a 2014 Corvette be just as beautiful or more than a 1967? The purist will say the 67 is better but aren't they both gorgeous? Folks, yes they are just cars, but in the same way, Maleficent and Sleeping Beauty are just movies! They are not gospel. Even the bible has 4 versions of the life of Jesus and yes they are each somewhat different but all very beautiful. Sleeping Beauty was a fine movie... But its a fairy tale folks. I love the X-Men characters such as Wolverine, grew up on it, but if Marvel decided to make a Wolverine movie where Logan is actually a woman instead of a man, I might not like the idea...but if the movie is amazing, I won't slam the idea of making Wolverine a woman....however if the movie stinks, well, slam away!",Maleficent
525,dodateodora,Wonderful fairy tale,9,22 June 2014,"When I first saw the trailer,I didn't have very high hopes for the movie,knowing that I have been disappointed in the past with such adaptations. With this in mind,I still went to watch the movie,and I was blown away. The special effects,the costumes,the entire design of this fictive world! I must say,Angelina Jolie will never be the same to me again. She took on a completely different role,and gave what I think is one of her best performances to date. Kudos to staying true to the title as well as the plot. Many of the characters are similar to the original animated Sleeping Beauty,yet they also take on a new twist (like the fact that Maleficent turned her servant into a dragon,rather than herself). However,this picture is completely devoted to Maleficent and how she came to be. They start from her childhood and build up to the present. It really is a beautiful movie,in the sense that we get a whole different view of the main character and learn to like her,despite of what we thought about her during our childhood. One of the hardest moments in the movie is somewhere in the beginning,when Maleficent's love cuts off her wings to become king. It counteracts with one of the final scenes,also my favorite. It is true love's kiss. This is where they didn't completely stick to the story by showing us that real love doesn't necessarily have to come from a prince on a white horse,but can come from the heart of both the hero and the villain of this story. All in all,I definitely recommend you go see this film without watching the trailer,because it does no justice!",Maleficent
526,willara_forever,A beautiful tale of true love.,8,29 May 2014,"Maleficent was definitely a great movie to watch and be touched by. The acting of Angelia Jolie was, as always, impeccable. Fanning's portrayal of Aurora was great as well. The effects were great, Disney never fails in this, and like most of the time the humor felt right in place. Sam Riley was perfect for the role of Diaval, surely one of the best moments on screen.What you know about the original is nothing compared to what this movie gave us, in a good way of course. The movie felt like it passed too quickly but every moment was worth it and left you satisfied but secretly craving for more.Without giving too much away, Maleficent was a beautiful movie that redeemed Disney's classic heart warming story telling. Though simple at times, the feeling of the movie makes you want to stay in it forever and never get your eyes off such charming story.",Maleficent
527,Gumdropps69,A flawed remake,7,6 June 2014,"After returning from the cinema last night, I felt compelled to write a review for this movie. I was very excited when I heard that Disney will be making a remake of the classical Sleeping Beauty tale with Maleficent as the leading lady. On one hand, now that I have seen it, I must say that I am positively surprised. On the other hand, I didn't quite like the plot changes from the original Disney movie.Pros: Very beautiful scenery, breath taking images of a Utopian world, great performance by Angelina JolieCons: the fairy godmothers's names are changed, ""Merryweather"" didn't cast a spell on Aurora, the fairy godmothers are portrayed as dim witted, one dimensional characters, King Stephan and Prince Philip are not convincing at all, Aurora looks like the ""girl-next-door"",Maleficent is not evil enough.To sum it up, in my opinion, Maleficent is a great movie, but not a flawless one. Definitely not the best movie Disney has made, but it's worth watching.",Maleficent
528,flickchick1909,We all know the story of Sleeping Beauty..... or do we?,7,29 May 2014,"We all know the story of Sleeping Beauty. The sweet and innocent infant Princess Aurora (Fanning) is cursed by the spiteful and vengeful fairy Maleficent (Jolie). Boooooooo Maleficent BOOOOOO. What kind of wicked creature curses an innocent child.And Maleficent is so evil that her skin is green so you know it's true. Wicked Disney women are always green . *coughs* But is there more to this tale? Why would a fairy curse an innocent child? Of course there is more ..As it turns out, Maleficent began life as a sweet natured fairy who roamed the hills of her native land doing fairy things and playing with goblins. Until one day she meets a human boy Stefan.But boys suck, right! They steal kisses and tell lies and break your heart.But our unexpected heroine, that would be Maleficent for those who cant keep up, does not get mad she gets even. And how! She stores up all that hatred and spite and curses the wee baby before Aurora's 16th birthday she will prick her finger and fall into eternal slumber, awakening only with true love's kiss. Yeah okay so that's not a cool thing to do but there ya go.So Aurora is whisked away to live with her 3 fairy godmothers Flittle (Manville), Thistletwit (Temple) and Knotgrass (Staunton) until the day after her 16th birthday.Maleficent watches the child silently and is ever-present as she grows. One day, Aurora ventures bravely into the fairy lands and meets Maleficent face to face. She is not afraid and it is here that the story takes an unexpected turn.And it is here that I will leave the telling to the movie :) The script was a bit cheesy in parts and I have to say, the uttering of the curse, one of folklore's most famous and devastating, was an absolute fizzer. Oh Jolie gave it her all but it was so lame I cringed.But then it got good. The movie that is. Maleficent was not a one-dimensional woman and Jolie's skill as an actress shone through as she presented us with a well-rounded and complex woman who, as I mentioned previously, is the true heroine of this story.This is, after all, a Disney movie about a Princess and we must keep this in mind. And it's for kids. It's rated PG so it's not for our littlest movie lovers but for those who proudly tote their pink Disney Princess lunch boxes to school in their pink Disney backpacks..well a dose of some kick arse women who are self-assured might be in order.I really liked this movie. I found it endearing and fun. Jolie is staggeringly stunning as Maleficent and her journey of self discovery is open and pure. Fanning plays the bright eyed Aurora with a sweetness that never once goes to far. In the hands of a lesser actress, the result may have been quite disastrous. She holds her own against Jolie quite nicely thank you very much. Bravo young lady! I recommend you leave your adult self in the cinema foyer and take your younger self in to watch. Take the self that still believes in fairys, still believes in true love and still believes that the world would be perfect if we all had wings *sighs* Love Flick xx (writehere.com.au)",Maleficent
529,cryptical_143,Is Maleficient really a Mistress of Evil?,9,17 August 2014,"Well, again.. Angelina gave an outstanding performance! Throughout the movie I feel her bitterness, and how hard it is to be betrayed. Until now I can't think of any other actresses who can possibly do better than what she did. Now, with regards to the story I'm quite pleased and I enjoyed it a lot! I think what made some people feel disappointed is the fact that they did not see who Maleficient is, and how she was portrayed in Sleeping Beauty's classic story before. Probably the the only missed is they weren't able to convince me that she is a villain, however, it still did not bother me, maybe it just get to prove that villains have goodness in them. If I were to give criticism, probably it is the movie being a little bit rushed I think, there were some points that must have been emphasized, like how this happened or that.. Etc. but then I am not disappointed, the graphics, effects, and acting is superb! It is really not a boring movie at all. I recommend this!",Maleficent
530,thompson-ru,Doesn't Live up to the Hype,6,13 October 2014,"The premise was phenomenal. So phenomenal, in fact, that I don't think anything could have come up to par. The idea of Maleficent - legendary super-villain Maleficent, the baddest of the bad -being turned into some kind of anti-hero was so appealing that no matter if Angelina Jolie herself materialized through the screen and kissed me on the mouth, I would still find myself mildly disappointed. Nothing could have matched the hype. I still think the movie was very good. But it wasn't the sort of movie that could become a timeless classic, and that's what I went in hoping for. Had the main character been anyone but Maleficent, the story-telling would have been enchanting, engrossing, encapsulating. It would have been a joy to watch and I could easily see myself rating it 8 stars. But because it was Maleficent, I found myself wanting. They could have done better, and they should have done better, to honor an already great legend.",Maleficent
531,amyramoon,Maleficent is Beautiful,10,20 November 2016,"Fantastic in its orchestration, this film tells a story full of raw emotion and characters with terrible inner strength and immense convictions. It's a story which starts with compassion and innocent camaraderie, extends into jealousy and betrayal, culminating in redemption and peace. The characters are multifaceted and in the end, every personage can be identified with. I originally saw the betrayal as a way of long term protection from imminent murder, and in the end, the sway of intense emotions to lead to an inevitable fate. Every action in the movie had a reason and those could be derived from inference and careful thought. This is not a movie about good versus evil. It's a movie about the good evil complex present in all of us as soon as we discover the horrors of human passion.",Maleficent
532,fact-n-fiction,Maleficent - superb,10,20 August 2014,"It looks as though Maleficent is another of those movies that sits under the Disney banner, yet is far from a children's only movie. There's death, destruction, duplicity and derring do in equal measure.Yes, despite the fact that there are fairies, nymphs and other mythical creatures that might inhabit the usual children's story, this would probably sit more comfortably with the original Grimm stories than Disney's animated version from 1959.The fact is though, after the Pirates of the Caribbean series, we are fast becoming used to a more adult story line in Disney's live action movies and in my opinion, they're all the better for it.Maleficent appears to follow the same course as Sleeping Beauty, but is far less predictable and has a large number of twists and turns, seeing the story from a refreshing viewpoint: that of the so-called, ""Wicked Witch"" - who this time, isn't a witch at all.The stereotypes that usually accompany Disney films with this kind of story premise are still there, but this time, are somehow more real. Maleficent presents us with a very believable plot - despite and including the fairies - and strong characters with very real motivation.The approach used in this movie was enough to keep us glued to the screen from beginning to end, with Jolie in brilliant form in the lead role. The story was riveting, keeping us guessing right up until the end.",Maleficent
533,dcreeves,"I wish I had a better term than ""chick flick""",10,29 May 2014,"Bad summary title aside... THE MOVIE WAS AWESOME!!!! This is a total retelling of the story. Not only do you get the back story of Maleficent but you also get a pro-female movie to the nines. (which is why I need a better term than ""chick flick""). I love the rise of the girl empowering movie genre that children are getting nowadays. No more is Aurora the passive subject of a ""King's daughter"" then some ""Prince's Conquest"" we see a story told with Maleficent having a multitude of dimensions. We see her entire development from the kind fairy to the Evil Fairy Queen. The creatures adapted in the Fae Realms(forgot what the movie officially called them) are MAGNIFICENT. They are all so beautiful, charming, and just delightful. We even get to see dimension to Maleficent's crow companion. Plus, the effects with Angelina Jolie's eyes are SO AMAZING!!!! SPOILERS ARE REALLY PAST THIS POINT(!!!!!!!!) I went with a girlfriend of mine and I LOVE all the symbolism in the movie-we couldn't stop discussing. The fact that it was a man who betrayed Maleficent and took her wings(her identity, courage, self-worth). A man set limitations ON HER (literally) because she could no longer fly.PLUS, when Maleficent becomes the Evil Fairy Queen NOTICE how the chair she creates looks much like a rib cage and she is the black heart inside.I'm also curious if I'm the only one who thought that Phillip(the King) took Maleficent's wings thinking he was protecting her.(me and my friend disagreed about this one). I mean he basically took her means of independence and ""trapped"" her to her Fae Realm. I mean YES she could travel but she was much slower and hobbled basically. That speaks volumes of MAN's desire to ""protect"" women but really are just crippling their real since of power/self-worth/ability out of some twisted ""love"". I mean this movie is SUCH a great female empowerment movie. The King may have been the catalyst but that is it. A HUGE chunk of the movie is about women taking care of each other.Two down sides (being a Disney Kid).1. The Sleep Spell wasn't included. I LOVED the idea of everyone being in an ageless slumber.2. There aren't really a great many FAE invited to Aurora's birth. I mean the initial REASON why the Evil Fairy was so mad was that she got snubbed. I think she was suppose to be the 8th or 13th fairy in attendance and that number plays some part in the original story. However, this one follows the Disney version...changing the trio's names(in the original Flora(plants), Fauna(animals), and Maryweather (unsure) ) and not even mentioning what the last fairy gave Aurora as a gift. (in the original telling that was the gift that swayed the death curse to a 'sleep like death' curse. One of my favourite parts of the original telling were the trio of fairies and their arguments.",Maleficent
534,lilyfm21,Maleficent the magnificent,10,22 August 2014,"In short this film is nothing short of amazing. Beautifully shot, witty writing and with Angelina Jolie's impeccable acting skills this film was always going to be a hit. It is truly magical, , everything you dreamed of once playing off with the fairies in the imaginary worldof childhood. If your looking for a film that gives a sense of escapism this is it.Angelina is truly underrated, whilst the makeup and costume add to the power of her character it is the true aura of herself that brings maleficent to life. Only she could give the character a true malevolence yet be heart breaking at the same time. You really end up feeling for her and realise perhaps all is not always as it seems. I would definitely recommend to anyone that is debating watching this film, , who knows you may just find your wings.",Maleficent
535,Andrewtw93,Mistress of All Evil?,5,31 May 2014,"What an interesting idea. Make a modern day fairy tale all based off of the villain! That was my thoughts over a year ago when I first heard about this film. I have never been a die hard fan of Ms. Jolie, but did not doubt her ability to transform herself into one of the most iconic villains of all time. And yes, she did just that. While I had heard before hand that the film was a disappointing 90 minutes long, I came to the conclusion that it did not matter as long as the story was handed well. I see myself here at a cross roads. The reason being that the visuals and acting were top notch. Copley is a personal favorite of mine, and does well here. As does Fanning who gave a fair performance as Sleeping Beauty. The problem came however with the fact that this story was not about a villain at all, but rather a fairy with emotional problem. Maybe if I was warned I could have possibly braced myself for the unexpected faults I found. I for one am not opposed to a bad guy film where the villain turns good, but did not see that fitting this film. Jolie gave a fantastic performance as a good fairy in a moral war with her self, but she was at her absolute finest as the cruel villain we all know. She was picture perfect as the malicious Maleficent, and I couldn't help but almost chuckle at how marvelous she was. Once again the problem, she was only that role for about 10 minutes. This is a terrific film about a bad fairy's struggle to remain good, I just wish our mistress of all evil could have appeared in more then 10 minutes.",Maleficent
536,hopefulhuman888,A horrible waste of a good idea,5,12 June 2014,"Disney did it again. They made total crap! What a surprise. The movie doesn't follow the plot lines that they made up in their own cartoon version which was disappointing. I know it was supposed to be from her point of view, but even then if you could look past that and try to see it from her point of view the movie was still lacking. I don't feel that they built up her character enough or the relationship between her and the king for me to sympathize with what he does to her. I was hoping as well that she would have been more evil. The acting sucked (except for Jolie's part). They made the fairies out to be utterly stupid instead of helpful. They were horrible CGI's and it just gave the movie an overall corniness. Disney just butchered it and I can't for some reason understand why people keep saying it was good. It was the most damn irritating movie of all.",Maleficent
537,amitso,Better for younger audience. Angelina was superb!,6,19 July 2014,"I went into this movie aware of the original Sleeping Beauty tale but entered with an open mind. Overall my thoughts were mixed with good and not so good aspects throughout.The story telling was one dimensional which for an adult can a bit dull and boring but for the kiddies it's an easy movie to follow. As appropriately titled, this movie was all about Maleficent and doesn't bother building too much of the other characters. Maleficent was definitely a character with depth but isn't she suppose to be a villain? She lacked any real evil and usually acted in revenge for misdemeanours by the new king who if fact was portrayed as the villain. She was a softy at heart which isn't something I wouldn't expect. Why did Disney want to completely change their portrayal of this character? Maybe it was a requirement for securing Angelina Jolie in the lead role.Angelina did a brilliant job. Her skills and presence on camera are first class leaving a huge gap between her and her supporting cast members. She carries this film throughout. The Stefan character was excruciatingly poor but it isn't completely the actors (Sharlto Copley) fault. The script failed to build Stefan and left the audience perplexed with his action towards Maleficent. The CGI graphics were beautifully done which transports the audience to a world of fantasy. The music score was also very done thanks to James Newton Howard.This new adaption to Sleeping Beauty provides more entertainment for the younger than older audience. Almost worth seeing for Angelina's performance alone.",Maleficent
538,Bayclove,"A movie for Jolie fans, NOT Disney fans",5,17 August 2014,"Not worth all the hype, but not a total bomb either. Generally enjoyable, but admit I felt bored at times.Maleficent is for all those Angelina Jolie lovers. She is pretty much the movie. Don't get me wrong, she does a good job. Besides a few corny lines here and there it's an OK movie. Special effects are easy on the eyes. I thought the 3 fairies were a wonderful addition and probably had the most 'Disney' feel throughout.The story is bland however. A twist on the original; still unsure if this spoilt it. Maleficent didn't seem evil enough which is a shame as Jolie looked set. The make-up is unique and mysterious. It works and fit's the character perfectly. A more devious plot would have been welcomed I think.This movie is very much like a lovey dovey fairytale and I doubt that's what folks were expecting. Disney can also do wicked but I feel it's too weak in this movie. An opportunity lost for such an iconic villain.",Maleficent
539,STMiitchell,The squishy side of Maleficent,2,13 July 2015,"Disney always tends to modify classic fairy tales, but this movie takes revisionism to a new level. Maleficent, who was surely one of Disney's most disturbing and enjoyable villains, is now a wronged and heartbroken fairy out for vengeance on a greedy King Stefan. She is far from evil. She's not even particularly mean-spirited; she's just angry, but not so angry as to actually hurt someone. She'll just make them uncomfortable for a little while. She even takes over the care of Aurora when the three good pixies prove unequal to the task. This is clearly not the Maleficent I feared as a boy.In fact, I'm glad I didn't see this version as a boy. Male characters are cruel, corrupt, inept, or some combination of all three, while women are uniformly noble in intent, if not in practice. Disney has apparently found a market niche among feminists. I hope few parents exposed their sons to this. On the bright side, the special effects are amazing.",Maleficent

Elle Fanning is usually so great but this seriously had me guffawing. Especially the line from the Prince ""I'm looking for a girl."" It was really, really bad. Parts of it are exquisite – the wings scene with Angelina Jolie is breathtaking but the fairies drove me nuts and the CGI went from clearly real to clearly unreal. I thought the producers could have done such a better job with this. The King who had previously starred in District 9 was laughable with his Scottish accent. So, so disappointed. It is not as good as other Disney films the huntsmen and mirror mirror. Unfortunately the trailer is a bit of a trap in this one. Me and my daughters were bored - too long and indulgent.",Maleficent

It's not just about evil people being punished - it's deeper than that. I even found myself getting teary at some point.

542,reidrigox,"Its a good movie, the idea are good but the execution could be better",6,29 August 2021,"Well, I liked the idea of Maleficent dont be a demon for no reason, and I was ""ok"" with that since the old style of ""good and evil"" are boring af for me, but they failed in that, and the script are just a disaster in some aspects.First, I'm a battle enthusiast, I love battles in movies, specially when it are unexpected. I know that it arent the foccus of the movie, but come on, that battles was so horribly writed that I was dying in cringe for who writed that.Maleficent was suposed to be insanely powerful, but the only thing who she did on the first battle was fly and hit some guys. Really? She don't use powers? It's ok, I convinced myself that she wasnt wanting to kill anyone.On the half part of the movie, we had a small battle where Maleficent just make the soldiers flutuate in the air like dolls, and well, it is what im talking about! She showed how powerful she was.But then on the last battle, unfortunately the writers did it again. Maleficent was surrounded by enemies and where is her powers? Where is her capability to curse? Where is her capability to launch everyone on the air? She was just being beaten down and thats it. In a second all his powers disappeared and she was so vulnerable as a child.I'll not even mention the fact that less than 10 mens (maybe) was able to hold down a DRAGON with just some chains. Normal mens have problems to hold down animals much smaller, like a bull, a crocodile, a lion or a tiger, but they just hold the Dragon as it are a little dog.But the worst part is how much misandric that movie looked.The premise of the movie was go away from the old ""hero and villain"" style, but it still the same, they only changed the villain.The King was just a greedy man who cut his beloved's wings for become king. He don't cared for his dying Queen, was only worried about his revange, so worried that he don't even care for his cursed child.The King was just a single-dimensional villain, they dont gave a reason for the King be like that, not even a hard life, a family who was in need of money, or any generic excuse who even a kid can think, they just made him greedy and evil and that's all, while the girls are good and pure.I liked the movie, I liked the premise, I liked the cast, but the execution could be much better.

544,oyasuna,Outstanding,9,10 November 2019,"""Once upon a time.. in a land far, far away..""Wait a minute, this isn't shrek 😣Greetings, and welcome to my review ✨You know, i remember it like it was yesterday. It was 2014, the night i saw the trailer for this movie when i should be sleeping because i still had finals, i thought to myself, ""Wow, just when i have been saying that Maleficent is such a great disney villain"". When i saw the movie posters in every cinema that i went, i still did not believe it and after my cousin asked if i wanted to watch it, you guessed it. My curiosity got the best of me. After school ended, i decided to go with her and her friends to finally this movie.As every viewer know by now, this is an adaptation from Sleeping Beauty now mainly focused on its film's antagonist. Disney made an excellent choice on making this a reality as a whole.Let's dive into the Moors, shall we? 🥀The movie begins with Maleficent, a young and bright fairy who lives in a magical realm bordering a human kingdom. She encounters a young scottish peasant boy named Stefan, who she eventually falls in love with. Unfortunately, his love is overshadowed by ambition and as time passes by, both grew distant and Maleficent becomes protector of the Moors.Over the human side of the border, King Henry soughts out conquer the Moors however he got fatally wounded and during his final moments, he declares that whoever can successfully murder Maleficent, they will be immensely rewarded as his successor and will get to marry his daughter, Princess Leila.Stefan, knowing this, steps foot on the Moors once more and attempts to drug Maleficent making her fall asleep. However, when he had to kill her, he could not bring himself to do it so instead he took lethal iron and removed her wings leaving her devastated when she realizes it the next morning. Consumed by that feeling, she turns the Moors into a dark kingdom and transforms a raven named Diaval to serve her every need.After some time, just as the original goes, Maleficent is informed of a new baby and comes there uninvited where the famous scene of her putting the curse on Princess Aurora. When she has come of age, her soul will be put to rest when she touches her finger on the spindle.After this scene is where the movie takes a whole different turn till its end, in which they play a distinct yet significant approach on the subject of True Love. It's not the typical prince-hovers-over-princess thing, it's much more greater than that. It is the love of a mother ❤Now, it is going to be the main argument among viewers concerning this movie. It is peculiar to ponder about, might as well even cause a ruckus. However, i did like this aspect very much as it is a unique take on the Fairytale genre.This movie was one and a half hour, and also plus seven minutes. It felt long however once again Disney receives its triumph on making dreams come true. The story is extremely touching adorned with marvelous cinematography, CGI, portraying its amazing human and magical worlds as well as beautifully acted with stars that stood out such as Angelina Jolie as the titular character and Sam Riley as her partner in crime, the two go side by side very well seeming like close friends too at some parts instead of a master-servant relationship.Fortunately, i only have one complaint about the movie. The relationship between Stefan and Maleficent could have been deeper to not just widen the narrative, but to give more weight because these two seem pretty shallow everytime they are on screen together.So, in conclusion, Maleficent is a brilliant movie taken to new heights on the Fairytale genre set in this modern world. It may not be as faithful, however as you take a chance and keep your expectations to a minimum, i guarantee it will at least be worth your time and money 😉Thank you for listening, and hope you have a great day 💚",Maleficent

Therefore, it is a illusory- to-life story. There are three aspects discussed are the leading role, special customs and the plot of ""Maleficent.""
Start with, the leading role of the film, Mayptith is the rule of Elf Kingdom. She has met a man, Stephen who was an ordinary person, when she was a child. However, he chooses to betray her,because of his personal power.
In the second place, the special customs of Mayptith is surprised me, because her makeup is so marvel. For example, her head has long horns, and her cheekbones are more prominent than human beings.
Finally, the plot of the movie is also impressed me. I think the Elf Kingdom represents the whole nature. Human beings continue destroy nature for their own benefits, as a result, nature will fight back.

Alas, at 39, those are the things that make fairy tales exactly that. This tale, touches, even so slightly and delicately at the problems that arise in real life with real feelings, and I think Angelina and Elle Fanning portray it was feels like what could be-in the real world, a mother/stepdaughter relationship. Yes yes, some of the characters (sharlto) motivations aren't fleshed out Ina way that would suit intereats- The adoring crow, the wonderous creatures of the Moor that suffer in silence. All typical fairy tale troupes, but the growth of the main relationship, and the happiness and closure that comes from the final act. That felt like a real, a really real fairy tale. The kind I'm moved to tears over, and the kind I share with my 2 girls and one boy whenever the mood strikes us. Maleficent is a triumph of showing how life can really be, no prince will save the day, and sometimes people hurt people because of the hurt done to them. But, sometimes, forgiveness can blossom into the strongest thing in this world. Honest, TRUE love. I hope some of you enjoyed this movie as much myself and my children have these last few years. It's such a rare glimmer of hope and greatness, and some emotional honesty, all wrapped up in a fairy tale. And what a beautifully filmed glimpse of another world it is.

I was impressed with this take, nay improvement on the classic story. Especially from Disney themselves. I actually preferred this deeper story than the original cartoon. That shocked my kids, as I almost never like ""remakes"".One caution - we did good to leave our 10 year old at home. It was a bit intense - our kids aren't numbed yet, they don't play GTA and watch horror movies. But it's perfect for watching on our 50"" at home, and adding to the collection.*****Spoiler Alert***** This is such a better telling of the story!! I recall as a kid wondering two things 1) What's that sorceress chick's problem? Whatever it was was not memorable, I've no idea when I remember the cartoon. Just that that was her job. Flimsy motivation. And 2) some prince looking for action and adventure hacks his way into this castle, and just settings eyes on a chick just once he's in ""true"" love? Yeah, no. We bought it as starry eyed kids back in the day, I guess - all our stories were always ""happily ever after"" eh? But it didn't ring true then. The old story was as 2 dimensional as the cartoon characters. So I loved that they fixed, even spoofed this weak story telling. Here's the ***Spoiler*** You've been warned plenty now...***Spoiler: The prince kisses her and it fizzles! Nothing. Not even a nose wiggle. Politics, tired nannies pushing, nothing can force true love. And who says true love is always romantic love? Excellent storytelling. Well done! Bravo! ****End of a Spoiler****This also was a terrific study in how psychopaths can leave a trail of victims, who in their pain, though not inherently evil, can lash out and inflict pain on other victims. ****Spoiler Alert**** Maleficent is a portrait of such a victim, and sets a good example of regretting, owning, and fixing the wrongs her conscience cannot let her live with. The thief king is a great example of how psychopathic abusers use everyone, their ""true"" love and their children - whom they've never loved, and care not what damage they do, ever. Thank you Disney for portraying how incorrigible psychopaths are, and for the fitting end you gave this one. ****End of a Spoiler****This is a story you want your kids to see. Great visuals, even greater storytelling, and good life lessons. Disney has made a masterpiece! Go see it!",Maleficent
551,dddddd-798-287550,Hmm,6,7 June 2014,"mixed feelings. It was extremely linear and straightforward, especially predictable, and all the actors were pretty crap. Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning (and Sam Riley, the crow dude) were spectacular though. The movie had several unnecessary parts and dumb, flat af characters, and a bunch more things I can list off but that would be mean. A good amount of the time was just like ""WHY?"" Too many ridiculous moments to be dismissed which were mostly ridiculous due to the bad acting and stuff BUTThe animation and scenery (it's scenery porn I tell you) were incredible. All the parts with Angelina Jolie (Maleficent) and Elle Fanning (Aurora) were amazing. I laughed so much. I actually cried a little. They made up for all the bad acting from the other people. And oh my god the fluff. The dialogue between the two aslkfjasldfhThe beginning lagged a lot. The whole time I was just like, ""This is a bad movie. Will this turn out to be like what Frozen is to me? Nope, this is a bad movie."" Mostly because of bad acting and more bad acting and even more bad acting jfc. And partially because it was super linear and straightforward, simply laid out when it could have been awesomely presented. I guess it worked out in the end now that I look back on it. They made it work somehow with the approach they took for the storytelling. But once Angelina Jolie appeared with her good acting skills and gorgeous cheekbones and stunning eyes and awesome stuff happened, it was pretty enjoyableOverall, it could have been a lot better if they, you know, actually had a more effective plot execution and good casting (other than the obvious two), but Angelina Jolie makes it all better with Elle Fanning and the fluff was simply wonderful and the pacing is actually spot on and the animation is oomph.

552,ahunger87,Incredibly disappointed...,3,21 August 2014,"Overall I was incredibly disappointed with this version of Maleficent. She is, in my opinion, the most amazing villain in all of Disney's movies. She was terrifying to me as a child & I would have loved to see how she became what she was but with better writing. The CGI & the actors in this version all did a great job, but the story & writing was just terrible! If you were expecting this movie to be about Maleficent back story for the original Disney movie you are mistaken. This movie is a brief background & then a complete re-telling of the original. This is NOT the same Sleeping Beauty story. There are a few similarities between the old & new story but they are mostly different.If you were expecting them to show Maleficent as the powerful, mystical, Mistress of Evil that she was in the old story you are mistaken. This version hardly shows her powers at all, and not nearly to the extent as the classic Disney version.",Maleficent
553,hgg17,slightly disappointed,4,30 May 2014,"i don't know, i have been excited for this film for a very, very long time. i watched all the trailers and got so excited for the cast and the soundtrack featuring lana del rey too. but now Maleficent is finally here it fell flat.firstly, the CGI was lovely and i feel like 3d (what i watched it in) may have enhanced the experience. it looked and felt very vast and real.the one constant positive throughout the film is maleficent's image. the prosthetics, costume design, makeup, everything to bring the classic maleficent to life. she is sinister and evil looking, dark, and while it's modern it still remains loyal to the image of the cartoon version.if only the character was as dark as her image. they made maleficent emotional, forgiving, empathetic. emotions you shouldn't really be seeing from 'the mistress of all evil.' there were even moments where she cracked little side jokes that made the audience laugh. maleficent ISN'T funny! (despite this angelina jolie's acting was solid and she really got into her role.)the opening which features some story telling of maleficent's childhood is literally borderline unsalvageable. i've never seen such terrible child acting.i understand why though. Disney's primary concerns are financial. the film was so traditional. 'true loves kiss', clash towards the middle, happy ending. they just want to appeal to as many paying children and parents as possible rather than focusing on creating an adventurous film that is lengthy containing with a proper back story rather than what felt like a cop out story. (love betrays her, seeks revenge blah blah blah).this film is not a bad film. it looks nice with some solid acting and will undoubtedly entertain children - which, at the end of the day is what its there to do. it might be me having such massively high expectations for it.anyone seeking something slightly different from Disney tradition, and anyone who wants a loyal adaptation of the maleficent character probably will not enjoy this film. it is way, way too safe for a film about such a sinister character.",Maleficent

557,FoolishCarriage,My review of Maleficent,6,1 June 2014,"Paid to see it in IMAX and 3D. I could have waited. It's really OK as a separate story, but it seemed to be bent on really rewriting the original story a WHOLE lot.I get that it was supposed to focus on Maleficent, but I did not realize until I was watching the movie that the script actually changed her character so much. I didn't quite mind that as much as I minded the total change for King Stefan's character.I think it would have been better to give King Stefan a better reason for his actions than having him be simply a greedy person who became totally unhinged. If he had cut off her wings because he was forced to do so, rather than because he wanted the kingdom, I could have accepted that better.Liked the costuming. Can't say much for the story. If they hadn't based it on the Disney classic, perhaps it could have made more of a statement on its own.",Maleficent
558,voaidesciprian95,Great Movie,9,15 September 2014,"For a reminder of how wonderful Frozen is, watch Maleficent. This summer blockbuster season, Disney has turned out a live-action reimagining of their own animated version of Sleeping Beauty, from 1959.As recently as six months ago, this might have felt subversive, even significant, although after seeing Elsa and Anna letting it go on icing-sugar mountains and finding endings happier than any standard-issue handsome prince could provide, the fun on offer here feels relatively thawed.It is still fun, though, which counts for something – largely because, as with Frozen, the game involves returning to a well- thumbed fairy tale and muddling the distinction between evil and good. Maleficent, played by Angelina Jolie, is the wicked fairy, down to the sleek black-and-purple gown and the hat like two raised scorpion-stings.Here, though, her wickedness is limited to that famous fit of rage at Princess Aurora's christening – the flash of green fire, the spinning-wheel curse, reproduced here from the 1959 cartoon version almost word-for-word – for which she spends much of this film trying to make amends.",Maleficent
559,orzguang,"A delightful re/de-construction of ""Sleeping Beauty"" and the values it championed",7,17 June 2014,"The directorial debut of Robert Stromberg is not only a visually delightful reconstruction of the 1959 Disney fairy tale ""Sleeping Beauty"", but also a deconstruction of its simplistic black-and-white universe, its feel-good storyline and the values it championed. I particularly enjoyed the presence of powerful female characters: the eponymous fairy queen, antagonist in the Disney version, is here the protagonist around whom the whole plot evolves; the story is narrated by the Sleeping Beauty herself, which gives the auctorial authority to a woman.Stromberg was the production designer of ""Avatar"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", which won him two Oscars, and ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" (James Franco!), a wonderful retelling of the cult classic ""The Wizard of Oz"". He also worked with the special effect team of the ""Game of Thrones"". Maleficent's loss of wings could well echo with Angelina Jolie's painful double mastectomy in real life and thus create some interesting paratexts for the film. Sam Riley has a few major roles under his name including a rather convincing portrayal of Kerouac's protagonist in ""On the Road"" (2012). And of course the prince charming has to be an Australian! The sexy and delicious Brenton Thwaites plays a prince who won't be killing any dragon nor is he able to perform the magic of liberating his sleeping girl, a supporting role in its absolute sense, but nicely done. You can see why Jolie, a fervent feminist, was interested by the script and eventually accepted the role.Some parts of the story might seem underdeveloped, but it's essentially an anti-myth, anti-fairy tale and a postmodern re-creation requires our knowledge of its intertextual conversations. Luckily, nothing is better known than cheap Disney fairy tales.",Maleficent

The costumes and effects were very well done and it could've been an awesome movie... I just can't comprehend why Disney decided to take one of it's most beloved stories and twist it around to the point where it bears almost no resemblance to the classic fairytale. The three good fairies were horrible, I cringed every time they appeared on screen. Why make them incompetent morons? I just don't get it... While the fairies were annoying, they paled in comparison to the overall story. So now Maleficent, one of the most, if not the most, famous Disney villains of all time was just misunderstood? Why do this? So, not only is she NOT evil, she, the self proclaimed ""mistress of all evil,"" is the one who wakes sleeping beauty with true loves kiss? Seriously?!! I could've tolerated some deviation from the original story but flipping the story around so the prince, who becomes the king, is evil and Maleficent is just a victim was probably the dumbest idea one could think up.

Let me tell you all right now, I was absolutely wrong! This film, takes a fresh approach on the Disney classic which greatly exceeds it's predecessor! Angelina Jolie (Maleficent) is a brilliant actress that was the true star of the film. Her vast range of acting skills (and the amazing plot) enabled her to portray Maleficent as much more than the shady, one dimensional villain with pathetic motives! In this film, we see Maleficent for who she truly is... A woman scorned, who at first acts according to her hate filled motives, but then succumbs to the goodness and love that the young Aurora brings out of her. Furthermore, Elle Fanning was perfectly cast as Aurora and although her character could have been explored a bit more, the film is called Maleficent, not Sleeping Beauty right?

I never thought I would be as satisfied as I am right now, watching it in 3D, despite the fact that Angelina Jolie ""is"" Maleficent.Compared to this one, there had been quite differences from the Sleeping Beauty version. I missed the part where Aurora ended up dancing with the Prince, the fairies fighting for the perfect color of Aurora's dress, the musicality and other instances.However, thinking that the story is centered on Maleficent, I can say that the people behind this film is worth the praise. The plot is perfect! Despite from the ""true love"" ideology, it teaches the audience a few lessons that should be learned from it: it doesn't have to be a handsome Prince. This film pointed out ""true love's kiss"" as a kiss of forgiveness for the fact that it was Maleficent's kiss that broke the curse.I had suspected Maleficent dying in the end of the film as far as I can remember from The Sleeping Beauty. Another thing that I love about this film is that it didn't conclude with the audience mourning for the death of the protagonist. Maleficent and Aurora had each other's backs as the King had been on the move of killing Maleficent.Compared to Sleeping Beauty, Maleficent concluded with the two kingdoms, Maleficent's and Aurora's, uniting.

First I thought, ""hmm maybe that crow guy actually loves Aurora (considering the first time they met) and he will kiss her!"" because obviously it wouldn't be that dude she just met. By the way, I didn't like the casting, he looked like some teenage kid they found off the streets while he was skateboarding HAH. Anyways, it was so predictable that Maleficient was gonna give Aurora ""true loves kiss"", like dude, FROZEN ALREADY DID THAT SAME IDEA. That's why it was so amazing at the time.. but Disney dear, don't use that same idea in every one of your movies, obviously almost everyone saw Frozen. If you didn't, then you probably thought this movie was better. *Maleficient kisses Aurora on the forehead* *Aurora starts waking up* ""OH YEAH. TRUE LOVES KISS!!!!""

569,usshopeless-210-785984,"""Maleficent"" completely ignores the context set by ""Sleeping Beauty""",3,12 January 2015,"Being a fan of Disney's 1959 ""Sleeping Beauty"", I was excited for Maleficent, one of Disney's most iconic villains, to be brought to life in live action. However, after seeing the film, I am utterly disappointed.In the film ""Maleficent"", the classic story of Sleeping beauty is butchered. The film by itself is not a bad film. The visuals are great, and Angelina Jolie actually resembles Maleficent. This film, though, ignores the already established tale of Sleeping Beauty and makes up a new one. While watching this film, I was pleased with the initial backstory created for maleficent.However, this backstory pins Stefan as the actual villain and Maleficent as the a victim.In this backstory, Stefan removes Maleficent's wings in order to be the next king. This change was one I was at first willing to tolerate. However, Maleficent interacts with Aurora from the time that she is a newborn all the way up to her teens. Maleficent becomes so close with Aurora that Aurora begins to call her a ""fairy godmother"". This destroys Maleficent's character. Maleficent is supposed to be cruel and evil, but this film makes her out to be a loving, motherly figure. Things only get worse from there. Prince Phillip is a practically useless character in this film. He appears to be a naive and unintelligent teenager instead of the powerful prince he is supposed to be. Then, adding to the uselessness of Phillip's character, when Aurora is in her ""death-like sleep"", Phillip's kiss does not wake her up. It is Maleficent's kiss that wakes her up. I find this change to be completely unacceptable. Maleificent is supposed to hate Aurora, and Phillip is supposed to fight epically to save Aurora. Then, once Aurora is awake again, she teams up with Maleficent to escape from Stefan's castle. In doing so, Aurora finds Maleficent's wings, which are still flapping. She gives them to Maleficent who basically becomes indestructible. This sequence is so departed from the Sleeping Beauty story that it seems like it contains all new characters instead of the already established Maleficent an Aurora. My biggest complaint is about the dragon. Maleficent does not turn into a dragon. There is A dragon, but it is not Maleficent, and it is easily overpowered by Stefan's soldiers. Phillip is not involved with he dragon at all. The dragon in the 1959 ""Sleeping Beauty"" is one of the most iconic scenes in all of Disney history, and the fact that they removed that scene is appalling to me. ""Maleficent"" completely ignores the context set by ""Sleeping Beauty"", and twists it into a lesser version.",Maleficent

It shows the background behind what made Maleficent the way she is. It shows what made her want to put the spell on Aurora when she was born. After the spell is placed, Maleficent watched Aurora from a distance. The director does a great job of showing the mystery of Maleficent by keeping her in the shadows and having her wear the dark closes to show the evil side of her. Maleficent interacts with Aurora off and on throughout the movie. I like that Maleficent doesn't interact with Aurora as if she was the girl that she put the spell on. Instead, she is more of a motherly figure and the warm in the character is comforting to the person watching the movie as well as to the other characters. I like that in the end Maleficent comes out of the darkness. Also, instead of falling back into the concept of a prince saving the princess, the love of Maleficent is what brings Aurora out of her sleep. The movie overall was very enjoyable and I suggest to anyone that is contemplating watching it to do so. It was definitely worth the time.",Maleficent
573,samykae,awesome,8,14 September 2015,This movie takes sleeping beauty and turns it into a whole new movie in ways that someone never sees coming. It puts a new spin on true love that no other movie has. It made me love Angelina when I usually am not a huge fan of hers. It is very different and wasn't like a sequel. I love when a villain does not always act like a villain. I like when they invent creatures that are not real in reality. I also like when movies do things and bring you to a whole new place. This is awesome because not all fairies are the same. Also it is funny with all the extra magic added and extra nuts thrown in. It should make a sequel after this one.,Maleficent
574,puppylovehz,A Different Take on the Renown Malicious Fairy,10,6 June 2017,"The story of Maleficent is an excellent interpretation on the other side of Disney classic ""Sleeping Beauty."" The beginning, her heartbreak, and betrayal by Stefan, really justifies why she curses Aurora in the first place. While watching this movie, I didn't see Maleficent as a villain; I saw her as someone misunderstood. Stefan stole her wings; he broke her heart. But honestly, most of her cute moments with Aurora make her right side shine, especially in the end, when she is the one to awaken Aurora from the sleeping curse, not the Prince. That defies the laws of their fairy tales, but then again, Disney has also made Brave and Frozen which are also different compared to their usual happy endings. This movie overall, it's amazing and a powerful message that a person shouldn't be judged based on what others say.",Maleficent
575,TroyHencely,Maleficent Soar into Your Heart,10,1 June 2014,"Maleficent Disney's Maleficent is a retelling of their 1959's Sleeping Beauty that was derived from Charles Perrault's The Sleeping Beauty. It is a beautiful movie. The story is so well written. The scenes are well directed and acted. I will say that the 3D is not worth it. If you are going to go, go to the 2D because the picture is better. I give Maleficent 9 out of 10 stars. It is a great family movie that everyone will enjoy, as long as you enjoy fairy tales with a great twist from what we are used to hearing.****************SPOILER ALERT BELOW*********************Maleficent retells the original Disney's Sleepy Beauty. It does a fantastic job at it. It aids in the Frozen redefining of the phrases ""true love"" and ""true loves kiss"", which I am a huge fan of. Linda Woolverton is the writer of this version of Sleeping Beauty, she is truly a master at finding the voice of Maleficent. It is based more on the life of Maleficent. It is written so the it rounds out and mirrors the characters of Maleficent and Aurora, while at the same time bringing depth to all of the characters in the movie, except Prince Phillip, which is intentional. When you see the movie you'll see why I say this.The actors do a superb job. Angelina Jolie as top bill was phenomenal. She does for Maleficent what Margaret Hamilton did for the Wicked Witch of the West. She brings the character to life. There are moments that steal your heart between Aurora and Maleficent. You see Maleficent harden and then you see her soften. Aurora is played superbly by Elle Fanning and a few other young girls. One of the moments that will really grab your heart is between Angelina Jolie and her own daughter playing Aurora at a very young age. It is a moment of truthfulness between the characters. Imelda Staunton leads the three fairies that are to take care of Aurora. There are really great moments there. Sharlto Copley plays the infamous Stefan. Just as he was a fantastic psycho baddie in Elysium, he is so in Maleficent. He masterfully shows a plunge into a psychotic King that is paranoid of losing his own life, sometimes seemingly over that of his daughter.As far as directing and the cinematography go, this is top notch. This is Robert Stromberg's directing debut and he really shows off his chops; as well as the cinematography work of Dean Semler. I hope to see these two team up again. The picturing and mise en scene is perfect. There are moments of close ups and the scene filled with other characters that just take you by surprise and make your heart melt.The hits that I really have for you are the moments where actors Jolie and Copley slip in and out of their accents. Copley has moments where he attempts an Irish accent and it is a wee bit disastrous (see what I did there). The greatest moments are when he accepts his Southern African accent and just goes for it. In the last moments of the film they have Prince Phillip and he really isn't needed in that scene. He's used as a plot device earlier in the movie and the pay off is great, but his reentrance into the forest isn't needed. The 3D and 2D are not needed. 2D in this movie is what you want to see. It is brighter and has a greater sense of detail to the beautiful pictures. There are moments in the 3D version where everything is just way too dark whereas in the 2D it is not. There are also moments, such as the Dragon scene and the Moore's scene that could've been outrageously beautiful, but they fall completely flat on their face. If I were a producer I would've called out the 3D editing. And the last and slight hit, I would've liked to see a green tinge to Maleficent.",Maleficent

OMG How I loved it! Contrary to professional reviews, I noticed that the general public seems to like it! I do not think it is that dark too. The movie gains pace after about 25 minutes (the movie is not that long anyway). Angelina is my new goddess! And Elle Fanning is here to stay! I loved Sam Riley as Diaval, and Sharlto Copley played the evil king to perfection, though I would have liked to know the story behind his being somewhat evil (because he could not bring himself to kill Maleficent) to being transformed to pure evil (getting so mad that he did not go to his wife in her deathbed and stopping at nothing to kill Maleficent). I really was intrigued by the way he was so obsessed by Maleficent. He did not ever love anyone but himself and yes, in my opinion, Maleficent. Therefore he had two obsessions - himself(to be in power) and Maleficent. He never cared about the queen (his prize along with the kingdom) and not even about the daughter! The 3 pixies (Imelda Staunton, Juno Temple and Lesley Manville) were silly fun, but their parts were really small. The CGI and production values could have been better for a movie with this budget though.",Maleficent

This is not your mamma's Sleeping Beauty however, so if you are looking for the traditional, Disney story, you may be disappointed. This is all Maleficent.

583,Shadowgate7789,"I enjoyed it, honest review.",8,30 June 2014,"My experience. I liked The Movie Maleficent, I thought the story was well done. It good for young and older audience. The story was mainly for older audiences because of the events and darker tone in Maleficent. I know that Maleficent is one of my favorite character that I like and enjoy, villainy character. Maleficent is more of a anti-hero in the movie Maleficent. It's a different movie from the animated movie the sleeping beauty, it's a live action movie had a good story, loving characters, action and entertainment. I gave Maleficent a score of 8.2 because of the story, the acting and entertainment. The Story. {Spoilers} The story of Maleficent is about Maleficent getting revenge from her from lover and companion who is the current king of the Kingdom name King Stefan. Maleficent and the King dated each other when they were younger, they were also friends. The king of the kingdom had a child name of Aurora, Maleficent was very angry when she heard about the news by her scout Diaval. Maleficent arrived at the kingdom when she heard about the child from the king and queen. She will fall into a sleep like death when she turns 16 years old. There on The father, King Stefan he sent his daughter to live away with three fairies who will guide her and look over her. King Stefan was angry, he wanted revenge against Maleficent and the Moors. The king ordered his men to remove all pointy cloth makers from the kingdoms and houses and have them burned for her daughter. In the end Maleficent became Aurora True Love, they tried with Prince Philips. Prince Philips didn't end the curse but Maleficent had. A fight broke out between King Stefan and Maleficent at the Kingdom, in the castle which were heavily guarded and protected. The Battle ended with Maleficent gaining victory over King Stefan, The two kingdoms were finally at peace with each other The Kingdom and The Moors.The Acting. The acting is well done what I thought in the movie Maleficent which I personally enjoyed. Maleficent who is played by Angelina Jolie did a lovely job in the movie. The actor of King Stefan who is played by Sharlto Copley who played in other good movies like Elysium, District 9 and The A-Team. He played the villain very well, like Angelina Jolie played Maleficent. Angelina who played in different movies as well like Tomb Raider, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Alexander and Baowolf. Ellie Fanning who played Aurora did a decent job for a girl her age which she played in Super 8, couple other movies. The acting was pleasant to watch and enjoy.Overall. The move is well done and enjoyable and a good movie, the Original Score and Graphics were well done. Angelina Jolie and Sharlto Copley were a plus with the acting and performances. I enjoyed the movie Maleficent, I do hope they have a sequel, it get good rewards for the movie. I'm sure that others will enjoy the movie if it's suit them. It is a Fantasy, action movie nothing new or groundbreaking like in other movies.",Maleficent
584,engelbrt,Aurora/Aurora Connection,8,31 May 2014,"Enjoyed the movie. Loved Angelina Jolie's interpretation. There is one subtle connection within the movie and I have no idea whether it was intentional or not. I have read that the inspiration for Maleficient's eyes was the Feldspar mineral Labradorite. In Inuit lore, Labradorite is made from ordinary stones that have been transformed in the frozen fire of the Aurora Borealis. If anyone knows if this connection was intentional, please let me know.In any event, I have long held a fantasy of playing Maleficient. Now that Angelina has nailed the role, I guess I will just have to fantasize of playing Maleficent's mother.",Maleficent

The mood often shifts between dark and light and is done really well. It's not your typical fairy tale story. It's great both for children and adults. The acting was amazing and you really felt engaged with the story. The characters were very dynamic and much more complex than your typical Disney movie. The special effects were very well done also. The magic effects aren't overly done and presented very softly. I would highly recommend anyone of all ages to see this.

588,hartgh,Another Overbearance of CGI,3,28 September 2014,"Not caring for remakes, I was taken to Maleficent somewhat reticently by my wife who was anxious to see it.I rarely go to theatrical releases of movies these days because I find that most lack two seemingly old, outdated concepts, plot and character development. And often WAAAY too much reliance on CGI! (""We have a special effect, let's make a movie to go with it!"")Maleficent had good character development for the main players in the beginning, but a bit less for later characters. Having been a fan of Disney's classic fairy-tail movies (Pinoccio, Dumbo, Snow White, Cinderella, etc.) I was somewhat curious to see how Maleficent would be portrayed as a sympathetic character and that was well done.The plot kept me guessing as to how this movie might turn out. Accustomed to the ""fairy-tale"" endings of the classic Disney movies, I thought I had it figured out, but was (disappointingly) wrong about the ending.I will say that it was a fanciful story that kept my mind constantly busy trying to guess the ending for the whole movie, but it was an uncomfortable wonderment.As is sadly too common with modern movies, the special effects guys often overwhelm the story in Maleficent with tooooo many unnecessarily fantastic, blurry, over-the-top CGI scenes, which are so crammed full of action that one can't possibly take in a tiny fraction of it, and hence--I say--the effect is wasted. (For the longest time, I had no idea it was Stefan dangling at the end of the chain.)Spoiler! (I'll try to spoil it as little as possible.)I would have much rather that Stefan had ONLY taken the wings, rather than the struggle which immediately proceeded his decision to take them. I would rather the story play out that he did so to save a life, rather than for a selfish motive.I would have much rather that the movie contain less violence, and frankly, wouldn't take a child younger than 10-12 to see the movie. Couldn't the soldiers have been scarred off by Maleficent's powers rather than killed??? I would have much rather that the story stayed truer to the original by having the prince (after better character development) show true love.I would have much rather that Aurora would have saved the one who truly loved her with an ""in-the-nick-of-time"" scene. While Stefan and Maleficent's motives for being bitter and angry were understandable, I would have liked to see that after good doses of begging forgiveness, understanding, forgiving and making up, Stefan and all involved would have lived happily ever after.I mean really, isn't that what Walt would have given us? Frankly, I don't think Walt would have ever allowed the Disney name to grace a ""fairy-tale"" that was so often this dark.Lastly, I find it curiously amusing that Disney is, in effect, telling us with Malefecent that they lied to us when telling the story of Sleeping Beauty the first time.",Maleficent
589,Racker_CRO,What happened to this world?,2,15 September 2014,"This is one story I was told as a child which is totally destroyed by this movie.

I do respect everyone but some things should stay as they were. What's next, Snowwhite is kissed by a witch who was always good inside? Hansel & Gretel were two boys? Princess returned glass slipper to Cinderella and they lived for ever and ever? On the other side, acting, effects, sound, everything is excellent.

590,maple_anne,new life and vindication,10,2 June 2014,"Sleeping Beauty came out in 1959 and was the most expensive film Walt Disney had made with the worst box office sales and reviews. There was so much of a loss that it caused massive layoffs and Walt Disney swore to never make another fairy tale again. The Walt Disney Company waited 23 years after his death to revive their famous genre. This weekend, the same story with the same company just broke records in the other direction, a huge success and a whole new twist on the notorious tale. Angelina Jolie portrayed the Villainess flawlessly and Lana Del Ray's haunting rendition of the classic ""Once upon a Dream"" wrapped up and captured the emotion of the film perfectly. 55 years after Walt Disney's epic failure, the fairy tale has been giving new life and vindication.",Maleficent
591,Ulises_Darko,Mediocre,6,20 June 2014,"In this film, you are presented with a story that little has to do with the plot that once delighted us in the 1959 Disney classic ""Sleeping Beauty"". In this adaptation, the story of the villain is softened perhaps to appeal to a wider audience and thus counteract some dark themes that may not be suitable for children because it shows the point of view of the antagonist. Taking this argument, the film loses its credibility, and completely changes the essence of the protagonist/antagonist. Furthermore, the development of the plot is not convincing at all and it seems that the film only has a chance of being well received and enjoyed due to the special effects that are on par with similar productions such as ""Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Oz the great and powerful.""",Maleficent
592,Mieshkaka,"Excellent, enchanting movie",10,29 May 2014,"I thought this movie was excellent. Anyone who is curious about what could of been the cause of the events in Sleeping Beauty will find this very satisfying..in my opinion. I thought Angelina was amazing. It was as if she was meant for the role. The creatures and setting of the woods is tantalizing and alive with fairies and creatures. It's done very well. It literally made me feel like a child again who wants fairies to be real! I always felt that Sleeping Beauty, while an amazing animated film, left me wondering a lot about Aurora and all the characters really... There was very little character development besides the Godmothers. Maleficent fit into sleeping beauty like missing pieces to a puzzle. Although they are not exactly the same story, they are pieced very well together for the events that matter. I can't say enough how unbelievable Angelina was in this role. She is a beautiful actor..and I don't just mean her looks. She has grace even while villainess. She portrays the roll perfectly. If I were my girl self again, I'd spent days upon days after seeing this dreaming about how it would be to be Maleficent. This movie was a real piece of Disney Magic. As an adult I didn't expect to be so thoroughly drawn in. What a nice surprise. My daughter, 5, and son, 3.5, enjoyed it. It was a little more scary for PG than I expected at the end for them but they were prepared as to what to expect and had seen the trailer. They both really liked it...especially my daughter.

It lacks a good screenplay, and is way too predictable, even in his ""different perspective"" approach. I enjoyed a lot the production design, most of the visual effects, and both Angelina Jolie and Sharlto Copley do a great job. But Elle Fanning isn't convincing, which is a problem,given her screen time, and the ""handsome yet goofy"" Prince Philip doesn't work. At all. So, in the end, a pleasure for the eyes, but way too corny and grotesque.

595,RapierHalfWitt,Not surprising,1,23 August 2015,"Typical feminist propaganda fare.Only men are evil. Women just get angry. And angry women can change. Angry woman can become nice.

But we'll never know. Because men are pointless and useless. So why bother finding out. Men are nasty and icky and don't deserve to be allowed to breath. Or dropped from very high places. Because men are bad. Or just simply useless. All that is right and proper and beautiful in this world is only embodied in woman. All that is sweet and good comes from women. And only from women. Because men are incapable of anything good.Now imagine how this movie will plant seeds of hatred and mistrust of men in little girls.

Can you comprehend small boys everywhere growing up subconsciously believing NOT that they've done something wrong...but that they WERE something wrong.(slow golf clap.) Well done, feminists.

So when I first heard there was going to be a Sleeping Beauty movie made from the perspective of Maleficient, I was a little apprehensive to give it any kind of credit. However, after watching it I was pleasantly surprised. The movie obliterates the notion of only a prince being able to save everyone and everything and it definitely tackles important issues surrounding feminism. It is a relentless movie showcasing the duality of mankind and the evils that surround us every day. I loved how they took a beautiful story and reworked it to show a more realistic version of events had any of this ever happened. I recommend everyone see this brilliantly made movie.",Maleficent
597,harbord-587-462423,Immensely disappointing,2,21 February 2015,"I decided to give this film a go out of a love for classic Disney (pre digital), Angelina Jolie's striking image, and the fantasy element. Sadly Angelina Jolie's image is the only successful aspect of this film (what a surprise that is the only image associated with the film!). Elle Fanning is in the kindest terms distinctly average and certainly not 'blessed with grace' or a 'beauty' by any great stretch of the imagination, neither can she act. Sharlto Copley is also incredibly overrated, and should only be considered for minor supporting roles. There is no character development: Copley's character is shown as a love interest, then we are told (not shown) that he is ambitious, next thing he is evil and cuts off Maleficents' wings and becomes inherently bad - this makes no sense. When Maleficent finds her wings stolen, we see her mourn for them for a few seconds at most, next thing she is 'evil'. While the CGI is good, the fairy fantasy element is shallow - remember how rich with emotion, action, humour and charm the animal scenes were in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs? I expected a certain amount of darkness and menace, something to give us an emotional journey - this was completely lacking. All in all, a wasted opportunity of a film. It would be forgettable if it didn't infuriate me so much.",Maleficent
598,vinuharidas-vinu,i liked this movie,8,19 August 2014,"after a long time.. i saw a adventure movie, it was so amazing, really i like this movie... Maleficent is a an iconic villainous role. She is one of Disney's best characters cast from the dark side and when I saw the trailer I succumbed to the beauty they inlaid using Jolie as the sinister evil fairy. I was seduced to believing that I would be lured into a world of evil and treachery. I wanted to see how evil was born and vengeance would be enacted. I wanted to be able to bond with this evil force and be drawn deep into darkness, rooting for the bad girl. I knew it would be filled with beautiful scenes and Disney magic, but what I did not anticipate that the greatest treachery would be the film itself. Jolie can most definitely embrace evil and the moments when she is allowed to succumb to the full force of Maleficent it is beautiful. Once you add in Goldie Locks however, you get a recipe for disaster. Suddenly I might as well be in a world of pink pixie dust, leprechauns and unicorns because this beautiful villain is disgraced into playing a role of a misunderstood black hearted fairy who really loved the doe eyed giggling Aurora. Hell hath no fury than a woman scorned, this should have been the driving force behind the film. The beginning scenes of a youthful Maleficent should have been nixed to allow more time to build a love story that was even remotely believable. To fall from grace the betrayal has to be tangible and dripping with poison. It must be something more than just a monologue infatuation and stolen wings. They said years passed and yet I felt nothing of a bond or great love that would give birth to Maleficent's destiny.In Disney's Rapunzel the ""mother"" figure who raised Rapunzel from a baby never fell in love with the child as a daughter. She was still greedy, evil and dedicated to her path. So why must the world's most wonderful villain turn to a soft hearted Godmother of a vapid child. I know Disney is trending this ""don't bet on the prince"" idea and that's fine I support that, but really...they thought this was ""no truer love."" If they think the king suffered by simply being tortured with the countdown till his child's demise then they are sadly mistaken. That was child's play. A woman changed by betrayal to the dark side has more ideas in her play-book that can make a man suffer. Madness would have been the king knowing that Maleficent knew the entire time where Aurora was hiding. Maleficent should have been sending him snippets of hair or visions of his daughter with the raven peering down at him while he slept. He should have been physically and mentally destroyed, a raving lunatic. I would have rather liked to see a double treachery in the story. That only the raven knew all along where Aurora was and hid it from his mistress. We could watch the anger burn and grow within Maleficent because she wasn't able to find the child for 16 years. That in the interim the raven would randomly turn into human form and it would have been those two that fell in love and the tragic day that Maleficent discovers her location through some fool's errand played by the three dopey fairies guarding her, absconds with the child and let's the curse play out its course. Then I would have a mega battle scene at the edge of the forest against the king, let her have her righteous moment when she takes his life all the while the king knowing his daughter is stuck in endless slumber with no hope of her being saved. Then during the battle the raven after escaping the battlefield leaves Maleficent's side to try and wake Aurora. When Maleficent discovers her minion's treachery the pain and anger at being betrayed for a second time by her own kind would fill her from the pit of her stomach up through her spine and a black fire filling her eyes transforming to the great dragon and an epic battle of good and evil which will lead to her glorious death! That would have at least been something!Then they could have there happier ever after. Then all those still shots of Maleficent looking like a falling angel in the glimmering sunlight would have been more picturesque, more visually twisted. Overall, I feel I paid $15 dollars for another movie funded by the Prozac and Xanax manufacturers that spread fallacies that evil fairies are really good, vampires are not evil blood suckers and werewolves make great best friends. It's a snooze and a travesty. If you love the traditional iconic role of Maleficent remain in darkness and forget the lies the trailer told you for the glorious black dragon is covered in daffodils and pink tutus in this film.",Maleficent
599,gtskintscher-617-311847,A Most Beautiful Lesson Learned,10,2 June 2014,"Parents certainly want to accompany their young ones to this move, but it is very well worth watching. The true value is in our sleeping beauty, as a little one, seeing the love that still lives within Maleficent's deceived and broken heart. And it is very refreshing for little ones to see that true love does not necessarily take the form of a handsome prince or princess riding in on a white horse to save the day. The visuals were stunning and we were all engaged from start to finish. As for someone who would liken this story to Christianity and the evils depicted in the Bible, any story can be twisted that way.

I knew the sleeping beauty story (sleeping princess awakened by a handsome prince), but actually thought Malificent was a new character invented for this movie (not a character with a Disney pedigree). I mention all of the above because I cannot wrap my head around all the criticism and disappointment expressed on these forums.From my vantage, the movie was wonderfully crafted and acted. It was essentially a character study of a single character - Maleficent - with plot serving a supporting role. The ending twist (though I had seen it coming midway through) was lovely, and the movie's overall pacing and production values of high quality. As for the acting, Jolie's performance was fantastic (I am hardly a Jolie fan): she gave the main character gravitas and sympathy. It was overall a complex, subtle character to feature in a Disney production - and commendably novel and refreshing for this reason alone. Recommended.",Maleficent
601,nurse-taffy,Terrific!,9,31 May 2014,"My husband, granddaughter and I went to see this last night. We were all enchanted! First thing my 8 year granddaughter asks is, ""When will we be able to get it on DVD?"" My response was we would be buying it on Bluray and I hope it comes out by the end of the summer, because I really want to see it again soon! It was a clever twist but had the same artistic feel to me that Sleeping Beauty had for me as a child. I thought Angelina Jolie gave a terrific, nuanced performance. My only negative thought at first was that Elle Fanning seemed to play Aurora a bit younger than 16. But upon reflection, I think she was playing her as a total innocent who looks at the world through wide-eyed wonder. And she did ""grow-up"" as things got rough! It was beautifully done. Different than the original which is truly my favorite Disney movie, but Maleficent, um, they may just be equal now!",Maleficent

Angelina jolie does not convince me she is the iconic evil Disney villain because Eleanor audley did it sooo much better (i mean, couldn't they have found SOMEONE more similar to Eleanor???). in fact, i couldn't stand ANY of the characters, as they all annoyed me. why would they make the 3 fairies so similar and change their names/personalities?? along with king Stephan. also, to have maleficent wake aurora up with HER kiss?!?!? wtf?? i don't understand why they even had the right to use the ""characters"" from ""sleeping beauty"" in this film?! Disney should of just changed some of the symbols (ie the spindle) and just created a new movie entirely. i mean, this would've created ""new"" characters for them to sell merchandise of and make more money... this is the first negative review i've EVER written because this movie was honestly THAT irritating, stupid, and unwatchable.",Maleficent

604,anton_heimerman,"Once upon a dream, there was a beautiful and misunderstood fairy",8,31 May 2014,"Within the opening sequence, we immediately get the picture: ""Maleficent"" goes above and beyond a mere moneymaker spin-off scheme for which a certain unnamed entertainment industry is developing a reputation. Here, we have the charm and glamor of traditional Disney storytelling, spectacular art design, and the only actress in the world that could breath life into the title character. Be a fan or not, you will agree Angelina Jolie is simply MARVELOUS.Undoubtedly the best aspect of ""Maleficent"" is that, for once, it actually lives up to the often misused tag-line: ""If you think you know the story you don't."" Maleficent is a cryptic character to begin with, and now we finally have an explanation. Not only was she actually good from the beginning, there is only a very brief period in which she is actually ""evil"", which might be her most enjoyable scene.At this point, the film begins to unfold in the most unexpected of ways: a transition that is not only pleasant, but rather believable. Served with a dose of humor and good-natured charm, Maleficent watches from a distance over the cursed child Aurora, who notices the presence of the dark fairy and of course, with goodness and naive innocence, mistakes her for a Fairy Godmother. Herein lies the heart of ""Maleficent"", a unique and unpredictable spin on the classic story we all know, in such a way that we can all turn into children again, as though seeing a Disney classic for the first time.VERDICT: Certainly nothing like what you're expecting, but exactly what you'll fall in love with. Jolie is STUNNING, as is the whole experience of this film which is so good, you're likely to forget about the original Disney classic altogether.",Maleficent
605,imdb-887-455966,Enjoyed it,8,2 June 2014,"Despite a handful of flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and heartily recommend it for lovers of this genre. It pays homage to the Disney animated story while venturing in its own direction.First the good: Angelina Jolie is wonderful and brought her A-game to this project. It was a perfect role for her. The story was a good mix of the traditional and the new. Didn't you ever wonder about those fairy-tale villains and their motivations?And the flaws: Elle Fanning (brilliant in Super 8) was well cast but somehow didn't always connect with the audience. I suspect poor direction - it was Robert's first as a director. I expected more than well-delivered facial expressions (""break into a smile in this scene""). Her performance was good, but this was an opportunity for Elle to be great opposite Jolie's excellence. The animated (CGI) creatures were for the most part good, but I'm quite tired by the puffy-blue-elephantine types with sad eyes and dumb expressions.",Maleficent
606,Maleficent28,The good and not good,5,1 June 2014,"The Good: 1. Angelina- she was great. 2. Elle fanning was a very cute Aurora. 3. Sam Riley was great as Diaval. 4. Brenton Thwaites as the young Prince Philip. SORRY FEMINISTS, BUT ROMANTIC LOVE IS THERE AND THE AURORA/PHILIP RELATIONSHIP IS TREATED LIKE TWO HIGH SCHOOL KIDS ASKING OUT THE PERSON THEY HAVE A CRUSH ON FOR THE FIRST TIME! The BAD: Oh my goodness, the people's motivation for trying to kill Maleficent and raid the Moor land is not convincing. Why was treasure so important to them that they did not care for anything else? Why did Stefan value being king over Maleficent? He has to be the worst Disney villain ever! Sometimes, you are made to think that he wasn't an all out evil bad guy, but the script writers seem to ignore that. Another thing. I think this movie would have been better if Maleficent had been a dark sort of character at the beginning rather than a sweet little girl. Someone who was redeemable but still had the potential to be the ""mistress of ALL EVIL!!!!!"" we all knew from the first film. Can Once Upon a Time cast Angelina as Maleficent and do a better job at writing her backstory???? Please, it was bad writing until the christening scene that hurt the film. After that, the movie got good.P.S. Where was King Hubert?????",Maleficent

The editing and CGI in this epic story perfectly emphasises the new twists to a classic fairytale. the message behind the movie is one to remember too: girls, you don't need a handsome prince on a white stallion to come rescue you! if you haven't watched this fascinating fantasy yet get yourself to a cinema and watch the magic :)",Maleficent

A charismatic, willing star who could really carry off a fantastic character, a juicy betrayal to get the tale going, and a lot of great special effects. But unfortunately, you can't stop there. Story, pacing, supporting cast, winning characters? Oops — we blew the budget with AJ's wings and the CGI, so.....So -- is it a spoiler to say that the plot pretty much goes nowhere and that by the end you are so dying for it to be over you don't even care what happens?? If good conflict is what drives a good narrative, does the absence of any good conflict --- very much the case with this plodding, slackly handled drear-a-thon -- make a bad one? The worst thing about this, which leaves quite a bad taste in your mouth, is that in redeeming the character of Maleficent they decide to depict that she wasn't a mean old spinster, she was a deeply loving maternal figure who was just bitter cuz she got royally screwed over by a guy she trusted. It's so schmaltzy it's kitsch. I'm a guy and this stuff offends MY paltry feminism. Considering some of the take-no-prisoners characters that AJ plays (and plays well), I am surprised she even took this part, but I suspect it was doing a screen test with the kudu horns on. I might have even taken the part just to wear those.Oh, and this movie (at press time) had a 7.1 rating. I mean, come on. I know this is more or less a kid's movie, but a good kid's movie is good, so we can just go ahead and say that a bad kid's movie is bad.

Is not Maleficent is Terrificient.,1,8 June 2014,"The movie is not worth, keep your kids from seeing this movie unless your want them to be disappointed and very confuse. Is a terrible change of something that was a beautiful master piece. Incredible to see and believe that the own owner of the Sleeping Beauty (Disney) is destroying what everybody has come to love for generations. I was very looking forward to see the movie since Disney has a good record on movies, although some of the last one has not been very good, including this one. But for example if you saw Frozen you though Disney is back to creativity and beautiful long lasting history that passed thru time. This movie Maleficent is not one of them, you won't be attract to even repeat it nor less read it to your daughters as a bed time story Maybe if Disney Management could use the imagination so much they promote to young ones they could it come up with a new history no one has ever heard before and could sell it. But for what reason will Disney Corporation will destroy what is already a proving time after time years after years mom to girl, princess to princess beautiful story, where the Prince rescue the Princess, The King Father and Queen Mother love and protect their daughter and the bad witch lose and is destroy by the goodness.

Now I am sure all you Disney fans who have watched the film disagree but this movie had an enchanting and endearing edge to it. From its beautiful scopes of the magical forest to its emotional moments, all of these qualities made it feel like a Disney film. Although some of the acting choices could be questioned for example: King Stefan, even though he did look menacing during his battle parts he did not seem very kingly at all and prince Philip also did not look very much like a prince and like Stefan he did not seem very regal.

The story is completely opposite of the original, which I didn't mind considering it was ""the villains side"" of the story. The first half of the movie was great, it was when she started feeling bad (caring) for Aurora when it was just not good. The fact that she gave the kiss that awakened Aurora was also weird for me - just because she is supposed to be the most evil and strongest villain, and this made her the ""weakest"" villain. The actor for Phillip was terrible I thought (it was actually kind of funny). I liked how the crow ended up being the dragon (in the original she was the dragon) - I thought that was an interesting turn. The effects were great. Don't recommend for very young children, they might get scared in some scenes (the king was kind of scary!).

615,harold-19-577690,Perhaps Angelina Jolie's best performance to date,8,11 June 2014,"When I first saw trailers of 'Maleficent' I thought I was in for another 'Lord of the Rings' style hack n slash. I could not have been more wrong.'Maleficent' is exactly what it says on the tin. The significant amalgamation of both Malevolent and Magnificent. As sinister, cruel and dark as it uplifting, inspiring and powerful.There are two significant movies which could be considered even remotely similar to 'Maleficent', the first being the most obvious; 'Sleeping Beauty'. The second being 'Pan's Labyrinth'. But perhaps 'Maleficent' is better than both.'Sleeping Beauty' was still quite a dark story for its time, I remember being mesmerized by the 'Evil witch' of the story as a child, and 'Sleeping Beauty' used much darker tones than many other animated feature films at that time. 'Maleficent' feels the same, the same light and dark tones being used to effect, creating that 'Sleeping Beauty' feel which was uniquely captured in the original animated film. 'Maleficent' feels like the grown up version of the animation, just as a generation of children who watched the animated film have also grown up.On the other hand, 'Maleficent' has echoes of 'Pan's Labyrinth'. The use of the faerie, or realm of fays. The use of a contrasting world of men. And these two polars being at conflict. It is true that in 'Pan's labyrinth' one could suppose that the girl was attempting to cocoon herself from the pains of her reality by creating a make-believe world and in 'Maleficent' the two are both realities. However both state that it is the world of men which is the cause of evil, and nature with all its spirits is our salvation. Even in 'Pan's Labyrinth' there was the associative conflict between 'Iron' and 'Wood'. To elaborate, the torture scene in Pan's Labyrinth is representative of the pain which 'Iron' causes, whereas the healing of her mother through magical roots is representative of the healing nature of 'Wood'. This is also evidenced in 'Maleficent' by the fairy's weakness to Iron.Parallels aside, 'Maleficent' would be the success it it, if not for the powerhouse driving force of Angelina Jolie. Her path from innocence, to betrayal, to revenge, finally progressing to love and forgiveness is nothing short of being a viceral carnage of emotions. Her subtlest of changes in expression warrant and reward your immediate attention. Her unparalleled use of tone and body language bring you closer and closer to the protagonist, and perhaps most importantly; Angelina Jolie is so immersed in her role it is easy to believe that Maleficent's cries of trauma and pain are her own. Comparatively the other roles are not able to even stratch the surface of Angelina's contribution to this movie. But perhaps they are not needed to. From the overly polite Philip, to the three pantomime fairies to the 'enchanted to always be happy' Aurora, many of the roles themselves do not give opportunities for the actors to develop them further. The two which I believe have some credibility are Sharlto Copley's Stephan and Sam Riley's Diaval. Interestingly they are also the only two male roles with any kind of interaction with Angelina Jolie's Maleficent. Sam Riley's Diaval is significant; although subservient to Maleficent, he provides a natural foil for her, rounding her off by reminding her of both dignity and love, values which she had yet to develop in the early stages of her (on screen) life. Sharlto Copley's Stephen is the villain with screen time, however perhaps due to the restrictions of the role, he was unable to provide a true 'Macbeth'. The lack of depth in both his love for his daughter/wife as well as the absence of remorse kept him thoroughly unlikable, but it also stole his humanity. Perhaps a development of his King Stephen would have created an interesting internal conflict within Maleficent during their final confrontation. As it was, he was simply a final boss waiting for the chop.As I mentioned above, the other character's contributions are somewhat superficial or lacking in depth, but this might be an unfair statement as they are being compared to what could be considered Angelina Jolie's best ever performance. And how can a pebble shine, when compared to a diamond?",Maleficent
616,yourface_isgreat,Better Than I Ever Expected!,10,5 June 2014,"Maleficent is a retelling of Sleeping Beauty, and when I found out about it last year, I was so excited. Then I began thinking that maybe it won't be as good as Disney was promoting it so much. Then I went and saw the movie, and let me tell you, it was better than I hoped it would be! I loved the original Sleeping Beauty, and like Angelina Jolie, I've always loved Maleficent and I've been drawn to her. The way they portrayed Maleficent was marvelous. The back story was fantastic and it took turns that I wasn't expecting. Angelina Jolie's portrayal of Maleficent was extraordinary and they couldn't have found a better actress to play her! Elle Fanning playing Aurora was a brilliant choice; she plays that part perfectly. Sharlto Copley was stunning as King Stephan. Although the three fairies were not my personal favorite part of the movie, the three actresses who played them were wonderful in their own right. The plot of the movie was captivating to say the least. The writers did a beautiful job with the script! I won't give out any spoilers; you should go see the movie yourself! This movie was completely amazing and I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is skeptical about it. 10/10 stars!",Maleficent
617,jamals21,Worst movie for young kids,1,5 June 2014,This movie was awful for a number of reasons. First it is a terrible story for young kids especially young girls. It constantly says that there is no love and the true love kiss is from Angelia to the young girl. I am all for female empowerment but female empowerment can do better than being anti man. Second the whole movie was CGI. They put almost no effort into making this movie at all. Disney could have put a lot more effort into making this script and into the costume design. Plus Angelia was super creepy. Anti fairy tales are all the rage and they can be made well but this is not one of them. Its OK to have a story that makes you feel good instead of making you feel like garbage at the end.,Maleficent
618,azren-delmare,"Pretty, but pretty infuriating",3,6 June 2014,"I'll start this with the good points: Angelina Jolie does an absolutely amazing job as the Dark Fairy Maleficent. The various acting jobs range from acceptable (the three fairies) to quite impressive (Maleficent and Aurora in particular). Also, the effects and design are simply gorgeous. The magical effects and creatures are wonderful, and just look great.Now the bad: I had really hoped Disney was above the trend of gritty reboots/remakes, but I have been sorely disappointed. The draw of Maleficent in the classic Sleeping Beauty was how incredible a villain she was; she was just plain evil. By turning her into a character who is not only sympathetic, but eventually heroic, this movie does a great disservice to the character who invoked ""all the powers of Hell"" to ensure her victory. Maleficent watches over the young Aurora, keeping her safe, while the three bumbling fairies maintain *complete* uselessness for the sake of comic relief. Eventually, after she and Aurora meet face to face, Maleficent begins to lament her death curse, even trying (and failing) to undo it. By the end of the film, one is supposed to be rooting for Maleficent, because the kingdom of humans is corrupt, greedy, and evil, the king completely insane.I cannot imagine what executive thought this would be a good idea, but it falls prey to ""Gritty Reboot Syndrome,"" resulting in something that feels more like ""character named after the ones in that other movie,"" instead of a different interpretation. I don't quite mean to say that the movie should have been exactly like Sleeping Beauty, but it just shows no respect for the classic in the first place. Don't waste your time.",Maleficent

The movie deserves a 3 rating because that is all that it is worth. The story was okay and nothing great. The characterization was also good. All together this movies was just dry and boring. If you like good plot twist and good story lines, this movie is not for you. It was like watching a Disney playhouses version of an action flick.

Unlike Charlize Theron Snow White & The Huntsman Angelina's Maleficent stay clothed and offers range into the understanding of evil formalities at no expense to adolescent awareness. Not only does this story of redemption and magic offer the visuals worth of an imagination it clarifies hatred, revenge, as forces of evil as roots to unimaginable consequences over an, other worldly antagonist desperate to see evil flourish.

This film brings Maleficent to wonderful life! She is honestly now one of my most favorite characters of all time. This is definitely not like any Disney princess movie if that's what you may be thinking. It's dark and beautiful and if it wasn't blatant about being Disney, you might not even know.

I can't recommend this movie enough except to say that I have taken my children AND their grandparents to it.

It seems to me that it's too easy for the fairy to stop the curse even she can't change destiny again. She just need to teach the girl how to meditate, which the fairy herself should be doing during the 16 years instead of wasting her time watching the dust. If the girl has some ability to meditate, then her soul can't control her and no curse can be effective any more. There is no way a fairy doesn't already know this.",Maleficent

Mainly because it changes EVERYTHING you ever thought about this story (of Sleeping Beauty) and actually about other similar sorties as well.

626,professorofsandseology,Magnificent Maleficent,10,24 November 2014,"Maleficent, starring Angelina Jolie, takes a new view on the Sleeping Beauty story from the life of Maleficent the fairy. This is much like the musical ""Wicked"" which tells the story of the Wizard of Oz from the life of the Wicked Witch. Everything about this movie just screamed awesome. The special effects, the cinematography, and the acting were all spot on.The magical forest. Home to Maleficent and all of the magical creatures. Almost the entire forest was computer generated but it looked as real as ever. The detail that was put into the creatures of the forest was incredible. They didn't cut any corners when making this movie. Even with the smallest of fairies, you could still see every wrinkle, every smile, and every movement clear as day. And watching as Maleficent soars across the water and watching it ripple or as she flies through the sky breaking through clouds was nothing less than breath taking. Everything in this film looked as real as anything I've ever seen.The camera angles, and lighting were also just as superb. Everything just seemed natural. It didn't like I was even watching a movie. More that I was actually experiencing everything that was happening. The lighting for the movie was great. When it was bright, it wasn't too bright and when it was dark, it wasn't pitch black. But the low light scenes are what really got me. In the castle, where most of the low lighting scenes took place, the amber lights from the torches never clashed with the casting lights and blended right in. And when Maleficent's forest was dark, they added soothing, yet eerie purple orbs of light all over the place to give the scene an ominous but peaceful feel. The acting was as spot on as the rest of the movie. Angelina Jolie was truly born to play the role of Maleficent. She was sweet and kind but strong and vengeful while still keeping her wisdom. And she wasn't the only amazing actor. Copley played a proud, but paranoid king who will stop at nothing to destroy Maleficent. Fanning played an innocent and beautiful (if you can get past her blonde hair and brown eyebrows) but strong Aurora. And Riley played a obedient yet free spirited Diaval (The crow). Even the small actors in this movie did an amazing job. This movie is one of the best non-animated Disney movies that I believe has ever been made. The acting, special effects and the cinematography were just plain incredible. You could really tell that the actors and the director put a lot of time into this movie and It couldn't have been any better. 10/10 for sure.",Maleficent

628,iceandsilver,Beautiful movie.,8,25 December 2015,"Such a beautiful, enchanting movie. This story is truly moving and a really nice twist on the original Sleeping Beauty story. I found myself fixated and pulled in from the very beginning. The whole cast did a really good job. The chemistry between Sam Riley, Elle Fanning & Angelina Jolie is amazing, their little family like relationship in the story is incredibly beautiful. Maleficent's (played incredibly by Jolie) story herself is very emotional, and I really connected with her character. It's lovely watching her character develop throughout the film. There's also some really beautiful and interesting creatures in the film. And the 3 smaller fairies are absolutely brilliant. (Juno Temple was my personal favourite) I'd really recommend watching.",Maleficent

The acting by Jolie was absolutely stunning, the CGI and makeup was excellent for all of the faerie kingdom, and the story completely believable. The soundtrack is also excellent - with emphasis on the closing song: Once Upon a Dream by Lana Del Ray. SPOILERS:The story wraps up nicely, with the pain of Maleficent losing her wings being redeemed by the girl returning them to her, the evil man who stole them from her dies, and the girl - not Maleficent - becomes the queen of the faerie kingdom. I couldn't have come up with a more perfect ending to this film.",Maleficent

The supposed ""rape scene"" was nothing more than a greedy Human being tearing off the limbs of an ""angel"". The ending of the movie was completely absurd.Thank you Disney!My six year old daughter was heart-broken and crying thanks you ending. ""Daddy, daddy, does this mean true love doesn't exist?"" OF COURSE IT DOES! What were you trying to pull with this ending?!?! My daughter deserved better than some sick twisted fairytale! I TRUSTED YOU Disney! This is the first movie your company has ever done where it portrays gruesome fighting and killing, plus you destroyed any ideas about love and romance.

The Costumes are Great also the CGI. All actors did well especially on Ms. Jolie ans Sam Riley. The Music of James Newton Howard are great. This is Really Memorable Movie. This Version has more sense and more intense. Good family Movie. It brings smile on me. Maleficent deserves to have her own movie as the Disney's Greatest Villain. Instead of a Live-action remake, they did a Great decision of representing it on modern times by the New Twist. Maleficent is Magneficent and Glamorous.",Maleficent

633,azureraven,Disappointed,3,17 December 2015,"When I heard that Disney was making a movie on one of their most iconic villains, Maleficent, I was hyped. I was really looking forward to some background on the mistress of all evil, and why she had such a hatred for the royal family and the princess she cursed. I was expecting something along the lines of Wicked, some insight into a character we originally saw as pure evil.Needless to say I was disappointed.It wasn't all bad. Angelina Jolie certainly looked the part, she was definitely trying to play this role. Maleficent's interactions with Diaval were enjoyable to watch. And the visuals, they are absolutely stunning. The cinematography is fantastic in this.However, despite this the movie is still pretty disappointing.The movie doesn't seem to care much about the backstory of Maleficent. Her backstory is very, very rushed. The movie seems more intent on rewriting the original story. Because it certainly doesn't show why Maleficent is the way she is. They try to say that Maleficent is a misunderstood character who has been through a lot of hardships and that leads to her becoming evil. But she's not. The mutilation of her wings leaves her bitter towards Stefan, but she doesn't turn evil. She's shown as a victim who never turns evil at all.So out of her bitterness she curses Stephan's baby, only to have second thoughts and lower the stakes. To hear the supposed mistress of evil say the words ""death-like sleep that can only be lifted by true love's kiss"", hurts. Eh...no. It's Merryweather who countered the curse of death since she never got to give her gift because Maleficent crashed the party.Speaking of the fairies, they are completely out of character. And yes, this is a big deal. The original versions may have had their flaws, but at least they had the sole motivation of keeping Aurora safe. They may not have been the best guardians in the world, but at least they tried and were somewhat competent. This movie portrays them as nothing but blithering idiots. Aurora was just a means to an end for them. Whereas in the original they were more like loving aunts to her, here they seem pretty negligent. And in the original where they all have their own personality, here they've been stripped of that and are basically the same character. You can't even call them characters they're so bland. They were so forgettable I completely lost track of their names. Watching them was just cringe worthy.And on that topic why were the characters of King Stephan and the fairies rewritten completely for the sole purpose of making Maleficent look like the good guy. It's OK to give a villain layers and grey areas to make them interesting. It's a way of showing their development to becoming the evil people they're commonly known as. But not to not have them evil at all. That spoils the point. Same with the good guys. They can be flawed, not everything they do has to be perfect. Once again, it makes an interesting and layered character. But not that they were really evil all that time or just plain stupid.King Stephan is a horribly written character in this. He had nothing in the beginning, and his relationship with relationship which would have actually added to his character was immediately glossed over just to get to the part where he steals her wings. And even though he begs for his daughter's life, when he actually gets her back he looks at her like an afterthought.Also, did it never come to him to actually EXPLAIN to Maleficent or give her wings back? It's never explained.And I may just be nit picking here, but the movie is kind of inconsistent in what Maleficent's weakness is. In the beginning, the iron ring burns her skin immediately, as she quotes, ""Iron burns fairies."" But later on, Stephan throws a iron net over her. Does it burn her and she begins suffering in agony? No. Turns out iron is Maleficent's Kryptonite. It just weakens her. That just bugs me personally.Elle Fannig's acting wasn't strong and the character was pretty bland and forgettable.The ending was ripped straight out of Frozen. Except when Frozen did it, it was refreshing. A year later it's no longer new. It's boring. This appears that Disney's new outlook on love is you can't have love between a man and a woman is non-existent, but girl/girl love that's between family members, not between lesbians, and also excluding true love from a male family member, THAT'S where the real love is! It's shown since the prince in this is useless. He was a bit bland in the original, yes, but here not only as he bland as bread, he's totally useless as well.And disappointingly, Maleficent doesn't turn into a dragon in this for some reason. One question, why? That's one of the reasons Maleficent is so iconic. I've already mentioned the cinematography is fabulous, why would you waste such a golden opportunity to show your audience you are still in fact LOYAL to the original? This is a poor adaptation and overall, just a disappointing movie. It's disloyal to the original, the story isn't well written and it did a very poor job portraying one of the most iconic Disney villains of all time.",Maleficent

638,lagoscalderoncamila,Maleficient's review,9,4 October 2019,"Maleficent is a Disney fantasy movie which was released in 2014. It was quite successful, it even gathered the large amount of 758.5 million US dollars. The main character is portrayed by the actress, Angelina Jolie. The movie is based on the classic fairy-tale of Grimm Brothers.
The movie depicts the story of Maleficent, a magical creature who protects the woods. As a young being, she falls in love with a human who later on breaks her heart. That situation is the breaking point not only in the story but also in Maleficient's life and attitude towards life. She turns into a revengeful being, who seeks revenge for her ex-lover betrayal.
When I first watched the movie I was expecting a classic Disney movie in which the princess is the protagonist. However, Maleficient has nothing to do with the typical fairy tale. First of all, the story is told by the point of view of the ""villain"", who never gets the opportunity to express their perspective of the narrative plot. So, it is interesting to see that the villains are not that mean after all, they have reasons for their behaviour. Second, the extraordinary visual effects that are employed throughout the film makes it quite appealing to the eye.
To sum up, I recommend watching this movie without prejudices towards the villains and to get ready to let their minds blow with the incredible special effects and fantastic setting.",Maleficent

643,pacoyvilejeune,Maleficient,6,18 May 2021,"Maleficent may be seen as one of the countless new Disney's movies if you just look at the directing. In this Stromberg's adaptation of the fairy tale ""The sleeping beauty"" I think that there are to much visual effect which are thought for the 3D but are useless and a little bit boring in 2D. But the scenario make up for it easily : even though you know the original tale you will not bore. The modifications of the storyline such as the explication of the schemes of Maleficent who don't appear as an evil fairy but more as a gifted human is interesting . I believe that the end change (which I will not spoil) enable two things : suspense and a more actual version of the tale : more fixed in the present and it's context. Unfortunately the acting is not very good (someones will says except Angelina Jolie who plays Maleficent) ,specially Sharlito Copley/King Stefan and Elle Fanning/Aurora don't shine by their acting because they don't seems very concerned by the events and might limit the wonderful dimension of the movie.",Maleficent

The film would have been boring without its actors (Angelina Jolie/Maleficient and Elle Fanning/Aurora ) which sublimates it ,all the more that the realization of the visuals effects is flawless and the scenery are sumptuous. The film lives up to my expectations (magic ,mysterious...).

It's like a dark movie, the pictures has been a bit gloomy. So, I have loved the atmosphere of this new film. There are a lot of special effects and the story has taken place in the darkness and a wonderful world. The switch of character between the fairy tales and the movie has made him really innovative. Many twists and turns has given the film as modern as possible, characters are not always good or always bad such as the father of the Sleeping Beauty. The movie starring very famous actors like Angelina Jolie who has brought her personal touch and play well a mystic character.

647,mathisr44,Maleficent,9,15 May 2021,"Maleficent is an adaptation of ""Sleeping Beauty"" but this movie is center around the villain of the story. The story is modified in comparison with the original story, and there is a war to kill Maleficent, who can call the trees to come with her. There are some changes about the characters: now, Disney changes their characters: there are not or evil or good, it's not black or white. Angelina Jolie, who plays Maleficent in the movie, is normally the evil character and the king is the good, but they are humans, so a bad person can be nice at some points and vice-versa. I think it's a good film (the trailer makes you want to see the entire movie) because it's more modern in the dialogues and in the way the characters are conceived.

I think this film is rather adapted for teenagers or even adults.The criteria of the fairy tale have been kept: an evil ""witch"" (Maleficient); a damsel in distress who is waiting for love (princess Aurora); the good fairy godmother (Hortense, Capucine and Florette); a castle; some magical creatures (Diaval, the raven for example, or even the dragon)... nevertheless, the characters are not only nice or villain, some of them change, the friendship between Aurore and maleficent was proof of this

It was not a surprise because it's a Disney movie and they are often awesome. ""Maleficient"" is ispired by ""the sleeping beauty"" but the story is different and we see another point of view.Then, this is a movie not really for children because of the violence and it can interest young adult and adult (that's a largest public).Finally, in this film, we learn more about the story of the evil fairy so it's more dark and maleficent. It's a change from the usual Disney movies and fairy tales. It's still a good movie and it's interesting to know the story of an evil charactere from a fairy tale.",Maleficent
650,angeldelbegue,An adaptation with good and bad,6,16 May 2021,"The Sleeping Beauty movie, directed by Clyde Geronimi in 1959, was one of my favorite Disney when I was younger, so when Maleficent came out in 2014, I had a lot of hopes and I had in mind the fact that Maleficent is one of Disney's most powerful and cruel villains, even though his motives for revenge weren't exactly complacent, and like many Disney, the Princess (Aurora) was the damsel in distress waiting for her prince in sparkling armor. So, I was a little disappointed to see how the film was adapted, because the cast is really good with Angelina Jolie in Malficient and Ella Fanning in Aurora and even though the film is mordernized the fact that Malificient is powerful and cruel is lost. But I admit that the motives for revenge of Maleficient are now more justified. I liked one point in this movie is this point of view about the ""true love"" in The Sleeping Beauty a stranger wakes up Aurora with a ""sincere kiss"" witch is can't be sincere and even is this is a fairy tale this is false and irreal.",Maleficent
651,azizslama-09797,I like it !,9,16 May 2021,"Everything from the costuming, to the sets, to the script and acting it's all amazing ! There is no overuse of the effects in this film. The entire film is done in very good taste and style. The excpetional performances by the entire cast finest in this film.The CGI effects is a bit opp at times but it adds to the sentimental and fantasy atmosphere of the movie.Unlike the usual Disney remake, this movie has a point. It allows you to rediscover a classic story but with a much more fleshed out antagonist and a light twist.But most of all, the changes made to the original story are what makes this movie worth watching. Maleficent is no longer a one dimensional villain but a caring creature who was betrayed and attains peace and forgiveness owing to her relationship with her godchild. The evolution of this relationship born in hatred but evolving into caring and the love feels moving and sincere; leading to quite a surprising finale that brings to shame the original version of the story. It's no longer about romantic love, it's about human love. And this concludes my review: this film was a real surprise.",Maleficent
652,manonbobet,Maleficient,8,17 May 2021,"Maleficent is the twisted tale of the famous fantastic Disney cartoon released in 1959 « Spleeping Beauty ». Directed by Robert Stromberd and came out in 2014, he reinvented the fairy tale telling it entirely from the villain's side and it is rather original!Angelina Jolie played a very convincing Maleficent, more tortured than evil and diabolical.We discovered a much more modern version of the tale with many special effects and adapted more for adults. It was very interesting to know the story from the point of view of Maleficent, in fact a very powerful woman. The King Stephen played by Sharlto Copley is not so kind and benevolent, he betrayed Maleficent and that's why she casts a spell on Aurora played by Elle Fanning in order to take revenge, here there was no prince to rescue her. However, even if Maleficent is not a real villain, she is too humanised and not very disturbing compared to the 1959 movie and I think this might upset some of them.",Maleficent

Maleficent is the ""Wicked"" of Disney movies, where we see the actions and reasons for why she became evil, and also the redemption arc that is not present in the original film ""Sleeping Beauty.""

656,evanmwestcomb,I'm confused on weather I like or hate this movie...,7,4 October 2021,"I really don't know what to say about this movie. On one side, we have people who claim it to be a bastardization of Maleficent's character, where she is a tragically misunderstood fairy who was betrayed by her own friend and is thirsty for revenge, instead of a tall and lean woman who just wanted to put a curse on a king. On the other hand, we have people who enjoy this new storyline and prefer it over classic maleficent. I fall somewhere on the ladder. I do enjoy this new storyline for her and was surprised by some of the darker moments within the movie. The only complaint I have is that this movie could work better as a standalone movie instead (same thing with Cruella). If that was the case, I would INSTANTLY give it a 10. But overall, this movie is surprisingly good despite its flaws. However, I would not recommend this movie to those who prefer classic Maleficent. I would also not recommend Mistress of Evil. That movie I can agree is awful, and should not exist, as this movie already gave a great conclusion.",Maleficent

However, this movie left me with a huge smile on my face, much thanks to the amazing performance of Angelina Jolie. She grows in every movie she's in but this has to be right there in the top of her performances. For those of u expecting a sleeping beauty story (true to its core) will be in for a surprise. The animations are spectacular and you will not be disappointed, neither with the animations or the actors.

659,pponcedeleon,Flying High!,9,25 June 2014,"Maleficent has a lot of things going for it. Great Storytelling, Jolie was magnificent and yeah, movie critics, the VFX were awesome! What, are they supposed to suck, so you can feel better? But that's not all.This movie is power-packed with serious themes, primarily pointing out through plot (not speeches) where the real ""evil"" is in this fantasy world and in ours. So yes, folks, King Stefan has more in common with Frank Underwood than we had originally suspected. But I really love its girl power attitude and how it says once and for all that if you're a girl, you don't need a dude to rescue you. Not what the anti-Disney crowd was expecting, was it? Last but not least, as a Star Wars fan, I'll readily admit this Disney flick did a much better job at showing how someone who is essentially good at heart can become a freaking menace. This leaves Episodes I to III in a galaxy far, far away. The story guides us into just how it is that Maleficent went on to become so mean and we buy it. Plus, it's nice for mainstream entertainment to give us complicated characters, who aren't all bad or all good. Jolie's Maleficent does just that with style.It all comes down to basics. Good and engaging narrative. This one turned what in my opinion was one of the lamest fairy tales of our time into a damn good movie for young audiences... of all ages. So the movie, like the character earns its wings. Fly High Maleficent!",Maleficent
660,teddypgray,Not Very good.,6,26 July 2014,"This movie is a big let down. While the plot seem to have some direct, it lacks surprise. The viewer all but voice each word throughout the movie. Every scene played out just as expected. There is little to any character development to allow the audience to empathize with each character's feelings about certain ideologies. For example, (spoiler) Maleficent harbors this belief that there is no such thing as true love. The story line those nothing to explain why she would think this. Well, it does offer an incident in her pass to suggest this idea, but it doesn't reinforce it to give the viewers a clear concept of it. Also, she began to grow to love the child, but the story doesn't give an appealing reason for her to. There is very little character relationship development here. The story is to broad! It's almost as if the writers sent in a draft of what the movie should be focused around and then the studio began production. The movie itself was entirely too short. Everything seemed rushed and not reviewed to add or take away parts. Angelina Jolie's wonderful acting skills was not utilized. Her face saved face in this movie. Other aspects that saved the movie from being a complete disaster was the graphics and visual quality of the movie, the Disney-ness of the movie (you still feel the enchantment of Disney movies), and ironically the shortness of the film. Yes, it was stayed earlier in this review that the film is too short. While this is true, due to the totality of the film the lack of longevity maintains the audience's attention just long enough to end the film before individuals began to lose all interest. And speaking of end, the film ending suggests that it all comes together at the end and all is well. This is some what true but, the plot, however, isn't made sensible by the completion of the tale. Neither is the character's emotions, attitudes, actions, or characters themselves are vindicated by the end of the film. This movie was a great idea poorly executed. Nevertheless, it tops the charts among film grosses, so maybe it's not as bad as reported?",Maleficent
661,Amarthiel,A different take on the tale but still enjoyable,8,6 January 2015,"I agree with what others say - this is not Maleficent we've seen in Sleeping Beauty. But that doesn't mean the film itself is bad or one cannot enjoy watching it. And that's coming from someone who watched Sleeping Beauty countless times as a kid and still has it on a VHS tape.I believe the main problem here is the different perception of good and evil between fairy tales and reality. In fairy tales there is good and evil with strict boundaries. Good folk are always good and do good, whereas evil folk is the exact opposite. Maleficent we've seen in Sleeping Beauty was evil. I mean, we're talking about someone who put a death curse on a baby because she didn't get an invitation to the christening.In reality, however, there is no good and evil as we've seen in fairy tales and epic stories countless times. Our world is not just black and white and that's the idea behind this film. Here we see a completely different character - a female who has become bitter and angry after she had been betrayed by a loved one. She is not evil at all, because that backstory completely humanized her. Well yes, she curses the baby, but then changes its terms after Stefan begs her. Yes, she watches over Aurora to make sure she reaches the age of 16 and falls victim to the curse, but then her heart softens in time and she grows fond of her. A pure evil being is not capable of doing such things.So it's safe to say that Sleeping Beauty's Maleficent was black whereas Angelina Jolie's Maleficent is grey and I believe this significant difference is the main reason of the most negative feedback. I can't say I'm complaining, because good versus evil is a problematic concept that needs to be revised.As for the film itself, I actually did enjoy watching it. I absolutely loved Jolie's Maleficent, The Moors was amazing and Aurora was so sweet I couldn't help but love her smile as Maleficent did. Diaval was a great addition to the story and the interactions between him and Maleficent were brilliant.There were also certain things that truly bothered me. Writing could have been better. The romance between Maleficent and Stefan was rushed. Prince Phillip looked too young and his hairstyle was too modern. But my biggest complain was, by far, Stefan. First, I don't get how a peasant can be a king some day. Second, this story created another meaningless villain while humanizing Maleficent, because Stefan's actions and motivations don't really make sense. Third, casting was terrible. I can tolerate the young actor, but the other one was a terrible choice. As an actor he's no match for Jolie, as Stefan he's no match for Maleficent. And his accent... oh my, it was so annoying. It was a total distraction that kept me from focusing on his scenes.On a side note, it's clear that Disney loved this ""true love doesn't have to come from a man"" formula they first used in Frozen and it looks like they will keep using it. Again I'm not complaining, because ""happily ever after with Prince Charming"" is just another problematic concept that we should get rid of.",Maleficent
662,Adept-X,variety of good and evil,8,5 January 2015,"This movie seemed a bit out of the ordinary, with eccentric behavior. Was pleasant and enjoyable and had good energy towards the film. The delivery of supernatural powers forced upon the good, whist Malaficent seemed to have a versatile approach to good and evil, almost making her look bi-polar with hidden anger. Angelia Jolie seemed quite selfish throughout the movie and her decision making kept me guessing.A mysterious world with a battlefield of civilization with great graphical features.Malificent seemed to always be the outcast in her world and never seemed to fit in anywhere but appreciated the company of respect and could tolerate and forgive making her not look so evil after all.",Maleficent
663,reginaborlestean,"""The fairy tale is over"" - more truth than one would expect",8,30 May 2014,"***WARNING – SPOLERS AHEAD!***After having waited for what seemed like an eternity, I finally saw Maleficent today. Naturally, being an avid Disney consumer, my expectations were high and, having seen a great deal of the official material as well as a great deal of similar movies, I had an hunch in what concerns the main plot line and what the ""denouement"" would reveal.For one thing, the movie is splendid to behold. Clearly, Stromberg, having a vast experience and understanding in what concerns the fantasy genre, did put a great deal of effort in the visuals, especially whilst designing the sets. King Stefan's castle is a nostalgic reproduction of the fairy tale classic in the original animated movie, the interiors and exteriors alike paying homage to what was defined in Sleeping Beauty as a ""new Disney visual style"". The Moors, by contrast, are a previously unexplored location which, although seem disturbingly similar to the landscapes in Oz, are different when regarding the details and the lavish, luscious Faerielands are truly enchanting and prove to be a real treat for the eyes.The story line shows several weak points where one might think that one particular scene was inserted solely to fill in an empty space. However, the way I see it, the director has chosen this formula so as to illustrate one of the main themes present throughout the film: the existence of opposites. It's a world of good and evil we are introduced to, one of men and faeries – to speak clearly, mankind and nature. The environmental references are obvious and seek to show the fact that the only way in which nature and the human race will coexist is by symbiosis – learning to rely on each other. Whenever man attacks, nature strikes back. Such mirrored images are shown on the occasion of Stefan's coronation when Maleficent also takes to the throne and when Stefan dispatches his armies and Maleficent raises the wall of thorns.Comparing the movie to the original animated feature, it greatly expands on the universe Sleeping Beauty established and it is clearly stated by the narrator (later revealed to be Aurora herself) that ""we know the story, so we shall now learn the truth"". Purists will have to be disappointed by the fact that the movie does not reproduce the animated feature word-for-word and frame-for-frame, though references are made throughout. The christening scene is the most meaningful in that context, as Maleficent's lines are changed here and there just a wee bit, in order to accommodate the story properly, without leaving loopholes. True Love's Kiss gets a new meaning while the word ""know"" from the original curse is replaced with ""meet"", foreshadowing the fact that ANYONE who is to meet the princess shall undeniably fall enchanted by her.Characters receive depth, the one-dimensional characters in the animated classic disappearing into thin air. Gone is the evil fairy who curses a baby for no good reason whatsoever and incoming the Queen of the Moors, bearing a betrayed, broken and stone heart. Angelina Jolie does stellar work impersonating Maleficent, her voice resonating in a similar manner to Eleanor Audley's. A pleasant appearance before Stefan steals her wings, she bares her teeth soon after, the christening scene being her character's climax. Red lips curling into smiles and sadistic frowns, silent, but vibrant evil laugh, gleaming, ice-cold yellow-ish eyes, coupled with a taste for stressing the vowels and smart sarcasm, she makes a king bow before her, begging for the life of his daughter (oh yes, the costumes are gorgeous, very fitting). Her answer to his plea is the sickest joke of fate – the only way for his daughter to awaken from the death sleep is the one thing that does not exist nor will it ever be. In spite of her desire for revenge, she has retained her humanity and soft spot for the innocent as she discovers that the girl she cursed should not bear the weight of her father's mistake. Step by step the two grow close, the actress playing the savory stereotype of a villain with a distaste for children as if she reveled in it. Of light humor is also her companion and servant, the raven Diaval. The two share a bond, which is strengthened by the occasional bickering – Diaval is Maleficent's little brother in more ways than one.Stefan's character also gains dimension, but only by the means of his wild ambition to become king. He ignores his moral values and his beginnings as a thief serve as a foreshadowing for his treacherous character. In the long run, however, he proves to be just another coward – he failed to kill Maleficent the first time around, and didn't struggle too much in their second encounter. Is it redemption, or maybe guilt? Maybe, but he's still a coward for not carrying out the deed from the beginning (not unlike the huntsman in the tale of Snow White, obvious reference, since the mishap sets the rest of the story in motion in both cases). The three pixies however are a bit of a nuisance. Annoying, incompetent and truly foolish, they are too preoccupied by their own worries rather than tend to the child they were entrusted. Which brings about Maleficent's ""wicked sense of fun"" in one scene, scaring the three ninnies by planting a storm in their cottage. Other than that, the interactions between Maleficent and the pixies show the former always looking down upon the latter, and with good reason.I greatly enjoyed the film and though the pace mat be uneven at times, one should reflect upon the message the movie tries to communicate, for it is, in many, many ways, more than just a fairy tale. It's life today as we know it, only with a harmonious, happy ending.",Maleficent

And before I keep going, let me say that I'm aware that this is a Disney movie (sadly so), and that it is supposed to be a family movie. Having gotten that out of the way, I wish the ending had been a bit more tragic and dramatic... along the lines of Maleficent giving her life for Aurora, which incidentally would be the ultimate demonstration of true love (wasn't that, after all, the main driving force for Maleficent venturing into the heavily guarded, iron fenced castle?). It would have been sad, yes, but it would have made for a better movie. The ending is admittedly too happy and perfect... but, again, this is (sadly) a Disney movie. I'm already terrified at the prospects of Star Wars episodes 7-9!!PS: Turning the effects down would have also helped. It was just too much!",Maleficent

The graphics were amazing and the whole movie felt so magical! This film made me widen my eyes in amazement, giggle with laughter, smile with pleasure and has made me eager to see it again. I am not really a film person but I was excited to see this and was not disappointed in the slightest! I watched Disney's Sleeping Beauty before hand with friends and must say that the things we questioned in the Sleeping Beauty film, was answered in Maleficent.

Both kingdoms where very beautiful, in a three dimensional computer generate picture sort of way, with a river in the middle, a ruined castle and everything. Well, this is the story of how two sixteen year old fall in love. One of them was a human boy, and the other a horned (get the hint of what is about to happen?) fairy girl called Maleficent. On a side note: what kind of parents hate their child much as to call her Maleficent?But back to the story, the human boy soon learns that the key to him becoming the king of all gloomy no sunshine kingdom is to get rid of Maleficent but as it happens, he can't get around to killing her because that would't be a very nice thing to do, right? Therefore he decides to cut her wings instead, leaving her there to grow all resentful and jealous while he marries the former king's daughter, whom we are not going to name because she is just not important enough. Maleficent is not best pleased with her sweetheart having a daughter with some other woman and on top of that not being invited to a party were everyone is going, even the annoying fairies... so she decides to give the little girl a birthday present, cursing her to sleep forever and ever until true love kiss and all that.One day, when Aurora is just about to turn sixteen, and after surviving multiple potentially painful deaths with the help of fairy god-mother, she meets baby faced prince Phillip, who is a lovely lad, but not enough to be anything more than a pretty face in this story. They sort-of- fall-in-love-but-not-just-yet and then Aurora has a typical teenager moment and runs away from home, gets pricked by the magic turning wheel and goes to a roughly half an hour nap until (spoiler alert) true love kiss wakes her up. Long story told short, good old Lara Croft with wings destroys the evil madman king, suddenly there is peace between gloomy kingdom and fluffy bunny land and everyone is happy, even Aurora, whose dad was killed just a few minutes ago; but don't blame her, it's not her fault, she was ""blessed"" to always be happy.Now you know the truth. And the moral of this story is that if you ever date a horned fairy don't dump her, things can get very nasty. On the other side, if you are a fairy, don't date a human, we are all become horrible greedy creatures on our sixteenth birthday. It's OK to be friendly before that because apparently kids are all sweet and innocent.La, di, da, di, da...The EndAs with Alice in Wonderland this is a film I wanted to like because of it's amazing visuals but felt bland and long.

668,a_train1222,"Disney I love you, but ugh! (Might be some spoilers)",5,11 June 2014,"I was really looking forward to this movie for a while now. I'm a huge Disney fan and Maleficent is probably most evil and by far the best Disney villain ever created. I sighed the beginning and all but after the christening scene, it went down hill. Let me say this first before I go on, I thought Angelina Jolie did an incredible job given what she had and she looked just like Maleficent, and the film was visually pleasing, but that's probably the only parts I liked. First, I didn't care about any of the characters. You care for Maleficent because it's all about her, but I couldn't give a crap about Aurora, the prince the was shoehorned in just because they need him, and the fairies. The fairies are way different than the original. The only thing that stayed the same was that they took care if Aurora. They also kinda creeped me out. Didn't feel any connection between Prince Phillip and Aurora, just felt like he was in the film because they need a prince. I thought Elle Fanning was fine as Aurora I just didn't care for her at all.Probably the biggest part I didn't like about this movie was that Maleficent was not evil what so ever. Yeah she did curse Aurora, but in the original, she said Aurora would die when she pricked her finger, which is way, WAY more evil than what she did in this film (I still think that scene is great though despite this). I hated how they made her actually watch over Aurora and then actually wanting to take back the curse half way through the movie. Then they made her the hero in the end. No! Why couldn't they made her evil throughout the whole movie? I still love you Disney, but this was not a good movie.",Maleficent

How can Aurora fairly decide upon the ""marshes"" without spending at least half her time among the ""humans"". Would not the 16 years have worn upon Stefan similarly to Maleficent? Or why not? There should have been a change of heart. And who gives up their infant to the protection of fairies? This movie could have been so much more... They should hire me to review their scripts.As my wife pointed out, the movie was very untrue to itself. In the beginning, the anarchist society flourished while the monarchy struggled.

Her role was powerful, because it can show the nature of love and that it isn't all what it is cracked up to be. Most people place a value on love that is fantasy like. Often more than not, this is not the case. But through this movie we are shown that maybe the ""fantasy like love,"" doesn't exist, however that does not mean that true love doesn't exist. And on top of that, that true love takes forms of not just romantically, but a relationship of one person to another.Amazing movie, and by the way whoever did Angelina's makeup did an amazing job, she looked stunning!",Maleficent

I am glad they were there and especially after hearing about shocking and shameful acts in the news in my country, i was really glad someone stepped up and kudos to Angelina Jolie.

However, not all is as per my expectations for your high standards as a producer and a talented actress. There is something in the script that worries me as it misrepresents core human values. It is that peoples' intuition cannot be wrong as Maleficient's intuition about Stefan cannot be wrong when she meets him and he throws away his ring not to harm her. Usually love grows with the time but this is not the case with the love between Maleficent and Stephen. The movie fails to convince the audience how Stephen changes. There are a few other gaps but this one is the most noticeable. Last but not least do you know that the movie's title in Bulgaria is translated ""Master of the evil""? While the fairy is far from evil, the script is twisted.-- Take care, Kamen",Maleficent
674,archangelvojnik,Biggest disappointment of the decade.,1,10 June 2014,"Let me start by saying that Maleficent has been a personal favorite of mine when it comes to Disney villains. Throughout her many interpretations, she has simply been Evil (yes, with a capital E). So forgive me if this review is a bit of a rant.In this adaptation, she is reinterpreted as a good fairy (because she's apparently not a human sorceress anymore?) that simply has a hissyfit. She is certainly not evil - just angry for a little while. She even ends up becoming a Godmother??Even King Stephen's character is butchered. Why does he go insane over her? If he were really the bad guy, why wouldn't he have killed Maleficent when he had the chance? What possible reason does he have for being indifferent about the welfare of his daughter?Speaking of Aurora, it's worth mentioning that she is relatively alright, but still not too close to her original character. A petty aesthetic thing about her is that her hair and eyebrows are not the same color, which is really distracting. Additionally, they rehash the concept from Frozen, which is that 'True Love' doesn't have to be from some man. If this trend continues from Disney, all we'll see is sisterly/Godmotherly/family love movies where Romance is thrown out the window because it apparently doesn't end with a ""happily ever after"" anymore.Overall, this film was simply horrible if you respected Maleficent as a villain. If you did like Maleficent as she was, I don't recommend seeing this movie. Even if you like the idea of there being no such thing as Evil, I urge you not to see this movie. Don't support the people who made it.",Maleficent

I wouldn't have minded additions and even changes to the story, but they went over the line with everything and killed the whole concept with clichés. The visuals of the movie seemed to be more important than the actual plot, which was very generic and boring. To my huge surprise even Angelina Jolie disappointed me in this movie. I think she's a great actor, but for me her performance was flat and I was not at impressed with her acting in this one.Before I saw the teasers I thought the new take on this classic story might be interesting and could have great potential. After seeing the full trailer, I wasn't expecting much, but somehow this movie was even worse than I had feared it to be. None of my friends liked it either, so it wasn't just me. I guess I had just pictured this movie going in a whole different direction than it ended up taking.

678,palmira-x,Rushed and very flat,6,8 June 2014,"I give it 6 stars because of the CGI, the special effects and the twists and new elements added to the classic Disney's Sleeping Beauty. Elle Fanning performance was charming, although her character fell short.I wish the film had had a ""darker"" theme because at the beginning, the scenery ""the moor"" was this bright, colorful, and cheerful world we've seen so many times before, very cliché, it was somehow a combination between the worlds of Bridge to Terabithia, Narnia, and Pan's Labyrinth. (And I swear every other movie that involve magical creatures)EVERYTHING in this movie was so rushed, they threw everything so fast in short scenes, like a play. Now that I think about the movie I have absolutely no clue about the attitude, nor the feelings of none of the characters. Everyone's role was so static and flat, their actions had almost no background, they did everything just for the sake of the moment. There was very little characters development through the movie I couldn't feel any empathy towards them, I was not drown into the film at all. You couldn't expect anything from anyone because you didn't get to know them. The very few intended ""comedy"" parts hurt, they caused no reaction whatsoever in the audience. The relationship (if they had any) of the fairies and Aurora was so terrible and so cold, it ended up bothering. I think in this movie everyone's was supposed to suck besides Maleficient. It was so odd how Maleficient had nothing to do but to watch Aurora grow, like she had no life before she was born. The process of how Maleficient became so attached to Aurora seemed too forced and unnatural.I'm not disappointed because I had no hope in Disney's remakes after seeing Alice's Wonderland, but I feel they missed a big opportunity to dig deeper into the characters emotions and reasons to be, it could've been so much better it hurts to know the movie's already done and it's flat.

680,mermanton,It is really bad...,3,29 May 2014,"I had really high expectations for the movie. But after just watching it, I don't think that 3 years were worth the wait. It was REALLY awful. What the heck was Disney thinking when they decided to portray Maleficent as a pure hearted young girl? How on earth can a girl with wings, horns and a name that LITERALLY means evil- Maleficent is an actual word- be pure and kind??? I have to admit though that the CGI in the fairy kingdom was magnificent. After the betrayal and the wing cutting, she turns evil. The only decent scene, imo. It was scary, the music was really great and the whole aesthetic was excellent. But. WHERE WAS HER CASTLE???????? The christening scene. Why? Why, why? It felt rushed. The whole movie felt rushed! The curse part was also not intense. It was just Angie screaming and then screaming even more, just to add the true love's kiss thing. And then... chaos. Maleficent finds Aurora, she goes by the window and tries to frighten her. Exactly as a 10 year old would do. The fairies were silly and completely useless, to the princess as well as to the movie itself. Nothing like the 3 animated ones. And from that point, the movie takes the downhill. I honestly couldn't BELIEVE what I was watching. Aurora and Maleficent together as friends? The supposedly mistress of all evil becoming an actual fairy Godmother and being maternal towards the baby she once cursed?????? Seriously Disney???? Laughing and playing with mud??? Making efforts to cancel her own curse? And then being the one who truly loves her and kisses her?! The final battle. Diaval turns into a dragon and that's it and Maleficent suddenly becomes Catwoman, wearing LEATHER PANTS(???!) and being extremely violently attacked with iron, as another Wicked Witch being vanquished with water. King Stefan dies without ever knowing that the curse has been broken and the truth in general. He just falls like Dumbledore and dies. The movie is a total disgrace towards the legend of Maleficent. It's just offending. Plus, it really took them 3 years to film it?? It was so short! The graphics were great but that's not enough. What's even worse, I wanted to rely on Angelina and feel relieved but even that didn't happen. She was OK. I couldn't be more disappointed. I am really sad.

Nonetheless, I had chills before, throughout, and after the entire movie.As a Disney fan I cannot be happier to have one of my most favorite classic Disney movie be remade and given a great twist. Most of all, I was so delighted to have one of the most mysterious villain ever to be played by such a powerful and talented actress.However, I think Angelina Jolie dragged the whole movie up herself. Her enigmatic presence and everlasting beauty basically is the reason why this movie is worth watching. Her acting is spot on, her face is eerily beautiful, and her interpretation of Maleficent's character is so good that you can't imagine anyone else who can do better than her.The storyline was somewhat predictable. Some scenes took me by surprise, but throughout the whole film you'd be getting minor details of how the whole movie's going to be. Long story short, it's an 80% Disney movie (which is basically for kids) and 20% Grimm's.The characterization of some of the cast were somehow far off from the original characters, which is both sweet and detrimental. You'd expect so much of what you've seen as a child and then be given this whole new different character from the film. Angelina gave so much power to her character but I think the director gave away a bit of the character's mystery. I was drawn for Maleficent's mysteriousness but the film didn't really gave me much of that dark and gloomy Maleficent I once known. It left me begging for more of her dark side.The whole production did such an amazing job. The cinematography is so astonishing, you'd think it'd be impossible to ever do a movie like that. The whole ""fantasy"" world they created is just beyond words.Overall, it was a great movie, but expect it to be very Disney and more approachable for young audiences. And also expect for a very different twist and changes from the storyline. It would probably kill 50% of your childhood and revive the other 50%. Well they did say in the end something about ""The story they told you is different, and this is the real story behind Maleficent"" or something. So that basically was the reviving part of the whole story.

If only she could give her inner sunshine to the soldiers she killed...well, she don't have a choice, these soldiers supposed to kill her or kidnap her.anyway, Maleficent woke up her adopted daughter by true love kiss. Still it could be better if Aurora could do something to show she made her own decision. Like Anna in Frozen, who chose to save her sister instead of her own life. In this show, Aurora still is someone take action by what she saw or how she is treated. Not very unique personality.I couldn't remember the prince's name. its harder and harder to tell a heterosexual story. How could man be better than woman when showing love? Its going to be tough competition.",Maleficent

I was expecting more evil on Maleficent's part, however there was more depth in her character and I think the movie did a great job expressing her character in a more complex way. It was definitely a lot sadder than I had expected. I can't get over how great Angelina Jolie was as the part of Maleficent. Her expressions were extremely detailed and I was very impressed with her acting. I think this movie is a definite yes, and I will be back in theaters to watch it again. It was a beautiful film, and I think many will find that it is much more enjoyable than they had expected. I will definitely be recommending this movie to others!",Maleficent
687,mmogame316,Sadly Disappointed,4,1 June 2014,"With the release of movie adaptations of classics like Snow White and Jack and the beanstalk, both of which I was highly entertained and thought it was simply amazing this movie was a sad let down. Pros: Visually stunning. Angelina Jolie's performance was spot on with the most evil of classical villains we always knew. Cons: The most beautiful princess Aurora looks like the girl next door. Why does Hollywood try to do that is beyond me. Mary Jane Watson (Spidermans love interest) is supposed to be a beautiful actress and a model. But again the movie portrays a girl next door look in ultimate Spiderman. Elle Fannig's acting was not strong and in the end not memorable in the least. It felt like she was there for the sake of being there.Sharlto Copley acting left a lot to be desired. Was he supposed to portray a loving farther and husband driven mad or a power hungry king driven insane by his overwhelming need to destroy the one creature that he could not bring himself to kill when he had the chance? If he was supposed to potray caring scenes it never really showed. ______________ ______________The King is portrayed as an evil man who begged for his daughters life and could have easily returned maleficent's wings but instead chose not to for reasons which are beyond anyones understanding. This is the start of where the movie just becomes a drag. Maleficent curses the child to die in the original storyline and this is the most important part in the story because of which the 3rd fairy who did not bestow a gift alters the curse by making them sleep instead of death. This part is totally lost in the movie. Watching a bunch of incompetent fairies nearly almost kill a child before the curse can take effect is as much a mystery as why maleficent would watch over the child and save it. Why the king would entrust his child to faeries whom he dislikes is also as much a mystery as why he would not send a nurse maid to care for his only child. The worst part of the movie is being subjected to watch the Princess grow to 16 years old and marvel at the beautiful fairies (it feels like pointless fillers). Also when the princess realizes whats going on one day before her birthday, the 3 incompetent fairies again forget to mention about what happened to Maleficents wings. The good fairies were not incompetent, just funny in the original story and smart enough to hide away the princess for 16 years. Why they made them look so incompetent and negligent is beyond me.Once you get over the visuals you will realize its nothing more than a chick flick geared at young children (visuals) and adults who are romantically inclined. The most evil Disney villain for over 50 years reduced to nothing more than a scorned women out to seek revenge for the betrayal. A loving father reduced to nothing more than a mad evil greed driven man who plunges himself into insanity with a overwhelming urge to kill maleficent despite his daughter being returned safe and well. Many times during the movie I found myself thinking about what work I have the next day or what needs to be done. This is something I have never experienced when sitting and watching a movie on big screen completely immersed in the plot. This is a far cry from Snow White and the Huntsman which was really good barring Kristen Stewart's emo acting (emotionless) drawn from twilight.",Maleficent
688,liuliwuyu-686-975151,"Simple and not as Dark as Expected, but Emotionally Powerful",9,2 June 2014,"Maleficent is not the morally gray dark fairy tale you might expect from all the marketing material, but it is not worse because of it. Revolved around a few central characters, it diverge from the recent trend of having a giant cast and extremely convoluted plots. The specially effect is good, if you like that kind of stuff, but the best thing is Angelina Jolie's performance as the title character. King Stefan and Diaval are also well played. The younger casts less so, but more because the movie does don't ask much from them than their own acting ability, I'm afraid.Can the movie have give the minor characters a bit more development? maybe. Can the plot be more complex? Of course. But that's beside the point of this movie. The true value of Maleficent lies in how emotionally powerfully it is. Most big productions shy away from it, or indeed are reluctant to give it time. It is rare to watch something something both painful, funny and hopeful----a simple fairy tale it is, but one that haven't been told in a long time.Verdict: If you want something like Batman or see Angelina naked this is not your movie. If you want to take you kid to cinema and watch something you might enjoy, this is the one.",Maleficent

I ended up LOVING every minute of it. Jolie's performance is incredible despite what some may say. I was mesmerized for the entire 97 minutes. I personally think it is great for all ages, though I could see how it could be a little dark for very young viewers. Being in my 20s, I found a much deeper meaning in this story than what a 10 year old may find. While holding true to the classic tale of Sleeping Beauty (with a few twists) this story is about love, betrayal, regret, and vulnerability. I had tears in my eyes for a good chunk of the movie. If you listen to the negative reviews and miss out on seeing this gem in theaters, you truly will regret it.",Maleficent
690,maurizio-galeone,A family movie against family values,1,1 January 2017,"This is my first review and please apologize my English. As a father of a 7 month little creature I felt offended watching this movie, where princess Aurora loves her mother and father's assassin: this is not a tale, this is an horror movie! The plot is not just explaining why Maleficent became bad, the plot is completely different from the original Disney's movie... this is a different story! This is not ""sleeping beauty""... this is ""sleeping with the enemy"", where the enemy, from my point of view, is not her family. There is no credible or even interesting character. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.",Maleficent
691,jacopobertacchi,Lots of Unused Potential,7,30 May 2014,"Well over all it's a nice movie. It's got its powerful and iconic Disney character played by a wonderful actress, an enjoyable (although faulty) plot, and its touch of Disney magic. What bothers me is this could have been so much more.I'm going to start by saying that Maleficent looked spectacular and her back-story was actually quite entertaining. Angelina Jolie is still a great actress and she still managed to move me. When the fairy lost her wings and you see her cry in anguish it hurts you as much as it does her. The dark clad and angsty side of the character is also portrayed fantastically with the curse scene being an exact copy of the cartoon version. Its after that point though that the movie seemed to fall apart a bit.Maybe I'm too traditionalist, but having seen the original made me a tad disappointed in this representation. Maleficent does turn into an evil b****, but only for about three minutes while acting like an actual fairy god-mother for the rest of the feature. I hated how Stephan became this ruthless antagonist and how his relationship with the witch did not seem to change much of the plot. His character had so much more potential! Aurora might add little to the whole story, but alas her character is a naive and innocent girl so I was not expecting much. Diaval the raven was actually a lot more enjoyable and entertaining to see on screen, although I would have preferred Angelina being the one who turns into a dragon. Philip was not even in the movie... wait what's that? He was? Oh I had not noticed.The plot itself is not bad and has some hidden symbolic parts. I say hidden because they are really covered by loads of predictable and cliché' scenes. Not to mention, the movie is also plagued by some plot- holes (Who named the child Maleficent anyway?).I'm not writing this to say it was a bad movie, quite the opposite. It was a good movie both graphically and plot-wise, but it ultimately failed to deliver anything truly special to the audience. I would have had the protagonist be a lot more dark (she was a hurt and betrayed soul after all), but it's also true that Disney would not like releasing a movie whose main character is actually a dark villain.In the end I guess I'm just upset that they had the means to make this a truly great movie, but for some reason decided to leave them out. Well, the title does read Maleficent and if it is just Maleficent you wanted to see then you won't be disappointed... just don't think too much of everything else that's happening around her.",Maleficent

An immense effort was put into making of this wonderful picture which shines with every frame. I didn't really care until now for Angelina's acting because of those shallow Tomb Raider performances(and overall movie) but she really convinced me with this one. She brilliantly plays her character being both good and bad and thus succeeds in making you relate to her emotions. The special effects are astonishing and the story is well written. The kids will really love it and their parents will also be trilled. If you liked the story of ""Sleeping Beauty"", you'll find this version even more beautiful and entertaining. My advice would be: GO SEE the movie and then store it in your personal collection.",Maleficent
693,nicglade,"Great for the kids, disappointing for everyone else",7,30 May 2014,"I had high hopes for this movie, and was waiting to see it for months. I convinced my family that I just had to see it opening night.Let me just say that I'm a 90's baby and grew up on the classic animated Disney movies; before the age of computer animated movies with little to offer. ""Sleeping Beauty"" was one of my favorites, and Maleficent was one of my favorite villains. The trailer looked phenomenal, but do not go see this movie based on the trailer! While Angelina Jolie was an AMAZING Maleficient - she gave me chills when she first appeared as the ""evil"" Maleficient - do not have high expectations for this movie. I was expecting some dark, ominous plots while following Maleficent throughout the story. While the kids in the theater loved it - they laughed and they gasped - it certainly is a movie made for small children. It does not follow the original ""Sleeping Beauty"" storyline at all, which may be okay for the kiddies and for Disney to get their PG rating, but for the rest of us that grew up on this film, it's a disappointment. I don't mind some creative differences between the original; it is to be expected. But this completely changed the story. Overall, it's a pretty good movie. Nothing like the trailers. Everything in the trailers are the only truly ""dark"", action parts of the movie. It's great for the kids, and classic Disney happily ever after. Since this movie was advertised as the story from Maleficient's point of view, I expected it to be just that. But it's a whole new story, which portrays Maleficient a more of a misunderstood heroine than the deliciously evil villain we have all come to love. Let's be real here, Maleficient was always one of the most purely evil and magnificent villains in any Disney movie. I scared of her as a young girl - they even had to cast Angelina Jolie's daughter as one of the young Auroras because they kids were too afraid of her. I think this movie would have been a million times better if it had the darker aspects of Maleficent and a PG-13 rating. Still, it's a movie worth seeing, even just to admire the spectacular special effects and a solid performance from Angelina Jolie.",Maleficent

Otherwise, it wasn't bad; but it could definitely have been better.",Maleficent
695,mohammedajam1992,"It's not sleeping beauty, but it's still good...I think?",7,2 September 2014,"I went into this movie expecting to see a prequel to 1959's Disney's Sleeping Beauty but what I got was very different. The movie focuses on Angelina Jolie's portrayal of what is arguably THE most evil Disney villain in history and the titular character of this movie, Maleficent. The movie delves deep into her back-story as a young fairy full of hope and aspiration, who didn't know or understand greed and envy but experienced them in a very cruel way which lead to her becoming evil. But did it? See, this part of the story takes around 25 minutes to get to, then we're in sleeping beauty territory, so this is definitely not a prequel.My gripe with this movie is the way it's been remade. In what universe is Maleficent (lady Satan if you will) not the evil person? I like how she was good and became evil through the despicable acts of Stefan (portrayed by Sharlto Copley) but even then, can we really say she was evil, I mean if we're comparing the 1959 version to this one, this Maleficent isn't evil at all, she just likes to hold temporary grudges against people. For example, when she curses Aurora (Elle Fanning), she doesn't say she will DIE, rather, she says she'll sleep forever, which is KIND OF like dyingWHAT!!??, then 10 seconds later, she backtracks and says the spell will be broken by true love's kiss. Where's your conviction lady? Make your point and stick to it! This just tells me she has no control over her emotions which is really unlike the 1959 counterpart who oozed conviction. Secondly, what's the deal with Aurora? She's portrayed as a little girl, not a teenager and therefore there's no real maturity in the dialogue between her and Maleficent which removes potentially great text from this filmI know it's for kids, but I'm 22 years old and grew up watching Disney and dammit I want me some mature conversation. Thirdly, the fairiesOMG the freaking fairies, what were they about? Such a waste of time. They didn't do anything to the story but were simply put in because they were in the old movie, simple as!Prince Phillip was also a waste of time. I f you blinked you literally missed him, that's how insignificant he was to the story. Plus he looks like Harry Styles from One Directionenough said!I also felt this movie was a little sexist towards men, yeah I went there! I mean, there are literally ZERO good male role models in this film. One is a king who declares war on the fairies because he claims they have become too powerful even though it is established that fairies and humans never come into contact with each other, so where that idea comes from is a guess to me. The second is a greedy bugger who drugs Maleficent and cuts off her wings so he can become king. The third is a One Direction wannabe who probably went to the wrong film-set because he did bugger all. The only good male role model was a crow, so I don't think he counts since he's not human. I'm all for gender equality in movies but this is pushing it too far the other side of the sexism-ometer. Finally, the ending was a little too nicey-nicey to me. I mean, had the film been nicey-nicey from the beginning then I would have forgiven it, but it wasn't. It was dark, therefore the end could have easily been redone a million ways. What's more, the film ends so abruptly, you never get a chance to see Stefan redeem himself. It's a little unfair I think. So for all these gripes, why is the film given a 7 out of 10? Well, although it wasn't the prequel I had in mind, if you forget what you thought the film was going to be and focused on what it WAS, it was pretty good. Firstly, it's is a visual masterpiece, what with the forest of thorns, the castle, the moors, the mythical creatures, those tree soldier things, etc. etc. Secondly, Angelina Jolie's return to acting after 4 years (The Tourist, 2010) was the PERFECT casting of Maleficent. Her physical and emotional agony at the loss of her wings and betrayal by Stefan was acted so brilliantly and when she curses Aurora, you can feel her hatred toward Aurora and Stefan. Another excellent role was Sharlto Copley as King Stefan. He was phenomenal, I mean the guy knows how to act. The way he becomes possessed about killing Maleficent to the point where he becomes schizophrenic and is oblivious to the ill health of his wife really sets a dark tone to the king and the film as a whole. I also like the way True Loves Kiss was done. Aurora was woken by Maleficent who was essentially her mother figure for the best part of a decade and could actually build a true platonic love with her as opposed to the blink-and-miss-him prince who she met for the best part of well, a blink! Overall, this film is good for a Disney REMAKE of sleeping beauty. Just don't expect it to be anything like sleeping beauty because it tells a completely different story to sleeping beauty where the good people are bad, the bad people are actually good and misunderstood and the fairies and princes are just a waste of time. This film has made the same error Frozen didit assumed that audiences these days can't take a little grey character, it's got to be black or white, evil or good and I think it's for that reason Maleficent transiently became evil, not completely evil and therefore didn't do her justice. I'm torn on this movie since it's still good but could have been AMAZING had Disney properly catered our nostalgia instead of throwing in pointless princes and fairies.",Maleficent
696,acmb14,"""A disgrace to the forces of evil""",7,28 May 2014,"(Contains spoilers) An effort to rant out my desperation for the film;Maleficent, you're everything I've never hoped for. :(((( Sadly after 3 years of waiting and enticing for it, since the film's announcement I'm not impressed (disappointed actually). The story line is crap, Maleficent is supposed to be the mistress of all evil, a menace and a villain whereas in the film, you can only see it for quite a short time and YET it wasn't cruel enough as portrayed in the trailers, the cartoon version of her is A LOT MORE villainous, good thing the execution on Angelina Jollie's look is PERFECT! From her clothers, acting and prosthetics she really looks like Maleficent from 1959 brought to llfe. She's actually the only real reason I enjoyed the film. You can only see her cruel and ferocious in the film for like less than 15 minutes. I swear! Then suddenly in one part she's addressed by Aurora as her fairy godmother?? Wtf. Her powers were portrayed without justice. The comedic approach shown through the dialogues were lame (its a fantasy/fictional story not some remake of Jumanji or Peter Pan, WHYYY??). Damn LAME.In the scene where she regains her wings, she was suddenly wearing a ""CAT SUIT"" an effin cat suit WITH HEELS, like the ones worn by superheroes in Marvel/DC universe. What were they thinking? She's an antagonist for a Disney princess. We're talking fairytale here people, not a comic book adaptation for Christ sake.The actress who played sleeping beauty disappears in the story. I mean, yeah sure the acting was great, she's pretty but there was nothing special to it.There was no love story between Prince Phillip and Aurora. You can only see him like 3 to 5 times in the film with shoooooort appearances. The story's supposed to revolve around their love for each other. That's the whole reason why there is a tale to tell, how sleeping beauty survived, the value of ""TRUE LOVE'S KISS"". We all know that by heart. But in the film it feels like there's a Prince Phillip character just for the sake of a Prince Phillip character to appear and be part of the film. He's supposed to rescue Aurora from her sleeping slumber.....or did he? Opps....The antagonist in the film is quite surprising (yes) buuuut I just don't get it, WHY?? Why is it that all of a sudden that antagonist is so mad of everyone else. WHAT HAPPENED? It's the one you'll least expect. It's not a treat and there's nothing special to it. AT ALL. Quite irritating actually. I'm not a hater to the franchise, but coming from someone who grew up watching the animated version of sleeping beauty over and over again, growing up to it and have it considered as his favorite fairytale EVER, this film is disappointing. Only Angelina Jollie served the treat. She's the only one to root for in the film and reason to watch it over and over again. Yes the visual effects were very good, VERY, VERY GOOD (you can take my word for it) but, it wasn't detailed out the way it was marketed. It lacks story and good acting (again, aside from Angelina Jollie). But hey, still, this film is worth a watch!

699,enabeshello,Confusion,5,22 September 2014,"This is actually the strangest version of the fairy tale ""Sleeping Beauty"". The whole plot gets complicated and constantly I've been asking myself during the movie: ""who is the villain and who is the good one""? Here it seems everything messes up. The three fairies who were supposed to raise Aurora properly and protect her from the curse seem to not do their job at all but quarrel and not know even how to feed a baby. Moreover, Aurora seems free to wander into the woods whenever she wants, so obviously there isn't any effort from the fairies to take a good care of her. I think that makes no sense at all. The main issue in this tale is the ""Maleficient"" as a notion. Surely I liked the twist of the tale when the evil fairy wants to break the curse because she begins to like her victim. I mean, this happens, and it gives a good message in a certain point, however, there isn't a distinctive line or gap between the good and the evil. There are many turning points like when Stefan harms Maleficient (Stefan now is the bad guy), when Maleficient takes revenge (and Stefan becomes the victim of his own ambition), and when she protects Aurora more than the three dumb and irresponsible fairies. Being a man doesn't mean you're definitely good, and being a fairy with black wings and horns doesn't mean you're bad. That seems to be the moral of the story, which I find it very controversial and ambiguous.",Maleficent

The first 1 hour of the movie was pretty good, but than it all happened. First of all, the king was pictured as the most evil one but that was not the case. He did cut the wings of Maleficent, but he didn't kill her and he had the chance.

However, trying to make the villain of a classic Disney movie into a good guy is infuriating. I understand how the directors wanted to make a change, but why? There is no point in making a huge change in a classic Disney movie. For example, Prince Phillip was not at the ceremony as a boy, defeating the whole purpose of the main highlight song ""I know you (once upon a dream)"" which did not happen. In the movie, they met of him asking for directions.Another thing, the fairies, Flaura, Fauna, and Maryweather in the original movie were at least somewhat responsible. But in this movie, they were the most stupid, dim-sighted caretakers I've ever seen. In the movie, They didn't even cast the names. Not to mention the hilarious cake/dress scene they made for Aurora's 16th birthday. Aurora never dances with Philip, which again, defeats the whole purpose of the ""true love's kiss"".Speaking of which, the whole ""true love's kiss"" scene never happens which makes me want to rip hair out of my head. It's the whole point of sleeping beauty The whole castle never falls asleep, and Maleficent awakes Aurora with a true loves kiss. what? Maleficent never turns into a dragon, which was the best part of the original movie. Where the prince slays the evil fairy and saves the princess. that's what we want to see.Basically the only good thing about the movie were the special effects and cgi.

705,jeffreysenk,new review,4,28 November 2014,"I initially enjoyed this movie although one aspect of it kept running though my head:This has got to be the most sexist movies I have ever seen.All of the male characters are either evil or idiots or both. The only characters that are good or reasonably so are women. The only people capable of ""true love"" is women towards women(Lesbian/feminist) fantasy. Men are not only portrayed as manipulative liars but also the ruthless despoilers of Utopia. This is a running theme in recent movies such as Avatar. The truth is that without men not only would society exist but the ability to see these anti male, anti technology movies would also not exist.It is entirely unproductive to fill young impressionable minds with propaganda that men are nothing but greedy rapists eager to take advantage of women and destroy Utopia. Even Maleficent who cast the spell on a young innocent baby is rendered blameless and forgiven because she was driven mad by the actions of a man. So the narrative is ""even when women do horrific actions they are blameless because it is all men's fault"". Truth is Utopia has never existed and never will, nor is it an enjoyable place for civilized humans to live. Just watch a few episodes of Naked and Afraid to see how ""wonderful"" life is without modern technology that men have created. It is also not productive to fill their heads with anti male sentiments.There are plenty of men who are honest and noble and yes... capable of true love.",Maleficent

Humans occupy a nearby kingdom. Each mostly keep to their realm until a young man enters the Moor to steal a jewel and is caught by Jolie. They become friends, grow up together, and she falls in love with him.When the nearby king fails in an attack on the Moor, the young man uses Jolie's love for him to take her wings and get himself appointed king. This sets up a central question, will she get revenge? She curses the new king's daughter so that when she reaches 16, she will fall into a deep sleep that can only be woken from a kiss of true love.In this middle section, Maleficent watches over the girl, whom she clearly and deeply loves. As the girl gets to know Maleficent, she comes to love her like a mother. But this section of the movie mostly keeps the king scheming to destroy Maleficent off-stage, and there's no real drama around seeing Maleficent care for the girl. Beautifully acted by Jolie, yes; the narrative tension necessary to sustain the movie, no.Narrative tension is generated when a character has a clear goal accessible to a story's audience, and is blocked from achieving that goal. When an audience has internalized a character achieving that, the narrative tension is transferred to the audience. This is what makes a story compelling.Maleficent has no narrative tension in its middle section, so the drama of the story sags.Jolie's wonderful performance can't make up for that.Jolie as an actress had the same problem in the movie Changeling. Great performance, no narrative tension.",Maleficent
707,c-tripp,Misleaded by the good rating,1,12 June 2014,"Cinema visitors seeing the good rating and reviews on IMDb beware.I am a big fan of fantasy movies, but first of all the 16+ Rating is not truly understandable for me. It's a children and family movie, and so i have to confess i may be to hard on the movie, because i went in there with to high expectations.The look may be good and the VFX are also high quality production, but the story just lacks on depth. The idea to show the beginning of evil and the fairy tale world from another point of view is good, but the script and the acting was really bad i.m.o Angelina could have done better and some very flat character drawings and dialogs let me roll my eyes unconsciously. The movie had some funny moments though, but they are rare and for this idea there should have been more time for preproduction. Sometimes and most of all in the beginning it seems like a fast-forward story, where every important story point is just streaked with the cautiousness of a metal glove.It's what i would call a Sunday afternoon movie, where you can lay on the couch and just let it pass, but it's nothing what really attracted me. For my 3 female friends it was entertaining, but they also told me that it was nothing special and they would not really recommend it to other friends. They just described it as a ""nice""If there are no expectations and you want to make your 4 to 12 year old child happy with a nice movie, you should sit in there. Seeing Angelina in the role was interesting, but now i know it's not her kind of genre.",Maleficent
708,person-of-nocolor,"Tired theme, incongruent casting and characters",1,29 November 2014,"A tired theme and plot. Nothing to see here. Overall the plot has a political agenda aimed at America in spite of the fake British accents. Ugly, inglorious scenery abounds from the beginning. Don't take your children to see this movie or rent it. Renting the movie or paying to see it because it has Angelina Jolie in it is the same as having voted for Obama because he was black. Great movies are cast with unknowns.So predictable- casting spells, turning people into the proverbial newt, royal birth and associated spell. Choir voices in spite of zero spirituality with associated special FX in the fairy-color spectrum. The political slant is in the plot where Maleficent defends the Moors (a biome in Europe) from humans. ""I banish humans from the moors fo-evAH!"", she says. The common belief today among the confused is that humans have ruined Mother Earth and do not belong here.My daughters and I have watched nearly every Disney movie in the last 20 years and this is the worst.",Maleficent
709,ExperienceTheMistress,ExperienceTheMistress.com Maleficent Review,8,1 June 2014,"After viewing the movie three times in every available cinematic experience ( RealD 3D, IMAX 3D and 2D), here our review of Maleficent...The bottom line: It is a great thing for Disney's Maleficent to offer the mainstream audience a chance to discover my favorite villain. It definitely pays-off the intensity of the character, and I think it has helped people understand why I love Maleficent so much. While it's visually stunning, and Angelina Jolie truly embodies the character we know and love, I feel a bit disappointed in the changes to the story. But, I do understand what Disney was trying to accomplish, and will continue to be supportive of the film. But most of all, I will continue an unyielding passion for the character of Maleficent, and encourage everyone that has been introduced to her through the live-action film, to revisit Walt Disney's original Sleeping Beauty animated film (1959) so they can have a true appreciation of Disney's #1 villain!Read the full review: http://experiencethemistress.com",Maleficent
710,hanpuder,Another Feminist Movie,6,1 June 2014,"Let me start by saying that I am a female, 22 years old, and probably one of the biggest Disney fans out there. Second, I found ""Maleficent"" to be an amazing movie as far as the effects, costumes, and make up go. But that is about it. From the opening lines of the movie, man is portrayed as greedy and wicked. Emotions of sympathy and compassion are stirred for the character that is traditionally thought of as evil. Parents are not to be trusted. They are really the ""evil in the world."" And the one force that is ""true love,"" lied to the princess and killed others. Why did Disney allow the traditional values of Sleeping Beauty to be twisted? Good is evil and evil is good. Why? Unfortunately, the movie has a feminist agenda ( what can be expected when Angelina Jolie is the star and executive producer ). Ironically, traditional values are now attacked and considered the ""wrong"" view. Liberal views are the only ""right"" perspective.",Maleficent
711,pradeep_christo,An excellent adaptation,10,28 May 2014,"Every true fan of the original Sleeping Beauty (1959) was skeptical about this and how much it had to deviate from the actual movie, and as more of the movie was revealed, it was only proving to be another female empowerment, victimized villain kind of a movie. But I'm glad I was wrong, for I'm sure only by watching the whole movie can we truly appreciate and understand the very convincing back story and development the character was subject to. Of course with very liberal changes to the original plot, the key elements that you'd look for are intact. Need I mention the perfect casting of Angelina Jolie, Maleficent truly comes to life in full form by Angelina's stunning skills and presence. A twist that's not cliché, sentiments that are deep, humor that's ever so natural and action that always keeps you at the edge of your seat! Maleficent in this movie is not exactly as we know of her from the few minutes we got to see her in the original movie, but let me tell you she's every bit deliciously evil. It was amusing to see Angelina play a role that requires a lot of nuances to pull of this character with a lot of depth as opposed to the one-dimensional character from the movie. Never letting off the grip, she carried the movie on her shoulders. Nothing to take away from the beauty of the rest of the movie which takes breath with excellent direction and visual effects that will truly transport you to another world, and the amazing work by all the 'supporting' actors. Yes, the other characters weren't as fleshed out as Maleficent, but I see that as good thing, given the title and theme. A spectacular balance. I'd also like to bring light on the enchanting score, thanks to James Newton Howard, this maestro is underrated.A comprehensive movie, there's a little something for audiences of all ages, truly a masterpiece.",Maleficent
712,remingtonlongstreth,Malefiscent,6,28 June 2014,"Malefiscent is a spin off of the Disney Classic Sleeping Beauty (1959). Angelina Jolie stars as a beautiful young sorcerer who turns into an evil villain after her first love betrays her. The special effects are nothing special. The story line is above average. I would definitely wait to see this movie on DVD. If you are a movie watcher, it is worth a sitting. This is not Jolie's best performance and I do not even think she is holding her breathe waiting on an Oscar. If you have children and they are aware of the Sleeping Beauty story, I would actually recommend that you take them to see this film. It will give your children some historical Disney context that they may appreciate.",Maleficent
713,siergssmith09,"Listen well, all of you",10,29 May 2014,"I would like to say that Jolie was just indeed perfect for the role of Maleficent. I mean come on! She did it flawlessly and effortlessly, you can see that she really enjoyed portraying her character *no doubt about it.* For the uttering of the curse part, some people found it ""trying hard"", ""she sounds bad"", ""I didn't like it"", ""Why?"", blah blah blah. What do you expect? This movie is intended for the little ones, not for the adults who has very high-standards. If you're an adult and doesn't like cheesy movies then don't watch this, this ain't for you. You better watch something else like X-men or wait for upcoming movies such as Transformers, Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc.We didn't expect that she would be that soft because in the classic Sleeping Beauty she was really dark and gave us the impression over the years that she was indeed the mistress of all evil - Powerful sorceress that draws power from hell *that's why she became that 'ol mighty dragon* Of course, as expected, Disney would really alter the story. As you can see, they gave her character a justice that's why the film showed lots of her lighter side. I for one don't want to see a live-action movie that will really follow the classic, I mean come on! It would be a waste of time because it will not give us a new kind of excitement for it.They gave us the impression that the movie will be very dark *as shown in the trailers* but then the movie showed the lightest and most human part of ""the mistress of all evil"".I know that people have different opinions, I respect that but if you just bash the movie out just keep your mouth shut/don't waste your energy typing foul words about the movie. Don't disrespect the people who made this movie possible, it took them a very long time to wrap this movie whole. :) I repeat: This movie is intended for the little ones, not for the adults who has very high-standards. This is a child-friendly movie. If the movie went really evil for her character like in the classic, what would a child think if he/she saw the movie? They'd be terrified and may give them nightmares. Think again. That's why the story went soft 'till the new ""cliche"" true love's kiss part.They proved that strong love does not come from Prince-Princess type of stories where they meet and then live a happily ever after. Love is also powerful in the family/friends area. So strong that can be one of the means in breaking a curse. :) Have a great day everyone :)",Maleficent
714,meiju-myllari,Nothing new to see here folks.,2,28 May 2014,"Maleficent is the very first movie, in my long list of movies that I have seen, that I wanted to walk out of.Lets start with the positives. Angelina Jolie was incredible. She was beautiful, she was strong, and she executed Maleficent beautifully. Her relationship with Aurora was refreshing and.... Nice. The magical world was something that has been seen on movies like bridge to terabithia, but it was still beautiful and engaging.But all of this does not save the movie. I expected to walk in and see a movie similar to wicked, where we get a better understanding of the bad guy. Yes, us understanding the bad guy does not excuse what they have done, but we can see where they come from. In the musical Wicked (and even in the movie great and powerful Oz) we have sympathy for the character we previously viewed as the bad guy. We could see where she was coming from. In those adaptations nobody truly ended up becoming ""the bad guy"". Most were victims of circumstances. In Maleficent? It was ferngully/Avatar all over again. Magical people, good! Man, BAAAAAAD! Instead of giving depth to all the characters that previously were left rather flat and on the background on the original sleeping beauty, suddenly the king has been reduced to this one dimensional villain that created the evil Maleficent and later on becomes obsessed with killing her! He was given NO aspects that would make us have even the tiniest bit of sympathy, not the smallest bit of understanding. He was just a vile man that broke Maleficents heart, mutilated her, and cared only for power. Even when he tried to protect his daughter, it was made appear more like he was protecting his property rather than a person he loved. Yes, he graveled for her for a bit, begging Maleficent not to curse her, but that was it. The movie left all traces of the good of the humanity from it. OK, it had some of the good of humanity, but the only human that was portrayed as good was Aurora.The movie tried to portray the three fairies as the comic relief, but ended up just portraying them as idiots, incompetent selfish creatures. The fairies in the original Disney movie were clumsy and unused to taking care of a child, but they were like that because for the first time in their lives they could not rely on their magic to achieve things in life. If were as modern people were thrown in to the middle of the woods and had to do everything by hand, then yes, we would be as lost as they were. But they were given 16 years to evolve, to learn and to grow. But no. The fairies were not given even the smallest of story arc in this movie. They were creatures that switched sides when ever it benefited the movie.I mentioned before that I liked the relationship that Maleficent and Aurora had in the movie, but even that was shattered later on in the movie. The solution to the problem was not a surprise at all. It was taken straight out of Frozen. It was refreshing and incredible when Frozen did it, because it was the first time Disney did not use the age old solution of a man being the one delivering the kiss of ""true love"", but when the same solution, the same realization is done in a movie that came out within year of each other? It is boring and in no way exiting, it is in no way entertaining. We have learned NOTHING new. Is this Disney's new approach in relationship? Love between man and a woman is obsolete, but the love between girl (family kind of love, not lesbian, kids apparently can't handle that, and also, family excludes male family members at this moment as well, only women can feel true love!)is the strongest of all the loves in this world.In the end, the movie basically told the audience ""yeah, the movie/story that has been told for decades is actually a propaganda, and I should know, because I am Queen Aurora, and I was there all along!"" The original Sleeping Beauty was rather black and white, good VS.. Evil. When I walked in to the theatre I expected the lines to be blurred, to be thought ""all stories have two sides, not all of our actions are blatantly good OR evil"" but instead the writers and directors and what nots decided to make the line between good and evil even more visible. The good creatures are good no matter what they do, and the bad humans are bad and rotten all the way.In conclusion: The movie might have given some depth to a villain that previously had been left as a rather one dimensional character, but in exchange they created a new one dimensional villain, just switching the genders around. The worlds was beautiful and the lead actress was amazing, but even she could not save this rehash of a movie in the end.",Maleficent

716,km-14-516317,Wow...Beautifully done...,10,30 May 2014,"Maleficent was an amazing movie! I waited about 2 years for it to come out and it did not disappoint! Although the commercials and advertisements show this film to be extremely dark and terrifying, it wasn't as evil as it was portrayed and there was a great balance between other emotional elements. Maleficent combines beautiful atmospheres, fairy-tale, innocence, and pride along with destructive intents, evil, power, revenge and of course maleficence. Simply put, an individual takes something that isn't theirs just for greed...and the victim of course wants revenge. An individual becomes evil for a reason, usually when something of theirs is stolen like their pride, heart, or wings. There are some deeper meanings portrayed and you get to see it through Joile's acting. There is a different ending so it shouldn't be compared to the original Disney's Sleeping Beauty. Since I am a huge Jolie fan, It must be stated that Ms. Jolie did an outstanding job portraying her character- her emotions, expressions, anguish, anger, and strong features made this film. At times Maleficence reveals her evil laugh and smiles and you just can't help but like this Villain for how gorgeous she really is. All the costume makeup in the world can't hide her gorgeousness. There is a ton of light humor in the film and some intense fight scenes. Well rounded movie combining love, anguish, revenge, and terror.",Maleficent

And the quality is the best. This has nothing to do with Frozen, don't compare them .

However, it is not cliché at all. Maleficent has many nuances and facets, and it's very interesting to see her changes and her motives. There is even a little bit of humor, which comes naturally and makes the spectator smile a bit, contrasting with the darker tone of the movie. Angelina Jolie is amazing, she really portrays Maleficent as this sophisticated and dark woman, but who is also driven by strong feelings such as hate, love and selfishness; not pure evil. The acting is a 10, there's even a scene where Angelina gives me the chills. I now understand why it's ""appropiate for all audiences"". The reason why I give it a nine out of ten because a) I expected it to be much darker and b) I am also a bit disappointed on the fact that they didn't play Lana del Rey's version of ""Once Upon a Dream"" in the movie, except in the credits.",Maleficent

721,natalie-tsay,Angelina Jolie IS Maleficent,8,31 May 2014,"As I've been HIGHLY anticipating its release, I saw the Thursday (May 29) showing of Maleficent. The most that I could gather from the previews was that Angelina Jolie makes a fierce Maleficent, and in that respect, I think very few people will be let down. While it probably won't blow you out of the water, I can tell you that Maleficent is an entertaining live-action take on the timeless animated feature, Sleeping Beauty... While the effects aren't groundbreaking or super- remarkable, the cast's genuine portrayals and the unique twist on events make it worth seeing. The message that ""everything is not what it seems"" is nothing new, but in my opinion, the delivery shines. Not everybody will be enchanted by the live-action prequel (of sorts) to the 1959 animated Sleeping Beauty, but those willing to take Maleficent at face value probably won't be disappointed.

722,v-h-schmid,This movie is an embarrassment for Disney.,3,31 May 2014,"This movie fails to show why a remake was necessary. It fails to bring the morals of the old movie into the modern world and it fails to develop the characters overall. It also shows a disappointing amount of visual inconsistency just to promote one Hollywood Star. The female-female-relationship as central point rather than the male- female-relationship is nothing new since Frozen. In fact, Prince Philip, who is even more one-dimensional than his cartoon-version, is still there at the end to be the one and only. Considering how easy this film avoids any conversational aspects between Aurora's real parents and ""adoptive parents"" just shows that plot development and modern problems were not what the writers thought about. Aurora's mother dies off-screen and nobody, not her husband, not her daughter ever seem to take any notice. Just to avoid any problems between the two mother figures in this movie.Not only the Queen and the young Prince are loosing screen-time and depth, the three good fairies in the Original had personalities, while they are now only a bunch of annoying and incompetent additions for the sake of obvious humor. The third fairy never actually was able to give her wish. The movie never explains this plot whole. Maleficent is a movie starring a cartoonist version of Angelina Jolie in a movie about Angelina Jolie. No character apart from her has been developed with any love or thought. They are all background for more Angelina Jolie. Overall I am deeply disappointed. If you compare the old ""Sleeping Beauty"" with the new movie you can see the Disney tendency to go from timeless movies to something that looks great but communicates nothing. Don't watch it with your children, they will not learn more than what they can get from the old movies. Don't watch it for the sake of nostalgia, because it's unable to provide the same quality it used to, before 3D was able to overcome any plot wholes. And don't watch it for the sake of crafty 3D. The same expected shots of flying, sunsets and growing plants are used over and over again. You will get tired of seeing the same overly perfect shot repetitively.",Maleficent

Some people may think because it is Disney that it is for children, however that is not the case at all. I saw it the first time with a group of my friends (who are all 17) and the second time with my cousin who is 14. It is a film for anyone who enjoys this genre, Disney films, Angelina Jolie's acting etc. I am not going to include the plot as it contains big spoilers! All I will say is that this film is full of secrets that the audience were not expecting (you'll have to watch it to find out what they are!). Personally, I cannot imagine anyone playing the role of Maleficent better than Angelina Jolie. She was born to play Maleficent. She represents her in a way no one else could. Her acting in the film is incredible. Elle Fanning who play's Aurora and Sharlto Copley who plays King Stefan also show great acting skills in the film. If you plan on seeing it, I think it is definitely worth seeing in 3D. I saw it in 3D and 2D but preferred seeing it in 3D due to the amazing visuals included in the magical scenes that are contained in the film. I just loved everything about it. The sets and costumes are stunning and were perfect for this film.

Maleficent is rated PG, parental guidance, not general audience. With that said - Maleficent is beautifully done and I am extremely pleased with Disney and the direction they took this film. As to the performance of Angelina Jolie, absolute perfection, no one could have done this better. A definite must see and own.

I just read a review that said adults were taking breaks throughout the movie because the film was predictable. Stay in your seats. Don't be rude. When I watched the movie, I didn't notice anyone moving around, much less leaving the theater. I can't imagine anyone wanting to leave during the movie. The special effects are spectacular. Think, ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Chronicles of Narnia"", or ""Avatar"" (the blue guy, not the air bender). Sweeping panoramas. Awesome CG and physical stunts. Beautifully designed mythical and fantastical creatures and environments. There is a lot of humor; some slapstick (which I don't particularly care for), some dry, and some was downright cute! There was breathtaking joy and heart wrenching sorrow. The story, we've heard, but the the reason for such a harsh edict was never really explained. This version, like ALL things written, has been interpreted with a bit of creative license. ""Predictable"". It is not. I really enjoyed this interpretation. I had questions at ""known"" events, and I enjoyed the writer's creativity. My inner child is always close to the surface, and she was cheering, crying, stamping her foot, clenching her fist and grinding her teeth in anger, smiling with joy, and laughing out loud. Stories like this encourages respect... not finding your happiness in someone else. Intriguing concept for a ""fairytale"". I know, right? Girls are taught to cook, clean, care for the little ones, fall in love, marry, have children and live happily ever after. Who lives that way? Ever. One of the many reasons why I enjoyed the movie is the message of Respect: Natural. Supernaturalatural. Man. Woman.Adult. Child. Beast. Creatures.Or, lost there of. A fiction that gives you a visual of what happens when respect is ignored, denied, discarded, fought for, and won. For those of you who have lost your childlike wonder... you know who you are... the ones who don't get misty eyed when Puff hangs his mighty head and slips into his cave... yeah, you. Dust off the Chronicles of Narnia, grab a few bottles of butter beer, put up your feet, play Peter.

And let me also add I do not remember the last time I went to a movie where the audience started clapping at the end.Just mention to any child that it is about the classic Sleeping Beauty, and the fairy who casts a curse on baby Aurora. Immediately, everyone thinks Maleficent is EVIL. And of course, to curse a baby, that is pretty darn evil. But there are twists and turns in the story that will delight adults and kids alike.What drives us to do bad things? Greed. Power. Emotional betrayal. Hope. Sadness. Physical injury. Love. Tragedy. Lots of emotion.Angelina Jolie was stunning as Maleficent. And I could not help wondering the entire film, what red lipstick is she wearing? And her cheekbones! Bravo to her makeup artist making her look and feel like the cartoon character. And I felt myself sympathetic to Maleficient. She is not heartless. She is protector of the fairly land, one of the most magical fairly lands I have seen in film in along time. She is emotionally deep.Elle Fanning played Aurora. Absolute perfection. She was made for this role.What I truly loved about this movie is the balance a ""fairy"" tale, and did not end in the typical happily ever after with a wedding. People who are good, do bad things, and sometimes they regret and want to be good again. It is a choice to do the right thing. Unless, you are insane, and therefore your actions are not in your control. The message is universal that explains the basis of all our relationships in life.Simply, go and see this movie. My 12 year old (daughter) and eight year (son) old loved it. The cinematography is stunning. The acting is really good. And the story is beautifully told, and certainly will be a classic. My recommendation is go see it now!",Maleficent
731,jlcooper13,The trailers lied...Disney should be sued for false advertising!,1,1 June 2014,"***Spoliers may be listed below****Maleficent is a an iconic villainous role. She is one of Disney's best characters cast from the dark side and when I saw the trailer I succumbed to the beauty they inlaid using Jolie as the sinister evil fairy. I was seduced to believing that I would be lured into a world of evil and treachery. I wanted to see how evil was born and vengeance would be enacted. I wanted to be able to bond with this evil force and be drawn deep into darkness, rooting for the bad girl. I knew it would be filled with beautiful scenes and Disney magic, but what I did not anticipate that the greatest treachery would be the film itself. Jolie can most definitely embrace evil and the moments when she is allowed to succumb to the full force of Maleficent it is beautiful. Once you add in Goldie Locks however, you get a recipe for disaster. Suddenly I might as well be in a world of pink pixie dust, leprechauns and unicorns because this beautiful villain is disgraced into playing a role of a misunderstood black hearted fairy who really loved the doe eyed giggling Aurora. Hell hath no fury than a woman scorned, this should have been the driving force behind the film. The beginning scenes of a youthful Maleficent should have been nixed to allow more time to build a love story that was even remotely believable. To fall from grace the betrayal has to be tangible and dripping with poison. It must be something more than just a monologue infatuation and stolen wings. They said years passed and yet I felt nothing of a bond or great love that would give birth to Maleficent's destiny.In Disney's Rapunzel the ""mother"" figure who raised Rapunzel from a baby never fell in love with the child as a daughter. She was still greedy, evil and dedicated to her path. So why must the world's most wonderful villain turn to a soft hearted Godmother of a vapid child. I know Disney is trending this ""don't bet on the prince"" idea and that's fine I support that, but really...they thought this was ""no truer love."" If they think the king suffered by simply being tortured with the countdown till his child's demise then they are sadly mistaken. That was child's play. A woman changed by betrayal to the dark side has more ideas in her play-book that can make a man suffer. Madness would have been the king knowing that Maleficent knew the entire time where Aurora was hiding. Maleficent should have been sending him snippets of hair or visions of his daughter with the raven peering down at him while he slept. He should have been physically and mentally destroyed, a raving lunatic. I would have rather liked to see a double treachery in the story. That only the raven knew all along where Aurora was and hid it from his mistress. We could watch the anger burn and grow within Maleficent because she wasn't able to find the child for 16 years. That in the interim the raven would randomly turn into human form and it would have been those two that fell in love and the tragic day that Maleficent discovers her location through some fool's errand played by the three dopey fairies guarding her, absconds with the child and let's the curse play out its course. Then I would have a mega battle scene at the edge of the forest against the king, let her have her righteous moment when she takes his life all the while the king knowing his daughter is stuck in endless slumber with no hope of her being saved. Then during the battle the raven after escaping the battlefield leaves Maleficent's side to try and wake Aurora. When Maleficent discovers her minion's treachery the pain and anger at being betrayed for a second time by her own kind would fill her from the pit of her stomach up through her spine and a black fire filling her eyes transforming to the great dragon and an epic battle of good and evil which will lead to her glorious death! That would have at least been something!Then they could have there happier ever after. Then all those still shots of Maleficent looking like a falling angel in the glimmering sunlight would have been more picturesque, more visually twisted. Overall, I feel I paid $15 dollars for another movie funded by the Prozac and Xanax manufacturers that spread fallacies that evil fairies are really good, vampires are not evil blood suckers and werewolves make great best friends. It's a snooze and a travesty. If you love the traditional iconic role of Maleficent remain in darkness and forget the lies the trailer told you for the glorious black dragon is covered in daffodils and pink tutus in this film.",Maleficent
732,eternaleel,Just so OK,7,1 June 2014,"A short version of this review is that this movie is just so weirdly OK. It's not bad, but it isn't great either.I was actually looking forward to Maleficent, but I did not go into the movie with my hopes too high. Too my hype will constantly lead to disappointment. I was impressed with the movies visuals as well as the new elements to the story. Every character was relevant to the story, and all motives were clear. I even loved the twist it gave on the 'true loves kiss', though it is not the first time we've seen it. I have to say I'm glad it's becoming a new trend in these types of movies.However, everything that bothered me with the film seems to stem from the director holding back the actors and actresses. Which I find extremely odd because Robert Stromberg is not a bad Director. I am an enormous fan of Pan's Labyrinth, but what Pan's Labyrinth has that Maleficent seems to lack is making me feel something. Sure I was seeing that I should be moved by parts of this film, but I never actually felt it. Where I felt the actors/actresses should have pushed there emotion just a bit more instead they flat lined. It left me feeling nothing but want. I wanted to feel sorrow for Maleficent. I wanted to feel pity and disgust with Stefan, but I didn't.Also, Maleficent in a cat suit? Are you serious? With a movie that had surprisingly accurate(or at least they were trying) clothes, to suddenly see that cat suit just pulled me out of the film. It looked ridiculous.",Maleficent
733,ikemyle,Another illuminati movie,1,2 June 2014,"Parents don't let your kids to see this movie. It is a brain wash action to show evil is good and humans are bad. Maleficent, it says is a fairy but she is looking nothing like one. She is projected to be a demon and the images with her above clouds with black wings and huge horns trying to really brain wash people. She is not a angel or a fairy. Most of the fairy creatures from the movie are ugly and same as the bad actress Angelina are evil. The movie is not PG should be PG13 at least. Someone or many are trying to change perspective of kids and kill the innocence. Don't be fooled by the special effects, see behind the scene before is too late, if is not already..",Maleficent

The story makes sense, the visuals are cool and it just really feels like a fairytale. Disney really delivered! From start to finish it was interesting and fun to watch. I don't think there is one thing I would change about it. I even want to see it again in the theater, which is not something I want to do for most films. It was better than I thought it would be and I was hoping it would be very good. It is a very good solitary film. There is much more that can be said in the positive!

But that only doesn't make a good movie.The storyline could have been good, even the adaptation of the original tale. However, the way it was done made it become flat and not worth watching, except if your are looking for mere amusement and distraction.The two most crucial moment in the movie turned out to be ridiculous. The grand moment of the movie was just rushed and passed without having any effect on the watcher.All in all, this movie is another product of a simple amusement industry which misses the chance to induce a positive change in this world, despite it great potential. Disney himself once was inducing visions and ideals into his movies. But that is a long time ago. The amusement industry fills it pockets with flat crap and satisfies the perceived needs of an inactive audience.Don't show this movie to your children, if you want them to be actors of change in their lives.",Maleficent

Angelina did an amazing job her accent was really good, all the actors was really good too, loved the comic bits I between fit perfectly into the film.But if you are a loyal Disney Princess or even sleeping beauty fan then I must say I was not happy I don't want to ruin the film for anyone, the 1st 90% of the film was really good but the last 10% of the film I was not impressed i was not impressed at all why ruin a perfectly good classic. Shame on you Walt Disney. But I give Angelina 5 Stars for her acting, if no one like her before they would love her in this movie.",Maleficent
737,nancysleiman,Best movie I've seen in a very long time!!!!!!!,10,4 June 2014,"This movie was wonderful and full of heart and wit. I enjoyed it so much I saw it twice!! Jolie *owned* the role of Maleficent,I swear she was born to play this role..Her enigmatic presence and everlasting beauty basically is the reason why this movie is worth watching. Her acting is spot on, her face is eerily beautiful, and her interpretation of Maleficent's character is so good that you can't imagine anyone else who can do better than her.The spin on the story was great. A whole new way to tell the story while still remaining true to the original. Couldn't have been better!!Waayy better than the fairy tale I grew up with.",Maleficent
738,ssn766-19-194769,Amazing,9,5 June 2014,This is an amazing movie. At first I was unsure if I would go to see this film. I am so glad that I went. Disney took an idea from the classic cartoon that most of us have seen as kids and turned it to see things from the view point of the villain. Angelina was absolutely brilliant at playing the role of Maleficent. The background story for the characters is what will really draw you in and the film will keep you engaged all the way to the credits. The way that the plot is set if flows smoothly and there is little room for drag like some films may have in the middle. My girlfriend really loved this movie and I am glad she convinced me to go see it with her. I loved this movie so much I will go see it again.,Maleficent
739,pmntzs,don't bother,1,6 June 2014,"Not worth a visit to the theater.Totally clumsy and amateurish, ignorant of the most basic cinematography. Completely out of pace, absolutely no sense of time rendering, the plot is so unstructured that it's just a mess (eg, we are introduced to the prince, then he disappears, then he reappears and that's it), so lifeless that editing seems like the land of lost opportunities (there no actual interplay between scenes, they just follow one another in mere succession), no character development (for example you get no sensible feel of who the three fairies are and why they behave like they do), a repetitiveness of emotions (the scenes with Maleficent and the beauty are the same, and the same, and the same,...), no escalation nowhere throughout (you'd expect the scene where Maleficent becomes who she is to be a tower of power... but no!). They could not even get a single scene right (the final battle is so out of rhythm that it's just a bore instead of having your beat rising). The storyline is just a plain line. To sum up, it feels like a high school production of a play written by children. In all this mess Angelina could be nothing but flat as if stepped-over by an elephant. Just a long puzzled snore. Shame 'cause it really could be an awesome movie.But that's what you get when you hire a guy (Robert Stromberg) who has never directed before (!!!!) for your 200.000.000 movie! And they say Hollywood is conservative and unadventurous...I 'm pretty sure that the 7.5 is not ""untouched"". After all it cost 200.000.000 and they have to make sure they get their money back. I 'm also sure that after it runs its course the real rating will be revealed to be much worse.",Maleficent
740,sumska_bobica,Absolutely FANTASTIC!!!,10,7 June 2014,"As I said in the title :)I really do not think why some leave negative comments...Movie is lovely,and I dear say this is Angelina's best performance ever!I am definitely going to watch this one over and over until I finally get bored ..:))This version of story is much,much more appealing to me,and I actually was on the Maleficent's side the whole movie..It shows strenght,love,heartbreak,not in a cliché boyfriend- girlfriend way but a kind of love that truly exists ;)I do not think that story always has to be followed by the book.In this case it definitely doesn't and that is what makes it NOT predictable in any way,quite opposite of what many people say.It would me much more predictable if it was what we watched and read until now.But,why am I not surprised if most of the people can not find the hidden message behind this movie? You guys should try thinking about this:1)Kingdoms were not united by a hero, but the person who was ""the worst villain in the tale"" and eventually turned to be the best person in it.She was the only that could give the true loves kiss... To make this more clear,look at the example of Yin-yang from Chinese philosophy.Everyone of us carries both-good and bad inside of us,but it is on us to decide which of the 2 will win in the end.It is not the circumstances that define us,but our choices.Maleficent gave her heart to a man- although that love is forbidden because shes a fairy and he is a human. There is a connection with the reality,when interracial couples are judged by their environment instead just being left in peace..2)Stephan cuts her wings for the sake of throne.People are mostly programmed from the day they were born,to give up love for its picture.Stephan was already happy-but he destroyed it for the sake of throne and wealth.This act ruined him as well everyone around him-and Maleficents trust in people and world around her.They are both rulers of their kingdoms,they have everything-but they are spiritually empty and deeply miserable...They have everything-and they have nothing.3)Maleficent wants to revenge and she curses his daughter-revenge is blind as love is.How many times in life have you hurt someone innocent for the sake of revenge?Probably too many...4)After she meets Aurora and begins to love her,she wants to take the curse down but she cant. As in life,there is sometime no going back after doing and saying awful things and we have to live with the consequents of our deeds...good or bad...""Think twice before you do."" There are many of these kind of examples.Oly people who cant understand them judge this movie. I am really proud that inner child in myself can see and understand the message and imagination behind the screen :)That is what Disney is all about.Inner child in ourselves is something we can not allow(afford) to lose..;) Don't be bitter,your life will be much nicer...Then you might enjoy Maleficent and understand it ;)(do not listen to spoilers and critics,they suck :p)",Maleficent
741,davidstory10,Disney at it's Best!,10,7 June 2014,"I read the disappointing reviews but as a father of two preteen girls and four girls altogether I took them to see the movie thinking I am going to walk away disappointed. Oh how the reviewers are wrong. I am no movie critic but I have seen my fair share of Disney films and every ""Princess"" film ever made, probably 100 times each. Maleficent ranks at the absolute top of the list. Every critic I read said there is no story line, well, I thought there was an awesome story line. Betrayal, revenge, regret and love. Maybe these critics prefer One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest but when you put the movie into perspective and accept that this movie was written to enhance the original it leaves you in awe. We laughed, we cheered and we cried. Yes, I am a 43 year old father in the theater crying with his daughters. It was that good. The visual effects were amazing. The musical score was unbelievably good and really added to the film. My honest opinion is, if you enjoy Disney princess movies then this one will not disappoint. It will not only not disappoint, you will walk away ecstatic. This is what Disney does best and Maleficent is Disney at it's best.",Maleficent
742,pirperi-23-435226,"well, this went quite well",10,9 June 2014,"Expecting another cliché Disney movie displaying the absolute beauty of Jolie as a siren for money and audiences was totally and surprisingly overturned by a story that removes clichés from love, hate, authority, myths and story telling. I will be watching it over and over again, if Disney keeps on this track I might even become a fun!Jolie proves she can go beyond stereotype roles of bad ass women and play more complicated things successfully. She does not overshadow the other characters as we are used in other scenarios.

Maleficent makes a significant positive contribution to continue this theme: Finally! These stories dive deeper into the meaning of love and relationships with others, and as much as they are fantasy, they engage real-life situations. I am delighted to take my teen-age nieces to see these movies, which foster good conversations about who they are and want to be. As someone the same age as Jolie, I left this movie with a better understanding of my role as their fairy- godmother. There's still much more work to be done to empower girls, and I hope Disney continues the momentum, even if it's just for my $ at the movies.",Maleficent
744,pajaa37,Meant to be a twist???,1,10 June 2014,"Oh lord where art thou? Well let me start with this: I was thinking of many different titles for my little ""essay"", most of which were either political incorrect or simply too plain to use. But still just a few: What happened? Or: Oh my balls!!! Or: The peak of feminism. Or: The extinction of Mankindetc. So the point is that the story we all know well from our childhood, got so many twists that you can easily forget it and look into the world of a totally ""other"" tale. The evil fairy godmother (back in the days just an innocent, but strong young lady) was betrayed by the pretentious young male who's aspiring for the throne of the kingdom of his own country. Since both of them are orphans no moral issues can interfere with their goals. But, while Maleficent becoming a strong, yet caring semi-goddess of her realm, her counterpart in the humans' world still wants the throne but not through some noble deed, but as a merit of his servitude. Evil humans, preferably males, claim the right for the neighboring country of fairies but fail miserably in their attempt and Maleficent fends off the attack with no problem. So the king puts a bounty on her head, and who else but the one-time lover of the strongest fairies, can seduce and bereft her from her wings. So Mother Nature, I mean, Maleficent becomes vengeful, waiting for her time to come turning into the evil fairy we've all been waiting for. In the meantime for his servitude, the little orphan becomes the King of his homeland, forgetting about his fairy-lover, and marring a beautiful human being, who has all the characteristics of a devoted, humble wife. She gives life to the young princess Aurora, and actually her part of the story ends here, we never see her again. The storyline shows only here some reminiscence of the original tale Maleficent bestowing the little child with her curse. But from there the story evolves into another path, Maleficent carefully watching over her ""cursed"" goddaughter, since the inapt fairies are unable to fulfill their task as babysitters. Little Aurora, becoming a young innocent blooming lady, caring for nature and her surroundings not knowing of her true origin meets Maleficent by chance and the two becoming friends (!!!!). Once Maleficent even trying to withdraw her own curse while she is asleep!!!!! She cannot, but Prince Charming is already on his way giving hope that the one with pure heart can wake her up in the event she should sting herself with the spinning-wheels needle. Which she does The Prince, with the help of Maleficent, gets into the castle and tries to wake Aurora with his kiss, but fails. So comes Maleficent, kisses her on the cheek, begging for forgiveness, and, my- oh-my, the young girl awakens from her sleep! Now that was the point where all those titles came into my mind. And as the castle is brittle and Princess Aurora has already found her home in fairy land, the two attempt to escape from her father's home. But ambush lurks around and poor Maleficent gets trapped with iron net. Luckily Aurora manages to escape from her own father's castle (?!?) and a fierce battle ensues between Maleficent and the King. Although at the end of the battle Maleficent cries: it's over! the King still wants to kill her but falls into his death! After that Maleficent reinstalls the once lovely Garden of Eden, eh, I mean Fairyland, and the two, Maleficent and Aurora, lives happily ever- after (Somewhere in the background we can see Prince Charming (I forgot his real name, the character's name) but with no special role in the set), now Aurora as the new Queen of Fairyland. I mean, I honestly believe that women should be more involved in the building of our society, and equal rights and alike. But come on! This is an offense against all MALE viewers! Not a single time had I the feeling of seeing a positive male character, not even the young Prince, who was more like a puppet for the will of Maleficent. In this world, men are either aggressive or caring only for themselves, but does not poses any kind of positive characteristics for which we could support them. In such world MALE are only there to fulfill their task of fertilizing, otherwise they have no earthly use. Females can live happily without males, who can only bestow them with sadness and regret. I guess this is the kind of attitude which turned this world into a hostile, selfish hell, not even Orwell imagined in his wildest dreams. The sheer evilness of the Male characters, who sometime self-pitying themselves, for their own weakness, is so one-folded, that a paper-bag is more versatile than that All in all the ""modern"" adaptation of the story (""find out the truth"" as the trailer puts it) is not just disappointing but shows the ""Zeitgeist"" in such mannerism that one should throw up(sorry). Females should be left alone with their fragile souls and naivety and only bothered by men if they humble enough to serve their needs. Trust me: I am not a male-chauvinist! But after this piece of .film, I honestly don't know what to do with my manhood...?",Maleficent
745,wekya0213-24-241017,A refreshing take for a Disney movie,10,10 June 2014,"There are many good and bad things I expect of a Disney movie, but Maleficent was full of all good things.I was very impressed with the high-quality environment CG building and I wouldn't expect anything less from Disney. It fit the dark theme of the film without distracting from the story. The story was actually much darker than I anticipated and for a while I actually forgot it was a Disney film. I enjoyed the story immensely but there was some problems with pacing while transition through years. The acting was wonderful, from all actors. Angelina's ability to speak volumes with just her eyes was perfect for this role. Sharlto's accent was a bit overwhelming at times, but his acting was excellent.Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. Definitely a film I'd like to add to my DVD collection in the future.",Maleficent

Anyway, this was also just a little bit TOO much like Frozen. I mean, I love the whole 'There are more than one type of True Love' thing, but at least have every other movie like that, not two in a row. I loved the plot though, and the graphics were AMAZING! I would give this a six out of ten because of the UNJUST promise of romance between Diaval and Aurora :) and the lack of romance thereof. When I go and see a princess movie I just want a twinge of romance. I would recommend you go see this movie, just don't expect any romance :( ... I love Angelina Jolie's acting in this movie too!

747,raining_leaves,"Deep message, yet lacking in execution",5,11 June 2014,"First of all, like many I've been waiting forever for this movie ever since I learned about it, especially since Jolie was going to play Maleficent and I knew she'd do a great job at it. Maleficent is my favorite Disney villain, and I was really looking forward to what sort of twist Disney would give us here.Unfortunately, when I sat down and watched the first 30 seconds of the movie, I began to regret sitting down in a cinema for this movie. If I had seen this on TV, I would have changed channels after the first 5 minutes. I wasn't engaged at all, it was just too cheesy for my liking--the storytelling was just horrid. Kind of reminded me of Alice in the Wonderland, where so much focus was on the CGI but none were put on the plot and execution, it just seemed so unnatural and amateurish.OK, I told myself. You've spent the money, now you're going to sit your ass through the movie, like it or not. Jolie hasn't even come out yet--maybe things would get better.They did. Jolie's acting was splendorous. But unfortunately, her acting and the special effects not enough to save the train-wreck of the story this was. Ridiculous bad guys, ridiculous war (capitalism/dictatorship vs socialism blah blah. I'm all for socialism but it was too in-my-face.) Lack of character depth, lack of complexity. Too black-and-white overall. If they want to make this a redemption story, I want to see Maleficent really become evil. But like many have pointed out, she didn't, like the scriptwriter was too afraid people would no longer feel sympathetic for Maleficent if she did something truly ""bad"". But I think that was a missed opportunity to truly make me feel for a supposed villain.When Maleficent took it upon herself to take care of Aurora, I was like...WHAT? I already knew how things would have turned out. I don't understand why she'd curse Aurora to sleep (death at first) and then continuously save her if she hated Aurora so much. That, to me, made zero sense.Don't make me talk about attempting to play homage to the old animation. I would have been SO much happier if they didn't, because it RUINED my childhood memories (the third fairy didn't even give her gift!!) It's like they HAD to make everyone stupid and selfish/evil to make Maleficent look good. They ruined those three fairies for me, not to mention I was looking forward to Maleficent turning herself into a dragon, not her crow. In fact I was expecting a love story between the crow and Aurora at first but nope it did not happen.Alright, I felt a little sorry when Maleficent tried to undo the curse. But I was already so removed from the story by then to care. I even thought it would have been better off with a bad ending if the intent was to give a different side of a story from the ""villain's"" side, since the villain would not be a ""villain"" if they prevailed in the end.Had I not later on learned about the message of a rape victim's recovery and redemption, I would have rated this film lower (like I'd give it a 2 or 3). Yes, I finally see how the message gave the film substance that I thought was lacking (as the true love =/= love at first sight negation has been done before already in Frozen). But seriously the execution was too bland and too sloppy for me to say this film is a masterpiece as it was a torture for me to sit through it.A commendable attempt to tackle the subject and empower women, but the storytelling did not make the cut and ruined the entire film.",Maleficent
748,ddailey1514,Maleficent = Lesbianism,10,12 June 2014,Felt that Maleficent had lesbian undertones but glad D-Bag King took a header. Watching this movie made me hate humans. I thought that Angelia did good job but that the King was dick. Prince Charming was a fake prince and not really a part of the plot. I was thinking that after the Prince failed in the sack that Bird boy might of been the one but nope turned out that Lesbianism did the job. I did find the battle scenes from Lord of the Rings pretty entertaining as well as the Dragon at the end. I'm not sure though how the humans were able to wrangle the Dragon to the ground before he burn them all with flame action. All in all I would give the movie a 10 based on Lesbianism and making humans out to be total self serving D-bags.,Maleficent
749,J_berryx,Horrible,2,13 June 2014,"Literally the worst movie I have ever watched in a theatre, I was tempted to walk out.The writing in this movie was God awful, and that's not even just the dialogue. The plot is inconsistent and lacks all sorts of background.Iron burns fairies, but why? It allows Stefan to easily remove her wings, burns her a couple times, but then an iron net is thrown on her and it no longer burns her, it acts like kryptonite and simply weakens her. Then she gets her wings back and the chain is thrown around her ankle and it's neither burning her foot off, or weakening her. Her wings? are they the source of her power? because it's never said.Character writing is horrible, aside from Maleficient, Diavel and Aurora, every character is a complete idiot. Nobody is able care for a child, the three pixies are CONSTANTLY ignoring this child, gone for 18 hours at a time and they don't even notice. On that note, WHY did Stefan put Aurora in their care? They were flung aside as if they weren't even there when Maleficent walked in to curse Aurora, obviously they were absolutely useless when it came to protecting her, and they literally just met these creatures, better trust them right? Stefan was still sane at this point, but apparently has no fatherly emotion.""Sleeping Beauty"" was asleep for about 3 hours, tops. The girl had a short power nap and was labelled as Sleeping Beauty? Absolutely absurd.Angelina Jolie tried her best to make this movie passable, but she just couldn't do it. The writing was some of the worst I've ever seen and even with 100% star studded cast this movie still would've been garbage.2/10. Do not watch.",Maleficent
750,seanlester-27-750104,Excellent rewrite of fairy tale,10,13 June 2014,"This is Jolie at her absolute finest. The perceptive nature of the film's story really adds a totally new dimension to the tale. Tales of this nature are far more than fodder for children. They touch a deep and old place as such stories have throughout our time as humans and if watched closely, can give a real sense of a change in awareness. Such tales were told to humans early in our history. The nuances which Jolie so fabulously reflects are stunning. And the Computer Graphics are amazing. Totally 3 dimensional.

751,hiimmichelleok,Predictable clichés and disgustingly cheesy,1,14 June 2014,"I saw all the positive reviews for Maleficent so I went to watch it in the cinemas with high hopes. I wish I had ignored the reviews. Maybe I went in with too great an expectation, but I've marked and graded 8th grade creative writing papers with more substance and plot. When you can call the conflict and resolution as soon as it is being set up, you know more thought was put into the CGI than actual story development. And the casting! Oh god, the only person who was logically cast was Jolie. Don't even get me started on the child actors.There were many times where I turned and looked at everyone else, watching to see if they were reacting positively to what was on screen; I found a couple breaking out the cards and playing a game of bluff. The ending quote and fade to black was met with a ""WHAT THE F WAS THAT?"" by the audience, and a bunch of laughing and booing.If you require more than pretty colours to entertain you, save your money and time for any other film.Maleficent gets a star for its beautiful CGI work and costume design, but falls flat in every other respect.",Maleficent

753,ram-haimoff,Excellent staging very poor and frustrating message.,6,14 June 2014,"It was wonderful to observe the imagination the art and beauty of scenes in this movie, but I as a viewer have felt as if betrayed for all of this was set to serve the approach of separation and segregation between man and a woman, separation in which women are always betrayed by men and men are always morally low and criminal in their actions... In this movie men are presented as useless, as money hungry and certainly not to be trusted, at best they may take their place as servants where they are perceived as usually weak compare to the women who are always positive, optimistic and powerful and although very mean - still generous. Women are those who manage the world. they take care and nurture it while men destroys everything...The image of the prince especially was very shallow and we hear that there is no true love... (what about dedication and loyalty - we see these often enough don't we? ) I have felt that all the charm and guidance for love and a path for happiness which was well presented at the original story was lost in favor of plunging separation and installing a wall between man and woman today - as if the current situation is not problematic enough.To bad a beautiful legend was forced to pay the price for one woman (the screen play writer?) pride and maladjustment...Wonderful beautiful movie - great to watch just ignore the message... can this be possible??????????Don't take your kids with you to see this one...

In fact, she really steals the show!The movie had some good humor which occasionally, breaks the tension - it does so however, in a positive way.

Not many actors could hold a scene and convey emotions to the audience using facial nuances. Why is it so important to hold on to a one dimensional interpretation of Maleficent as pure evil? Nostalgia? Hold on to your fairy tales if you choose to; but life and people are more complex and gray and it's exciting to be offered another interpretation on a classic. I highly anticipated the re-telling of this story. The symbolism, lessons, parables, are all there should you look for them; or you could just sit back and enjoy the movie.",Maleficent

This is what the movie ads say, but it was more than that, much more. Do you remember the first time you saw The Wizard of Oz, yeah its like that. This is one of the best films I have had the pleasure of plunking down my hard earned cash on. This movie is a retelling of the Disney Classic ""Sleeping Beauty"" but that is where the similarities end. According to Aurora the story we were told was wrong and she should know because she is Sleeping beauty. Aurora was played by Elle Fanning, I personally had never heard of her but she was a very good choice for the part. Her Father, King Stefan, was played by Sharlto Copley and they could probably have done better. The real star of this film was Angelina Jolie as Maleficent. I have to be honest I am not a big fan of hers, but this part was hers. She owned it, she was Maleficent and nobody could have played it better. The entire cast from Maleficent to the ""Aunties"" were magical and a delight to watch. Well King Stefan could have been better but this movie was so good I can over look that casting mistake. This film was true Disney Magic, a Movie that only Disney could do. I laughed, Cried and watched in amazement. If you see one move, See this one. I give this 5+ Lenny's.",Maleficent

764,anna-jusuf,Not a Remake,8,30 June 2014,"If you are fond of the original ""Sleeping Beauty"" tale in which this remake is based off of, I suggest going into the theatres with an open mind. I wouldn't exactly call the 2014 ""Maleficent"" a remake of the 1959 Disney classic. The plot and character development were worlds apart. Literally. The audience was introduced to a new magical world with creature's that were never seen in any other fairy tale. ""Maleficent"" should be treated, as a first of it's kind.The casting itself deserves praise. Each and every character was meticulously casted to the T. Every cast member did their roles justice, principally the menacing and strangely sweet Angelina Jolie as Maleficent. Her performance was nothing less than outstanding. She captivated the audience in her explosive role and showed her diverse abilities. Elle Fanning surprised us with her ability to play a dainty, playful, princess. It seemed like the young actress did her research. She breathed life into Aurora and displayed all the princess qualities that we imagine when reading fairy tales. The audience can't help but fall in love with Fanning's character. Then there's the antagonist of the story, King Stefan, played by Sharlto Copley. Copley expressed the power-hungry nature of the king impeccably. As far as the plot goes, there were a few obvious scenes that mirror the original ""Sleeping Beauty"" but most of them were unfamiliar. Nevertheless, they were artistic and beguiling. The beginning was captivating and adventurous. The audience followed a young Maleficent through the magical land of the Moors and got a peak at what she was like before her character was swallowed by dark emotions. It was thrilling and saddening to follow Maleficent on her transition from good to evil. The plot kept the audience's curiosity throughout the movie and gave us magic in every scene. Although dialogue was sparse, the aesthetics of the movie told a story on it's own. It's a beautiful film that the young and elderly could enjoy. Maleficent is truly a work of art with a unique plot.",Maleficent

Moreover,the story about the Disney princess's is different, it is a new vision of the classic tale. But in my opinion, in some scenes Maleficent should be more evil than she is yet.So, in general I liked the film. I have been able to enjoy it and Angelina Jolie has been perfect.",Maleficent

It is a must for all ages, and my family will see it again in the theater.One of the most brilliant things is that the trailers do not reveal most of the key story plots. This was so refreshing, and I applaud Disney for brilliance on this point. My family and I watched the classic and every trailer, and were still enthralled by the unfolding of this story. My daughter wanted to go back into the theater immediately.This story deserves much more credit than it is getting. There are many powerful themes, and it delivers so much more than the original story. The trailers look epic, the original is a classic known to all, and yet this movie still takes you to places that you do not expect.This will be a favorite in our library for sure.",Maleficent

Unlike ""Frozen"" which we still cannot understand the hype unless we focus on the ""keep saying it's good and eventually the people will buy into it theory"" without asking questions! Angelina Jolie DELIVERS in this movie and you felt comfortable going with your child, because even though it has parts that may seem suspenseful, the movie isn't ""dark"" like parts of ""Princess and the Frog"" and ""the Robinsons"" so no nightmares to worry about afterwards! Overall a great movie and we have recommended it highly to our friends and family!",Maleficent
768,falatise,Magnificent & Visually Stunning.,10,9 July 2014,"-SPOILERS ALERT!- I had been waiting for the movie since I found out about the live-action production of Disney classic iconic villain from Sleeping Beauty. As a child, I was always frightened by Maleficent and was intrigued to know why she cursed Aurora. Just like in the TV show OUAT, I learned once again evil isn't born its made. In many past reviews people comment on how Disney ruined Maleficent's character but people need to understand that she wasn't always this dark, scary and terrible person/creature. Also, she wouldn't just curse a baby for the pleasure of enjoying other's misery; There must have been a back story that drove her to being evil such as betrayal and being heartbroken. I enjoyed the romance(s) and I loved how Disney changed the ending to show that love comes in all forms and how strong the bond is between a mother and daughter can be.Loved: 1) King Stefan downward spiral into corruption. TERRIFIC ACTING 2) Maleficient back story- It was well planned out and really shows the shaping of her character 3)The scenery, effects and CGI were stunning. They were gorgeous and had a touch of realismWould Have CHANGED: The transitions could have been better. Occasionally, it made the story feel slow at time.Surprisingly, as a fan of the classics, I didn't mind the changes from sleeping beauty. Considering fairy tales are passed down orally and this is Malificient story, changes were needed. I thought the changes really improved her story and you need to keep in mind that everyone has a different perspective.To conclude: 1. I thought the movie was excellent and lived up to my expectation 2. The back story was perfect showing how Maleficent's evil wasn't born but made 3. Remember to expect changes from the original 4. The animation, effects, and CGI were beautiful and stunning.",Maleficent
769,sfk11-53-90668,Completely different story,1,14 July 2014,"Where to start! This isn't anything to do with sleeping beauty apart from the names. Even then the three good fairies names change, who are Knotgrass, Thistlewit and Flittle? Shouldn't it be Flora Fauna and Merryweather. What's the point in changing the names! It adds to the complete difference between Sleeping beauty and maleficent.Since when did maleficent see aurora everyday; in sleeping beauty, she sends her warthog things to find aurora, but they have been looking in cradles for 16 years so she sends her raven/crow to find aurora. However in maleficent they become really good friends and Maleficent wants aurora to stay with her. What?!?! Some if this is from the book I read so I'm blaming the book as well here.Since when did the queen die? At the end of sleeping beauty it pictures her with Stefan while Phillip and aurora dance. Happy ending. In Maleficent auroras parents both die. Wow. And it's not like Disney to suffocate someone, as in Stefan and King Henry. And making the Raven/Crow be the dragon totally takes it away from Maleficent. That was a main part in the story in Sleeping Beauty but now it's a meh moment.Seriously quit while your ahead, frozen was amazing so Disney should have waited a but to find new ideas, not just launch into another movie which a lot of people seem to dislike for the same reasons. Thus film takes it away from Frozen.I could honestly go on but it would take all day to point out the flaws in the book and the film, the storyline is what makes a story/film. Yeah characters are important but if the story is untrue and totally contradicts itself how can the actors look good. Films have to make actors look good. Maleficent doesn't. I'm usually a massive fan of Disney but whoever wrote this needs to watch sleeping beauty again.",Maleficent
770,phant_opera,Simply the new classical,10,16 July 2014,"I had to see two times the movie to notice the great film that i was watching. Firsth i have to recognize the twist of the original plot was a little hard to swallowed for me. But, at the second time that i saw it i remember that i wasn't see sleeping beauty i was watching Maleficent, a different history but with the same characters so i can enjoy the movie as independent subject. Maleficent in the original 1959 movie was cool but unidimensional(she was evil but why, she is a demon, a fairy a witch or what) and the new Maleficent is very complex. The reasons that i recommend this movie:1.- Angelina Jolie's work is amazing, by far the best actress performance in fairy tale movie. Eaven the worst reviews of the movie recognize her great job in this film. She's beauty, mesmerizing and you can't take your eyes from her, she's simply perfect for the role, like Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone or Heath Ledger's Jocker.2.- The Gothic beauty world and photography is just iconic, looks like you see a fairy tale book with dark atmosphere but gorgeous itself.3.- The metaphors of the movie are great and easy to explain to the children's: For example, the rape (when Maleficent lost her wings) an the way she recovered them, by the way of act of love and forgiveness, so the dark world where she lives recall its ancient beauty at the end. The King Stephan, has afraid of the consequences of his own acts (Maleficent) so he instead to make a mends and return the wings to Maleficent, he decides to take away the people who can love him (the Queen and Aurora)and hide away in his castle in the middle of the iron forest of thorns and reject the forgiveness of Maleficent, so he call's his own doom. 4.-The sound and the music are epic, simply one of the best. 5.-She's not a super hero.So i hardly recommend this movie,i really enjoyed that much, it work so well. Don't guide by the reviews of the critics see it and make your own opinion. This is a kind of movie that you love it or hate it, and remember you'll see Maleficent not sleeping beauty.",Maleficent

I thought okay, it's going to be the same ol' thing....a old movie/storyline redone a thousand times. Shockingly though even with a basic storyline, several in fact, it was so well done my family and I were so into it, it was amazing. We will definitely see it again, actually, I can't wait to see it again!! I know there is some controversy over what a particular scene was supposed to symbolize but what you see is what you see not what the actress was trying to make you feel it ""meant"" during that scene. There is no bad words and no awkward scenes that you have to worry about with your kids. Although, we did feel like it was too intense/scary for our little guys (2&4) but my 6 yr old was just about the right age to enjoy it (not to mention my 14 yr old who couldn't stop talking about it afterwards!).",Maleficent
772,Serendipity211,One of the best real life Disney movies I've seen,10,15 December 2015,"Maleficent was magnificent. The story was so awesome! It took me so long to watch it because I thought that It would just like the regular sleeping beauty movie and I myself has never cared for Sleeping Beauty.The movie was absolutely beautiful. The fields and the creatures were breathtaking. The only thing that I thought was mainstream was the castle. It looked like every castle in every single medieval type movie.The characters were breathtaking as well. Angelina Jolie is not one of my favorite actresses but she was absolutely perfect for this role. Her facial expressions were beautiful. I'm very glad that they chose her to play Maleficent. Like I said at the beginning of this review, I wasn't like anything that I had expected. It was way different from the original/animated Sleeping Beauty movie and it's a definite 10 out of 10 for me. One of the most enjoyable films I've seen in the past couple months.",Maleficent
773,ponygirl1022,An exceptional job for a difficult film to pull off,7,25 July 2014,"I'll just check the spoiler box because I'm not sure if anything I'll say will be considered a spoiler. I'm a Disney fan, and a really big Maleficent fan. I was super excited when this film was rumored to being made, and I followed all the trailers and sneak peeks and buzz about it and was super excited when I visited friends in NYC the weekend it was released, and they wanted to see it. So I finally got to see my dream come true: a movie all about Maleficent. Generally, the movie looks very nice. The costumes and the settings are gorgeous. Angelina Jolie did a very good job for this role. They couldn't find anyone who could replace the amazing vocal work of Eleanor Audley (RIP) in the original animated film. Jolie didn't try to outshine the original, and just did her best, which I appreciated. I will say that the trailer made it look like it would be a creepy, twisted Gothic story, when that kind of wasn't the case. To compare it to the original: Only the christening scene was close to the original. The Forbidden Mountain was not present. The final fight scene we all know and love was there but it was changed a lot in relation to the original. If you love the original to death and hold the VHS in a silver chest, you probably won't like this film. But honestly even though it did stray from the original a lot in places, I still enjoyed this Maleficent. She is evil, and she is vulnerable. She has been wronged, but she has made mistakes herself. Yes, I will say the film is feminist in that it swims with strong female characters. But I was kind of expecting that a little bit from a Disney remake. I say that the movie knew it was a retelling from a new perspective, and it didn't want to take too many risks. For what the writers and directors had on their plate with this idea, I think they did an exceptional job. In all, I agree with pretty much what everyone else is saying about it. I see where it's flawed, and I see where it's awesome. Personally, I liked it enough that I would want to see it a second time.",Maleficent
774,al-sa,"In a good way amazingly different from the known version of ""Sleeping Beauty""",10,1 August 2014,"There has been a lot of focus on the old Grimm stories lately. A lot of them have been redone, remodeled or completely changed and turned into TV-series or movies, but I have to say: In my opinion, Maleficiant is the best of all those remakes!I personally always thought that sleeping beauty was rather lacking when it came to the characters depths. They were too stereotyped for my liking. Sleeping beauty was presumably beautiful and seemed shy and kind, but you didn't get to see much of her character. The fairies were ALL good and nice because well, duh, they are fairies... Well, all BUT that one bad fairy of course... she was evil. Just because. And cursed the new born girl for no good reason at all. Oh no, make that my bad... only because she wasn't invited to the birthday party.Oh and let's not even start with the stereotype prince charming.To tell the truth, i only gave this movie a shot because it featured Angelina Jolie and i usually enjoy her works. And i was POSITIVELY surprised about this remake by Disney!For the first time, there was an explainable reason for why the characters in that story acted the way they did. The characters in Maleficiant managed to obtain a depth that was missing in the original! Most of all Maleficiant. It wasn't a stereotyped character at all. It went through changes, showed real emotions and grew with each experience.I wasn't sure what to expect of Jolie as a fairy tale character but I was yet again blown away by her acting talent, especially since she showed an emotional depth one doesn't necessarily see in other more action-focusing movies with her.But not only Jolie, but also Sharlto Copley in his role as king seems vital. Choosing Elle Fanning as Aurora was also a good choice since playing an amiable, beautiful and childishly innocent character which is still lovable seems natural for her.All in all i think this movie is very recommendable, not only for children who love fairy tales but also for grown ups who enjoy a good life story! The fact that the movie differs from the original is it's success!",Maleficent
775,kpartleton,fresh take on a classic story,9,10 August 2014,"I'm not one for fairy tales and I wasn't a particularly big fan of the original Disney adaptation however Maleficent was such a fresh new take on a classic fairy tale, and was easily one of the best human film adaptations of a fairy tale or Disney film. it's not very often a whole film is made like this where the centre of attention is the villain, in this case being Maleficent. there were several moments from this film that gave a fresh new look to some of the classic themes found in these sorts of movies. the performance from Angelina Jolie as Maleficent was fantastic with some excellent support from fellow actors, the casting of Maleficent could not have been any better, however despite her being a very talented young actress perhaps Elle Fanning wasn't the most suited actress to play what is supposed to be the most stunning princess of them all. other human adaptations of old stories include snow white and the huntsman where the acting was mediocre at best thanks to having a less than good leading actress, maleficent was filled with a talented cast with a talented lead actress showing just how sublime a film in genre can be. As Maleficent Angelina Jolie nailed every emotion felt by her character giving the audience every perspective possible of the character. she also portrayed some excellent humour throughout the course of this movie, something which lead actors from previous films have failed to do. one of the main reasons for this film being as good as it is was the insight into the fairy Maleficent was, it's not very often a movie gives the desired background of their villain. I believe that with the audience being more aware of certain events that occurred in Maleficents life it gave the audience a better understanding of her and she has become the evil fairy. the film had a slight darkness to it which all fairy tale stories but has only been present in film adaptations in recent years. however the film is not so dark that it is unsuitable for the younger viewers but just dark enough for the teenagers and older viewers to appreciate it too. there are many more factors from this film that I could talk about from the CGI visual effects to the quality of the script but it was all simply amazing.overall Maleficent was a fantastic film with some truly stunning acting, highly recommended.",Maleficent

Since I am a mother, I very much appreciated the twist this version has for the story.The only odd thing I felt was, this does contain the ""gift of beauty"" aspect but the actresses they chose for the toddler age Aurora and then the 16-year-old one (Elle Fanning) would not be what I would consider to be beauty befitting a magical gift, and I found Elle Fanning also wasn't at all convincing in her ""naivety"" and innocence. It felt forced and unbelievable. Perhaps using a new and fresh faced actress would have been more beneficial here. I have seen Elle Fanning in other movies (as well as her sister Dakota) and have found them fit for their parts, generally. This one just doesn't seem a part fit for Elle.Otherwise, other than the irritation of Elle Fanning, the rest of the movie and the actors were great and enough to help distract me from the poor choice of casting Elle Fanning.",Maleficent
778,ngwanehansel,Most confusing story. Weak and boring,5,10 September 2014,"Here is the issue. Fairy tales are supposed to be magical. They need to take you to a wonderland through a strong plot and interesting characters and cleverly induced conflicts. This movie fails to do just that. My 7year old sister kept looking at the screen in total disbelief as she wondered when the movie will become interesting. More shocking is the fact that Angelina Jolie's character was weak and did not influence the characterization of the other characters in the movie. I don't know what the director was aiming for, but all I know is that he missed. I didn't have a single moment of laughter. Let's not forget the gruesome depiction of some fairytale characters, too gruesome for kids to watch. All in all, they could do better.",Maleficent
779,cheetohead777,Horrible,1,12 September 2014,"I was extremely excited to see this movie when it came out. Boy, what a waste of excitement. Angelina Jolie was terrible! I swear, she only had about 30 lines in the whole movie. Most of her scenes were of her posing in her costume and looking, or trying to look, evil. Stick with the original Sleeping Beauty movie if you want a movie with an actual plot. Whoever made this movie focused on what it looked like and the CGI more then the actual acting, which was horrendous. The whole movie was just eye candy...absolutely no depth to it what-so-ever. No more Angelina Jolie movies! The woman can't act at all! All of these big blockbuster, over-hyped movies have no depth or plot. It's like they put all of their energy and money into the visual appeal of the movie and said 'to hell with it' when it came to the actual acting and plot. Such a shame.",Maleficent
780,vanessame,The best movie in 2014,10,14 September 2014,"I love this movie! Excellent acting by Angelina! It is worth watching it!!!!!! This is a movie that all our children would love to tell their children in the future. Firstly, I thought this is just a movie of a fairy because of the introduction at the very beginning with the little maleficent but later on, it turned in to a giant picture which can stole our hearts by the storyline. The things I wish I could change in this movie are, firstly I wish the dragon had more muscle power in it when the solders trapped it down and at that scene, Angelina was wearing a tight black trouser that we can not imagine a fairy would wear. Secondly, I wish King Stefan could see how Maleficent loves his daughter before he dies. But, overall, excellent directing! Excellent acting! That's all I can say.",Maleficent
781,seyudey,Awesomeness...!!!,10,24 September 2014,"This movie was exactly what I thought it would be– Great! It had just the right amount of mystery, action and magic! From the very trailer I knew that I would be satisfied. The writers are ""fan-tab-u-lous""! I must say Angelina Jolie, over and over again you rock... I was enthralled by your performance and that of your co-stars as well. As if your performances were not enough, wardrobe completely nailed it with the marrying of the performers personalities to their surroundings. (especially Angelina Jolies'). On top of all of these goodies, the music department did an outstanding job captivating me from 00:00:01 until the end. This is hands down an amazing film ""Team Maleficent"". Good fairy tales are hard to come by. This one fits the bill. With such incredible artistic direction I had no choice but to feel inspired once again by the magic of a great production/story. We all have one to tell...",Maleficent
782,d-s-d,Loved it!,8,24 September 2014,"For those who claim that they don't understand king Stephen, I'll tell you: He was an orphan and lived in a BARN all his childhood! I don't think Stephen had anyone caring for him or loving him, maybe it was contrary - people was cruel and humiliated him. As it often happens in real life, those who was treated badly in childhood and did not have any parent figure at all, just random people passing by, grow up to be sociopaths with attachment and bonding problems. Stephen could not love anybody, only thing he knew was how to use people to get his way. He married princess not for love but for ambitions, so, maybe Stephen DID consider his daughter as a valuable property you can later use in political games (as all the kings in medieval times felt about their daughters). Maleficient humiliated king when she forced him to beg on his knees, also she was a threat to his kingdom - good motivation for wanting to kill her. I loved the true loves kiss - (god) mothers love is as true as it comes! It is much better than the concept of a cute stranger with whom you have spoken once suddenly being your true love.To those who miss villain Maleficient - have you met really, really evil people in your everyday life? Mostly we meet people we are tempted to consider evil because it's easier for us. I don't care about the old cartoon, this new version moved me!",Maleficent
783,dawnaladwig,Intriguing and yet predictable plot,7,19 October 2014,"I just went to see it tonight. I have an even greater admiration for Angelina and her unique talent as an actress. I could somehow feel the pain and hurt from the betrayal of Stefan. Yet, I wondered if there might ever be a revelation that he stole her wings because he loved her and didn't want to kill her - he thought this would be a win win! I don't understand how she could turn one man into anything she wanted, but could not do this to herself or to anyone else. When her follower became trapped as a dragon, that would have been perfect timing to turn him into a worm and then he would have been free from the chains! She could have made him back into an even fiercer dragon after that. I wondered if her newly softened heart might have been able to soften that of Stefan and the two of them become loving parents to the young girl they love, but I guess not. I would have liked to see the look on his face from knowing that his precious daughter betrayed him by getting the wings back to Maleficent. Instead the battle continues until his eventual death. I really loved the special effects. I am an even bigger fan of Angelina than ever before!",Maleficent
784,sunset-babe21,it is a great movie for everyone,9,22 October 2014,"Maleficent is a film that is very well made. Its not fast-paced which is a plus. Angelina Jolie is so good in the role as Maleficent, that words cannot even really describe how spectacular she is as Maleficent so spectacular is an understatement. She really got into the character 'Maleficent' excellently. Elle Fanning is perfect for the role as Princess Aurora, no other actress would have been better for the role as Princess Aurora then Elle Fanning, and no other actress would have been better for the role as Maleficent then Angelina Jolie. This film is perfectly paced and doesn't feel rushed in terms of running time. It's not fast paced and that's a plus in and of itself. It doesn't end too soon, it doesn't end too late. It's just a perfect 98 minute running time.",Maleficent
785,Grae-143-575721,Inconsistent plot,4,26 October 2014,"Firstly, the cinematography, graphics and acting were up to the expected Disney standards. However, the storyline seemed like the writers fell asleep at the wheel and made at least one unforgivable and totally asinine mistake.Around midway through the plot, Maleficent creates an unsurmountable and impassable wall that completely surrounds the Moor, and which the King tries desperately to penetrate. Sometime later, a strange prince rides in from a neighbouring kingdom with no apparent difficulty. Later still, Maleficient herself rides through the Moor to the King's palace with no interference from the wall. Yet, at the end of the movie, she is shown to be taking down the wall. Quite an obvious plot error",Maleficent

The animation for one was beautiful and intense, watching Maleficent fly was emotional and inspiring. I couldn't help but think how amazing this movie must have been in the theater!This movie was humorous in it's own special way, Maleficent's personality was both emotional and hilarious at times. I found myself laughing a lot, and really feeling all of her emotions throughout the movie.This is a great movie for everyone. I can't say enough how well done this movie was, it had every element I enjoy, and the characters/character growth was well done!This movie kept me anticipating what was to come next the entire time.",Maleficent
787,cassandrahathaway-164-703354,This movie was amazing!,9,20 November 2014,"One thing this movie did well was the special effects. Every part of this movie was realistic which is surprising because a lot of movies that require effects slip up somewhere in the movie. Maleficent is full of effects--ranging from Maleficent's homeland to the epic battle in the castle. One scene that really stands out is a scene set in the Moors. Aurora is in the Moors with Maleficent and Diavel petting a big, blue, glowing, flying creature. Another impressive scene is when Aurora is having a mud fight with some pixie creatures. In the movie Maleficent transforms Diavel into many things like a wolf, and a horse both of which are very realistic.The acting in the show is also another strong point. The actors make the story very believable and I was in tears several times throughout this movie. There is a scene in the movie featuring an encounter in the woods by Maleficent and a toddler Aurora who is actually played by Angelina Jolie's daughter. The only rocky acting in this movie is done by the young man who played Stephan as a child in the beginning of the film.The theme of the movie is unexpected and very powerful. The theme is true love doesn't always have to come in the form of dating or relationships, it can come from true friendships and family.The soundtrack for this film was well done. There is one song in particular called ""Once Upon a Dream"" performed by Lana Del Rey and is actually a remake of the exact same song that is performed in the original Disney animated movie Sleeping Beauty.The ending was also done very well; it wasn't rushed and was well developed. The ending was very open ended, therefore leaving the possibility of a sequel open.There are those out there who say this movie is ""The script failed to give her character any depth and instead created a one dimensional villain with unconvincing narrative choices and the rest of the characters given too little to do in this very lackluster story which takes itself far too seriously. Verdict; a very flawed, bland and dark take on the classic fantasy fairy tale which not even Angelina Jolie's performance can save in the end."" I strongly disagree with this review; especially the part involving the other characters; many of the characters in the movie had many major roles to play and the story wouldn't work without them. I recommend ignoring them, and go see the movie and decide how the show is for yourself.""I will not ask your forgiveness because what I have done to you is unforgivable. I was so lost in hatred and revenge. Sweet Aurora, you stole what was left of my heart, and now I have lost you forever"" (Maleficent). The movie Maleficent is and incredible show with so much to offer its audience. After seeing this film I found that my high expectations had been exceeded. The film was so great I saw it twice in one week; once with my family and once with friends, and even after the second time I was still awed at the amazing movie that is Maleficent.",Maleficent

789,Mondry,Great new take on an old story,10,27 December 2014,"A great new take on ""sleeping beauty"", this is also and foremost evidence that Angelina Jolie is not a superstar for nothing, but actually a really great actress. Given there are over 500 reviews online, mine will be brief:Having just watched this show at a club re-run, I was shocked to find such a good show receiving only 7.1 average- so shocked that I registered with IMDb to give a better rating, for whatever my vote is worth. Why is this show so good? Well, it surprises the spectator. Firstly, this is much darker and cynically witty than one would expect from a Disney movie. There is a sharp contrast between cartoonish, slapstick (literally) acting and quoting of imagery from older, ""classic"" Disney interpretation and Angelina Jolie's look. Secondly, the old tale is presented with a twist that will surely appeal to anybody who enjoyed ""Wicked"". And then there is Angelina Jolie, most of her acting reduced to facial expressions, and subtle looks.Who should watch? From teenage on, anybody who enjoys fantastic stories, is able to bear mild violence and is happy to see old stories told in new ways.",Maleficent
790,ddtankers34,This was a very amazing movie! I loved it!,10,1 January 2015,"I was both touched and happy at the ending! It was so good... :) -- It was a good script, and the acting was good! Even though Angelina Jolie is not going to act anymore and continue being a producer (which is what i think), she was and always will be a star in my heart. I hope she will always be happy with her family.To me the movie was a good one! It had a good script, and the actors/actresses were doing very well acting. I was quite surprised that it wasn't like the stories we were told about, like Maleficent was always the villain and never had a good heart. But in this one it was changed, and i have to say it was by far one of the best movies i have ever seen.In my opinion i think it was better than the original movie. There were some touching scenes to me, but that is because i sometimes cry easily! And the acting was done very well!I am giving this a 10/10. This movie was very amazing! Angelina J. never ceases to amaze me!",Maleficent
791,sohbanki,Maleficent is more insidious than you think.,7,1 January 2015,"The story is based on the original sleeping beauty, where good and evil is pretty much black and white. Then Disney decided to provide a fresh new perspective from Maleficent, and decided to complicate the character, and made her pretty much like what everyone is. So Maleficent is no longer black, but rather gray (except for her costume). Tainted by the betrayal by King Stefan, she cursed Aurora out of anger and hatred (OK, this part made her sound pretty much like a Sith Lord, but I digress). The only way to break the spell was from a true love kiss. Then the king burnt all the spinning wheels in the kingdom and locked their remains in the castle dungeon. She is sent to live with 3 idiots who cannot even feed her, and Maleficent decides she will care for Aurora from the shadows. To keep a long story short, she gained the trust of Aurora, lifted the curse by bestowing her the true love kiss, united the 2 kingdoms and crowned Aurora as the Queen, presumably of the 2 united kingdoms. OK, here's my beef:1. Stefan cut off her wings. I can empathize that. I will feel terrible if someone cut off my arms. But if the wings can miraculously reattach themselves, then why didn't Maleficent ask for the wings back? She didn't even negotiate or barter. No where in the show did I see her ask for her wings back, and she knew her wings were in the castle. I was going ""huh?"". Right, so she rather curse a newborn rather than arrange to have her wings back.2. If you want to destroy something, you make sure they are dust. You don't half destroy the spinning wheels and leave their parts in an UNLOCKED dungeon. What if someone just walks in and decides to reassemble whatever usable parts into a working spinning wheel Someone's gotta make some thread to mend their clothes eventually. Really sloppy work of destruction, if you ask me.3. And while we are on clothes, how the heck do the citizens of the kingdom make or maintain their clothes for 16 years if there is no thread?4. Aurora was sent to live with 3 idiots.5. So Maleficent woke Aurora up with a true love kiss. You mean the parents have never kissed their daughter before they sent her away? Oh, so true love can only exist between a corrupted fairy and a little girl, but not between the parents and their daughter?6. If your father is killed by your fairy godmother, will you still be chummy with her? Aurora did, and I can never understand that. Look at her beaming away at the coronation. It is as she is saying, ""Yippee, my godmother killed my father and I get to be Queen of both a fantasy land and my own kingdom. How cool is that?""7. If you ask me, this was a ploy by Maleficent to get revenge all along. The curse was just a ruse to separate Aurora from her parents. Then she strategically inserted herself into Aurora's life and won over her trust. If you look at the end result, she killed the person who betrayed her, destroyed his family, took ownership of his daughter's heart, mind and body, conquered and assimilated his lands, installed his daughter as a puppet Queen, and she got back what was stolen from her. Is she scary or what?Coming up next, Disney will make a movie called ""King Stefan"" and present his side of the story.",Maleficent
792,epictacogamer,"This dark remake may entertain some, but for me it did not suffice.",4,8 January 2015,"My viewing experience for this movie was similar to my viewing experience of Man of Steel. Everybody who saw this movie told me that it was good, some even saying it was the best movie they ever saw. So when I finally bought the movie on Amazon I was excited to watch it because everyone said it was a great movie. When I watched it i was bored throughout it's runtime, it wasn't as good as the original film, the tone was uneven, the fight scenes weren't interesting, etc. Now, I'd rather see Maleficent than Man of Steel anyday, but that doesn't change that this movie is a below average movie at best. Reviews for this movie seem to be mixed. I've seen reviews for this movie as high as 10/10 and 1/10, so I'm here to give my take on the film Maleficent.Let me start off by saying that I don't hate this movie. Sure it's a bad movie but I certainly don't hate it. For the most part it's not stupid it's just boring. So I'm going to start by listing the things in the film that I like.The Good Stuff: - Angelina Jolie does a mostly good performance, and she looks great in the costume, probably the best casting choice possible for this role.Though it's obviously fake, the CGI in this movie is amazing, and despite the best CGI location in this movie being a knock-off of Pandora from Avatar, the CGI does look very impressive to me, despite my love for practical effects.I like the scene where Maleficent goes to the window where Baby Aurora is and talks to her. It's a funny scene, it isn't used to the film's advantage, nor does it add to the movie as a whole, but I'll take what I can get.The soundtrack for the film is very nice.Maleficent's character is the best in the movie and the only good character in the entire movie. Everyone else just feels like a cardboard cutout except Stefan and The Fairies. (I'll get to them later.)Now that you see my positives for this movie you probably want to know why I gave a 4/10.The Bad Stuff: - The film is boring throughout most of it's runtime. It's not as boring as a Star Wars prequel because usually something is happening on screen but the execution just makes it a drag and when it's not boring it's annoying.Most of the characters are either uninteresting or annoying (Except Maleficent). Other than Maleficent, Stefan, and the Fairies are the only characters in the movie with a goal they are working toward. Otherwise the King is boring and the Fairies are very annoying.The tone of the film is uneven. At some points it's funny, at others it's depressing, at others it's vibrant and each time these scenes happen it's usually by surprise and they don't work to the film's advantage either.The stakes are lower this time. Instead of cursing Aurora to die, she curses her to eternal sleep. I don't usually use this term but that's such a lame change to the source material given.The film uses the ""true love between two girls"" concept seen in Frozen (Frozen is awesome by the way), but here it feels forced. I can't help but feel that this was shoehorned in to appeal to Frozen fans.The movie is a boring. I get a feeling if it wasn't for the brilliant CGI, most people wouldn't like this movie. Other than the fight scenes and when Maleficent curses Aurora, the movie is just a drool-inducing remake.So in conclusion, despite having some entertaining scenes, the movie is another dark remake of a classic fairy tale. If you like the new dark remakes coming out, you might like this movie. (It's leagues better than the Alice in Wonderland reboot.) But most others won't be interested in it. And for those of you who say that this film is less ""sexist"" toward women, keep in mind that all the females in this movie (excluding extras) are either villains seeking revenge (Maleficent), negligent excuses for guardians (The Fairies), those guardians' victim (Aurora), or idiots. (the lady who didn't stop Aurora from the room where the burnt remnants of the spinning wheels were.) Just something to think about.",Maleficent
793,vaclav-96521,Non-traditional roles of the evil and good,10,15 March 2015,"Contrary to movie reviewers and the tradition of story telling, the roles of the evil and the good in this movie are reversed - Maleficent here represents the good and Stefan the evil.People take the traditional view that evil must be grandiose, powerful, extremely hard to defeat which traditionally is the task only true heroes can handle... while the reality of life is that evil among us is always small, smutty, weak, easy to defeat if only one knows how to... but that doesn't make the good none the less heroic. Finding the right principles and applying them in life against evil is every inch as heroic as defeating the typical arch evil nemesis (like Voldemort in Harry Potter series which is the kind of evil that leaves me nonplussed, evil form which is nonsensical and therefore boring).Stefan in view of the possibility of becoming a king betrays the good fairy and coward that he is, he can't bring himself to kill her but actually does even worse - cuts off her wings. I mean, how more base evil can you get? Of course, evil people like Stefan submit to a marriage of convenience - kings typically can't and don't have a wife of their heart - and it is only logical they don't loose much love over their children, especially female ones (those are mostly a burden for kings but can be traded away in marriage which can be good for the kingdom politics...) and so the baby princess gets shuffled off to seclusion - and when nearing the age of sixteen and shows up home, gets shuffled off into another seclusion without being shown any family feelings.From the reviews I did read (the first seven pages of them), one mistake is commonly made about Maleficent' role in bringing up the baby princess - in that scene when the fairies let her run off towards the cliff chasing after a butterfly. The reviewers interpret that as incompetence of fairies looking after the child and a good deed by Maleficent when she has to look after the baby princess herself - while nothing can be farther from the truth - as I see it, Maleficent distracts the fairies with her magic, so that they don't notice the baby is in imminent danger falling off the cliff, which is all of Maleficent's evil intention, but the creatures of fairyland (the bush catching the child) thwart her evil-doing ways and rescue the child, because the fairyland creatures do not share in Maleficent's evil ways.The movie did not strike me as feminist dream come true as some reviewers see it (I am male and against feminism as reverse discrimination). Sometimes you just get a movie that features female heroine and no outstanding male role showing. Also I didn't come to view this movie burdened with Sleeping Beauty classic etched in my consciousness and that freed me from making any comparisons (although generally I do decry modern tong-in-cheek remakes of classic works) and can only recommend this movie. I'd rate it for adolescent to adults, not for small children because they wouldn't understand the role the evil takes on in this movie. I'd classify the movie as 'very humanistic' or true to life, as movies do get. Can only recommend it.",Maleficent
794,mail-16079,A superb fantasy film which I recommend to all.,10,22 March 2015,"As a man who prefers science fiction to fantasy, I was pleasantly surprised by this superb film. It is a re-imagining of the classic fairy tale 'sleeping beauty' (at least I think so, as I have never read the original tale in the original language, and it may be that the Disney version with which we are all familiar is, in fact a re-imagining). The film is superbly directed; finely scripted, well acted, and is a joy to watch. The special effects are excellent, but are not overused. They are there when needed, and are spectacular, creating a magical world we can all appreciate. However, the thrust of the film is the changing relationships between the main characters, which are sometimes surprising and key to the story. Preconceptions from the accepted version of this story are overturned, and the altered relationships between the core characters provide a satisfying basis for a reappraisal of the whole concept of the story. This is a film that everyone should see, because I believe that almost everyone will enjoy it. I have no hesitation in recommending this to all viewers, of all ages.",Maleficent
795,annsilk-65319,Full marks for the story and special effects.,8,23 April 2015,"I watched Maleficent after greatly enjoying the very traditional and English Cinderella and being obliged to endure Frozen 3.Maleficent blew me away with such a clever deviation from the classic story, the drama, and the subtle and inventive special effects involving captives, fairies and woodland creatures. I found the Irish and English accents replacing the usual American a delight. The ability these days of American actresses like Elle Fanning, to become seamlessly English when required for a film like this, is impressive.I thought the score, whilst just right for most of the film, was a let down in the christening scene...sat there hankering for a bit of Tchaikovsky! ..and thought the dragon scene strayed too far into 'blockbuster' territory....but these were minor points in an overall 'magnificent' film.",Maleficent

I learn so much from this film that in the world we cannot believe anybody and we must care about everybody, don't make them sad because of you. The director of this film is Robert Stromberg and the actors is Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning, and so much another famous people. The story about the kingdom called Moors, in this kingdom has one girl called Maleficent the girl who is very kind and she often help people in this Kingdom. One day the man who called Stefan came to the Moors and he meet Maleficent. They grew up together and they were really close.

797,softballgirl-51919,A Sleepy Beauty tale told from a different perspective.,9,30 September 2015,"MaleficentIf we saw all the fairy tales from the villains' side would they still be all that evil? Maleficent was made in 2014 telling sleeping beauty's story from the point of view of the villain. Maleficent works very well, putting a whole new twist to the way fairy tales are normally portrayed and changes your perspective on various aspects in the original tale, which made it one of the best movies I have seen in a while. Maleficent stars Angelina Jolie, as the main character, who when she was a young fairy helped rule a kingdom of creatures. However their kingdom was surrounded by a country of humans and since they were not normal creatures, they could not go outside of their small kingdom. The ruler of the country was King Henry (Kenneth Cranham), who was very cruel and his son Stefan (Jackson Bews) found himself in the magical kingdom one day and him and Maleficent fall into a forbidden love. Years later King Henry tries to take over the magical kingdom, but not without a fight from Maleficent, Stefan being grown, now in hopes to help his father, proceeds to cut Maleficent's wings. After this happens Maleficent puts a curse on Stefan when he has his first daughter, Aurora (Elle Fanning), on her 16th birthday she would prick her finger on a spin wheel and fall in a death like sleep. Once this curse is cast Stefan demands all the spin wheels to be taken out of the country and for his daughter to be raised in the woods by three good fairies and be returned back to him the day after her 16th birthday. Maleficent secretly watches Aurora grow up in the woods and starts to have mother like feelings towards her which leads her to undo the curse. Maleficent has some similarities to the original Sleeping Beauty but also has its own twist. Both stories have some of the same themes such as love conquers all. In Maleficent this theme is shown, in one scene Maleficent feels guilt and regret because she cares for Aurora so much that she cannot believe she would cast something bad on someone she loves and wants to reverse it. Sleeping Beauty shows this as well when Prince Phillip, her true love, has to kiss her to wake her up from the curse.This movie being told from the villain's side somewhat changes your aspects of the story. In Sleeping Beauty it was always portrayed that Maleficent was very evil, and it turned everyone against her. In this movie, Maleficent, it makes you have more sympathy for the so called 'villain'. If more tales had an opposing side from the villains' point of view I think that fairy tales would become much more interesting and popular again. Overall this movie is great, it had very good graphics, a clear story line, and some suspenseful scenes. However, this is not like a normal fairy tale that you would play for your small children all the time. It has some very intense scenes such as, when Maleficent comes in to cast a spell on Stefan the lighting gets very dark and the music becomes suspenseful. This could seem scary to some people, which is another quality that I love about this movie because its target audience is not just for children, but it also has entertained adults as well. Maleficent is a movie that I would recommend everyone to see. It makes the whole fairy tale perception change by telling the villain's point of view. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat at some times, and other parts make you want to cry. This is a must see movie, and I think other film makers should follow in their footsteps.",Maleficent
798,sodalysss,The amazing Maleficent,8,18 November 2015,"Maleficent is totally a great inspiration movie. First of all, Angelina Jolie was an incredibly adorable angel but because of King Stephan that changed her white soul to black. It's all because of the revenge. She tried to payback the revenge to King Stephan but the Karma goes back to her with her deep emotional love for Aurora. Even at the end, she's awaken from the mistakes that she had put the curses on Aurora, but it's too late. The most lovable scene that I really like in the movie is when Angelina kissed Aurora just because she's regret her fault. The writer made it really meaningful to express the love of the mother to the daughter! It shows that ""True love kiss"" doesn't has to be from the partner of your life but could be from the heart-guardians that love you, raised you, and keep looking after you. Thanks for reading, have a nice day!",Maleficent

My favorite character is Maleficent, she's really kind and pretty but the King(Stefan) turns her into an evil. She teach us about true love which cannot just kissing from a guy(not like in the Disney). I've been waiting this movie for a long time because I really love Angelina Jolie and it doesn't disappoint me at all. The action scenes is really impressive, The fight between the King and Maleficent, also the magic too. The scenario is pretty and the movie is HD also the fantasy world can't get my eyes off it. It has also teach me a mother love is important than partner's love. I suggest u guys should watch this movie...!",Maleficent
800,oumsopheap,I really enjoy Maleficent it's one of my all time favorite movie.,9,18 November 2015,"I think that this movie is amazing because it is science fiction, it has a lot of fantasy scenes that captured my attention. Angelina Jolie delivers an amazing acting performance full of potentials. Her dark sides in the movie was amazing this show how awesome Angelina is. The movie is great and unique from any other Disney original movies and by that i mean the villain in the story is not as bad as others maleficent actually turns out to be a hero in the story. I'm also a fan of sleeping beauty by having Aurora in the story is a bonus to me I absolutely adored her character. This movie is very entertaining u wouldn't want to miss any part of the scene and I genuinely recommend the movie to any of you who love a classic Disney movie like i do.",Maleficent
801,fedebi,She's not Maleficent...,4,24 November 2015,"Angelina Jolie is amazing, but without her this film would make no sense.In this version of Maleficent she's not evil at all, actually, she's a very good fairy. She turns evil as she wants her revenge, but she ends up becoming Aurora's fairy godmother.What?!So basically she's good, then she turns evil but not too evil, than she curses Aurora, but in the end she's repentant and tries to save her. I say it again: Angelina is amazing. Take her off and very little is left.Her name is MALEFICENT. Doesn't this ring a bell about the fact that she's a villain and not Aurora's fairy godmother? I understand narrating the story from a different prospective, but this is a completely new story that has nothing in common with the Sleeping Beauty.",Maleficent

803,pjacobs16,Misandry on film...nothing more ...spoiler alert,2,25 February 2015,"The visuals were wonderful and that is about all I can say that was good about this film. Either the men were without ""members"" or were brutish bast-ages that were the cause of all the problems. It started out good, but why is it that there has to be a ""different take"" on a film or story just to outright slander, defile and degrade men? I tried to like it, but I see this trend in a lot of movies today. Women can be pure evil in their own right without the help of a man. I was really hoping that Elle Fanning would shine in this film, but she was mind numbingly dull. The three fairies were stupid. The prince should not even have been in the film if he was not going to save her with a kiss. The ""true love's kiss"" part was wickedly betrayed by what only another woman can give, even if she is not the girl's mother. Is this what you want your daughter to think about men in general?",Maleficent
804,robin_fredriksz,Love it,9,16 May 2021,I always was scared of maleficent when I was little. Now I love her Amazing how they keep the real story vivid but also give her a real lovable personality.,Maleficent
805,missstacieleah,10/10 Amazing,10,22 April 2016,"Just had the pleasure of watching this. I was quite skeptical to begin with, I thought it would be the stereotypical story about an evil queen who'd taken over all the land to be defeated by some kind of hero because I'd never heard much about Maleficent's character before this. And I had a feeling there'd also be a typical la-Dee-da love story too (due to the whole sleeping beauty story) but I was so pleasantly surprised and warmed when the twists came.It is such a beautiful film, with a good feel/heartwarming ending. And I was so over joyed that there's going to be a sequel. Roller coaster of emotions. Must watch.",Maleficent
806,gulinyucel,Malecifent,7,25 October 2016,"Interesting and a fantastic film, because different visual effects. It shows different tales and the wicked witch by shows. In fact,there is no villains in the movie.Have the results of past mistakes. Angelina was different from the classic film. I think it was really good movie. The end of the film was different and creative. It was a film that excites me. Maleficent's wings are very realistic. Horns made her different, but the film should slightly improve.Angelina Jolie's acting is very good. Costumes were very successful. It worked carefully on this issue. A family film that should be followed. I would definitely recommend this film.",Maleficent
807,abysmalrabbit,Perfection!,10,12 January 2015,"I definitely wanted to see this movie, as I am a HUGE fan of the Disney version of Sleeping Beauty, but I was still cautious. Being a fan helped me to enjoy and appreciate what they were trying to do with this movie. After viewing Maleficent, I ended up LOVING the movie. The acting, the costumes and sets, the story, the emotion, the humor....everything was superb! I especially loved Angelina Jolie! Honestly, no one could have done a better job. If I had one criticism, it would be that, compared to the Disney cartoon, Aurora in Maleficent was not pretty enough. Elle Fanning is OK looking. Maybe sort of pretty. Aurora in Sleeping Beauty? Gorgeous. By far the the prettiest Disney Princess of all, in my honest, and biased, opinion. All in all, a great movie that only the trolliest of trolls would nitpick. See it!",Maleficent
808,missjoannaking,Magnificent!!!,10,17 December 2016,"My first review on here, I felt compelled to tell you that this movie is excellent. Dark themes, rich, emotive and beautifully done. It's an adult fairy tale, about love, greed, desire, betrayal and sacrifice. Angelina Jolie is outstanding. This isn't for kids, and there is nothing 'Disney' about it. And it is all the better for it. There is a feeling during the movie that the end could go either way, they certainly don't give you any reassurances and there is no sugar coating. It's unpredictable and I found myself getting very emotionally involved, which is not my usual 'Disney' experience. I don't like fairy tales, I don't like Disney, I'm not even a fan of fantasy, but these movie is grounded in the complexity of human emotion and I thought it was superb.",Maleficent
809,Phreakii,Maleficent is magnificent!,10,14 June 2014,"I didn't have to much high hope for this movie, more then Angelina Jolie. Not often do I give a movie 10/10. First I gave this a strong 9. But changed me mind, lovely movie, it deserves a 10. I thought everyone knew the story, and this was just a remake. So this was only eye candy for my. The cgi is wonderful, awesome. Atmosphere in this movie is great, it's all that fantasy you want in this kind of a Disney telling story. That with a new twist. The trailer is more dark then the movie. It contains a lot of humor, great fantasy action scenes. To see the story behind Sleeping beauty from a different perspective, the evil Maleficent perspective. But is she evil? I strongly recommend all people to see this. Does not matter if you'r 7 or 70. I'll gladly see it again. Lovely movie!",Maleficent
810,nickwakey,"The Best Line Of Dialogue, I've Ever Heard",10,9 June 2018,"Aurora - Come out. Don't be afraid.Maleficent - But if I come out, then you'll be afraid.>mic drop<I think this is Angelina Jolie's best work to date. She is perfectly cast for this role. A riveting performance of menace, comedy and affability, for a family friendly tea time film.All the cast are of equal, on par quality and the CGI is outstanding, especially the faces of the three fairies. The fight/battle scenes are action packed yet won't have your wee-ones screaming out in their sleep.If there is a Maleficent II, keep the same staff and style. The recipe is perfect as it is.",Maleficent
811,Man_from_the_moon81,The Dark and More Adult Fairytale Adaptation We All Have Been Waiting For.,10,29 May 2014,"This is not a fairy tale where a princess sing along with animals and waiting for a charming prince to rescue her. This movie has a message that all evil may not only have a dark side. We are told this true story of Maleficent . How she became the evil fairy we all know her as in the fairy tale . We get details about her relationship with Princess Aurora. More about the plot , I would not tell. But while this is a dark story , there are bright and cheerful colors , too. Beautiful contrasts in a nicely narrated fantasy film . We get to experience beautiful worlds we have not ever seen before on film. Angelina Jolie is amazing in the lead role. She exudes both power and fragility in a brilliant combination. The strongest card in this film is the interaction between Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning . In summary this is that dark and more adult fairytale movie adaptation we all have been waiting for . It has a beautiful message that revenge is not always the best solution after a betrayal .",Maleficent
812,soloki-65043,This was almost perfect.,9,28 July 2018,"I feel like her revenge should have been taken out on the guilty party in the first place, but overall this movie was great! I LOVE Angelina Jolie. Kudos to the creators! As for a few anti-feminist comments, Angelina makes more than you... has done more good than you ... you are effectively ignored.",Maleficent
813,creweblueyondercouk,Brilliant,10,16 August 2018,"I have read some of the 1 out of 10 mob. They must have been watching a different movie to me. All this feminist message rubbish. Disney sold out rubbish. Well maybe they got out of bed on the wrong side. It was brilliant. Jolie was brilliant. The evil king Stefan got his richly deserved comeuppance and everyone lived happily ever after. As it should be.
Jolie got the balance of strength but vulnerable just right. She tries to be evil but it's hard when you are fundamentally good. Hate makes you feel bad. Love makes you feel good, and we all want to feel good. If you haven't seen it do so ASAP. You won't regret it.",Maleficent
814,brianbrummer,A very worthy movie!,8,19 October 2014,"I really enjoyed this movie. I loved how they didn't follow the exact fairy tail and thus giving you no idea how the ending will be and if it will be a good or a bad ending. Of course, as usual, the acting of Angelina Jolie was simply sublime. I think the thing I loved most was the characters that you don't really meet, but still have their own story, even though it's not being told. Also a thing I really enjoyed was the special effects. It just looked so real and there was literally no doubt in my mind that there was put a lot of time in it. Although I did expect a little more action. But I suppose it's not that kind of movie, and I guess it wouldn't really fit the movie either if it were filled with battles etcetera. To just recap, I'm pretty sure I will watch this movie again in a few months. Simply because I enjoyed it that much.",Maleficent
