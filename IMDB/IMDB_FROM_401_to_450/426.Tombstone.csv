0,MartinHafer,"While it still promotes some of the old west myths, it's far more accurate than most westerns.",8,12 February 2020,"In movie westerns, there were shootouts all the time, Indian attacks and chaos. Well, this is true...in films. But in reality, the west was not so lawless and things like the shootout at the OK Corral were the exception rather than the rule. So, when you watch ""Tombstone"" understand that in many ways it is more historically accurate than most westerns but it still presents an image of western life that isn't really true....at least not for the average person living out west back in the day. So, when you watch the movie, just understand that it represents an exception...not the rule. And, while this might surprise you, the famed shootout wasn't even seen as anything that important when it happened...and it was only because of Wyatt Earp's publicizing it so much in the 1920s and 30s that we think it was some big to do today.The film is a modern and more adult version of a western. There is a LOT of realistic blood and gore...which there would have been in shootouts (WHEN and IF they occurred). It's certainly NOT a film for kids and is one I recommend but only for adults who know what they're getting into...it's unrelentingly tough and violent. This is much unlike other versions of the story (such as ""My Darling Clementine"" and ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"")...and for added realism, Doc Holliday looks awful...which he should have looked like since he was dying from Tuberculosis. Overall, very unpleasant but very well made.",Tombstone
1,bkoganbing,"""They Drag Me Back In Again""",9,11 July 2009,"Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp must have felt a whole lot like Michael Corleone being brought back into the law business which he thought he'd left behind in Kansas. Of course when you and your brothers settle in a wide open town like Tombstone, Arizona you've got to expect your talents will be called upon.As long as films are being made, filmmakers will never lose their fascination for the saga of Wyatt Earp that culminated in the famous gunfight at the OK Corral in 1881. Kurt Russell join an incredible pantheon of Hollywood's best actors who've gotten a crack at Wyatt Earp, like Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster and Tom Mix. However this film bears the closest resemblance to Hour Of The Gun which had James Garner as Wyatt Earp which also showed, in fact it concentrated on what happened after the famous gunfight.Unlike in Hour Of The Gun where Jason Robards, Jr. as Doc Holliday upbraids Wyatt Earp for becoming a killing machine, nobody's really caring about that here. In fact the tubercular Holliday quite approves of what Russell is doing. He's given plenty of cause after the OK Corral as you'll see.When he's on the screen Val Kilmer steals the film. In fairness to Russell and the rest who've played Earp, especially as a straight arrow the way Burt Lancaster did Gunfight At The OK Corral, the role of Holliday is such a colorful one, it's an actor's dream. Kirk Douglas walked off with that picture as does Val Kilmer here and Russell isn't quite the straight arrow that Lancaster was.For the first time the Earp brothers are shown as the family men they were. All but Wyatt were married in fact and Wyatt was keeping company with Dana Wheeler-Nicholson, but he drops her for Dana Delany who in fact he was with for the rest of their lives together and Earp died in 1929.Robert Mitchum whose unmistakable voice narrates the film was supposed to play Old Man Clanton, but health considerations knocked him out of the part and he only narrated. I'm sure the rewriting also reduced the parts of Ike and Billy Clanton. Another film legend, Charlton Heston, plays rancher Henry Hooker who shelters Wyatt and his posse.The bad guys who get their due here are Powers Boothe as a vicious Curly Bill Brocius and Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo who's definitely not gambling with the Earps and Doc Holliday with a full deck.My favorite Wyatt Earp film still remains Hour Of The Gun, but Tombstone which follows and embellishes a lot of the story line of that film is definitely a worthwhile film. I understand according to commentary made during a showing of this on the History Channel, Kurt Russell did a lot of the directing himself.He and credited director George P. Cosmatos deserve a lot of credit.",Tombstone
2,Leofwine_draca,The cast alone makes this worthwhile...,8,31 October 2016,"TOMBSTONE is yet another retelling of the famous story of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and the gunfight at the OK Corral. The subject is a well-rehearsed one having been covered elsewhere in the likes of John Ford's MY DARLING CLEMENTINE and the Kevin Costner epic Wyatt Earp. However, TOMBSTONE is well worth a look despite the familiarity of the material, and the reason for that is the cast.This film has an exemplary all-star cast of famous and future-famous faces. Nearly all members of the violent 'cowboy' gang ruled over by a scenery-chewing Powers Boothe are famous; we get the likes of Thomas Haden Church, Stephen Lang, Michael Rooker, the excellent and sinister Michael Biehn, and many others besides. Due to the sheer wealth of numbers not everybody gets much of a look in, but it's still eminently satisfying on a purely visual level.The heroes are given the most depth in terms of characterisation in the movie and the actors don't disappoint. Val Kilmer has never been more convincing in what is possibly his best role playing the sickly Holliday. Kurt Russell is all gravitas as Earp and as good as he ever is. Bill Paxton and Sam Elliott help to make up the numbers and certainly enhance the experience. And yet there are still more actors in support; the lovely Dana Delany as the love interest, Billy Zane as a pompous actor, Charlton Heston in an old-timer cameo, Billy Bob Thornton (back when he was fat) as a no-good card dealer and Terry O'Quinn as the mayor.The film itself is epic in length but the strong production values keep it watchable and engrossing. The Old West is brought to life in a convincing way. The first half of the movie is all build up and occasionally slow, but the suspense builds and pays off in an action-packed latter half with some great shoot-outs and choreography. TOMBSTONE is a violent, vibrant film and a fitting tribute to the heroes of old. It comes highly recommended.",Tombstone
3,SnoopyStyle,Val Kilmer steals the show,7,4 October 2014,"Tombstone, Arizona is a boom town from silver and is hounded by an organized gang called the Cowboys. It is led by Curly Bill Brocius (Powers Boothe). Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) is a cold-hearted killer. After success in Dodge City, Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) moves to Tombstone to find riches and a more simple life. He is joined by his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott), Morgan (Bill Paxton), and close friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer). Despite having his wife Mattie there, he becomes infatuated with actress Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany). The Earps get into confrontations with the Cowboys which eventually leads to the shoot-out at the OK Corral.There are a lot of good actors as both good guys and bad guys. Kurt Russell may not be the most impressive of the lot but he does a solid job. Val Kilmer is really hamming it up. He steals the movie with his memorable performance. Other than him, this is a straight western without much comedy. It's not camp. If there is any problem, it's that the movie is too ambitious. There are a lot of characters. It tries to be grand. It's quite a western. It's slightly better than the even longer Lawrence Kasdan's Wyatt Earp which came out 6 months later.",Tombstone
4,classicsoncall,"""If we're gonna have a future in this town, it's gotta have some law and order"".",10,30 July 2010,"I'll get on a roll every now and then, and right now I'm into the Earps and the Gunfight at the OK Corral. Actually I'm coming back to the subject having watched 1994's ""Wyatt Earp:Return to Tombstone"" last week, which in turn caused me to do some more reading and research on the topic. Both movies actually get a lot of the history of the Earp Brothers down pretty accurately, right down to some of the nuances that led to the famous gunfight. Like Wyatt Earp bumping into Tom McLaury coming out of The Oriental, and cold cocking him to provoke a confrontation. There were a lot of those historical tidbits sprinkled throughout the story, so that if you learned about them ahead of time, you would be even more intrigued by the film.That wasn't the case the first time I saw this picture when it came out in 1993. Back then, this was purely escapist entertainment, and the story of the OK Corral was just another fuzzy piece of Western history. But watching today, there's a lot about that period of the early 1880's that comes into focus under director George Cosmatos' discerning eye. If you're a Wyatt Earp fan, (and I am), and watch the picture from a completely neutral perspective, it becomes pretty evident that the Earp Brothers formed their own version of a protection racket once they got a foothold in Tombstone. With no more than a blistering confrontation with Ed Bailey (Frank Stallone) - ""You gonna do somethin' or just stand there and bleed?"" - Wyatt picks up a quarter interest in the Oriental. That kind of intimidation gained the Earps a reputation that quickly earned them a financial stake in virtually all the gambling and prostitution the town had to offer.On the opposite side of course were the Cowboys. The opening narration to the picture might have gone a bit overboard with their description as the first instance of organized crime in the country. Actually, the Cowboys depended on a rather loose association based on business interests and family affiliation, along with personal friendships. In 1881, the Clantons were rather large landowners who derived much of their income from cattle rustling. The citizens of Tombstone were somewhat divided in their opinion of the Earps and the Cowboys, because even though they were a rowdy bunch, the Cowboys spent their money freely throughout the town. It wasn't surprising then, that elements would seek revenge on the Earps after the gunfight and trial.But enough of the history. One of the things that I had forgotten all about was the opening sequence with Curly Bill (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). Eight years earlier, Clint Eastwood built a movie narrative around Revelations 6, Verse 8 in ""Pale Rider"" - ""And I looked, and behold a pale horse. And his name that sat on his back was Death, and Hell followed with him"". I'm somewhat surprised the picture used virtually the same theme to kick off this picture. Johnny Ringo goes on to effect his own demonic influence throughout the story, but I wonder now whether it's more intriguing to consider Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday as the real pale rider of the story. Racked by tuberculosis, Kilmer gradually transforms his character into a deathlike spectre who faces Ringo in a final throw down that was pre-ordained. But I have to say, their initial meeting in The Oriental ranks right up there as one of the most memorable scenes in movie Westerns. Kilmer's cup twirl was an inspired piece of writing and acting brilliance.As for the fabled gunfight, the story gets it right once again (for the most part). The McLaury's and Billy Clanton died, Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne ran off, while Morgan and Virgil Earp were severely wounded. Doc Holliday took a bullet to the hip, and Wyatt came away unscathed. I counted over fifty rounds fired in the picture against history's account of roughly thirty one shots fired, nevertheless, it was all over pretty quickly.Dispensing with the Spicer trial that found Wyatt and Doc cleared of murder charges, the events that follow wind up economically compressed for time. With Virgil (Sam Elliott) once again severely shot and wounded, and Morgan (Bill Paxton) murdered, Wyatt and Doc embark on a lesser known facet of Tombstone history, the Earp Vendetta Ride. With a loyal group of followers, Wyatt and Doc sought revenge on those they considered responsible for the attacks on the Earps. Historically, Johnny Ringo met his demise during this period, though the circumstances of his death is open to wide speculation, one of which is the version offered here.Although they maintained contact following the vendetta ride, Wyatt and Doc Holliday basically went their separate ways, so the scene at the Glenwood Springs Sanatorium is the film's final attempt to elicit some genuine emotion from the players and the viewer. I'll let them get away with that, as every film takes some license with history. It's the picture's last chance to put the Wyatt Earp/Doc Holliday relationship into perspective, as reflecting on Doc's words earlier in the film states it best - ""Wyatt Earp is my friend"".",Tombstone
5,gavin6942,"Hey, Let's Play Cowboys and...",7,6 March 2006,"What this movie comes down to, without a real need for review, is do you like westerns? If you can't stand them and have no desire to see one, you'll dislike this film. If you like them, even a little bit, you'll probably love this film. It's the telling of the true story of Tombstone with the best cast of any Western: Kurt Russell, Bill Paxton, Val Vilmer, Sam Elliott, Terry O'Quinn, Michael Rooker, that guy from ""Wings"", Powers Boothe and others...And the drama is there: a man torn between two women while his family is gunned down. And the action? It's the Old West! Gun fights everywhere you look! But the real story is the mustache parade. Val Kilmer in a silly mustache. Kurt Russell's mustache is a bit large. Both seem rather fake. Terry O'Quinn looks like his is real, not unlike the one he had in ""The Stepfather"". Bill Paxton's mustache is unremarkable. And the best mustache award goes to Sam Elliott. But that's obvious, because Elliott's mustache is his second-best quality (behind his gravely voice). In ""The Big Lebowski"" his mustache was massive. In ""The legacy"", his mustache actually had a co-starring role on the opening credits. One time I saw Sam without his mustache, and it was like Samson without his long hair. It destroyed the man.Anyway, this film s recommended if you need a western. Otherwise, maybe not. You have to be in that mood, if you know what I mean.",Tombstone
6,jboothmillard,Tombstone,7,18 January 2007,"Months before the Kevin Costner version was released, this Wyatt Earp film came out, and I think is almost better. Basically Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) has come back from cleaning up Dodge City, and now comes to the town of Tombstone, Arizona, and wishes to get rich in obscurity. He meets his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton) while there, as well as his old friend, Doc Holliday (a great Val Kilmer). They encounter a gang called The Cowboys (how original) who are causing chaos with random violent acts, and eventually it leads up to shoot ups at the OK Corral. Also starring Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocious, The Terminator's Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo and Charlton Heston as Henry Hooker. Very good!",Tombstone
7,ccthemovieman-1,Entertaining But Way Too Prejudiced & Profane,5,30 August 2006,"Most people consider this the best Wyatt Earp story ever put on film, and there have been a half dozen. I don't put in that category for personal reasons: I took offense at the blatant anti-religious tone of the movie. I don't to hear Earp (Kurt Russell) tell us he's an atheist, somewhat mock those who do believe, all the while using the Lord's name in vain frequently, nor did I need to hear the latter over 25 total times in this movie, which is almost 25 times more than any other Earp film. This kind of bias was not needed in the story. What was the purpose? Answer - religious prejudice in films is so strong screenwriters apparently can't help but put it in everyone's face, even if it doesn't fit in the storyline.Other than that, it's extremely entertaining and Val Kilmer's portrayal of ""Doc"" Holliday"" is still the best-ever. He is the star of this movie in my opinion, and I'm not alone in that view. I think Kilmer is an underrated actor, in the first place.There are lots of well-known actors in here and the story moves extremely well with one interesting scene after another. It's just too bad they had to include all that blasphemy. I might feel different about it instead of preferring Kevin Costner's version of ""Wyatt Earp.""",Tombstone
8,rmax304823,A Confederacy of Mustaches,5,25 December 2004,"Sometimes I wish Sergio Leone had never made any of those much-imitated Westerns. We'd be spared all those close up of faces of the sort were get here. Sometimes, instead of a choker, we find some kind of macrolens that gives us ever fleck in the subjects irises and every pore on his nose. Sometimes if a character should smile, there is a Great Wall as the screen is filled with giant Chiclets.There's that aplenty in this movie. And lots of gunplay too. Sometimes I was confused about who, exactly, was shooting whom, and why. Why, for instance, does the gang led by Michael Rooker, genuine bad guys so far, revolt against Powers Booth? Okay. Booth has been responsible for a couple of shotgun blasts thrown womensward. That's enough to turn off anyone who reeks of sensibilities the way these boys do. But why does Rooker and his gang then throw in with the Earp faction? Motivation is thrown to the winds, along with the red scarves the reformed bad guys have been wearing.I suppose the story of the Earps, Doc Holliday, and the Clantons is familiar in rough outline to everyone, so there's no need to recount it. The historical inaccuracies aren't particularly bothersome. The movie doesn't pretend to be a documentary and it's not trying to make some sociopolitical point that needs propping up by evidence.But, maybe because I missed a few minutes here and there, the movie struck me as a kind of sloppy lash-up. Were the cutters drinking an infusion of mushrooms or what? The story is all over the place. Okay -- Wyatt Earp is married to a hop head. What happens to their marriage? It just sort of fades away and Wyatt runs off with the red-headed singer.Speaking of red-haired singers, I really like Dana Delaney, but she's miscast here as a free spirit, a saloon girl, squired around by the County Sheriff. No. She's beautiful, but not in the properly sluttish way. She has great big dark soulful eyes and a tiny dimpled smile, in which her lower lip covers much of her upper lip. This woman is not an iconoclast. She is reassuringly feminine stability. And she's the only woman we get to know much about. Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) has a girl too, the exotically gorgeous Joanna Pacula, but she fades away too. The Earp's wives were almost indistinguishable to me.There are two interesting figures. One is Curly Bill, played by Powers Booth. He's neat in his red shirt. He laughs with genuine pleasure as he rips things apart and shoots out lights and he has never regretted anything in his life, a regular Edith Piaf in drag. He's the kind of guy who, after having accidentally shot a harmless well-intentioned old sheriff through the heart, doesn't seem remorseful, just puzzled. ""Aww, come on White,"" he says drunkenly, as if Sheriff White were playing a game that had gone too far. I hated to see Booth go.The other interesting figure is the tragic Doc Holliday, all pale and sweaty and coughing blood from consumption. I understand he was a kind of rotten guy in real life, a racist and all that, but he's a winning character here. He talks like a college graduate. ""Frederic f***ing Chopin."" And he will not use a short word where a long one will fit in. But we are thankfully spared any display of his medical skills. The script doesn't even get into his background enough to establish him as a dentists -- let alone a surgeon.Holliday was a surgeon in ""My Darling Clementine,"" come to think of it, which had far more in the way of historical inaccuracies. But you know what? It's a far far better movie than ""Tombstone."" There's nothing here that even remotely resembles Wyatt Earp escorting Clementine to the church service.This is okay if you're interested in lots of gunplay and not much in the way of character or humor. The photography is quite good. An item in ""trivia"" says the lightning was real lightning, and it looks it, but curiously the thunder sounds electronic, less real than the thunder of half a century ago. Nice silhouettes of funeral processions under a darkening sky. But the cinematography doesn't really save the movie from mediocrity.What led to all that violence in the Southwest was honor. Honor was a vital part of the regional Southern culture and the Western culture that sprang from it. Honor is like water. We need it, just as we need a drink once in a while. But there can be too much of it and what you wind up with is a flood that destroys communities even as it preserves dignity. Robert E. Lee had to be careful about posting his officers in the Civil War. There were so many outstanding challenges to duels that he had to be sure to keep those offended far apart.",Tombstone
9,ma-cortes,"Exciting revisionist Western with plenty of tension , thrills , gunplay and high body-count .",8,19 September 2018,"""Tombstone: The Legend of Wyatt Earp"" (George P. Cosmatos, 1993) with Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer is a vigorous recounting of a familiar tale , dealing with legendary lawman moves to Tombstone , Arizona, aiming to begin a new life along with his brothers , Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) . This trigger-taut Western drama deals with a lawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) and a badman gunslinger and philosopher Southern gent who usually coughs , called Doc Holliday , (Val Kilmer who excels , giving comsumptive conviction to character) , the strangest friendship this side of heaven and hell . They fought shoulder to shoulder in the wildest stand-up gunfight in the history of the West . As the fabled showdown is seen about two-thirds of the way through this film . They are the strangest alliance between the West's most famous sheriff Wyatt Earp , trying to overcome outlaws and its deadliest gambling killer , Doc Holliday. It's incomparably performed by the greatest team who ever went into action , Kurt Russell portrays the large-than-life lawman , living by the old rules , driven by revenge , dueling to the death and Kilmer is most impressive as a gunslinger , the hellfire gambler , his only friends were his guns and his only refuge was a woman's heart , Kate : Joanna Pacula . Two towering Box office actors in a huge exciting production . The film correctly builds up its suspense until a tense battle in streets of Tombstone , it is the highlight to the story and the start of a small war between the revenger Earp and the baddies : ¨The Cowboys¨ , led by Curly Bill (Powers Boothe ) , Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) , Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) , Billy Clanton (Thomas Haden Church) , Frank McLaury (Robert Burke) . Meanwhile , Wyatt falls in love for an actress , Josephine (Dana Delaney) , though lacks the indispensable romantic spark . 
This is an overwhelming Western , though too self-conscious , suffering from 90s Western revisionism . It was partially panned , but nowadays being well considered , may be seen by some as unoriginal and cliched but is really a very fashionable outing in Earp saga and a throughly agreeable Western. Russell sounds and looks the part more than any other Earp , including Kevin Costner/Kasdan Wyatt, being helped in no small measure by his courage in growing a large Earp-like tache . Val Kilmer delivers an awesome acting , stealing clearly the show , a character designed for scenary chewing , giving a breathtaking portrayal of the doomed dentist . Although overlong , but blessed with a high-energy level , thanks to noisy action , spectacular horse riding and rousing shooting . Russell spends a lot of time looking troubled by the violence while kills mercilessly. There's also essential moustache-wearing from the very effective Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton : Virgil and Morgan . Here Doc helps Earp against other historic characters , such as Stephen Lang /Ike Clanton , Thomas Haden Church /Billy Clanton and Johnny Ringo/Michael Biehn . As the picture benefits itself from despictable villians . The film focuses Tombstone , 1881 , with stimulating scenes about OK Corral gunfight between Morgan , Virgil , Wyatt Earp , Doc against the nefarious Ike Billy Clanton , Johnny Ringo, and Tom McLowery . This main character is a historical figure , in this case the sheriff Wyatt Earp who participated the most famous duel occurred in the western town of Tombstone in 1881 that has been brought to the big screen many times as in the classic ""My Darling Clementine"" in 1946 directed by John Ford with Henry Fonda and Victor Mature , in this ""Gunfight at O.K. Corral"" (1957) with Burt Lancaster , Kirk Douglas directed by specialist John Sturges who would resume the same story in ""The Hour of the Gun"" (1967) ; the demystifying ""Doc"" (Frank Perry, 1971) with Harris Yulin and Stacy Keach or the more modern ¨Wyatt Earp¨ (Lawrence Kasdan, 1994) with Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid . This is a story enormous in scope ,unusual in concept with a mile-a-minute action on a climatic and thrill-a-minute gunfight. Packs a magnificent and marvelous cinematography-Vistavision with a nice sense of period , and Technicolor with overblown chromatic by William A Fraker . As well as adequate costuming and lavish production design . This thrilling film contains a spectacular and lyric musical score by the great Bruce Broughton who composes a rousing soundtrack . All of them help make this one an enjoyable action western film . This saga of Earp family and the band of law-abiding large moustaches beat the Wyatt Earp by Lawrence Kasdan/Kevin Costner to big screen by several years . The motion picture was stunningly directed by George Pasn Cosmatos",Tombstone
10,michaelRokeefe,Excellent epic. Wyatt Earp is an icon of the old west.,8,5 March 2001,"This is a tremendous movie crammed with gunsmoke, romance and the full flavor of the old west. The life of the legendary lawman and his family is very interesting. Earp moves to rugged Arizona to start life over with his brothers. He proves to have a strong stature as a businessman, but can't get away from his legend or let it die. The elaborate gunfight at OK Corral lets the lead fly. Flawless camera work and lighting and talented ensemble cast will draw attention to this epic for a long, long time.Kurt Russell is a powerful and macho Earp. This role is almost as strong as his portrayal of Elvis Presley in a TV bio-pic. Val Kilmer is excellent in the role of Doc Holiday. Probably his best job of acting ever. Sam Elliott is a standout as Virgil Earp.Other fine performances come from Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Dana Delany, Billy Bob Thornton, Charlton Heston and Jason Priestly.This one you can watch again and again with no fear of tiring of it.The full cast and crew are responsible for making Kevin Jarre's words come alive. This is more than a western; it is classic bound.",Tombstone
11,hitchcockthelegend,"Indeed, sir. The last charge of Wyatt Earp and his immortals.",8,16 August 2010,"Tombstone is written by Kevin Jarre and directed by its star Kurt Russell, with credited director George P. Cosmatos ghost-directing. It also features a large ensemble cast that includes Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn & Powers Boothe. The movie is loosely based on historic incidents occurring in 1881-1882. The plot follows newly retired peace officer Wyatt Earp (Russell) as he and his two brothers, Virgil (Elliott) & Morgan (Paxton), arrive in the Tuscon town of Tombstone. Here they plan to make their fortune and gain themselves a share in a farrow game at the local saloon. Wyatt's long time friend, Doc Holliday (Kilmer), also joins the Earp's in town and it's not long before they encounter trouble in the form of The Cowboys - a ruthless bunch of outlaws led by Curly Bill Brocious (Boothe).The back story to Tombstone is rather interesting, so without waffling on and boring the spurs off of any readers I'll try & keep this paragraph short! Willem Dafoe was slated to star as Doc Holliday but Buena Vista (Disney company) said no way on account of his appearance in the frowned upon The Last Temptation Of Christ. Since Buena Vista were the only company willing to distribute Tombstone, on account of Kevin Costner pulling rank and influence due to his own Wyatt Earp movie being on the go, they had the big say in things. Then when the screenplay was turned in by Jarre it was shot down by both Russell and the now on board Kilmer because it was deemed excessively too long. Jarre was then fired as director for refusing to cut down the characterisations. Enter Cosmatos to ghost-direct for Russell. Then Robert Mitchum (who narrates in the film) had to drop out of playing Old Man Clanton (subsequently dropped from the story) due to a riding accident. While genre legend Glenn Ford bailed out of playing Marshall White to pave the way for Harry Carey Junior to fill those boots.In spite of all the problems getting harmony and cohesion to the screen, Tombstone ends up being a thoroughly entertaining genre piece. A love letter to the genre and boasting one of the best ever portrayals of an (in)famous Western character (Kilmer's take on Holliday is sexy, dangerous and utterly beguiling). Comparing it to Costner's movie is folly, for that movie (and I'm a big fan of it) is a telling of Earp's life and doesn't Hollywoodise things, this is about a short period in Earp's life, with bells on. There's some inaccuracies, but in the main the makers do a good job of covering the events leading up to the famous gunfight that occurred at the O.K. Corall - and the aftermath of said confrontation. Pic manages to have its cake and to eat it for a modern age made Western. It does all in all what old fans of the genre expect whilst having enough savvy dialogue and rah rah sequences to engage the more youthful viewers. There's not much art to speak of (for instance you wont go searching out for the cinematographer's name) and the sheer volume of characters at times threatens to bulge the piece over the belt buckle. Yet it always manages to keep us entertained with a high energy action sequence or a sharp quip delivered by the irrepressible Kilmer. Even the standardised romantic angle involving the beautiful, but superfluous Dana Delaney as Josephine manages to have its engaging moments. Sure we ache for the next scene of Kilmer being cool or Biehn being a cocky bastard, but the love blossoming between Wyatt & Josephine, and the inner conflict that it causes Earp, really fleshes out where Earp was emotionally at a time when he was trying to settle down for peace in his world.Ultimately it's probably with the story of Kilmer & Russell insisting on a trimming of the story that Tombstone makes the most telling point. Critically it was recognised as being too bloated and that wasn't what was needed. For crying out loud the Western fan had had Eastwood's sublime Unforgiven the previous year, so who in their right mind would try and follow that? Tombstone thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously, but still it has enough nous to keep the beans cooking on high and the splendid moustache's a twirling. All that Whilst simultaneously providing some of the most quotable lines delivered in the most splendid of film genres. Kilmer's Doc is our Huckleberry, and so is Tombstone the film. 8/10",Tombstone
12,Hey_Sweden,Hell's coming with me!,8,10 December 2014,"While not exactly epic in scope - ""Tombstone"" does compress the passage of time a fair bit - it does do a fine job of entertaining its audience. This viewer isn't surprised to hear that it plays with the facts - such is the nature of motion pictures - but wasn't exactly expecting a history lesson in the first place. It's extremely well shot and does transport its audience to a different time and place. Everything feels very authentic, from the production design to the costume design. Granted, this gets pretty melodramatic - right after a key death has occurred, our main character is standing outside in an absolute torrent of rain. Subtlety is in short supply. But one thing this movie is not, is boring, and it fills a two hour and 15 minute run time quite thoroughly.A rock solid Kurt Russell leads an absolutely fantastic ensemble. There are LOTS of familiar faces here, although some unfortunately end up with very little to do. Russell plays the legendary lawman Wyatt Earp, who has left that line of work behind - or so he hopes. He retires to the Arizona town of Tombstone with brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) and their wives. Ultimately, fate dictates that Wyatt will NOT be able to ""live and let live"". A very scummy gang of outlaws that call themselves The Cowboys are going to become more than just a nuisance, and Wyatt will be forced to deal with them.It's the engaging and effectively eccentric Val Kilmer, as Wyatts' good friend Doc Holliday, that ends up stealing this show. Kilmer completely immerses himself in this character. Dana Delany as Josephine is an appealing love interest for Wyatt. Elliott, Paxton, and Russell make for a rather believable trio of brothers. Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, and Stephen Lang stand out among the many antagonists. As Doc says of Biehns' Johnny Ringo, he most likely wants revenge for having been born in the first place. Lang as Ike Clanton is such a worthless weasel that you keep hoping to see him get his comeuppance. It's nice to see Western veterans such as Harry Carey Jr. and Buck Taylor among the Tombstone citizens; the real Earps' namesake fifth cousin plays the role of Billy Claiborne. Robert Mitchum, whose son Chris has a tiny role, serves as the narrator.Good action scenes and visceral moments combine with some poignant elements to make for an enjoyable experience.Eight out of 10.",Tombstone

14,utgard14,"""Skin that smokewagon and see what happens.""",8,29 June 2014,"There have been many movies made about Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and the O.K. Corral. Chief among those are probably John Ford's ""My Darling Clementine"" and John Sturges' ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral."" Both of those are classic westerns that I love a lot. But this one is my favorite because it's just such an interesting and fun movie. Kurt Russell, Sam Elliott, and Bill Paxton as the Earps are all great. Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Stephen Lang, and the other Cowboys make for exciting, colorful villains. But the star of the show that steals every scene he's in is Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. This is easily the best role of his career, in my opinion. The rest of the cast is fantastic. Really it's an amazing movie with good characters and lots of memorable lines and scenes. While there are historical inaccuracies (aren't there always), it's more accurate than the other more well-regarded films about Earp and Holliday, such as the two I mentioned before. If you like westerns you should like this but I think it also has appeal outside of that fanbase, due to the fun script and the action movie tone of it all.",Tombstone

16,Boba_Fett1138,Perhaps the most awesome western ever made.,8,5 October 2006,"I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of the western genre, although the genre has definitely grown onto me the last couple of years. But even as a non-fan of the genre I've just always loved this movie.A '90's western is per definition a rare thing. Even rarer is that it's also a great one. ""Tombstone"" is a movie made in the tradition of the old spaghetti westerns but with a flavor of '90's action added to it. The end result is a great to watch and spectacular movie.Of course one of the reason why this movie is such a great one to watch is due to the story that is filled with some of the best known character of the wild west. The Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, Johnny Ringo etcetera. Everybody knows these persons, no introductions are required, which means that the story can do to them what they want without ever having to explain to much about their motivations or background. The movie is filled with well known characters, which are all portrayed by well known and excellent actors.The cast is also definitely one of the things that distinct this movie from other genre movies. The movie basically has an all-star cast but on top of that every actor is well cast as well. They suit their roles fine and make sure that the all-star cast doesn't distract from the movie its story. The cast has both well known established actors, like Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Charlton Heston, Michael Biehn, among others and yet fairly unknown actors that now are well known names such as Thomas Haden Church, Billy Bob Thornton and Billy Zane. So I say, good casting!It would be impossible to name and rate every actors performance in this movie but still I would like to mention a few. Kurt Russell works better than expected in the main part. Sam Elliott is solid as always and he delivers a powerful performance and puts down a strong character. Powers Boothe is truly great as Curly Bill Brocious, the leader of the cowboy-gang. Michael Biehn is also a great ruthless and hard tough cowboy, that also knows how to handle a pistol. Movie icons like Charlton Heston and Robert Mitchum as the narrator at the ending also show up in this movie. But obviously the one that steals the show, is Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday. It's a real shame that his performance was overlooked by the academy awards and any other award show for that matter. His performance is among the best of the '90's and definitely Kilmer's best till date. All of the characters also work well on an emotional level. It makes this movie so much more than just another western but a solid drama about true friendship, brotherhood and loyalty. The movie even manages to put a love-story into the movie, which works in a non-distractive way which is of course a real positive thing,The movie is basically filled with all of the western clichés and characters. You can say that this movie is a great homage to the good old westerns but that is also a great movie on its own. The movie is however not made in old western style but in '90's action style instead. This works surprisingly well for the movie and its story. It makes this movie perhaps the most awesome western ever made and an original one as well.The movie is filled with some great and memorable moments. Lots of those moments feature Doc Holiday. A coincidence? I think not. It proofs how utterly brilliant Val Kilmer is in his role and how well his character works out in the movie. Especially the stand-off between Johnny Ringo and Doc Holiday is one to remember.The movie might start off as a cliché filled western with nostalgic feelings but from the moment on when Wyatt's revenge starts, there is no holding back. The movie takes pace quickly and the movie turns into a non-stop action filled feast with some true awesome and well filmed moments, that are unforgettable.The way the cowboys are portrayed as a early group of organized crime is an interesting take, which works well for the story and the events in it. It also is another reason why this movie distinct itself from other genre movies.Visually the movie is great with some wonderful looking sets and costumes and a sweeping musical score from Bruce Broughton. I'll admit that the musical score is one of the biggest reasons why I love this movie so much. Broughton has composed some great musical scores over the years but yet he remains fairly unknown and underrated and mostly works on TV projects.I just totally love this movie, although I'll admit that it's not a flawless one.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Tombstone
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Great,8,5 June 2011,"Wyatt Earp, a former lawman, and his brothers want to start anew in Tombstone, Arizona. Unfortunately, the so-called Cowboys, a notorious gang of outlaws cause increasing unease for the regular citizens of the town, and the three can no longer sit idly by. This has an incredibly talented cast, and everyone does excellent work. The pure awesome of Russell, Booth, Biehn and Elliott makes this required viewing for anyone with a Y chromosome. This is one of the best modern Western classics(and not a spaghetti one, it's largely realistic), if the action is, if not small in amount, then at least grouped here and there in the film... long stretches pass with no guns fired, which is not to say that you'll be bored. There are a lot of characters, and this isn't about a detailed study of each of them, though they are well-developed. The plot is easy to follow and satisfying. Given that George P. Comatose(yes, I call him that intentionally) also directed The Cassandra Crossing and Rambo: First Blood Part II(and I've heard ugly things about Cobra), I have to wonder if this was the one film he did(R.I.P.) a really solid job on. The humor works. Dialog is pretty sharp, and well-delivered. There is blood, disturbing content and violence in this. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine enjoying it. 8/10",Tombstone
18,Uriah43,Not Historically Accurate but Enjoyable All the Same,7,23 August 2017,"This movie begins with an outlaw gang known as ""the Cowboys"" riding into a Mexican village where a wedding is being conducted. After killing several police officers attending the wedding, the outlaws then rape the new bride and subsequently murder the local priest in the process. The scene then shifts to Tucson where ""Wyatt Earp"" (Kurt Russell) meets up with his brothers ""Virgil"" (Sam Elliott) and ""Morgan"" (Bill Paxton) en route to Tombstone. As luck would have it, upon arriving they meet up with ""Doc Holliday"" (Val Kilmer) who intervenes in the nick of time to prevent them from being ambushed by a man Wyatt had completely humiliated just an hour before. Unknown to them, their fortunes are about to change when the Cowboys decide to ride in and take ownership of Tombstone. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining film from start to finish. I especially liked the acting of Val Kilmer and Dana Delaney who brightened each scene they were in. On the flip side, however, I didn't quite care for the manner in which Wyatt Earp was characterized as historically he was just as much of a scoundrel as any of the other people depicted in this film. So to have him in the role of as one of ""the good guys"" seems a bit of a stretch. But that's Hollywood for you.

The plot:After having retired as a lawman,Wyatt Earp decides to live in the town of Tombstone with his two brothers and his best friend Doc Holiday.When he gets to to the town,Earp finds out that there is a gang terrorising the town called The Cowboys.Everyone knows that The Cowboys think they are above everyone (even the law!) As Earp and his family and friends stay at Tombstone,he realises that he must come out of retirement and get everyone to to stand up to them.So Earp gets his family and friends to take out The Cowboys.This will lead them to Arizona for The Shootout at The o.k. Corral.But not all of Earps friends and family will be alive after the shootout. View on the film:Direction/screenplay,the film is directed by George (Rambo 2) P.Cosmatos and the screenplay is by Kevin Jarre.After having seen this film,i am suppressed that Cosmatos is (i feel) really under-rated as a director.The thing that Cosmatos does really well,is instead of letting the action drown the film down,he uses it at the right moment,so that the film is more a really great character piece.Screenwriter Jarre does a great job with the characters,in giving them all there own time to build,and having the characters speak in a very ""natural"" way,so you can tell how much they are really good friends to each-other.The cast.Whilst this film is a fantastic ensemble film,i have to point out the major to actors of this film.The first is Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday.I have to say that this is one of Kilmers best performances.(Along with his acting as the charismatic Jim Morrison in Oliver Stones flawed movie The Doors.) The other performance is Kurt Russell as the legendary Qyatt Earp.Russell (who has done some fantastic work with director John Carpenter and in the much under-rated film Breakdown,) does a really good job playing the every man,who you can see wants to do everything to help the people in the town.Acoures these two actors would not be able to work in such a great group of actors,that includes-Sam Elliott,Powers Boothe and the very under-used Bill Paxton and Michael Biehn who all make the film work with there strong support work.

Unfortunately, outlaws known as ""The Cowboys"", and the Clanton family gang in particular, cause trouble and tragedy for them, and with the help of old friend(and renowned gunfighter) Doc Holiday(played by Val Kilmer) go after the outlaws with a vengeance...

21,Wuchakk,"""Tombstone"" or ""Wyatt Earp""? How about BOTH",8,22 September 2016,"Released in 1993 and directed/written by George Cosmatos, ""Tombstone"" stars Kurt Russell & Val Kilmer as Wyatt Earp & Doc Holliday focusing on the infamous gunfight in Tombstone, Arizona, on October 26, 1881.This version of the story beat Kevin Costner's ""Wyatt Earp"" to the theater by six months and stole its thunder. The difference in these two films is in their names: ""Tombstone"" focuses on Earp's conflict with the 'Cowboys' gang in the Arizona town, whereas ""Wyatt Earp"" is an epic Western detailing Earp's life from youth to old age, although the Tombstone events are certainly the center piece. At 2 hours and 10 minutes, ""Tombstone"" runs an hour shorter than ""Wyatt Earp."" Both are top-of-the-line modern Westerns and whether you'll like one or the other depends on what you're in the mood for. If you're looking for a kinetic, mythmaking rendition of the tale then go with ""Tombstone."" However, if you want a more realistic, mundane account see ""Wyatt Earp."" Both are vastly superior to the talky 1957 version of the tale with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral."" I just saw both films back-to-back and it is fun comparing the two. Val Kilmer from ""Tombstone"" wins out over Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday, but not by much and not because Quaid is bad but rather because Holiday's role is more prominent in ""Tombstone"" with better lines. Actually Kilmer is nothing less than fascinating, although Quaid is more believable. Kurt Russell and Costner are about even as Earp, but ""Tombstone"" wins out overall in cast with Sam Elliott, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Billy Zane and the shining Dana Delany as Josie, although Joanna Going shines just as much in the same role in ""Wyatt."" There are exceptions; for instance, Isabella Rossellini from ""Wyatt"" edges out Joanna Pacula as Big Nose Kate.As for the dramatic walk to the O.K. Corral and the gunfight itself I favor ""Wyatt Earp,"" but ""Tombstone"" has a much better build-up to the confrontation. Unfortunately, ""Tombstone"" spins its wheels in the last 35 minutes with redundant gunfights between Wyatt & his men and the remaining Cowboys. ""Wyatt Earp"" maintains better momentum after the gunfight.""Tombstone"" stands with the best Westerns of all time, but so does ""Wyatt Earp."" The film was shot in Arizona.GRADE: A- (8.5/10 Stars)",Tombstone
22,The_Void,"Russell, Paxton and Kilmer raise some hell in a small town",8,26 November 2004,"Legendary lawman Wyatt Earp is now a retired man, and has decided to travel to the town of 'Tombstone' to find his fortune. While there, he meets his two brothers, Virgil and Morgan along with his good friend Doc Holliday; and all is fine and dandy. That is, until an infamous band of outlaws calling themselves 'The Cowboys' turns up to spoil Wyatt's party. These are the outlaws that Wyatt loved to dispatch in his prime, but now all he wants is to retire and have done with it...will he be able to do that, or is it time for him to re-enter the frey?Kurt Russell takes the lead role of Wyatt Earp for this movie, and does a good job with it (despite a very silly mustache). When justifying his reasons for casting Russell in Escape From New York, John Carpenter said that he could play anybody; and I think he can...but he's a lot better at roles that require him to show off, and he doesn't really get that chance here. Still, it's different and refreshing to see him in a more serious role. Russell gets support from a number of good actors, one of which being one of my personal favourites, Bill Paxton. Like Kurt, Paxton isn't given reign to play to his strengths here either. Paxton is at his best when he's running the show like he was in Aliens and Near Dark (despite them also being supporting roles), but his character here is a more subdued one, so he doesn't shine as much as he had previously. Val Kilmer is the only cast member that is allowed to go over the top in his role. He plays Doc Holliday; the drunken, loud mouthed braggart of the film and spends most it making quips and generally showing off. Although this does the film credit as it makes it more exciting, it does become annoying after a while. These are the stars that stick out the most, but also getting in on the fun to complete an excellent cast are Sam Elliot, Paxton's Aliens co-star; Michael Beihn, and Powers Boothe, the man he would later cast in the excellent 'Frailty'. Then there's Billy Bob Thornton, Charlton Heston, Michael Rooker and we've even got Robert Mitchum doing the narrating!The film is very dramatic; a lot of the cast look like they could auditioning for the next Oscar ceremony, and the music adds to the theatrics, coming in whenever there's a whisper of a heartbreaking or exciting moment (the latter of which the film has plenty). However, this over-dramatization adds to the campy feel of the film and it makes it quite fun to watch. Tombstone is a very good movie; it's well shot, the acting is good enough and it remains entertaining for it's duration, and it's certainly one of the better westerns that have been released since 'Unforgiven' was met with critical acclaim in 1992. However, it's no classic.",Tombstone

Val Kilmer will never equal his performance as Doc Holliday, and Kurt Russel brought Earpp to life. I watched a show on Earpp's life before going to this movie, and it's script is historically close.  The unbelievable events in this movie is true, and life, sometimes, is more bazaar then fiction.

All the the usual (dependable) are her: revenge thirsts, gang wars, gun fights, showdowns and memorable characters - mostly because the actors take their parts and run with them. Such scenery-chewing is endearing. There's more than enough rugged to go around, yet there's such a strong romantic undercurrent that really flavors the whole thing. It's amazing just how Dana Delany impacts the movie even when she's not on screen. But it's a western first and foremost, and not a bad one, at that. You tend to wonder how historically accurate all of this is, (with Doc Holliday especially), but that's nitpicking with a movie this good.7/10",Tombstone
25,JamesHitchcock,"Less Grand, but Tauter and Leaner",7,21 March 2014,"In the cinema, as in other areas of life, one occasionally comes across odd coincidences. There were, for example, two unrelated films about the life of Oscar Wilde in 1960 and two biopics of Coco Chanel in 2008/09. In the early seventies two Hollywood studios were working on disaster movies about skyscrapers on fire, but in this case the coincidence was discovered early on and the two studios joined forces to produce the film known as ""The Towering Inferno"". The near-simultaneous appearance of two films about the life of Wyatt Earp and the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1993/94 might seem like a similar coincidence, but in fact there is a more logical explanation. Kevin Costner, the star of ""Wyatt Earp"", and Kevin Jarre, the scriptwriter of ""Tombstone"", originally planned to make a movie together on this theme, doubtless inspired by the success of Costner's own ""Dances with Wolves"" and Eastwood's ""The Unforgiven"", which gave promise that a revival of the Western was possible in the nineties. After a disagreement, however, they went their separate ways to make their own separate films. ""Wyatt Earp"", the film which Costner was to make with director Lawrence Kasdan, is a grand, sprawling three-hour epic, and Jarre, who was originally also the director of ""Tombstone"", had ambitions to produce something in the same vein. The studio, however, were worried by the potential cost of the project and wanted something shorter. Jarre was sacked as director when shooting fell behind schedule, George P. Cosmatos was brought in to replace him and extensive cuts were made to his script. As the title suggests, the film is (like ""Wyatt Earp"") based on real historical events in, Tombstone, Arizona during the 1880s, although it takes some liberties with strict historical fact. Wyatt Earp has recently retired as a peace officer and moves to Tombstone with his brothers Virgil and Morgan, seeing it as a place where he can settle down and pursue his business interests. Of course, he quickly realises that Tombstone is just as wild and lawless as the towns, such as Dodge City, in which he made his reputation and that his services will be required against a band of outlaws called the Cowboys who are terrorising the town. I think that Costner is better than Kurt Russell (here virtually unrecognisable behind that huge moustache) as Wyatt Earp; Russell never quite brings Costner's power and sense of the heroic to the role. ""Tombstone"" does, however, have one outstanding acting contribution which comes, rather surprisingly, from Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. I say ""surprisingly"" because, before seeing this film, I had always regarded Kilmer as a well-muscled action hero rather than as a serious actor. Holliday was (as the film points out) a complex character, a Southern gentleman-turned-dentist-turned gambler-cum-gunslinger and, unlike many of Kilmer's characters, was not physically strong- indeed, he was seriously ill with tuberculosis at the time of the events depicted here and did not have long to live. Kilmer's characterisation brings out many of the complexities of his character; his Doc is simultaneously gentlemanly, effete, soft-spoken, ruthless and shrewd. The driving force behind him is his close friendship with Wyatt Earp; he is not a man with many friends, but is unquestioningly loyal to the few that he does have. Among the supporting cast I liked Sam Elliott as Virgil and Dana Delany as Wyatt's mistress (later his second wife) Josephine Marcus.Kilmer, strangely, was not Jarre's first choice to play Doc. That would have been Willem Dafoe, but in a curious piece of censorship the studio, Buena Vista, refused to distribute the film if he was cast because of his role in the controversial ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" which had appeared several years earlier. Cosmatos only directed a handful of films during his career, and the only ones I had previously seen were ""Escape to Athena"" (which I disliked) and ""The Cassandra Crossing"" and ""Rambo"" (both of which I disliked intensely). I was therefore pleasantly surprised by ""Tombstone"", a far better movie than any of those. The pace does sometimes flag during the second half, a legacy of the decision not to make the Gunfight the climax of the film (as is done in some versions of the story) but to go on to tell the subsequent history of the Earp brothers and their enemies. Overall, however, Cosmatos succeeds well in the difficult task of taking over somebody else's project and then, at the behest of the studio, turning it into something quite different from what was originally envisaged. His version is less grand than Kasdan's, but tauter and leaner, and can stand comparison with it. 7/10",Tombstone

28,paul2001sw-1,"Amazingly, worse than Costners' movie",4,2 January 2010,"Wyatt Earp, the hero of the famous shootout at the OK Corrall, is a fascinating character, who lived through the wildest days of the west and eventually became a friend to the actors who played him in the early westerns. The shootout itself (and Earp's subsequent trial for murder) can be seen as the story of a impudent but sorely provoked law man who was nearly stitched up by a corrupt establishment, but there's also a more interesting interpretation: that in Tombstone, many men (Earp and his brothers included) fought in defence of their own business interests; and that jobs such as sheriff or deputy (held by the Earps) or prosecuting authority (controlled by their enemies) had nothing to do with any true concept of law. I've recently seen two of the many films made about Earp's life (in fact, two films made within a year of each other in the early 1990s); but sadly, neither is particularly good. Kevin Costner even managed the unlikely feat of making Earp's life seem dull, through a leaden determination to play him as a man of frankly preposterous moral resolution. In George Cosmatos's 'Tombstone', Earp is a little less noble - but the film is clearly the worse of the two. The gist of the plot (which drops much of the interesting truth) is that Earp is a bland would-be businessman lacking even the gumption to fall in love, but when people start shooting at him for no good reason, he responds by riding around Arizona personally delivering justice to the state's leading criminals. If I hadn't known the story beforehand, I doubt it would have made any sense to me. One feature of both films is that they make play of the character of Doc Holliday, one of Earp's sidekicks; I found Dennis Quaid's take (in Costner's film) a more rounded performance than Val Kilmer's in this one (though the implausible script is more to blame than the actor).The film starts with a portrayal of a random murder just to let the audience know that the bad guys are really bad; and unfortunately, that's about as subtle as it gets. I'm sure there is an interesting, ambiguous version of the life of Earp of his comrades to be told; but I certainly didn't find it here.",Tombstone
29,MOscarbradley,Almost certainly the worst of the Earp westerns.,2,15 June 2019,"Yet another take, and a very different one, on the legend of Wyatt Earp, (and, of course, Doc Holliday), and that (in)famous gunfight at the OK Corral, but a very poor one, despite a huge and mostly talented cast, none of whom are at their best. It aims for the epic and it looks great, (William Fraker was the DoP), but the director, George P. Cosmatos wasn't able to tie it all together and it's poorly written by Kevin Jarre. You get the impression that someone, (the director, the writer, both?), thought they were making the greatest western of them all, the one that would put all other epic westerns in the shade, even down to casting Charlton Heston in a tiny role and getting Robert Mitchum to do the narration but this is a classic example of overwhelming ambition operating in a vacuum. Earp is Kurt Russell, who's barely adequate in the role and a pasty-faced Val Kilmer isn't even that as Doc Holliday.

30,Cineanalyst,"""Tom Mix Wept""",8,4 August 2021,"A huckleberry of a Western, ""Tombstone"" is quickly paced, full of gunfighting and memorable lines and mustaches and features an outstanding cast--especially Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday, but even the small parts feature actors who'd later become well-known, like Billy Bob Thornton getting slapped around by Kurt Russell's Wyatt Earp--all of which surely contributed to its continued success after theatrical release in its life on television and home video and for standing out in a crowded field of cinematic portrayals of the O. K. Corral gunfight, including John Ford's ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946) starring Henry Fonda and Kevin Costner's twin film ""Wyatt Earp"" (1993). It's also surely why I find it eminently rewatchable and have, indeed, seen it a few times now. Upon this latest occasion, what especially strikes me doesn't have anything to do with its touted relative historical authenticity, which I would hardly know much about anyways, but, rather to the contrary, how intentionally mythical it is.The first two scenes establish the two central conceits to this mythopoeia: biblical and cinematic. The first one is an introductory sort of film-within-the-film narrated by legendary screen actor Robert Mitchum and made up of grainy, flickering footage in the (imagined) style of nickelodeon-era films--indeed, is made up partly of them, such as that very first great Western film ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903). The second scene is at a church, where a massacre of retribution and an assault on law takes place (it's during a Mexican lawman's wedding) and Bible verses are recited in Spanish. So, right from the start, the history of the American West is conflated with its cinematic legacy and the Church with that of the law.Wyatt Earp is treated as a Christ figure, with talk of a reckoning and walking on water. He's the reluctant savior of law and order, pulled away from that capitalistic American Dream of financial and family gain and, more interestingly, from a more theatrical temptation. The business with the troupe of actors here, including the vaudevillian Shakespeare and, aptly enough, Faust, is great. It reminds me of the similar play-within-play structure of ""The Seventh Seal"" (1957), another highly reflexive and religious picture. Moreover, Earp is literally tempted to abandon his wife and gambling business by an actress playing the devil. The biblical and godly talk, too, runs throughout the proceedings, including the brother's discussion of the Spiritualism that was in vogue around the time. One character doesn't see the light upon death, while it's suggested that another, whom one might consider the seemingly more unredeemable sort, does--and after consecutive visits from the Church and from art, the latter via a pamphlet written by another character. And the simultaneously artistic and religious allusions continue until the last line, ""Tom Mix wept,"" referencing by way of a silent film cowboy star the famously shortest verse in the King James Bible, ""Jesus wept.""None of this seems especially evangelical, though, at least not in the sense of established religion. It's no William S. Hart Western silent film, which were usually explicitly set up as a struggle for Hart's good bad-man character's Christian soul. No, this is the Wild West as memorialized by the church of cinema. A deconstruction of the genre not in the fashion of revisionist Westerns since Ford's ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962) and continuing through Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" (1992), but rather for a reconstruction of a traditional, even worshipful, picture of the American Frontier. That's not to say it's an entirely uncomplicated picture. It's, after all, an entertaining shoot-'em-up that ironically initially arose from a defense of gun control. The other big cameo from a legendary Hollywood star here is amusing in this respect, or at least I think so, as it was some five years after Charlton Heston played a rancher aiding gun-control lawmen in ""Tombstone"" that he became president of the National Rifle Association. And, the film's Jesus dances with the devil. Historical authenticity as mythology. Cinema is a contradiction; yet, that only makes my devotion to it stronger.Plus, seriously, Kilmer is very good. Like his Doc here, the infamously ""difficult"" actor must have few friends in the industry to not receive an Academy Award nomination for this--I mean, he should've got the Oscar--but at least a nomination. I probably didn't think about most of what I discussed in this review in my prior viewings of the film because I was so taken aback by Kilmer's performance. In anticipation of his upcoming ""Val"" documentary, this was the role I wanted to see again. He's incredible.",Tombstone
31,851222,Terrific Western,10,16 September 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Tombstone"" (1993) is a much known movie by now. It is know because first and the most important thing - this movie is superb. Its also know for terrific performance by
Val Kilmer who was snubbeb for at least an Oscar nomination back in the day - at least. Because as good as Gene Hackman was in ""Unforgiven"", the best performance in a supporting role was by Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday in my opinion. Others were also great and this movie truly captured that friendship between two main characters. Now it is known that this movie went through 9 circles of hell before it was finally released, with directors switching and etc, and its a true miracle that the final film eventually turned out to be superbly entertaining western.Overall, superbly paced, strongly acted by all involved, with one superb performance, great cinematography and very solid directing, this is a must see western. Its a true classic in many ways.",Tombstone
32,ironhorse_iv,This movie is indeed my huckleberry. Tombstone is a film too tough to die. It's highly rewatchable even today.,8,1 June 2019,"Released by Hollywood Pictures and based off actual events in American Old West during the 1880s. 1993 'Tombstone' is one of the two epic westerns released within a few months of each other that tells the story of Wyatt Earp played by Kurt Russell battles with the Cochise County Cowboys. The other film being director Larence Kasdan and Kevin Costner 1994 film 'Wyatt Earp'. Without spoiling this motion picture too much, while the production was indeed troublesome to the point that writer & original director Kevin Jarre had to replace by George P. Cosmatos. The movie was still very well made and very beautiful shot. Everything about the film was highly focused on historical accuracy including casting, locations, costumes, props and sets. Much of this success was due to Russell who pretty much make things run smoothly, during the majority of the production. However, there were some inaccuracies. One of them is with the omission of certain Earp Family members. Don't get me wrong, I can understand why they didn't introduce Wyatt's half-brother, Newton into the story as he has nothing to do with the town of Tombstone. However, Wyatt's other brothers James & Warren were there. Even if they weren't presence for the gunfight at the OK Corral, which in reality, was in a vacant lot next to Fry's photographic studio, six lots away. James was still a key member in the historical events, as he was saloon keeper who gambling houses were often visited by the Cowboys. Not only that, but he very helpful to the events that Morgan Earp played by Bill Paxton went through. They could had add his story. The same goes with Warren whom was original part of the Vendetta Ride yet not feature in the film. I really don't know why. The only guess is that Jarre really wanted the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse metaphor. While, this motion picture has the more tighten pace film than Costner's film. There were still some parts of Wyatt's story that went underdeveloped in this movie. One of them is the struggles he went through when first arriving in the city. While it's true that he did became part owner of the Oriental Saloon which is depicted. The movie didn't feature scenes of him starting out as small stagecoach business owner before turning to working as shotgun guard for Well Fargo. It's here where much of the real tension between Wyatt and Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) came from, as Clanton was a loose association of the outlaws and was looking to cut a deal with the lawmen concerning some stagecoach robberies and cattle rustling by some of the Cowboys. He may have feared that his dealings with the family would be revealed after the shooting, hints why he chose to side back with the Cowboys. The movie also romanticize Wyatt's reasons of becoming a lawman, a little too much. Much of his interest in being a deputy sheriff came from seeking power in elections and gaining more money, not from protecting the people from criminals. In truth, the Earps probably did more harm on that infamous day at the OK Corral than good, as there was no need to disarm the Cowboys. It was very custom for riders heading to Tombstone to carry their guns. After all, Apache warriors had engaged the Army near the city just three weeks before the shootout. It was very well established. Yet the brothers carry on with the attack fearing an later ambush for Wyatt's friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) at his living quarters at CS Fly's boarding house even after sheriff Johnny Behan (Jon Tenney) disarmed two of the members of the outlaws knowing that issues was high after the accident involving Marshal Fred White played Harry Carey Jr. The film makes them look more like heroes, when the movie should had made them more like antiheroes. Regardless, the Cowboys revenge afterwards was more spaced out in real life than the film. The shooting were not done during the same night, but rather several weeks apart. As for Wyatt hunt for the outlaws like Curly Bill (Power Boothe) & Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). Much of that is up for debate. Nevertheless, one of the weaker parts of the film is the love story between Wyatt and Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany). The film doesn't give enough time between the violence and tension with the outlaws to establish much. I thought the western could had done better if they cut that subplot out. It made the ending so cheesy. In real life, the whole idea that Doc would tell Wyatt to find her after the events in Tombstone is very unlikeable due to Holliday's ethic remarks about the woman. In truth, the two friends actually parted ways. Nevertheless, I love the acting between the two performers. It was amazing, but Kilmer really does steal the show. He put a love of work into his sickly alcoholic character. It was very believable even if the Latin speaking parts were fictional. I just wish the historical narrating from Robert Mitchum from the closing and opening wasn't part of the movie. It distracting from the reality of the story. It kinda hurts the film. As for the other actors, they were just as great. Also the cinematography from William Fraker and musical score from Bruce Broughton is to die for. It really help set the tone of the movie. Overall: While the script ask to be lot more epic with the original intention being a three hour plus movie. I really felt that the filmmakers did enough to make the western, highly rewatchable. In the end the movie is highly recommended checking out. It put the wild in Wild West for sure.",Tombstone
33,The-Sarkologist,A Decent remake of a classic western story,6,21 December 2013,"This is a pretty good movie even though it is a remake of older movies with new technology. I tend to prefer the newer movies as the technology tends to add more realism to it. I also appreciate the new styles of cinematography that filmmakers use to make the movie more visually attractive. I have seen some other westerns (such as Clint Eastwood movies) and I was not impressed.This movie has two actors that I enjoy: Kirt Douglus and Val Kilmer. My favourite character in this movie was Doc Haliday (Val Kilmer): he had numerous interesting personality quirks and very much seems to be detached from the world. He seems to always be around as he turns up in the most unusual placed. We are never quite sure what he is doing. The Earp brothers are normal and predictable, Haliday is not. The movie opens with a prophecy, something I have seen in another western (Pale Rider): beware the sickly horse. There are always four people around, at the beginning the three Earp brothers and Haliday, at the end Wyatt Earp, Haliday and two ex-Cowboys. This seems to suggest the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in that they are out to destroy the cowboys. The prophecy does not refer to a horse, but the rider - Doc Haliday. I won't mention anymore as it will spoil the end. This was used in Pale Rider but not as effective as here.At the beginning Wyatt Earp enters the scene as a retired sheriff. Even though he continues to remind us that he is retired, it is evident that he is not. As soon as he reaches Tombstone he clears out a rough neck bar called the Oriental. Even though he does it for selfish reasons, this action shows us that he will not stay retired. Even though a number of times his desire for law and order is suppressed (and even then when things seem bad enough he finds himself in the thick of things) this overshadows him later by revenge for the death of his brother.The criticism comes from a friend of mine who is a western fan. He claims that this is not the original story but rather a cut and paste to make an interesting and entertaining film. The story is twisted out of proportion to suit the audience. This was the same criticism that I had with the Odyssey which was also twisted around to make it more entertaining (though I still believe the original story was just as good). As I have little knowledge of the west, I cannot comment on this.The filmmakers attempted to set this film in historical context with an introduction of the characters and the times in which the movie was set. The movie also finished with the typical narrative of what happened to the main characters afterwards. I thought that this was worked well into the movie and had no problem with it. One of the major things that I noticed about Wyatt Earp was the struggle he has with his former self. Not only is he struggling to remain out of the affairs of the state, but he is also struggling to remain faithful to his wife. When he was young it is made clear by Haliday that Earp was quite promiscuous; but now that he is married he must remain faithful. We are led to wonder whether he will give up his wife for this other woman, and when we look at his wife all we see is an opium addict. The movie thus suggests that it is alright to thus leave her because she is failing to be a good wife. This is not true for our marriage vowels tell us that we are to remain faithful ""in sickness and in health."" Even if they are sick, as Earp's wife was, we are not free to leave her for somebody else. The whole moral question though is made moot when at the close to the movie we are informed that his wife died of a drug overdose shortly after she left Tombstone, thus when Earp did meet up with the new lady, he was essentially free to marry her.The end of the movie was a bit rushed but this is expected when they are trying to break up a big gang. They dealt with the leaders in a detailed manner but rushed through the other members. Ike was an interesting character as he was quite cowardly. He was the one that always escaped and when things seemed bad, he would always collapse and plead for mercy. To me, Ike was the most detestable of the cowboys because he could not face up to his punishment, and when it was obvious that he had been caught, he would plead for mercy only to go back to his old ways when set free. As a whole, I enjoyed this movie and would encourage others to watch it to.",Tombstone

As they arrive there they get in troubles and things start to go very wrong. They have to defend themselves but also protect one another.I liked this movie because it had an interesting plot with much of suspense and some great interpretations made by its cast. The direction which was made by George P. Cosmatos was very good and he did a great job on making us understand how his main characters felt and how their lives changed by their choices. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to say that I was amazed by both the interpretations of Val Kilmer who played as Doc Holliday and Kurt Russell who played as Wyatt Earp. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Bill Paxton's who played as Morgan Earp and Sam Elliott's who played as Virgil Earp.

35,eddie_baggins,A fun western with a loaded A-list cast,6,9 June 2020,"When the discussion of Western's comes up among film fans there's the obvious choices like the Sergio Leone classics, The Searchers, Unforgiven and a myriad of other well-liked tales of the Wild Wild West but one film that has also managed to find itself in the conversation is 1993 hit Tombstone, a film not adored by critics upon release but one that's stature has continued to grow in the years following its initial release.Filled with one of the most eclectic and talented casts assembled in the 90's, with some of the most enjoyable turns in the career's of Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell in particular, George P. Cosmatos and Kevin Jarre's film (with Jarre doing a bulk of the early filming only to find himself fired and replaced by Cosmatos) that chronicles the events leading up to the famous shootout at the O.K Corral that featured famed Western stalwarts Wyatt Earp, Doc Holiday and Wyatt's brothers Virgil and Morgan.Overcoming a somewhat loose and scatter-gun early approach that makes it hard to care to much for anyone or anything, Tombstone finds its pulpy western groove around the half way mark with it impossible not to get caught up in the retired lawman going on one last mission quest that sees Wyatt and his gang taking it to a group of marauding cowboys who are making the lives of those living in the town of Tombstone far harder than it need be.With some of the best facial hair and swagger going around, the core cast of Kurt Russell, Sam Elliot, Val Kilmer and Bill Paxton make for some extremely enjoyable viewing with the gang of A-lister's all clearly having a blast getting to play dress-up and enact out every young boys fantasy of western life, with Russell and Kilmer in particular shining in a loaded ensemble that find themselves competing for screen-time in a loaded two hour event.There's little nuance to anything going on and little deep reflection that is prevalent in the more thoughtful westerns like The Searchers or Unforgiven, to be expected when the director tasked with finalizing proceedings is responsible for the likes of Cobra and Rambo: First Blood Part 2, but there is a prevailing sense of playfulness and energy that keeps the film ticking along, particularly when the bodies start piling up in the films latter half.Without providing anything that will make you ponder it once the credits begin to roll, Tombstone showcases how exciting and enjoyable the western genre can be, reminding us that its great to have the serious minded products but also that ones that feature Val Kilmer's Southern accent and Powers Booth wandering around with custom made cowboy boots.Final Say -A fun western that eschews anything of lasting substance to instead give us an abundance of action and sassy attitudes, Tombstone is a fun ride to the wild west with one of the best casts ever assembled for such a product.3 gun-toting audience members out of 5",Tombstone
36,johnnyboyz,"Energy; pot boiling; characterisation and ultimately heart sapped out of a film of its time, but Tombstone suffices as a basic, action orientated flick.",6,11 March 2010,"George P. Cosmatos' loose 1993 remake of John Ford's Classical Hollywood era western My Darling Clementine is a relatively daft and wavy film; a piece that announces its intentions very early on with a big shoot out after some bandits inflict a large amount of cruelty on a bunch of townsfolk, whereas the original built to a climactic shootout in which characters we'd spent the entire film with rode on in and put themselves in the face of danger. Tombstone feels the need to establish, in the most basic of manners, that the 'bad guys' are the ones cackling and free willingly executing whilst a bunch of gunshots sound off for the sake of it. Tombstone veers more towards actioner than it does western, providing basic arcs for its characters and hand-holding us through whom we ought to be rooting for; but what else can you expect from the director of the second Rambo film? There's that wonderful instance in Ford's version of the story which sees a character by name of Doc Holliday, who has spent most of the opening forty minutes giving Henry Fonda's Wyatt Earp grief, have the Clementine of the title walk back into his life and put him through an emotional grinder of forlorn memories and drink. The shift in balance was stark, an informing to the audience that just because a character gives grief to someone we might assume to be whatever protagonist the film has lined up, does not mean he cannot be a human being; with respective flaws and characteristics. Tombstone tiptoes around this naturalistic air of plight, opting for archetype more often than I'd have liked whilst spending a gross amount of time plodding along before breaking off into bouts of shooting and chaos at intermittent times.The Wyatt Earp of Tombstone is played by Kurt Russell, an ex-marshal whom we know is good natured at the core due to stopping of a number of horses from having further pain and harm inflicted upon them by a certain perpetrator; an entire sequence which stands in stark comparison to the opening bandits and their attitudes towards the innocent. Journeying to the Arizona town of Tombstone with his brothers, where they hope to settle down, Earp is mangled into defending the town from the aforementioned group of a group of bullyin', gun-totin' cowboys; led by Curly Bill Brocius (Boothe). Doc Holliday is this time played by Val Kilmer, a laid-back; black-clad; smooth talking' card player whom we observe beat the system, win a card game, engage in a bar-room brawl of some nature before swinging his way outta' there with the money in one hand and the gal in the other – yes, it does feel a little fabricated. Holliday's relationship with Earp is certainly more low key in this one, something that fast-tracks character relations between the two and forces the film to focus on the cowboy gang as a primary source of antagonism, something that doesn't crop up nearly as much as Earp and Holliday's banter in Ford's version; hence the reason Tombstone comes across as the plodding piece it is.Italian born Cosmatos has his lead reflect what might very well be his own view on the material, in the sense Russell's Earp has an opinion on all the death and what's going on around him but it's a vacant feeling. A character's attempt at raising theological discussion with Russell's Earp near the beginning of the film is somewhat dismissed; amidst all the killing and hurt, it's established he doesn't care much about it – it's more so how Earp 'does' it rather than how he 'feels' about it, something that echoes the director's approach to the subject matter, in the sense he is more interested in black and white heroes and villains than looking at what these people think about those around them and particular predicaments. Holliday's easy truce with Earp is representational of this.Earp doesn't initially want the responsibility of keeping law and order. His smart and well dressed brothers stand in articulate contrast to Boothe's ragtag bunch of sloppy, roughly dressed and ugly looking bandits; although the film implores, in a bizarre manner, that practically everybody in the town is bound by a theatrical performance of a Shakespere piece; and that when the poetic nature of something so beautiful begins, everybody keeps quiet and observes. The film is one in which the focus is on men, and their relationship with one another and how they come to exist within the enclosed space of the town of Tombstone; a place that two different factions see two different, distinct futures in which they are at the respective centrefold of it all. In a film about men, men co-existing; men sorting out their relations with one another, it ought to be no surprise that the female characters are pushed to the back row - relegated to staying at home; staying silent and being seen out and about beside their man.Regardless, Tombstone isn't a bad film but it's certainly a lot less interesting than films that have taken on the story of Earp in the past. As an actioner, it works relatively well but as a character piece, it limps along for over two hours purely so that it can boil down to a showdown between good and evil. The melodramatic thunderclaps complete with lightning in the background as a key character dies about half way through exemplifies this, in the sense Cosmatos needs aid within the dramatic thunderclap sound effects to bring about more emotion out of the occurrence, rather than rely on all the previous character driven content for it to genuinely play out effectively. I like a good film about a power struggle in one locale between two groups of men, each with their own ideologies and attitudes towards life and Tombstone does suffice, it's just a little drawn-out; limp and mysteriously uninvolving for most of the time.",Tombstone

There is something about Doc Holliday n Val Kilmer nailed it. Val Kilmer is the first reason to see this flick. He potrayed the fearlessness n daring of a man with finesse
n the second good reason is Kurt Russell who with his handle bar moustache was awesome, specially in the last river shootout sequence n the third reason is the splendid star cast, Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Charlton Heston, Michael Rooker, Powers Boothe, Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Zane, Stephen Lang n Michael Biehn as the notorious crazy Johnny Ringo. Biehns facial expression during the last confrontation was very convincing of that of nervousness n insanity.

42,bsmith5552,Superb Telling of the Wyatt Earp Saga,9,23 January 2002,"""Tombstone"" deals with the adventures of Wyatt Earp and his brothers covering a two and one half year period. It starts with Wyatt (Kurt Russell) and his two brothers (Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton) arriving in Tombstone to seek their fortune. Subsequent events put badges back on the Earps and lead to the infamous gunfight at the OK Corral. The last third of the film deals with Wyatt's revenge on the baddies, known as ""The Cowboys"". Director George P. Cosmatos gives us a visually stunning film. From the spectacular sunsets/sunrises to the real lightning flashes and authentic settings and costumes. Most of the male actors are hidden under real beards and handle bar moustaches they grew which were common at the time of the story. The performances are excellent all around. Russell makes an excellent Wyatt. The relationship between Wyatt his brothers and Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer) are developed in detail. Kilmer plays Holiday as a former southern aristocrat complete with accent and mannerisms. Joanna Pacula plays his girlfriend. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson is good as Wyatt's drug addicted first wife and Dana Delaney looks stunning as the ""other woman"".  Heading up the villains are Powers Boothe as Curly Bill, Michael Biehn as Ringo and Stephen Lang and Thomas Haden Church as the Clantons. Wyatt Earp's grandson Wyatt Earp III plays Billy Claiborne. Veteran western performer Harry Carey Jr. does a nice turn as the town marshal and Buck Taylor (of ""Gunsmoke"" fame) plays one of Wyatt's marshals. Charlton Heston puts in a cameo as a rancher and look for Billy Bob Thornton as a saloon bully early in the film. ""Tombstone"" ranks in my opinion, as the best and most accurate version of the Wyatt Earp saga ever filmed. Try and catch the director's cut (at 134 minutes) which restores many of the cut sequences from the original version and serves to provide further clarification to the development of the characters and their relationships with one another.",Tombstone
43,freemantle_uk,The Law is coming,8,31 July 2011,"Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven helped reinvent the Western for modern audiences in the 90s but it was still unpopular genre. 1993 and 1994 also saw two films about legendary Wyatt Earp Old West hero being released in a short space of time.In 1879 lots of people are heading West in America to make their fortunes, buying land to become farmers, ranchers, miners or various businessmen. But it was also a wild place and in Arizona and there is a violence gang, the Cowboys who wear red sash who strike fear in the area. In Tombstone, the Earp brothers, Wyatt (Kurt Russell), Viral (Sam Elliot) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) move to the town, Wyatt being a famous peace officer from Kansas. Wyatt wants a peaceful life but many things prevent him, his wife's (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), his interest in an actress, Josephine (Dana Delany) and his personal sense of justice make him and his brothers get involved with law enforcement. As the Earps get into conflict with the Cowboys the violence start to escalate.Tombstone does have an old-fashion feel with its story of a more simple tale of good vs. evil and the score felt like it was from an older film. But at the same time there is more willingness to show violence, that bullets are painful, that the Old West is rough and that knives were used. Director George P. Cosmatos certainly knew how to make the film tense, building scenes up as characters come into conflict and not letting you guess if the scene is going to end up having a violence conclusion. Particular scenes of note are when Wyatt as a poker dealer comes into clash with the Cowboys as his drunk friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) challenges one of them and Wyatt has a shotgun under the table, the other being the build up to the Gunfight at the O.K. Coral, knowing something major is about to happen and the music really fitting the tone.The actions scenes were strong: quick, snappy and violence. They are fast paced and well edited, not using shaky cam or quick cuts. It what I want in a Western.Acting wise whilst Russell is prone to some meladramatic moments it shows that given the right material he can be a good actor and his Wyatt Earp is smart, tough with a sense of justice but also good wit with behind him. A particular scene being when Wyatt beats a dodgy poker dealer out of a saloon. Kilmer also surprising gives a good performance as a TB suffering alcoholic who is good gun slider and ally to Wyatt. Kilmer makes him softly spoken and a slightly campy fella but still a tough man to fight against despite his illness. Elliot is always a strong performer and most of the acting is solid in the film.Reading the trivia page on IMDb, Kevin Jarre originally wrote the film as a longer, more epic story and I can see that with many elements were cut. Wyatt's relationships with wife and Josephine were not explored very much and I bet in the original version of the script there would have been more of a focus on personal drama. After the family is attacked as well the film seems to speed alone very quickly as Wyatt and Holiday hunt the Cowboys: it feels very rushed.Overall Tombstone is enjoyable to anyone who is a fan of the Western genre.",Tombstone
44,kevin_robbins,There's nothing I'd change about this film,10,28 August 2021,"Tombstone (1993) is currently available on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows Wyatt Earp and his brothers after he retires from law enforcement and moves to Tombstone to start his new career as a bar owner/operator. When a group of outlaws who run the town cross him and his brothers, and terrorize the townspeople, the Earps return to law enforcement. This movie is directed by George P. Cosmatos (Leviathan and Rambo: First Blood) and stars Kurt Russell (Escape from New York), Val Kilmer (Willow), Bill Paxton (Aliens), Sam Elliott (Roadhouse), Powers Boothe (Sin City), Charlton Heston (Ben-Hur) and Jason Priestley (90210). The storyline for this is very entertaining and contains larger than life characters. The cast matches the quality of the storyline with masterful performances. Every character is delivered to perfection. This is my all time favorite Kilmer performance and Paxton, Elliot and Russell played the Earp boys so well. The settings, backdrops and cinematography are perfect - as are the sets, costumes, hairstyles and props. The villains were also great as are the shootouts. There's nothing I'd change about this film and I'd score this an easy 10/10.",Tombstone

It's a bit on the shallow, simplistic side, but machismo levels are off the charts and the strong personalities are endlessly entertaining, bouncing around and ricocheting off one another like careless lead sprayed on a dusty street. Earp gets the marquee treatment, but there's no masking that Holliday is the story's real star. Played with an overdose of charisma by Val Kilmer, Doc is a vastly intriguing character; damaged both mentally and physically, he spends the entire film in some combination of deep intoxication and sweaty near-death, brought on by the later stages of tuberculosis. Doesn't matter. He still gets the best lines, the most memorable scenes and the densest, most complete individual storyline. A staggering, winking car-wreck of a man who's simply impossible to look away from, I'd throw him up against any of cinema's all-time greats. The surrounding film is secondary. We get a heavy dose of gunfights, shady characters and gentlemen who look cool in an absurd mustache and a duster, par for the course given the era and genre. But Doc, man, Doc elevates this film from a stylish also-ran to an absolute classic.",Tombstone

With so much stoic machismo on display his sly turn as Holiday gives things some much needed balance. I don't know if it's good history, but it's certainly an entertaining film.",Tombstone
47,Lechuguilla,Right Off The Hollywood Assembly Line,3,8 June 2010,"Muddled story about gunslingers in 1879 Tombstone, boom town of the Old West. Too many speaking parts and a lack of character focus make a mess of the plot. Cast extras number in the hundreds if not thousands. This is a big-budget Hollywood production, bombastic in tone, with lots of violent action, and not much depth.The film's casting is generally atrocious. Kurt Russell, complete with ugly mustache, looks too young to play a retired Wyatt Earp. Powers Boothe, who was quite good as preacher Jim Jones, is not convincing in a story set in the nineteenth century. The cast even includes old-man Sam Elliott, a has-been actor from the 1970s. And the women, cast mostly as ornaments, make no significant impression.Despite being too young to play Doc Holliday, Val Kilmer gives a fine performance as the alcoholic but eloquently spoken Doc. Unlike other actors who phone in their performances, Kilmer at least tries to imbue his character with some uniqueness.Wyatt Earp yearns for some peace and quiet amid retirement. Of course, things don't work out that way, as a gang of thugs invokes Earp's wrath. Lots of shoot-em-ups initiated by scowling villains who, in stereotyped fashion, have no sense of humor. Even the dialogue is clichéd. Costumes are way over done, and feature black suits and capes, Hollywood stylish in the 1990s.Cinematography features an unfortunate widescreen projection that leaves lots of black space above and below the images. Some of the dusk scenes are evocative, with human silhouettes set against an orange sunset. Most of the film looks like it was shot on studio sets and back-lots. The film's thundering score is overbearing and manipulative, totally in keeping with a film that is in-your-face blunt. Sound effects are needlessly exaggerated.There's nothing subtle about ""Tombstone"". Except for Doc Holliday, there's no depth to the characters. And there's no depth at all to the contrived story. This is a film that's benefited from lots of marketing and a big-name cast. Like most Hollywood assembly-line films, the effect of ""Tombstone"" is momentary. It will leave no lasting impression.",Tombstone
48,jimbo-53-186511,"Rambling and occasionally unfocused, Tombstone is far from perfect but the fine ensemble cast make it worth a look",6,10 February 2019,"Successful lawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) heads to Tombstone, Arizona with the intention of retiring. However, when the citizens of Tombstone are threatened by an unruly group of cowboys, Earp and his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) take it upon themselves to stand up to the cowboys and protect the citizens.I've seen quite a few westerns in my time and the best ones usually have Clint Eastwood's name attached to them. Tombstone had a 5 star rating and on the basis that this one was based on a true story I had hoped that this film would be exciting and informative. Well, it does achieve both objectives to a certain extent, but isn't what I would categorise as a brilliant film.After an impressive start, the film seems to go into rambling mode with several scenes in the first half presumably existing to establish Wyatt Earp's heroism and perhaps why he was both feared and respected in equal measure. It's admirable to a degree, but unfortunately at times it feels a bit boring (the entire sequence at the theatre, for example, could have been omitted entirely as it has little effect on the story given how much time was devoted to it). In fact, the only reason I can fathom for its existence was to create a crass and somewhat unnecessary romance sub-plot. It's around an hour into the film before the cowboys make their return and it is here when the film starts to get back on track; there are some good showdowns and suitably tense moments - although again not as many as I was expecting.One major problem with this film lies with a lot of its characters; the female characters in particular are very poorly written and as for general character development...well if I were to call it 'sparse' that would probably be an understatement. The fact we learn so little about each of the characters; particularly important characters such as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday make the film all the more frustrating when you realise how good it could have been if it would have just had a tad more depth.Although the characterisation is a little flat, Tombstone does at least boast a fine ensemble cast. All the big hitters are very good, but perhaps special recognition should go to Val Kilmer whose character is perhaps the most difficult and complex one to bring to the screen and Kilmer does an excellent job making Holliday both pitiful and cocky in equal measure.Tombstone is rambling, sprawling and at times a bit superficial and unfocused. However, it has a fine cast, some tense moments and some terrific performances. I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't slightly disappointed with Tombstone, but overall it was still a fairly decent offering.",Tombstone

50,NateWatchesCoolMovies,I'm your huckleberry,9,13 September 2016,"There are two main film versions based on the life of infamous outlaw Wyatt Earp: a serious, sombre one with Kevin Costner (and a whole lot of others), and a rolkicking circus sideshow starring Kurt Russell, bedazzled with a jaw dropping supporting cast that doesn't quit. Both films are great, but if you held a six shooter to my head and demanded a preference, I'd have to give Tombstone the edge. It's just too much fun, one wild screamer from start to finish, filled with swashbuckling deeds, evil outlaws and bawdy gunfights galore. It should have been called It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World In The Wild West. Kurt Russell is in mustache mode again here, but looks younger and leaner than last year's western double feature his mutton chops starred in. Along with his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Norman (Bill Paxton) he arrives in Tombstone with a life of law enforcement in his dust and designs on retirement and relaxation. He gets pretty much the opposite though, when every lowlife bandit and villain in the area comes crawling out of the woodwork to give him trouble. Michael Biehn is the worst of them as crazy eyed Johnny Ringo, a deadly smart and ruthless killer, and Powers Boothe hams it up terrifically as drunken scoundrel Curly Bill Brocius. They are the two main causes of grief for the Earps, backed up by all sorts of goons including Michael Rooker, Billy Bob Thornton and a petulant Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton. Russell is joined by an off the wall Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday, the wheezy southern prince with a silver tongue that's constantly fuelled by booze. He gives the best work of the film, and it's fascinating to compare it to its counterpart, Dennis Quaid's turn in the other version. There's also great work from Billy Zane, Dana Delaney, Thomas Haden Church, Paula Malcomson, Tomas Arana, Johanna Pacula, Paul Ben Victor, Robert John Burke, John Corbett, Terry O Quinn, Robert Mitcham and even Charlton Heston good lawd what a cast. The standoffs, both verbal and physical, are a thing of beauty and the reason we go to the movies. Of all the westerns out there, this has just got to be the most fun. It's constantly alive, there's always something going on, a cheeky glint in its eye and a vitality in every corner of every frame, like a kid that won't sit still. Russell is a champ as Earp, a no nonsense killer, plain and simple, but a man of both style and charisma, two weapons that are equally as important as his side arms. Kilmer gets all the best lines and goes to town with his portrayal, creating electric tension whenever he faces off with Biehn, who is equally mesmerizing in a more intense way. The three of them kill it, and along with the howling mess hall of a supporting cast, make this simply the liveliest western I've ever seen in the genre.",Tombstone

53,drystyx,Lame spaghetti without the cool music,1,7 August 2007,"Make no mistake, this is just another goofy spaghetti western, but without the great music that makes people think such westerns are good. One of the worst things about this one is the false bravado of try9ing to look like the real story. It is so Hollywood skewed that it lacks any entertainment value. First, the characters. This is where the film fell flat on its face. In the spaghetti western, there is just one character, each with different names and faces, but all the same character, the self righteous, unbelievably self confident superman (or buy who thinks he's Superman.) The trouble with this is, these characters would all be dead by believing they could fly off a cliff from day one. This movie gives a second character, the Virgil Earp. There are a few like him, but the script is so badly written, you realize these are just the same character, too. There is the ridiculous character, and the stereotype civilized character. That is it. And it is way too obvious and ridiculous to accept even in a fantasy land. We want to like Wyatt and Doc, the two main characters, but in Hollywood tradition, the director and writers do the worst job they can. This might be an example of how not to write or direct a movie. A few good actors and clever camera men try to salvage this, but to no avail. Doc and Wyatt are the same person. No difference. The same Hollywood hype Superman with an impossible to believe Superiority Complex. With such a complex, their trivial interests are impossible to believe. In Hollywood tradition, only the most unlikable of characters survive to the end, so no one ever watches the end, except for a few masochists. Even worse than what are usually inferior spaghetti westerns, because this lacks the great music. If this is not on a critic's worst 200 list, he's been bribed or is pulling your leg.

The only character we really end up interested in is Doc Holliday, humorously played by Val Kilmer in what is one of his best roles. Others just don't inspire, such as Kurt Russell, Sam Elliott, Billy Zane and Powers Boothe, or they don't sit right, like Bill Paxton as the younger Earp or Michael Biehn, who tries hard as Johnny Ringo, but doesn't quite pull off the tortured, lethal gunman.Most of the gunfights, including the big one, are well staged, but little else is left to help recommend what is otherwise a fairly flat western.

55,dworldeater,Gloriously detailed and action packed western classic,8,21 March 2016,"Tombstone is a very action packed and well crafted western. Those involved with this production made a very authentic, high quality character driven film centered around Wyatt Earp and his family when they arrive in Tombstone, Az. The Earp's are looking to put their lawmen days behind them and make loads of cash in the booming town of Tombstone. However, several confrontations with the cowboys bring the Earp's back to law enforcement. Events soon escalate at the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, where the rest of the film results in an blood feud of revenge until the film's conclusion. Before the gunfight at the O.k. Corral the film spends time developing and humanizing these iconic characters in American history, exploring their lives and relationships while putting forth a great effort to be truthful and historically accurate. The film has an excellent ensemble cast starring Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Michael Rooker and a brief appearance of Hollywood icon Charlton Heston. I must say that I enjoy this a lot and the quality of performances, rich attention to detail and characters really knock this out of the park. If you just want to see a shoot em' up western, Tombstone is quite action driven and delivers big on bad ass action. I also enjoy the other film that came out a year later about Wyatt Earp, called Wyatt Earp.

I've always loved the classic Westerns, and this one seems head and shoulders above the rest.While some people still dispute the validity of the film's self-proclaimed ""authentic"" tag, it still remains one of the best westerns ever.

Val Kilmer goes above and beyond with his portrayal of Doc Holiday and has not been able to recapture than magic since. Although the action is great, there's just not enough story to justify the nearly two and a half hours of running time, even if the direction is confident, there's enough hiccups in the script to distract from the story a tad, but there's enough humor, action, and setting to make this western a great one.

Excellent details, with the reconstruction of Tombstone and a little known fact that cowboys indeed wore bright colour silks (sometimes clashing). You would not normally think of Val Kilmer as being one of the greatest actors of all time but his portrayal of Doc Holliday is nothing less than superb. With 'Tombstone' you not only get a blinding, Western extravaganza but a damn fine history lesson at the same time. The pace never lets up and all of the skilfully assembled cast are up really up to the task; in the sense that all (including Kurt Russell) give their best ever performances.

59,MartianOctocretr5,Superior retelling of the OK Corral gunfight,7,25 October 2006,"The legendary gunfight at the OK Corral has been addressed several times on film; this is a well designed and faithful retelling of the story.For the 1990's, this was remarkably old-school western in its approach. The larger than life Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell, sporting a giant mustache) and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer, also mustachioed) are portrayed as the legend paints them: heroically brave, with only traces of dented halos. Both Russell and Kilmer occupy their respective roles as these historic gunfighters with exuberance and urgency. Sam Elliot and Bill Paxton are great as the remaining Earp bothers, Virgil and Morgan.The movie, like most of the other versions of the OK Corral story, elects to take poetic license to inflate the legendary characters and events of Tombstone. One of the Earps and one of the Clanton gang gunmen are missing, and the order of a couple of events have been changed in chronology. A couple of items are omitted, and a couple others fabricated. However, the deviations from history are negligible and easy to overlook, as the movie's focus on developing the main characters is thereby enabled. There is good insight to the souls of Wyatt and Doc, and what they stood for. The steadily mounting animosity between the two camps, and how it is exacerbated with each skirmish, is presented well.The gunfight itself is strategically handled, and realistic. Events before and after the fight are also developed and showcased well. A fine movie for history buffs or western fans.",Tombstone
60,Screen_Blitz,Beautifully engaging with magnificent performances by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer,8,11 October 2016,"Labeling this biopic-based western epic directed by George P. Cosmatos a classic may feel somewhat of an overstatement, but with engaging storytelling by Kevin Jarre and lively performances by such a likable cast (most notably Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer); it almost feels like one. With the Golden Age of Hollywood several decades in the rear-view mirror and the glory days of western actors like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood in the past, it seems the livelihood of the western genre has been slowly dying out with a progressing shortage of memorable or even engaging westerns outings looming year after year. However, this 90s biopic centering on the story of western lawman Wyatt Earp shows good proof that though the western genre is running low on fuel, its not out of the game yet. Set in the 1800s American West, this film tells the story of former lawmen Wyatt Earp (played by Kurt Russell) who has set to retire from law enforcement duty and settle down in the old town of Tombstone, Arizona where he reunites with his old friend Doc Holliday (played by Val Kilmer) and his brothers: Virgil (played by Sam Elliot), the town marshal, and Morgan (played by Bill Paxton), the town sheriff. Everything in town goes pretty peaceful, that is until a gang of corrupt outlaws lead by the ruthless Curly Bill Brocious (played by Powers Booth) arrive in town and cause tyranny. With the lives of their loved ones threaten, Wyatt and his gang must pick their guns back and serve justice against the unlawful gang.What do you come to expect when hopping aboard the western genre? Bearded men in ten gallon hats? Gunslingers engaging in violent shootouts? Thick Southern accents? As common tropes they are, they all of these happens to be here. But director George P. Cosmotos has much more engaging aspects to offer here than the usual western conventions. Based on an inspiring screenplay by Kevin Jarre partially based on true events, the film boasts a gripping biopic story with mostly solid pacing and charismatic characters, and ventures through the harsh odyssey of former lawmen Wyatt Earp and his call for heroism when the ones he loved become the target of corruption and the life he thought he left behind comes back to grab him by his throat. This all comes down to some bloodshed conflict between his town and the ruthless outlaws of the wild west who threaten to tear him apart. This is not to say the story doesn't offer moments of levity and humor in the midst of its overall solemn atmosphere, particularly from Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday who sprinkles in some comic relief. But the murderous outlaws are not only trouble Wyatt is gutted with, he is also caught in the unexpected love triangle with his narcotic common-law wife Josephine Marcus (played by Dana Delany) and Matty Blaylock (played by Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), which forms to a subplot this story sadly leaves underdeveloped and less dynamic than it should have been. Overall, the story is a spectacle. Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are both genuine and highly rigid in their roles, and the chemistry these leads show is equally moving, though nothing in the Oscar territory, nothing remotely disappointing. Sam Elliot and Bill Paxton are fine, but quite as memorable as the former duo in the performance department, nor is Powers Booth as the gun-slinging antagonist with a thirst of blood.Tombstone is a beautifully engaging western epic with lively performances by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer, and boasts a powerful, if flawed direction by George G. Cosmatos and a gripping script by Kevin Jarre. Though this film may be not be what I consider a masterpiece, there are plenty of reasons why this film is worth your time, even if the western genre doesn't quite spark your interest.",Tombstone
61,dunmore_ego,When The West Was Huckleberry.,8,22 May 2008,"The *Pulp Fiction* of westerns, with its vivid dialog and firestorm set pieces. Also, Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer together in one film  and that's a big YUM for the ladies. Russell's and Kilmer's opening scenes establish them as powerhouse masculines, something which this film veritably bleeds with, yet these two tower over every other dusty gunslinger and scenery-chomping henchman.Russell is Wyatt Earp. We meet him alighting a train and whipping a wrangler across the face with his own whip for beating Earp's horse, growling in a rasp that would make The Clint proud, ""Hurts, don't it?"" Kilmer is Doc Holliday. Drawing his guns like proverbial greased lightning in a card game gone sour, then knifing his antagonist and exiting stage right with a fistful of cash and a hard, sexy woman, Kilmer has only begun to amaze us as he takes his character a mighty step further, endowing his Holliday with a pseudo-continental accent of his own nefarious design and an educated panache that we doubt anyone on the frontier could have seriously exhibited WITHOUT being a lightning gun (i.e. he'd be killed in a hot second for being such a dandy). To this day he has never commanded a role so deliciously elitist. Yes, *Tombstone* is yet another Gunfight at the O.K. Corral  but related in such a way that this fact is peripheral to the characters at the heart of the tale. Directed by George P. Cosmatos, written by Kevin Jarre, *Tombstone* presents a vision of the frontier as half brutal reality, half snakeskin Hollywood, all guilty pleasure. Ten times more entertaining than that OTHER *Wyatt Earp* - poor Kevin Costner's epic, drawn-out, tedious June 1994 release, coming in a weary second to this film in release date and pure animal fun. The Earp brothers, Wyatt (Russell), Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton), with their three blond wives in tow, arrive in Tombstone, eager to settle in and seek their fortune. Wyatt especially wants to leave behind his bloody rep as a ""Kansas lawdog."" The frontier has other ideas, crawling as it is with The Cowboys  rowdy, red-sashed troublemaking gunhands who ""rule"" the vicinity like mobsters; led by Curly Bill (Powers Boothe) and his sidekick, Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn), the ""deadliest pistolier since Wild Bill.""As the trailer said, ""Justice is coming to Tombstone.""Setting themselves up, unwillingly at first, as keepers of the peace, the Earp brothers' fate inexorably leads to the gunfight at the you-know-where, due to The Cowboys refusing to disarm while within town limits, the Earps sensing anarchy in the air and attempting to simply disarm them where they had congregated behind the O.K. Corral. Because this movie piles on so many entertaining vignettes, the O.K. is the least of our climaxes from Wyatt driving out the Faro dealer (Billy Bob Thornton): ""Go ahead, skin it! Skin that smoke wagon and see what happens!""to the tasty, intelligent, Latin exchange between Holliday and Ringo (you can see the full translation in the 'memorable quotes' link): ""Eventus stultorum magister."" ""In pace requiescat""; this movie roars like a stallion on steel hooves, in a hail of Peacemaker gunfire and very real handlebar moustachios.",Tombstone

It's still done today but with laser guns and any number of exotic weapons replacing them - and we still forgive it regardless. Notable, primarily for an unforgettable rendition of Doc Holliday or, Val Kilmer not playing Val Kilmer for a change, this ultimately represents another closing down sale for the Supercowboys franchise as the encroaching Superheroes drive them out of town.

It's Virgil, Morgan and Wyatt versus a loose-knit gang of thugs known as The Cowboys for control of Tombstone. Things heat up after a showdown adjacent to the OK Corral, and Wyatt -- now a federal marshal -- creates a special posse including Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer in top form) and a trio of Cowboy deserters to hunt down the remaining Cowboys. Many familiar faces dot the landscape, including Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp, Powers Boothe as Curly Bill, leader of The Cowboys, and Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo, second-in-command of The Cowboys. Russell is given two women to romance in this film, Earp's drug-addicted wife Mattie (Dana Nicholson) and saloon singer Josephine Marcus (Danas Delaney) who has her sights set on Wyatt.

I have never been much on Westerns, but this is my all time favorite. Wyatt Earp may not have been a saint, but he certainly exceeds the moral values of his enemies, the Cowboys. And has the gumption to stand up to them. Russell is almost always spectacular, no where more than playing Earp along with a ton of other stars, including a very effective Kilmer as the quirky Doc Holliday. I checked out the truth vs. Hollywood and was pleasantly surprised to say this is on the money in some key spots. Good from beginning to end, Russell should have been an Oscar nominee.",Tombstone
65,TheUnknown837-1,One of the best Westerns ever,10,18 July 2005,"Tombstone is one of my top favorite movies for its action, humor, and great plot and acting. Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Michael Biehn, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Harry Carey Jr., and the others do an excellent job of portraying the real men who lived back in the 1880s. Kurt Russell did a fantastic job of playing Wyatt Earp and he also bears quite a facial resemblance. Val Kilmer practically stole the picture as Doc Holliday. He was excellent at being casual, humorous, and dangerous all at the same time. And personally, out of them all, I like Michael Biehn (who we all know as Reese from The Terminator) as the sadistic and ruthless murderer Johnny Ringo. And after him I do favor Powers Boothe as the equally dangerous Curly Bill Brocious. They did their roles very well. And wow, Michael Biehn is equally great as being a bad guy as well as a hero. He just did a spectacular performance in my opinion. And the long gunfire-filled vendetta at the end is one of the best I've ever seen (although nothing compared to the shootouts in Open Range). Although Tombstone is a fun movie to watch, there are a lot of historical differences regarding the lives of the Earps. I will list a few examples. One, Virgil Earp (Sam Elliott) and Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton)were not shot on the same night. It was actually three months apart. And for Morgan's murder, there would be no need for the doctor to dig through his spine looking for the bullet, because in fact, Morgan was hit with a shotgun and the shell had gone clean through him and embedded itself into the leg of another man. Also, it is only suspected and not proved that Doc Holliday killed Johnny Ringo. Because Ringo was found tucked against some trees with a bullet lodged in his temple, some say it was suicide. And also, Sheriff Johnny Behan (Jon Tenney) wasn't sheriff when the Earps came to Tombstone, he became a lawman after they arrived. Another Earp brother, Warren was also involved in what happened in Tombstone, but he didn't get involved in the gunfight. Another thing, the cowboy gang wasn't distinguished by red sashes they wore. They didn't have anything distinguishing in truth. And they didn't have any leaders after Old Man Clanton (the father of Ike and Billy Clanton) died. But Ringo and Brocious were the most famous after Old Man Clanton passed away. Tombstone is a fun movie to watch, and although not 100% accurate in historical means, one of my favorite movies to watch.",Tombstone
66,baumer,"You gonna do something, or just stand there and bleed?",10,27 April 2007,"To say this movie is entertaining is to say that Popcorn is sold at the movies. It is a no brainer. Tombstone is one of the best movies ever made from an entertainment standpoint and it is by far the best western ever made, and that includes films like Cool Hand Luke and Stagecoach.I also have to concur with the opinion that Kilmer steals the show and he should have at least been nominated in 93 for best supporting actor. Tommy Lee Jones was brilliant as Girard in The Fugitive but Kilmer was equally as brilliant in this film.This film may not be a completely accurate re-creation of the famous story with the Clantons and the OK Corral and such, but it is so much fun that accuracy doesn't really matter. What does matter is that you are mesmerized by Doc and even guys like Ike, Curly Bill and even small roles such as Billy. But to me the two most interesting characters in the film was the relationship between Doc and Ringo. They truly hate each other but have a mutual respect for each other and you just know that there will be a showdown between these two gunslingers. And when they do play for blood, we realize that not only is Doc "" your Huckleberry "" but Ringo "" ain't no daisy. He ain't no daisy. There is so much fun in this movie.The script is unbelievable and some of the lines in this film will be quoted for generations to come, with the bulk of the hilarity and brilliance coming from Doc.On a scale of 1-10, this film easily gets a ten. And if you want to see one of the best casts ever assembled, you have come to the right place.To sum it up, I'll leave you with this "" You tell em' the law is comin.

67,Richie-67-485852,You Mangy Cur!,10,23 September 2017,"One of the best Westerns ever to come around Tombstone raised the viewer bar for classic Westerns and remained reasonably accurate in its story-telling. This Western has it all except for Indians which you don't even give a second thought but on second thought, there is a injun character bad guy so perhaps it does have everything. Guns, whiskey, cards, brawling, shoot-outs, dust, horses, good and bad guys, sheriffs and Marshalls, court scenes, women and even drugs too. No one knows for sure all the details but we do know that if you carried a gun or two, a knife and a rifle, chances are you not only needed to but used them often. Those that didn't died before their time. I am saying that to say this: killing remained a common problem forcing law and order to come into play or the killings would just go on. Bushwacking (getting the jump on someone) was common and shooting a person in the back was looked down on but there were many ways to kill and very few to testify. Nice long movie and who doesn't like all the stars and good supporting players they packed into it? Just well done all around. Great movie for a meal or sandwich with a tasty drink plus a decent snack to follow. I must also say the dialog was exceptional too. Get to your horses, mount-up and let's ride!",Tombstone

69,hnt_dnl,Doesn't deserve all the accolades,3,27 December 2014,"In re-visiting this film recently, I've come to the conclusion that there are really no great Westerns post-1980! The most notable 80s Western is probably Silverado (from 85), which while being somewhat entertaining, is entirely too long with too many somber, interchangeable characters. And, yes, I'm counting 'Unforgiven(from 92)' in the list of dull post- 1980s Westerns with it's pompous sense of self-importance and array of forgettable characterizations. Also, there is the ambitious yet monumentally monotonous 'Wyatt Earp(from 94)', which somehow manages to go LOWER than both Silverado and Unforgiven in terms of underperforming. It's an ironic twist because Silverado and Wyatt Earp both feature Kevin Costner and Costner basically stole Silverado as a minor character giving the liveliest, most engaging performance while being the polar opposite in Wyatt Earp, a super-serious, somber, eternally sad lawman.This film that I'm reviewing TOMBSTONE (1993) is the polar opposite of those 3 movies. Instead of ""lack of"", there is ""too much of"". Too many characters who blatantly over-act and shout their lines. Scenes punctuated with overdramatic, pumped-up music that's supposed to engage and move the viewer, but instead sounds extremely annoying. Too simplistic, unreal sounding dialog that comes across as laughable upon close scrutiny.'Tombstone' stars the usually reliable Kurt Russell as the infamous lawman Wyatt Earp, who arrives in the lawless frontier town circa 1880 via train along with his brothers Virgil (played by vet Sam Elliott, probably my 3rd fave performance in the movie; will get to the other 2 later) and Morgan (played by comical character actor Bill Paxton in a rather bad performance), their respective wives, including Wyatt's common-law wife Maddie (earnestly played by Dana Wheeler-Nicholson). Upon arrival, Wyatt and his clan meet up with his longtime associate Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer in a performance deserved of an Oscar nomination). So we've come to my BEST performance in this otherwise lacking film. Kilmer really rises to the occasion delivering an energetic, career-defining performance. But sadly, virtually no one else in the film is even HALF as good as Kilmer. Unlike the rest of the cast, Kilmer balances out the bombast with empathy, compelling the viewer to root and feel for his character. It may not be the most accurate portrayal of the famed dentist-turned-gunfighter, but it certainly is one of the most entertaining.The other significant group in the large ensemble are the actors playing 'The Cowboys', the nemeses of the Earp clan and Holliday. The Cowboys are played by Michael Biehn (as Johnny Ringo, my 2nd favorite performance), Powers Boothe (as leader Curly Bill Brosius), Stephen Lang (as Ike Clanton), Thomas Haden Church (as Billy Clanton), and Michael Rooker (as McMasters), in addition to several other character actors. Except for Ringo, these characters are all too 1-dimensional as villains with absolutely no layers. They're hateable, but not relatable, again Biehn's solid portrayal of the educated, contemplative Ringo being the exception, which is another problem I had: Ringo disappears for huge chunks of this movie yet I feel he was the most important member of the Cowboys.Additionally, there's a terrible tacked-on ""love story"" between Wyatt and town newcomer Josie (played by Dana Delany), a travelling acting troupe performer. Josie is supposedly the femme fatale role in this movie, but it's hardly believable that Wyatt would be so enamored with a rather plain-looking woman who's about as sexy as a root canal! The acting troupe includes an effeminate actor (played by Billy Zane, getting in early practice for his over-the-top villainous role in 'Titanic'). Like most of the actors in this movie, Zane thought this was a Broadway play! Then there are odd characters like Jason Priestley's who literally just occupy space and give nothing to the proceedings. And I didn't buy for a second Russell as a tough lawman. Too many characters folded against him and I didn't find him intimidating in the least.The acting in this movie isn't very good, but the script has to take a lot of the blame. Much of the dialog is extremely odd, the tone of the film meanders clumsily among elements of comedy, melodrama, and existentialism. It takes itself WAY too seriously to even be taken serious by the viewer. In actuality, I used to think this film was re-watchable, but lately, I see that it's good for maybe only a couple of viewings. The revenge angle is nice because it's always fun to see truly bad guys get their comeuppance, but the characterizations are so poor, you don't really care by the end of the movie. You just want to get to the end!",Tombstone
70,sharky_55,"I have two guns, one for each of ya.",8,12 March 2016,"Supposedly the original script of Tombstone had fully fleshed out lives and motives for even the smallest of secondary characters but which had to be cut for budgetary and time constraints. But in Fraker's dusty, deep focus shots of the bustling western town we get an inkling of this ideal anyway. The church sits in centre background like it did in My Darling Clementine, but here it is not a redemptive, restorative symbol and instead something to be burnt down and cursed. Townsfolk mill about in the distance, on foot and on horseback, and shootings erupt and cease fire like they are an everyday occurrence. There are those classical wide shots of posses riding furiously across the everlong plains, and those sunset silhouettes of caravan travel (that usual motif of the death of the west, the steam engine, not yet appearing). And who knows how long the crew had to wait to capture those shots of the red scarf billowing in the wind of the lightning storm in that frightful ambush? What better to play over the closing credits then the best sequence of the film, where the four 'tall drink of waters' approach the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. They are dressed in black, and stride so confidently like the role of bringers of death that they have taken up, like undertakers ready to their duty (the thespian's description is rather apt). We know from their moustaches their history easily; Sam Elliot's iconic weathered one, grey with age and experience and good intentions (we react exactly as he does to a mother's scar). Paxton's thinner, younger one, who is most obviously the only of the brothers to not have killed a man. And Russell's whose is thick and in its prime, but reluctant and looking for a new life. Cosmatos (in reality Russell) takes his cues from Leone in the climatic build-up to the shoot-out. But the best performance undoubtedly belongs to Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday, who is electric as the long-time friend of Wyatt Earp. His tuberculosis does not hinder him; it in fact makes his sweaty face and his steady drawl even more menacing along with his eyes that seem alive in contrast. His gaze is steely and his wit unmatched - we cheer along with the bar's patrons when he mocks Ringo's quick-fast skills with the pistol with his drinking cup. And we know exactly where his loyalties and intentions lie when he fiercely objects to Wyatt's claim that he has no business here: he has not many friends, but once gaining that title it is for life. There's a curious element that goes mostly unexplored here. These men are more concerned with gambling and money and guns than they are with the arts - Cowboys shooting at a stage performance manages to be comedic and frightening at the same time. And in a symbolic blow, Mr Fabian falls later to more fatal shots, but Josephine is hurriedly moves on to the next arc of her life. Not even the gorgeous Dana Delany and her little shake of the head as she proclaims upon seeing Wyatt for the first time ""I want one"" can really save this subplot from veering into Hollywood cliché; it seems a little too coincidental for them to bump into each for a flirtatious horse ride and picnic, and the ending is too cheesy on the backdrop of such dramatic events (the director's cut ties up some loose ends, including the fates of Big Nose Kate and Mattie Blaylock). And some of the action sequence are a little sloppy and rushed - the river's end for Curly Bill, and the montages of the posse finishing off the Cowboys. But of course right on cue, the credits remind us how good it is at its best.",Tombstone
71,Bob-45,Exciting AND Historically Accurate ? See the Director's Cut,9,3 April 2002,"In either the theatrical version or the director's cut (VISTA series), ""Tombstone"" is an exciting and historically accurate account of the Earp brothers vs. ""the Clanton's"".  Unlike ""My Darling Clementine,"" ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" and ""Hour of the Gun,"" we get a true pictures of the relationships and fates of the Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, Josephine Marcus, Katie Elder, Curly Bill Brocius, Johnny Ringo (probably) and Ike Clanton.  Moreover, unlike the atrocious ""Wyatt Earp,"" we get a suspenseful, actionpacked and COHERENT storyline. We discover ""the Clanton gang"" of earlier films was actually a huge gang (over 100) of outlaws known as ""the cowboys.""  We learn that Virgil, not Wyatt is the real instigator behind the ""gunfight at the OK Corral and Wyatt a reluctant participant.""  That gunfight is given its proper perspective rather than being the dominant event in ""Tombstone.""  The male cast is mostly extremely good, particularly Val Kilmer (Holliday), Sam Elliot (Virgil Earp), Powers Boothe (Brocius) and Michael Biehn (Johnny Ringo). Unfortunately, with the notable exception of Joanna Pacula (Kate Elder), the female cast is pretty colorless. Especially disappointing is Dana Delaney as Josephine Marcus. There's nothing flat about Delaney, except her acting here.  One wishes, Joanna Going (""Wyatt Earp"") had performed the role in this movie. Nevertheless, it's a mild disappointment in a mostly terrific movie.George P. Cosmatos' director's  cut is a BIG improvement over the original theatrical release.  Although only four minutes longer, his version provides much better context and continuity, particularly during the ""reckoning "" portion. of the movie.  I would give the theatrical version a ""high 7"", while the director's cut is clearly a ""9"".The VISTA series DVDs comes with a bonus disk with lots of great features and a reproduction map of the OK corral drawn by Wyatt Earp in 1919.  The VISTA series disk is only a couple of dollars more thanthe theatrical version.  It's a must for any collector of great and near great westerns.",Tombstone

The writing and story is incredible, the dialogue flows so well with the story and the actors that portrays the characters. The story is about Wyatt Earp, the director and writer does a magnificent job of creating and bringing his and the other's story to life whilst keeping it in a good pace, making each scene entertaining and almost every scene memorable.The ensemble cast is one of the many highlights of the movie as it is a huge one with both good guys and bad guys, lots of real people. We got the title characters Wyatt Earp and his brothers, Doc Holliday that are brilliantly played by Kurt Russell, Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton and Val Kilmer whilst we have Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn as the two villains, there is also lots of others but they are the ones that stand out the most with superb performances and I believe making realistic portrayals. Val Kilmer brings as always something unique to the role and he does it in a perfect way, making him stand out in every scene in a good way. With the movie's great writing we get some well written characters that are likeable and believable. Kurt Russell is the lead actor and he leads the movie with the help of Val Kilmer and Powers Boothe but he could have done it without them as he got chemistry with the others as well but the movie wouldn't be as good if they weren't cast as they brought their A game onto this movie.",Tombstone

In fact, Kilmer gives a bit of comedy relief where it's needed, compared to Russell's straightforwardness.There are some great scenes throughout the film, in particular, the scene with Holliday and Johnny Ringo and the ending scene is very heartfelt too.

76,Squonkamatic,Still Quite Remarkable,7,2 September 2009,"Not sure how it happened but somehow I ended up reading about one of my favorite American anti-heroes, Doc Holliday, the other weekend and by golly I was inspired to dig out my tape of TOMBSTONE. And gosh darnit this is still a very enjoyable modern day western, with a fabulous cast, some great laugh out loud moments and a sly sense of humor that sets it apart from some of it's more lead-footed contemporaries.It's far from a perfect film. Kurt Russell isn't quite larger-than-life enough for Wyatt Earp (he's still the COMPUTER WORE TENNIS SHOES guy, even thirty five years later), the screenplay & cinematography is hit or miss in spots. The music is stirring at the right moments but doesn't have the resonance of something like Walter Hill's THE LONG RIDERS -- still my personal favorite of the modern era westerns -- nor the novelty of a good old spaghetti western score.The comparison to spaghetti westerns is inevitable, as far as I can see, mostly because TOMBSTONE is a cartoon of sorts. A graphic novel for grown-ups that just happens to use the legend of the Gunfight at O.K. Corral as it's departure point. It's colorful, bloody, bombastic, funny, pop oriented, and yet it has some very memorable moments that are perhaps more important than the work as a whole. Westerns in general are usually more about their individual moments than their story arcs, an attribute that directors like Sergio Leone or Sergio Corbucci understood very well. I think both of them would have enjoyed TOMBSTONE & gotten a kick out of how some of their own ideas were recycled by the very industry they themselves were recycling.The standout attribute of the film is still Val Kilmer's delightful interpretation of Doc Holliday. With his southern drawl, cultured mannerisms, sly quick wits (""I've got two guns, one for each of ya."") and still quotable one-liners he created a role that was uniquely his. Whether or not it was as historically accurate as Kirk Douglas or Jason Robards or Dennis Quaid's versions isn't important. And like him or not as a person, the moments where Doc gets to shine are the movie's high points. The best part of his role is that Kilmer seems to have been aware that TOMBSTONE was a cartoon, and caricatured himself accordingly. As did many of the supporting players, particularly Powers Booth, Michael Biehn and Stephen Lang's delightfully scummy Ike Clanton.Part of what makes the film so remarkable is what a star crossed production it was in the first place. Originally a Kevin Costner envisioned project, he departed quickly to make his own Wyatt Earp movie upon creative disagreements with writer + original director Kevin Jarre, who was promptly fired when Kurt Russell came into the project and changed it's focus. Robert Mitchum was injured before he could play his role, a sitting director could not be secured until the late George P. Cosmatos agreed to helm. Kurt Russell apparently directed the bulk of the project himself just to keep the production alive, which perhaps explains some of the more awkward moments.The most awkward being Dana DeLaney's role as Josephine Marcus, Wyatt Earp's love interest. Her part was either inflicted on the script hastily or is sadly under-written, a conclusion borne out by stories about an original three hour version that might have explored her character in a bit more interesting of a manner. I also can't get around Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, who makes bizarre facial expressions through the whole film that aren't helped much by that cookie duster mustache he grew. Then again one of the historical accuracy traits the film boasts is that all of the mustaches and period costumes are real, which explains why Val Kilmer is sweating there in a wool suit for the entire movie. No air conditioning in the old west.So while it may not have the poignancy of UNFORGIVEN or the breadth of THE GOOD THE BAD & THE UGLY or even the macho swagger of an EL DORADO John Wayne film, TOMBSTONE is one of the great American westerns and a marvelous entertainment & deserves to be seen again. Here's a movie that's worth owning your own copy of.7/10",Tombstone

Now, 7 years later I rewatched and I found it a bit better than the first time.This film is about the notorious gunfight at the OK Corral and all the events that led up to it. The subject had been brought in movies various times (with movies such as MY DARLING CLEMENTINE and THE GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL) but this time the West is seen in a more realistic way. In movies the West is full of shootouts, attacks by the indians and chaos in the saloons. In reality the West had lots of laws and shootouts were the exception rather than the norm. So when you go into this movie expect of reality unlike many Westerns do.This movie has a solid direction and a great cast: Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton and Kurt Russell as the Earp brothers and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday are the most relevant characters. There is a cast full of famous actors of those years in all the supporting roles: Stephen Lang, Michael Biehn, Jon Tenney, Joanna Pacula, Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Zane, Michael Rooker, Thomas Haden Church and even veterans Harry Carey jr and Charlton Heston. The soundtrack too is great especially in the end credits.

Dana Delaney is stunningly beautiful and Val Kilmer's performance as the seriously ill Doc Holliday is brilliant. But the best performance is by Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo. He was convincing and made me undeerstand that Johnny Ringo was totally evil. The character of Curly Bill Brocious was poorly written in that he chuckled too much to be taken seriously. I believe the film begins to go downhill a bit at the end. The part where US Marshall Earp, Doc and his Deputies finally mop up the Cowboys is just a little too neat, too choreographed. There was a bit too much showmanship there. The final cleanup of the cowboys was actually a difficult, bloody process. The cowboys didn't give up since they knew they'd be hanged if they did. Consequently, most of them had to be hunted down individually. So for that lapse in the ending, I dropped it to a 7. The rest of the film is absolutely excellent, however!",Tombstone

After seeing all of these, I finally got a chance to sit down and watch ""Tombstone"".The Story: It was a decent, typical tale of an ordinary man, Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russel) and his family including his opium addicted wife, and two brothers Virgil (Sam Elliot) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) decide to live a leisure and peaceful life in the west. But when a band of thieves and ruthless murderers called ""the cowboys"" lurk in the town and go about their business ""scott free"" of the law, the three brothers and their friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) decide to bring ""law and order"".Now, it sounds all good, but the way the film delivered it was at most the pace of a snail. There was plenty of character development, and intermittent brief tales of each individual, but the entire first hour is made up of this, with only one gun battle in the start, occasional fist fights and one or two, here-and-there murders. The film did not even feel like a western, more like a soap opera as the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" deal with their delusions of obsessive gambling and alcohol intakes, and their lust for using their testosterone. When the first hour ends, the REAL story kicks in with the famous ""shootout at the OK Carrol"".Henceforth comes the gun battles and merciless killing. The action though did not have the exciting camera angles that Sergio Leone had in ""The Good, Bad, and the Ugly"", nor did it have an uplifting score as ""The Magnificent Seven"". The action sequences were very stiff and bland, lacking creativity and thrills. Even the ""Ok Corral"" sequence was a bit dull and long lasting, in which only three guys were killed in, when it looked like a dozen or so were shot. The violence in this film was brutal and cold-blooded like Spielberg's Schindler's List. Perhaps the director wanted to make a more realistic look at the film (since it was based on a true story), but even by that time, I was numb from sleepiness. Unforgiven did not have as much action, but it flew by! What's up with that?The acting: It was very good. Val Kilmer gave quite a performance as Doc Holliday, with his one-liner clichés, deep philosophy of life, and armed with his two pistols. Kurt Russel was also very decent as the hero who is drawn between what to do right, and what to do for himself. He performed a very ambivalent character. The other actors were great too, even the villains who were both laughable and insane.Overall: The film had good characters and a decent story, but it lacked the pace. With this movie, do not expect much action till the second half of the film. Critics call this the ""last great western"", but that's one fat lie. When I mean it lacked the ""western soul"" I mean it lacked the the thrilling action, the music, and the adventurous pace and story. Because of this, it did not feel like a western, at least to me. This is possible, since I'm old-fashioned when it comes to a western film (good vs. bad, saving the damsel in distress stuff). Basically, it does not follow ""the traditional western."" It is an okay film, but it lacks the speed and proper soul of a western. I had to give it some credit since it was based off of true events. 3/5",Tombstone

They, along with Morgan (Bill Paxton) and Virgil (Sam Elliott), come to the mining town of Tombstone to seek their fortune.  Instead, however, they wind up becoming not only gamblers but making a return as lawmen when the ruthless gang known as the Cowboys, led by the perpetually drunk Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang), turn the dusty streets of Tombstone red with the blood of innocent people.

CORRAL, HOUR OF THE GUN), sticks pretty close to the facts (**SPOILER**: the real shootout at the O.K. Corral lasted only about forty seconds, and the film is dead-on in accurately recreating that).  TOMBSTONE is further boosted by Dana Delany's efficient performance as Wyatt's future wife Josephine Marks, the excellent Bruce Broughton score, and the expansive cinematography from master cameraman William Fraker (BULLITT, ROSEMARY'S BABY).TOMBSTONE proves that there is still life to be had in the western genre; it is a shame that Hollywood seems to have forgotten that.",Tombstone
82,Bogmeister,Earps & Doc vs.Mean Cowboys as early Organized Crime,8,26 May 2006,"A late entry in the western genre when already not too many were being made, this is one of those re-watchable mini-epics, with strong entertainment value. It begins with a bang, an intense shoot-out after some supposedly historical footage narrated by actor Mitchum. We are introduced to The Cowboys, this era's version of the Mafia, led by the charismatic Curly Bill (Boothe). These first few minutes manage to unnerve and surprise the audience right away: we are also introduced to the psychotic gunslinger, Ringo (Biehn), but he's revealed as the most dangerous of the bunch only after the shoot-out, a sleight of hand by the filmmakers - they made him look sympathetic in those early moments while everyone is blasting away and he just stands there looking dazed and bothered. Only afterward do we realize he's a lethal lunatic of the damned - it's a powerful beginning.It's amazing how well this film turned out considering all the rumors of a troubled history. Credit must be given to director Cosmatos and the actors. It's a fairly huge cast, with numerous speaking roles, and everyone seems to have at least one good moment during the story. Then there's Kilmer as Doc, who is good or great in every scene he's in - this is easily Kilmer's best role. Doc is already sick as the movie begins but he manages to stay in the game to the very end, more dangerous than any 2 cowboys, using supernatural willpower & sardonic wit to distract everyone and himself from the fact he's nearly a walking ghost. Russell is just super-solid as Wyatt; he conveys a strength, tapped from unknown sources (whereas Doc draws from within), standing tall when other tough guys quake in the knees. These two make a terrific team; it's not the usual buddy stuff of most pictures. All the supporting cast is fine, including Elliott and Paxton as Wyatt's brothers, though there are some overly obvious moments. Earp's on - off relationship with the actress (Delany) has its ups & downs, there's not much room for subtlety as Earp's wife looks on quite upset as Delany strikes another of her bemused expressions. Also, due to the large number of characters, some of their stories have a heavily truncated feel (Priestley's, for example). The Vista director's cut special edition DVD has some restored footage to improve this problem. The better scenes are the confrontations between the men, the threats swung high & low, and the sheer thrill of watching Russell slap an overweight Billy Bob Thornton silly.And we have the villains, ah yes, the villains. I've already mentioned a couple of them - another one is Lang as Ike Clanton in a deliciously cheesy, hammy yet mesmerizing performance. By the last 3rd of the movie, I was so wishing he would get his - please, someone - Earp, Holliday, anyone ! - blow this bastard away! Ike is one of the great unsung villains of movie history, a tribute to Lang's abilities. The conflict in this true-life story stemmed from the notion that there were no real villains. It was a matter of which faction had the rights, based on gun power and political ambition. In other words, the Earps were just making a political power play in the view of some and there was little difference between them and The Cowboys. But this film wastes no time in establishing Wyatt and his brothers as the decent side of the coin and when you have characters like Ike, there's no mistaking which side are the bad guys. For a different take on this piece of history, check out the original Star Trek episode ""Spectre of the Gun"" from '68. Oh yeah, there are also other films like the Lancaster - Douglas opus from 1957. But the Gunfight at the OK Corral in ""Tombstone"" was just one set piece out of many.",Tombstone
83,OriginalMovieBuff21,A neat western flick,8,28 July 2005,"Tombstone was a pretty enjoyable movie. I went to a friends house and at night we put in Tombstone. He said it was one of his favorite movies and said it was amazing so I kind of wanted to watch it. I'm not really in to western films actually and it is probably the least cared about genre to me but Tombstone was a good movie. The performances were all top-notch especially Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. He put a lot of laughs in his performance and is accent was cool. The entertainment for Tombstone was very high and I thought before I watched the movie that I would fall asleep before it ended but I wasn't really bored once. Overall, I thought the movie was enjoyable and that's all there is to it. I recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 7.5/10 *** B-",Tombstone
84,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: a little slow, more a drama than action",7,6 September 2002,"OK, let me admit it up front. I'm an action movie guy, and I don't have a lot of patience for dramas. It isn't that I'm anti-intellectual. I just don't have the art school training to appreciate some of the subtleties if the main storyline is slow or melancholy.That's how I found Tombstone: a fascinating true story that was just a little too slow for me. There was amazing acting, especially by Val Kilmer, but I guess I wish they'd spent a little less time on the backstory of the heroes. For anyone who thinks a true to life story can't be made more gripping, check out ""October Sky"", which is a true story about some kid who builds rockets -- but it is Fascinating with a capital F. Same with Almost Famous and Apollo 13.Who should see this film:-- drama types, go for it-- western lovers, most definitely-- action movie buffs, but only on a rainy day unless you have a western or historical interestI'll give Tombstone a solid but not impressive 6 out of 10.",Tombstone
85,oOoBarracuda,"""I'm your huckleberry""",7,7 December 2015,"Tombstone tells the story of an aging Wyatt Earp who seeks to settle down and create some roots in Tombstone, Arizona. He is committed to changing his ways of womanizing and scuffling, in hopes of maintaining a business and a peaceful life. When you lie with dogs, however, you are unlikely to avoid getting fleas. With his gang of rascals helmed by Doc Holliday, trouble mounts. Holliday, much less committed to Earp's draw to a peaceful life seeks as much pleasure as possible, while enjoying life to the fullest. Earp's troubles go well beyond the confines of his own gang. Soon after arriving in Tombstone, Earp realizes that the cowboys that have run this town, and the law, are not willing to back down from their land without a fight. Another bright spot to Tombstone is a Miss Josephine Marcus, actress in the local theater who takes no time noticing Wyatt Earp, even though Earp tries to take his time noticing Miss Marcus. This love interest proves vital for Earp, as Josephine shows Wyatt how to seek and gain something from life, and how to enjoy it. Under attack, and unwilling to be scared away, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and the rest of the gang set out to prove that the west is left to be won for anyone. Technically, this movie is a stunning success! Set against the sometimes mountainous, sometimes open plains of the Old West, each shot is a miniature piece of art that comes together to create a magnificent mural. This film also reached outside of the box (pun intended) and minimized the screen to remind the viewer of the stretched screen format in which many classic westerns were watched on. This nod proved useful to establishing the authenticity of a western filmed in the modern day. Also essential to providing the western flair that the audience expects was the multiple extreme close-up shots of faces dispersed throughout the film. These shots help set the tone, and the mood of each character by blocking out all other visual stimuli, oftentimes leaving only the eyes visible to the viewer. Not only did this camera work set the gritty western tone, but it added benefit of seeing the character as they were going through their struggles. Tombstone proves to be an exceptionally acted ensemble piece. Anytime you have a film composed of about 30 main actors, the likelihood of one character upstaging another or one character disappearing into the background proves great. In this film, however, this problem never occurred. Each actor had at least one moment in which their character shines, and their acting is noticed. For me, the standout was Val Kilmer. It is unfortunate for Val Kilmer that what turned out to be, possibly the best performance of his career happened in a year stacked with masterpiece performances of supporting actors. When you watch Kilmer's Doc Holliday, and you watch both his health deteriorate and his drunken stupor, you see a depth to the actor that I, for one, did not know was there. When immersed in the film, it is easy to immediately state that he should have taken home a statuette that year from the dear Academy. Then, when you remember that was also the year of honoring work like The Schindler's List, you remember Ralph Fiennes' performance snub. Kilmer's acting in this film is the pinnacle of his career, and he should have certainly, at least, been nominated for it. An all-star cast came together for Tombstone and it will not disappoint. A stellar ensemble performance, wonderfully casted, and a beautiful backdrop proves Tombstone a western force to be reckoned with.",Tombstone
86,romanorum1,A Throwback to the Greatest Westerns of All Time,9,26 August 2016,"The opening narration by Robert Mitchum is told among scenes from several early silent features: ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903) and ""The Bank Robbery"" (1908). The narrator further states that the discovery of silver created the boom-town of Tombstone (1879). A large gang of ruthless outlaws, led by psychopaths Curly Bill Brocius (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn), ride hard at a Mexican wedding party and thoroughly destroy it. An incensed priest warns them about the ominous signs of the apocalypse: vengeful men riding on horseback. He is abruptly gunned down by Ringo. Only a few months after rowdy Tombstone's founding, three Earp Brothers (Wyatt = Kurt Russell, Virgil = Sam Elliott, and Morgan = Bill Paxton) arrive with their three wives (Mattie, Allie, Louisa) to settle down and make money. We do not hear about brothers James or Warren, even though they were there in the 1880s; James was a saloon-keeper not involved in the politics. Tombstone is typically western in that saloons and gambling establishments thrive. Confidence men check out the Earps as they disembark from wagons. County Sheriff Behan (Jon Tenney) introduces himself; the Earps also meet town marshal Fred White (Harry Carey, Jr.). After that, Wyatt enters the Oriental to confront bully Johnny Tyler (Billy Bob Thorton), who had seized the gaming table. By disposing of the coward, Wyatt obtains 25% of the faro take. Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), an old friend who has pneumonia, turns up to renew his old acquaintances. Entering town by stagecoach is actress Josephine Marcus (Dana Delaney) and her small acting troupe. Over time Josephine will replace laudanum-drinking Mattie as Wyatt's wife. At the Oriental gaming table, Wyatt and Doc make the acquaintance of Curly Bill, Johnny Ringo, and Ike Clanton (Stephan Lang). Ike warns Wyatt that the Cowboys dislike lawmen; Wyatt, though, is ""retired""; he had been a noted peace officer in Dodge City, Kansas. Curly Bill wins $500 and walks away happy, although Doc and Ringo eye each other. Leaving an opium den, Curly Bill is of unsound mind and fires his weapons against town regulations; eventually he murders Marshal Fred White while corrupt Sheriff Behan does nothing. The mayor wants Wyatt to be town marshal but he initially refuses. Later Wyatt becomes a lawman, along with his two brothers. Meanwhile some outlaw cowboys pull into town armed. The Earps deploy to disarm the cowboys, an action that sets up the famous shootout at the OK Corral (26 Oct 1881). When the smoke clears, two McLaury Brothers and Billy Clanton (Thomas Haden Church) are dead; Virgil, Morgan, and Doc are wounded. Billy Clairborne (Wyatt Earp III) and Ike Clanton have run away. Actually Ike did not shoot at the Earps from Fly's studio; he simply ran towards the stables. Unsuccessfully, Behan tries to arrest the Earps. ""Tombstone"" is unique in that it covers six months after the OK Corral gunfight. Because of the shootout, the cowboys commence cowardly acts of vengeance. They hold a funeral for their dead comrades, carrying a sign that reads ""Murdered on the Streets of Tombstone."" On a subsequent stormy night, Virgil is ambushed by some cowboys; resulting in a buckshot-shattered left arm. After (actually three months later), Morgan is shot in the back while playing pool; he lives only a few minutes before expiring. Wyatt decides it is time to send Virgil, Allie, and Louisa to California. Curly Bill sends Frank Stillwell (Tomas Arana) to the train station to wipe out the remaining Earps. Stillwell, however, is shot to death by Wyatt, who now becomes a renegade for his vengeful action. The rest of the movie focuses on the Earp Vendetta (1882). This was a federal posse that included ""Texas Jack"" John Vermillion (Peter Sherayko), ""Turkey Creek"" Jack Johnson (Buck Taylor), Sherman McMasters (Michael Rooker), Warren Earp (although Warren was not in the movie), and Wyatt. These are the men of the apocalypse, the earlier warning of the priest. Cowboys are shot to death on site, whether on the plains, in the woods, at an opium den, or in a barber shop. It's not easy, though. Once, Wyatt's band is trapped in a crossfire by Curly Bill and some cohorts at Iron Springs. Wyatt bravely extricates himself and runs towards the cowboys, blazing away, and killing Curly Bill. Doc says Wyatt walks on water. (It is an historical fact that Wyatt was never wounded in any of his gun battles.)Although Sheriff Behan forms a posse (that included outlaw cowboys) to arrest Wyatt, he never locates him. Wyatt's band rests at the ranch of sympathetic Henry Hooker (Charlton Heston). Ringo sends a message challenging Earp to come to the Oak Grove (Silver Springs), but Doc Holliday arrives first and challenges Ringo, who is slain. The remaining gang-members are systematically wiped out. Ike survives (only to be killed later while rustling cattle). After the vendetta is over, a dying Doc has checked himself into a Colorado sanitarium. On his deathbed he has converted to the Roman Catholic faith. (Doc actually lived longer, until 1888.)In snowy Colorado, Wyatt visits Josephine and proposes, even though he owns nothing. Josephine says she comes from a rich family. The narrator tells us that they lived together for 47 years; Wyatt died in 1929. Two of his funeral pall bearers were silent screen cowboys William S. Hart and Tom Mix. Credits appear at movie's end. Director George P. Cosmatos has created a vastly underrated western. The photography magnificently pictures the grandeur of the West, like its sunsets. Notice the interior of the telegraph office at the beginning, the ornate bar of the Oriental, or the candle-lighting around the actors' stage. The sets are authentic, even finer details like clothing, wallpaper, saddles, and pistols of the 1880s. The exception is the red sashes, which appear solely for Cowboy identification. There are 85 speaking parts and characters are well-developed. This might have been the best western since the 1970s.",Tombstone
87,moviemanMA,Justice is now in session...,7,21 August 2005,"When you think of the 'Wild, Wild West', saloons, sheriffs, shoot-outs, and cowboys are some of the things you might think of as essential to painting a portrait of the old west. Well, this movie shows just that, but not in a cheesy, run of the mill sort of way. This is the story of Tombstone.Tombstone stars Kurt Russell as the legendary Wyatt Earp, the U.S. Marshall known for 'keeping the peace'. He and his two brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) decide to head out to the town of Tombstone. It's a place where you can make it rich and quick, too. Wyatt decides to grab a share of the local saloon/casino called The Oriental. Making all of this money and having a good time is all they want to think about. They just want to leave they're past behind them. Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer) wants to do the same thing. With his lung condition worsening, he is trying to live life to the fullest...that is gambling, drinking, smoking, and doing his ""marital duties"" with his wife Kate. A traveling group of actors and performers roll into town put on a show for Tombstone. Josephine Marcus (Dana Delaney) and Mr. Fabian (Billy Zane) sweep the town off of their feet with their charm and talents. Josephine is attracted to Wyatt's ruggedness and mystery. Wyatt tries not to be tempted even though his drug addicted girl friend doesn't help his cause much. With all of this going on in Tombstone it seems like it will be easy sailing for Wyatt and his crew...until they have a run in with the Cowboys.Led by Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), this gang has been terrorizing the west for a number of years. They are the law in the town of Tombstone. They influence everything from the sheriff to the saloons. When the local marshal is shot by Curly Bill, Wyatt locks him up this is when the cowboys start to make trouble. Virgil and Morgan soon sign up as the new Sheriff's in town and Wyatt doesn't want any part of it. Doc has become enemies with one of the quickest and skilled guns in the west named Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). When Wyatt is forced into help keep the peace, there is the showdown at the O.K. Carral that would just become more of the legend of Wyatt Earp and his band of law men.Tombstone is a great film with a lot of action, drama, and even some comedic moments. The screenplay is fantastic with Wyatt Doc having some great conversations. Russell, Kilmer, Elliott, and Paxton all give good performances. Kilmer especially shows his range as an actor with his charm and charisma not scene in this way before. The ailing Doc Holiday is an interesting character to portray and Kilmer nails it. Along with Doc, Wyatt couldn't be just another law enforcer. He had to have a soft side and a mean streak as well. Russell give Wyatt a feeling of accomplishment, like he has done what he has set out to do. But when things go wrong, he is the first one you want on your side.Fans of westerns, have no fear because Tombstone is hear! This magnificent film is worth more than one viewing and I'm sure you'll agree.",Tombstone

89,Flagrant-Baronessa,Epic blockbuster that gets many things right,7,8 November 2006,"Tombstone is arguably one of the more 'accessible' Westerns  a readily-molded popcorn flick that serves plenty of action, emotion and fun. Former hard-boiled lawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), his two brothers and his tuberculosis-infected friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) move westward and settle in the town Tombstone to retire and lead the profitable good life. This is grossly undermined by a band of outlawed cowboys who stir up a conflict with the authority.First let me say that the occasional shortcomings that 'Tombstone' has are what makes it a good film in the first place. To put it bluntly, it is a mish-mash of old 'harder' Westerns that has been filtered through Hollywood producers and softened up to a shameless blockbuster calibre. From the dramatic musical crescendo and the damsels in distress to the wide-ranging extended cameos by a big high-profile cast  it's accessible and fun and it makes no pretense about it. It is also so far into the Western genre with the dusty outback, the moustaches, the tense duel looks, the relentless alcohol-chugging and gunslinging characters that is almost tips over into camp territory.The good news is that Tombstone never quite slips that far and instead remains not only afloat but periodically extremely entertaining. At all other times, it manages solid fun. As said, hard-boiled graphic gore is kept to a relative minimum in the film which undoubtedly only makes its infrequency all the more effective. The acing is also top-notch  if a little theatric, but hey, it's Western  Russell and the others crisply retain an emotional transparency throughout and the prevalence of emotionally-charged looks among them is particularly impressive. In the ultimate showdown (that spans across the entire movie) between law-men and outlaws, the key word is tension, and Tombstone aptly plays upon the former at all times.7 out of 10",Tombstone
90,MovieCriticOnline,Worth it,6,17 January 2021,"Comparing Tombstone with Wyatt Earp (Costner) they are two totally different movies that were released around the same time. Tombstone focuses on an event in Tombstone, Earp focuses on Wyatt's life from boy to man. Because of the latter there is a bit more emotional investment in the characters, rather than a plot, which to me is always better.Tombstone is filled too much with exposition. In Earp they took an hour to introduce characters and build the story. Tombstone introduces all the characters within 10 minutes, which felt rushed. Every second a new name was spoken out loud to introduce them. Earp was not without its problems, but I think at the end of the day Tombstone is the inferior movie. When we see Matti we are immediately shown she is already poisoning herself (within first 10 min), unlike in Earp it was slowly introduced over time. Both films suffer from the Hollywood formula, but at least it's the old Hollywood, which does work on some level unlike today where it's mostly all CGI, action and the cliffnote version of characters and relationship.Some of my criticism would be if you make a movie called Tombstone where the main focus is on the shootout don't meander into long side stories like love stories unless that IS the focus of the film, which it wasn't here. Dana Delany was miscast as the seductive maverick Josie.In other words, Tombstone struggled between wanting to make personal bio and a plot driven event at the OK Corral. Earp (Costner) stuck to the bio which made it more focused. And although Tombstone did distinguish itself by focusing on the villains too, they showed them as one dimensional bad guys, which is a lazy way to treat characters.At the end I think it's fine to build some love story so we care, but I think it should have been between the brothers not Earp and Josie. And I think the feud between the Earps and the outlaws seemed weak, rushed and forced. In summary I had more, though not many, cringe moment during Tombstone than Earp.Like Earp this also felt a notch above a TV movie. The music was too much and too forced.Nevertheless, it is worth watching..",Tombstone
91,SkullScreamerReturns,Very good western with Russell and Kilmer,8,16 October 2021,"I watch both this one and ""Wyatt Earp"" because I wanted to compare them. Latter was more epic and adventure-styled, also a bit more inconsistent because it deals with such long time period. ""Tombstone"" on the other hand is more tight because it tells only the story of Earp's later days and his last fights.It's been a few weeks since I watched it so I've already forgotten what was I going to say but what has stayed is that it was a thoroughly good western film with great cast. Kurt Russell is an excellent Wyatt, and Val Kilmer equally great Doc Holliday - maybe the best performance I've seen from him.

92,emperor_bender,Not bad for a modern Western,8,18 February 2008,"I will first come out and say it, I'm not a huge Western fan. I don't watch John Wayne or anything like that. Not to say I don't like the Western lifestyle and all of that, but the movies always seem to fall short somewhere. But not Tombstone. Tombstone managed to keep my attention. Kurt Russell(Wyatt Earp), Sam Elliot (Virgil Earp) and Bill Paxton (Morgan Earp) are 3 actors I always like in movies, so that automatically had me interested. Powers Boothe was great in Red Dawn and Sin City, so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed when he played Curly Bill Brocious. Michael Biehn was always good, so I knew Johnny Ringo would be played well. Michael Rooker surprised me by playing Sherman McMasters so well (although he wasn't in the movie all that long). Even Billy Bob Thornton opened my eyes as Johnny Tyler, the sleazy poker dealer (again, only in the movie briefly). It wasn't a bunch of city-slicker big name actors standing around bored talking with terrible western fake accents, shooting and cussing at everyone. This was actually a movie I could follow and enjoy. The gunfights were authentic, the tension was realistic, and the whole movie felt...well...real. However, there were some parts I feel were overdone. Wyatt seemed a little cocky at times. I didn't like John Behan's character either, he was pretty improbable, how he was everywhere disaster struck but always manage to get out alive. Still, good movie. 8/10.

97,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Action-Packed Western Classic And One Of The Greatest Westerns Of All Time With Brilliant Performances From Kurt Russell And Val Klimer.",10,2 July 2013,"Tombstone is easily one of the greatest Western films of all time and an unforgettable classic that is filled with great direction,wonderful cast,fantastic Action,well-written screenplay and an amazing score and is not only one of my favorite Westerns of all time but one of my favorite films of all time.Set in Tombstone,Arizona in 1881,Tombstone tells the story of Wyatt Earp(Kurt Russell),a lawman who recently retired who along with his two brothers Virgil Earp(Sam Elliot)and Morgan Earp(Bill Paxton)and their wives decide to start a new life in Tombstone. But Wyatt's plans to settle down and retire are ruined when Wyatt and his brothers have to deal with an outlaw gang called The Cowboys who want the Earps blood. Now with the help of their friend Doc Holliday(Val Kilmer),the Earps and Doc look to destroy The Cowboys at all costs.In 1993 and 1994 there were two Western films made about Western legend Wyatt Earp George P. Cosmatos' Tombstone in 1993 and Lawrence Kadsen's Wyatt Earp which came out a year later. Where as Tombstone was an intense Action film about the events that took place before and after the Gunfight At The O.K Corral,Wyatt Earp was an epic biopic about the man Wyatt Earp and while Wyatt Earp is a good film in it's own right Tombstone is just a better and fully realized film. Tombstone is just an excellent film from beginning to end and is one of those films when you turn on Tombstone you just never turn it off and you are glued to the screen. There have been many films about Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday and The Gunfight At The O.K Corral but Tombstone is a film that stands out and is in a league of it's own because while Tombstone is based on real characters and historical events the movie is a thrill ride that has memorable characters and tension like a tightrope and never lets the viewer go until the end. What I also love about Tombstone and the Western genre in general is that TS brings into the world of the Old West and shows viewers how the West really was where Lawman enforced the laws and Outlaws broke them and blood was spilled into the dust and dirt. The Western atmosphere is accurate and very realistic and comes off the screen. The portrayals of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday are great and is some of the best depictions of Wyatt and Doc ever put on the screen. In Tombstone Wyatt Earp is depicted as some one who cares about his family and friends and doesn't want to get involved or participate with the violence and uncontrolled chaos that is happening in Tombstone but at the same time Wyatt is tough,heroic and takes crap from no one whether it's The Cowboys or strangers on the street. In Tombstone Doc Holliday is a character who gambles and uses his guns as well as smarts and charisma to get out situations and when he's in a conversation. Doc is a character you will love as soon as he comes on screen. I also loved the friendship between Wyatt and Doc because it feels real and truthful and when you watch the film you can tell that Wyatt and Doc really care about one another and that their friendship is honest. The film's screenplay by Kevin Jarre is great and well-written,with Jarre's script giving the main characters fantastic dialog and great,memorable scenes that will stay with the viewer after the film is over. The Action scenes in Tombstone are amazing and intense with wonderful Western gunfights and is done with great build up wonderful tension and white hot suspense especially The Gunfight At The O.K Correl scene. The build up to The Gunfight At The O.K Correl is unforgettable and when the classic Gunfight happens it explodes like a bomb and is done in a rapid fire quickness and you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. The Gunfight At The O.K Correl in this film is one of the best Action movie gunfights in film history and will be remembered forever. The ending of the film is wonderful and will leave you sad and happy and is a great cap off to Tombstone.The whole cast is wonderful. Kurt Russell is excellent and at his best as Wyatt Earp,with Russell bringing grit,toughness and depth to the role and is truly memorable. Val Kilmer gives a brilliant,unforgettable Oscar worthy iconic scene stealing performance as Doc Holliday,with Kilmer bringing coolness,charisma,great dialog and humor to the role. Kilmer's performance is masterful and will stick with you. Sam Elliot(Virgil Earp) and Bill Paxton(Morgan Earp)give great performances as Wyatt's brothers. Powers Booth(Curly Bill Brocius),Michael Biehn(Johnny Ringo)and Stephen Lang(Ike Clanton)give fantastic performances as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Dana Delany is great and beautiful as Josephine Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Jon Tenney is wonderful as Behan,a corrupt County Sheriff. Also,lookout for appearances from Charlton Heston(Henry Rooker),Michael Rooker(Sherman McMasters),Harry Carey Jr.(Marshel Fred White),Thomas Haden Church(Billy Clanton),Billy Bob Thorton(Johnny Tyler),Robert Burke(Frank McLaury),Joanna Pucula(Kate),Billy Zane(Mr. Fabian),Jason Priestly(Billy Breckinridge),Dana Wheeler-Nicholson(Mattie Earp),Terry O'Quinn(Mayor John Clum),John Corbett(Barnes),Pedro Armendariz Jr.(Priest)and Sly's younger brother Frank Stallone(Ed Bailey).The direction by George P. Cosmatos is excellent,with Cosmatos bringing an big,epic scope to the film and making the West look beautiful and glorious and wonderful shots of the sunlight and sky while Cosmatos also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Cosmatos.The score by Bruce Broughton is brilliant,epic,tragic and intense and matches the tone of the film and each scene. Great powerful score by Broughton.In final word,if you love Western films,Action films or films in general I highly suggest you see Tombstone,one of the best Westerns films of all time and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Tombstone
98,bluesman-20,Hell comes to Tombstone.,10,8 September 2012,As many others pointed out. Tombstone is the definitive Wyatt Earp film. In some cases it's historically accurate. And in some cases it's not so accurate but who cares ? The real movie is Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday. It helps that they had the good sense to bring Sam Elliot on board as well. Elliot is The Western actor to turn to since John Wayne died.Tombstone tries to tell the Story of the Gunfight at the O.K.. Corrall. The Events leading up to it and the events after.Russell steals the film as Wyatt Earp making a classic portrayal of a classic historical figure. And Yet Val Kilmer becomes the whole show for his portrayal of the doomed yet honourable Doc.I saw it when it came out in the theatre. And I watch it every now and then and I'm always amazed by how well a job they did. Always worth seeing just for the incredible acting of Val Kilmer. And always worth seeing Kurt Russell making Wyatt Earp a little bit more human.,Tombstone
99,The_Wood,Solid American Western 9/10,9,31 March 2002,"One of the best modern Westerns -- not too surprising, since the genre is almost nonexistent in this day and age.  Val Kilmer is DOC HOLLIDAY, giving the best performance of his career to date.  Kurt Russel, as usual, is able to carry the film.Sometimes the dialogue is less then impressive -- but Tombstone is an enjoyable Western, with it's share of violence and heroism.",Tombstone
100,werefox08,Western Non-sense.............For Children ?,3,9 December 2012,"Tombstone is a ""good looking movie"""". That is one of the few reasons you should watch it. It is about 1% historically accurate. The story is absurd. The script is weak. The acting is poor. Val Kilmer is hysterically funny with his ridiculous ""camped up"" version of Doc Holliday. He should have won the razz in 1993 (he was robbed). Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) tries too hard to be cool, and wearing his whiter than white shirts is highly amusing. I was not there, but I can assure you...the West was not like this...Tombstone was not a ""cosmopolitan American Town"". The story of Wyatt Earp, Tombstone, The O.K. corral, Etc. was nothing like this. Maybe this was made for young teenagers...Or maybe this is just a bad movie.",Tombstone
101,Panamint,What a ride......,8,16 November 2006,"A very good movie, well made action and with fine adult psychological aspects.The law was what you made it. Hard to believe, but this was western America in the 1880's. Equally unbelievable to us nowadays is the fact that Earp's ride of vengeance really happened, but it did.Outstanding performance by Russell. He nails Earp, and is the only actor to portray a sense of the personal charisma that Earp apparently had in real life. Kilmer is also good. He delivers a very watchable, outlandish and complex portrait of Doc Holliday that, like Russell, portrays a sense of who his character probably really was. Kilmer's and Russell's acting styles are so different that they interestingly show what a true odd couple these two historical characters were.Powers Boothe portrays crazy, wild badness as the insane Curly Bill. A fine performance that provides a glimpse at one of the types of unrestrained humanity that were roaring across the western landscape in the 19th century. The other supporting actors also do a good job as they portray the good, the bad, and the ugly aspects of human nature.The director and actors have probably been to the real Tombstone, Arizona and have researched the subject matter. This is arguably the best of the Tombstone/Earp era movies. It is the only Tombstone/Earp movie you will ever need to see, but anyone who is not a western buff will also be entertained by these remarkable performances.",Tombstone
102,chubarova,Amazing western.,9,31 May 2020,"This film is awesome. Firstly, the plot is great, it is based on real story that happens in the second half of 19th century, in the USA. It has a lot of guns, shooting and murders. Secondly, the cast is the best part of the film. Kurt Russell is great, he plays a man, who wants quite life but he can't live without adventures. I think, Doc is the best role of Val Kilmer, he looks awesome.
So, it's great western.",Tombstone
103,roland-104,"Too few good turns, too few good moments, in this long, long film",5,19 November 2005,"The Earp brothers take on the Clanton gang, redux, in this muddled, overly long remake of ""Gunfight at the OK Corral."" The classical themes of old west lawlessness and threat of death are well displayed, but intruding upon these is an updated psychologizing theme that seems out of place as well as boring.Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp spends a lot of time staring blandly into space. He is dignified, give him that. But he looks too much like a preacher and not enough like a killer with a badge. Burt Lancaster was better cast. Ditto for the Clanton gang, all tricked out here with red sashes, like some step dance troupe. Give me John Ireland and Dennis Hopper  both were Clantons in ""Gunfight"" - any day over the acting ensemble playing at bad guys here.On the plus side, Val Kilmer is superb as the dying, mannerly Doc Holliday, way better than the perpetual ham, Kirk Douglas. And Sam Elliott is picture perfect here as Wyatt's brother Virgil. There were production problems on this film. Cosmatos was brought in to direct a month before the shoot, after Kevin Jarre, the screenwriter, who was supposed to make his directing debut here, was sacked. And Jarre's screenplay is dull, too inactive, too long, especially the second hour. (Gunfight, on the other hand, moved well and was written in part by the great action novelist, Leon Uris.) My rating: 5/10 (C). (Last seen on 11/12/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.",Tombstone
104,Hancock_the_Superb,"Fun, Unpretentious Western",8,1 May 2006,"The story of Wyatt Earp has been told innumerable times in cinema. In the old days, Earp, the marshal who tamed Dodge City, Abilene, and Tombstone, among others, always represented the good and virtuous lawman who defended the downtrodden and was quick on the draw - in short, the archetypal Western hero - accompanied by the drunken, philosophical, tubercular Doc Holliday, and his brothers Virgil and Morgan. Every movie about the Earps seem to center (and with some good reason) on their conflicts in Tombstone with the Cowboys, a gang of vicious cutthroats led by the Clantons, McLoweries, Curly Bill Brocious, Johnny Ringo, and a bunch of others, which resulted in the mythic gunfight at the OK Corral and the lesser-known series of vendettas which left one Earp and most of the above outlaws dead. In 1993/4, both ""Tombstone"" and ""Wyatt Earp"" would present this traditional hero in a darker, more critical light, changing from a heroic superman to a flawed man who more often than not was a cold-blooded murderer.The point is, this story's been done to death. There isn't really much you can add to a story that's been filmed dozens of times, or a character that has been played by Randolph Scott, Henry Fonda, James Stewart, James Garner, Burt Lancaster, and many, many others. So, the creators of ""Tombstone"" and ""Wyatt Earp"" deserve credit for trying to take this oft-told legend in different directions. It's a shame that the two films had to be released almost simultaneously, resulting in inevitable comparisons.""Tombstone"" is easily the more accessible of the two. While ""Wyatt Earp"" tries to be an epic a la ""How The West Was Won"" and ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", showing Earp's entire life, ""Tombstone"" is a simple, unpretentious action Western full of slam-bang shootouts and loads of clichés. It's hard to say that either film is really better than the other, as they are two different types of film altogether, but ""Tombstone"" is easily the more enjoyable.The movie centers on the Earps' troubles in Tombstone and after. The movie at times seems a very simplistic black-versus-white movie, with sneeringly evil baddies as personified by Powers Boothe (Curly Bill), Stephen Lang (Ike Clanton), and Michael Biehn (Johnny Ringo), while the Earps - Wyatt (Kurt Russell), Morgan (Bill Paxton), and Virgil (the always-great Sam Elliot), plus Doc (Val Kilmer) - are the good guys, albeit with a tainted past. No sooner do the Earps come into town then trouble starts. The villains are sneeringly evil caricatures, the Earps paragons of virtue. If you don't like old-fashioned Westerns, then the first hour might make you sick - particularly Wyatt's extramarital affair with the lovely actress Josephine (Dana Delaney).However, the second half of the film does show Wyatt in a darker light; after Morgan is assassinated and Virgil wounded by the Cowboys, Wyatt and Doc are deputized by the US Marshal, and a long with a few others go on a vicious rampage from which no one is safe. This sequence of the film is by far the most effective; an exciting montage of action ranging from shootouts to just plain murders.The movie isn't exactly a deep film; it's very highly stylized and does have its moments of overt corniness (the slow-motion ""No!"" before Wyatt blasts Curly Bill, for instance). However, I don't really think that should be held against it. If you want depth in a film, don't come here.I do think that Kurt Russell has to be on the lower-tier of screen Earps. Despite physical resemblance, Russell never really convinces as the tough guy Earp was, and at times even comes across as a loser. On the other hand, Paxton and the always-reliable Elliot pick up the slack, though Val Kilmer's brilliant turn as Doc steals the show. I won't add any more to the sea of compliments on Kilmer's performance, except to say that he really DOES look like he was dying of TB. Boothe, Lang, and Biehn scarf up the scenery and are a joy to watch while they're doing it. The supporting cast interestingly includes some soon-to-be-famous stars - Billy Zane, Terry O'Quinn, Billy Bob Thornton - in solid roles, and cameos by Western veterans Buck Taylor, Harry Carey Jr., and the legendary Charlton Heston add some class to the proceedings. The woman characters, unfortunately, are mostly caricatures. I wanted to like Dana Delaney as Josie, but her character was poor - don't know if it was the performance or the screenplay, but either way, I didn't really care for her.I give ""Tombstone"" an eight - instead of a seven - because, unlike the similar ""Silverado"", it didn't pretend to be anything more than it was - a fun action Western with an edge. There were many flaws, and it will never be featured on any ""Best Movies of All Time"" lists, but it's still a solid movie, much like ""The Untouchables"". Kevin Costner was the better Earp of 1993/4, but ""Tombstone"" is probably the better film.Eight stars.",Tombstone
105,buzznzipp1995,"No awards, just rewards to cinema patrons.",10,4 February 2007,"God bless George P Cosmatos. To anyone who is a fan of the old west genre, holy smokes!! This little piece of western history hit with a thunderous explosion. Tombstone, was in theaters around the time that Eastwood's-- ""Unforgiven"" was just heading out. That (Clint's western saga) won a lot of awards, but to my dismay, it seems as though ' they ' missed this one. To me this is what Oscars are made of . Steely-performances that bring the viewer to a place of awe. Simple. This film of the old west, that some will quibble about the fact that they didn't go into further detail on the lives and events that were part of each character here. Or that some of the facts were traded or missed all together in Tombstone. The director had set this western up and many others on their heels. Everybody mentions Val Kilmer in this as the incomparable 'Doc' Holiday. No doubt that he was indeed just that. But add to it the way that Russell and Elliot with Paxton were the brothers that fell right into cinematic place. They were picture- perfect in their places. Then you bring in Dana Delaney, who is made for this part of the love opposite Wyatt, feisty, smart, educated and beautiful. and Stephen Lang another 'Pro' in about anything he takes on. I think he has multiple acting-personalities, his range is as broad as lake Superior. From a confident Jewish Lawyer David Abrams in 'Crime Story' (1986-88) to a quivering voice scumbag criminal outlaw in this, he has all the talent and a few other actor's talents too! Along with him, Michael Biehn, who was prime as Ringo, oh yeah! Charlton Heston as ' Henry Hooker' the solid standing rancher, who aides 'Doc' in a time of trouble, to Powers Booth, as the smart-Aleck's, oddly likable but equally slimy instigator 'Curly Bill' . The guy you love to hate. There was many moments that were the blocks that built the story, the one in particular that seemed strangely authentic, was when Wyatt and Virgil (Russell and Elliot) walked with Allie and Mattie, from the train after meeting up, and stopped at that storefront window and stood there, as if posing for a portrait. Wyatt sort of directed them to take a moment and take a picture of it to remember in their mind. That was a pause for reality in this for me. This had both tragedy and hard fought victory. The Arizona sky and scenery was dreamy in some sequences and the camera crew and sound was top-notch. I still can't really say there is another 'West' picture that stimulates my senses better than Wyatt and the whole gang, with 'Doc' the wild huckleberry, at your service....The crew that played together in this film, helped make it a smash hit!! There are the other actors that took part as well, too many to list with the 'word' limit on IMDb, but, it was so good, you could feel it even after the movie was over! I highly and gladly recommend to western lovers and action movie seekers. Tombstone...Justice is coming.(*****)",Tombstone

107,cshep,Surrealistic Retelling of the Old West !,8,1 December 2004,"If you believe in fate, and Hollywoods endings that are completely detached from reality, then this feature is for you ! Kurt Russell shines as Wyatt Earp, retired law enforcement officers, with brothers Virgil(Sam Elliot) and Morgan(Bill Paxton). The gunfight at the OK Corral is dispatched midway of the movie, and then the real story begins.The Earp brothers relocate to Tombstone,AZ. This is where they encounter the ""Cowboys"" based on a real life group of thugs, they don't seem to like each other. So , after throwing a chubby faced Billy Bob Thornton out of a local gaming facility, Wyatt decides to run the establishment. ""Doc"" Holiday (Val Kilmer) steals the show as the sickly killer, with a sympathetic following. Wyatts ailing wife played by Dana Wheeler-Erickson, is a crutch to Wyatt, whose ambitions outweigh his sense of right and wrong. Enter Dana Delany , how convenient, another portal for Wyatt to take comfort in. As a matter of fact, the movie always has an answer for every situation! But the redeeming factors are the even pace, magnificent cinematography, and excellent acting ! Look for Jason Priestly in a throwaway role, and Charlton Heston in a cameo as a rancher. The movies basic philosophy is that might makes right !So if you are ready to suspend reality, a lot of killing , especially toward the end of the movie, and an unreal dance in the snow, by all means take the afternoon off, and see ""Tombstone"", not a great movie, but enjoyable fare with a Hollywood ending ! I give it a 7.5 for overall effort!",Tombstone

This great western has it all: a terrific cast, great dialog, deft directing, stunning cinematography, a wonderful music score, plenty of action and even narration by the great Robert Mitchum. At 129 minutes, it moves along swiftly with no unnecessary scenes or dragging. The cast, led by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer, are perfection, many turning in their greatest performances ever, especially Kilmer and Sam Elliott. I'm not a historian, but it seemed to me to be fairly accurate in its facts. Of all its pluses, I can't say enough about the cast. Powers Booth, Stephen Lang, Michael Biehn, Billy Bob Thornton and Thomas Haden Church all portray terrific villains, while Kilmer, Russell, Elliott, Harry Carey Jr., Buck Taylor, Bill Paxton, Charlton Heston, Billy Zane and Jason Priestley are solid as the good guys.

110,arthurclay,The best western since Silverado,10,1 May 2005,"Everyone knows the story of Wyatt Earp and the gunfight at O.K. Corral. This film covers the events before AND after that event with a beauty and ferocity that is rarely seen in westerns. Kurt Russell does well as Wyatt, Boothe as Curly Bill, Biehn as Johnny Ringo, but the real showman is Val Kilmer as the chronic killer ""Doc"" Holliday and turns in the best depiction of the gunslinger since Kirk Douglas. He is astounding. I think it was the best role he ever had and he makes the most of it. Kilmer makes you care about his character like no else can and his chemistry with Russell works like a charm. The casting was very good and the realism is unmatched. The gunfights are entertaining and keep your attention. There is tension and suspense in Tombstone like no other western you can feel it permeating the whole picture. Forget the movie ""Wyatt Earp"" with Kevin Costner this one knocks it out of the box rather easily. It's destined for classic status and is re-watchable which is unusual for most films being made today.",Tombstone
111,headhunter46,"A gritty, realistic portrayal of the old west",7,16 February 2006,This is a great western. Similar to the style of westerns I grew up with in the 1950's. Kurt Russell was convincingly deadly in his face down with a few who had it coming. Val Kilmer was both humorous and pathetic as the diseased and dieing Doc Holiday. I felt all of the actors were convincing and believable. This is certainly one of the better modern day westerns. Wyatt is portrayed as wanting to avoid being a lawman because he saw the risks as outweighing the benefits. It is others and circumstances that draw Wyatt into being a lawman and later he is incensed to the point of revenge bordering on lawless behavior himself. Dana Delaney provides an interesting distraction for our hero. The shootout is portrayed quite well and of course we know the outcome.,Tombstone

The romantic subplot is silly and carried off in a lighthearted manner reminiscent of corny '80s TV serials, but the worst thing is the villains. Though Earp does deliver some wrath upon their heads by the movie's end, we've already seen them act in too casual a manner, to the point where any threat they may have had is gone. Now it's just a bunch of guys shooting each other with no emotional kick for the viewer to really make him put his fist in the air and say, ""You get that son of a B!"" Mainstream types will gush all over this, which is what it was made for.

That said, the characters here couldn't be better, each one has their own distinct personality, they all have moments to shine and, most importantly, they are all superbly acted. Top honours in that category go, of course, to Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday. Simply one of the best characters ever to grace the screen, no more needs to be said. Kurt Russell also did a very good job as celebrated lawman Wyatt Earp. The supporting cast are great as well, but these two certainly stand out...especially Kilmer.I wont get in to how great the plot is so that I don't spoil it. I'll just leave it at this: it's an enthralling story that will keep you glued from beginning to end, surprise you at times, and even saves time to make you laugh. Very well written, very well played out. Even the music is great, which is something that I often overlook.In conclusion, I'm a huge western fan.

Among a uniformly good cast, Kurt Russell as Wyat Earp and Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday are particularly excellent.  In fact, I believe that Kilmer's antic Holiday was the best performance, among many fine performances, of his career.  The film's descriptions of how the men died who were thought to have been responsible for the death of Morgan Earp and the maiming of Virgil Earp are uniformly ludicrous but, what the heck, this is Hollywood.

I never tire of watching him slap Billy Bob Thornton around before stealing his game of Pharoah (whatever that is?) Great ensemble cast, powerful story, and fantastic action. Val Kilmer deserved recognition for his portrayal of Doc Holliday...the humor is biting. The story only suffers from occasional intrusions by wives, Shakespearean actors, and Wyatt's love interest.

121,DeuceWild_77,"Very good, but could have been great. Kilmer is amazing, but Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe & Stephen Lang stole the show...",8,6 February 2018,"After the departure of screenwriter Kevin Jarre on the director's chair, Kurt Russell, advised by Sylvester Stallone, hired George Pan Cosmatos, a veteran filmmaker well-known in the 80's for ghost-direct two of Sly's most famous flicks: ""Rambo - First Blood - Part II"" ('85) & ""Cobra"" ('86). ""Tombstone"" was since its conception a ""dream come true"" project for Russell, an avid western fan, the son of one of the most prominent character actors of the genre, Bing Russell and even named his own son with Goldie Hawn, Wyatt. He took the helm of the entire production with Cosmatos standing only as an advisor and taking care of the look and authenticity of this period piece.In terms of production values, ""Tombstone"" scores high in the art department, set design, costumes, locations (in and outdoors) and cinematography. It looks and feels like the Old West, but unfortunately, the trimmed screenplay and the scenes that were left out in the cutting room floor turned the movie a bit more generic, disjointed and the previous envisioned epic film about the life of Wyatt Earp was turned into an action film for the less demanding audiences.Some sub-plots went nowhere (more evident in the Jason Priestley's character, what was his purpose in the movie anyway?) and several scenes happened without proper explanation (suddenly the Curly Bill and Ringo's gang wear badges; who shot Billy Zane?; Michael Rooker's change of side seemed contrived) and in the last half a hour the movie looks like it was in a urge to finish with some quick editing thrown in and the result is a bit messy.It's a shame because the all-star cast is outstanding: Kurt Russell plays the legendary Wyatt Earp with conviction and adequate stubbornness, but he's upstaged by the brilliant turns of Val Kilmer as the lunger Doc Holliday, in one of his best performances to date; the criminally underrated Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocius and especially Michael Biehn, who delivers the best performance in the film, as the cold-blooded killer, but educated man, Johnny Ringo. His blinkless eyes & facial expressions devoid of any humanity and on-screen vileness presence made his ruthless character one of the most memorable villains of the 90's.Manly, rugged and moustache favorite, Sam Elliott as the elder brother, Virgil Earp and the always watchable, Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp were both ok, but their roles needed to be expanded. Stephen Lang stole all of his scenes as the nasty drunk, Ike Clanton and Jon Tenney provides a smooth & slick Marshall Behan, an ambiguous character which reminds a bit of Jeff Goldblum's in ""Silverado"".The rest of the cast were given almost nothing to do, except standing here and there and recite a few lines, a waste of Joana Pacula, Billy Zane, Michael Rooker, Thomas Haden Church, Terry O'Quinn, Harry Carey Jr. and even the screen legend, Mr. Charlton Heston in a thankless role. Robert Mitchum as the narrator had a way noticeable voice for fans of him and his old westerns.
Dana Delany as Wyatt's love interest, well... she may be adequate as a television actress. but she's not a leading lady material for a movie like this, and even if she didn't ruined her character, she wasn't impressive either...Besides the screenplay & editing problems, ""Tombstone"" have a couple of great and virtuously staged scenes, like the long walk and consequent gunfight at the O.K. Curral and the earlier confrontation between Biehn's Johnny Ringo and Kilmer's Doc Holliday in the Saloon, which are a joy to watch and because of that, the movie got its merit, but for a long, epic and more insightful view on Wyatt Earp's life, please go watch the Lawrence Kasdan's ""Wyatt Earp"" ('94) starring Kevin Costner as Earp and an almost unrecognizable / skinny, Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday.
It may be too long and boring for less demanding fans, but it's a much better written and directed film, and even if it flopped when it was released, it stands today as the definitive Wyatt Earp's biopic. Fans of ""Dances with Wolves"" or ""Open Range"" (both with Costner directing and acting in it) will love the film.",Tombstone

The true story of ""Tombstone"" is the story about the Friendship between Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday.Do yourself a favor after watching this film; then go and watch ""The Making of Tombstone"" -- which can be seen on YouTube. The attention each cast member provides gives one an insight as to how much effort was put into this great film, and how each actor strove to give his or her best to bring their character to the screen. I particularly recall Powers Booth's (Curly Bill) telling on how the film was madeThe costuming, the Story, the Plot, the action, the suspense, the characters -- well they are all there to near perfection.Couple of truly Historical things I remember: Wyatt DID really cross some creek in the face of gunfire to kill Curly Bill Brochous -- without any injuries. Ike Clanton really did live past all of this. Wyatt and Dana Delany's character really did live their lives as narrated at the end. (There is also some evidence that there were other Earp brothers involved as well.)It's a shame one can only give this film 10 stars -- it deserves more, way more.",Tombstone
123,marbleann,"Kilmers movie, but Delaney almost kills it",9,24 January 2005,"I am addicted to this flick. First let me say that Kurt Russell belongs the underrated actors club. Never seen him give a bad performance, bad movies but he was always good. That being said this is definitely Val Kilmers movie. His Doc Holliday is the Doc Holliday I always envisioned. Frail, red around the noise and mouth always coughing and a cold blooded killer. Powers Booth was also good as Curly Joe. A raging maniac. Stephen Lang playing the role he does so well, a weasel. The only complaint I have about the movie is a big complaint and her name is Dana Delaney. Every scene she is in the movie comes to a screeching halt. There is something about Dana Delaney that is so goofy I can't look at her with a straight face. A miscast if there ever was one. I could not see what the attraction was in the movie. In real life she was a Jewish New Yorker who left home at a early age. She seemed to be a very interesting person. Wyatt was even buried next to her in a Jewish cemetery in San Fransisco. Dana Delaney made the character one dimensional that the only person who would be interested in her would be someone looking for some nookie. Other then her almost killing the movie there are no complaints from me. Val Kilmer should of got a Oscar for his performance. Tombstone is a good old type western with a lot of action. Take a look and try to overlook Dana Delaney's Josephine.",Tombstone
124,no-skyline,Lightweight Western,7,13 June 2005,"Lightweight western staring Kurt Russel as Wyat Earp and Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday. The film plays fast and loose with history (as most westerns do) but the famous OK Coral shootout is well choreographed and pretty accurate. The problem being the shootout occurs in middle of the film and nothing after matches the intensity of that one scene. But even so this film is worth a watch for western fans and the performances range from OK Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot to a surprisingly good Kilmer as Doc Holiday. The action scenes are handled well but it never stretches the genre like the better 'modern' westerns i.e. Unforgiven, Open Range etc. Overall its a slick, competent western and an enjoyable couple of hours 7/10",Tombstone
125,gattonero975,"""Wyatt Earp and His Immortals""",8,28 January 2013,"I saw this one back-to-back with Kevin Costner's 'Wyatt Earp'(1994) movie and wow, what a difference in similarities. I will compare both films characters and interpretations , if applicable, and come to a conclusion at the end.Kurt Russell's Wyatt was not bad. I enjoyed it. This Earp story was more about like the title, about just that. Costner's was more how Wyatt Earp became the famous Earp from the beginning. So it's a tie as who did a better Wyatt Earp.Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday was a surprise. I felt he did a great job just as Dennis Quaid did with his. Very difficult on this also. I give it a tie also.Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp was right on casting. As this great actor personifies the ideal cowboy to me. Michael Madsen's interpretation was not bad but Elliott just nailed it. Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, also a great casting. I prefer Paxton's over Linden Ashby's. Even though Paxton's death scene was more Hollywood-ish and Ashby's more real and the Earp woman were more real in Costner's version.Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocius was a treat. Again Boothe wins over Lewis Smith's one. Boothe was sneaky, sinister and just slimy evil. Great casting even though he looked more ethnic per say. When I 1st saw him I really thought he was a Mexican bandido or something. lolMichael Biehn as Johnny Ringo wins big time. Not only did Biehn do a phenomenal great job, the Ringo character was much more displayed and played a vital role here than Costner's one! The final showdown of Biehns Ringo with Kilmer's Holliday is classic!Charlton Heston as Henry Hooker was more like a glorified cameo and that's all. Still nice to see the late great Heston in a modern western regardless. Jason Priestley as Billy Breckinridge I felt was a OK but not enough screen time for this young actor so I feel he was wasted per say. Both these characters were not portrayed in the Costner version.Jon Tenney as Sheriff Johnny Behan was I believe a tie with Mark Harmon's. Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton was just great. A tie with Jeff Fahey's, who was also great. Thomas Haden Church as Billy Clanton was much better than Costner's version. Dana Delany as Josephine Marcus. was not bad but I gotta give it to Joanna Going's version. Both very beautiful actresses and they needed someone like that to interpret the Josephine role to make it believable that Wyatt would be mesmerized by this woman.Paula Malcomson as Allie Earp loses to the great Catherine O'Hara's version. Even the beautiful Dana Wheeler-Nicholson's Mattie Blaylock loses to Mare Winningham's version. Joanna Pacula's take on Big Nose Kate was way more believable than Isabella Rossellini's. But then again Isabella wasn't given much screen time and some of her scenes were cut, so who knows, had Isabella had more to do she could have given Pacula a run for her money.Michael Rooker as Sherman McMasters was not bad but short. Still it was way better than Todd Allen's in Costner's version. Billy Bob Thornton as Johnny Tyler was a nice treat. Paul Ben-Victor as Florentino was amusing. John Philbin as Tom McLaury was a nice bit. His was better than Adam Baldwin's one even though Baldwin's was more menacing as he stands 6'4"" but Baldwin didn't have much to do in his version and Philbin has a nice bit confrontation scene with Russell's Wyatt. Robert John Burke as Frank McLaury was so-so. I prefer Rex Linn's one. Billy Zane as Mr. Fabian was nice bit. perfect casting for Zane. Even Boothe's Curly says, ""this is the handsomest man I have ever seen""! lol Buck Taylor as Turkey Creek Jack Johnson was better than Costner's version. Terry O'Quinn as Mayor John Clum was not bad at all. I wonder how he would have done in the Behan role instead. Frank Stallone as Ed Bailey had a nice cameo bit. And Robert Mitchum as the Narrator was not inspired but nice to hear the recognizable Mitchum tone in there. In the end, both films are good but as far as interpretations goes I gotta give it to Tombstone. But as storyline goes , Costner's versions wins there.",Tombstone
126,walsh-22,The best western that has been done in a while,10,7 May 2007,"I am a real fan of the old westerns and have found the modern westerns lacking in what the old westerns stood for but in Tombstone, I have found the modern equivalent of the best old westerns that starred actors like John Wayne and Gregory Peck.Tombstone is about Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) who moves to Tombstone to retire from the law and settle as a businessman in the town. He moves to the town with his brothers Virgil(Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton)to start a new life with them but through a series of run-ins with the cowboys, a murderous bunch of outlaws, realises he can't live the save life he wanted and has to step up to the plate and keep law and order in the town but after his brother is killed, he becomes focused on killing all the cowboys for what they have done and vows he will wipe out all the cowboys completely so they can't rise again to cause more mayhem to the area.This film has a lot of tension from the start when the brothers come across the cowboys and it builds and builds till you get to the point where your stomach is in knots because you are sucked into the movie and can't stop feeling jumpy when the two gangs clash. You are especially on tenterhooks when the Earps and Doc Holliday confront the gang at the O.K Corral and the director heaps more tension on as the two gangs freeze, waiting for the other to move first and you are on the edge of your seat waiting for the action to start again and when it does, it doesn't let up on the tension. It is quick and there is no hesitation as in the past, you had to be prepared to kill or be killed and you needed to be at the top of your game to survive. Even after the gun battle, there is still more suspense and apprehension about what will happen next and how it will finally end.This film is very much a morality tale. None of the bad guys survive not even Doc. The scene where Doc dies is not heroic, it is just unremarkable. He is in bed and knows from the feeling in his toes that it is time for him to leave the earth.What is touching is the relationship between Wyatt and Doc. They love one another like brothers and Wyatt is the only softness Doc has in his heart because he's had to survive living in the wild west and his life-threatening illness and to do so he had to be able to defend himself when the situation called for it. He is always there for Wyatt and what's sad is he is the only friend Doc has. Doc dies alone, not wanting his friend to see him in pain so he still protecting Wyatt.I also liked the rivalry between Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer). They are equals, very intelligent men but also very deadly and they seem to understand where the other is coming from.I can't imagine anyone else in the role of Doc, Val Kilmer, makes that character his own. The accent, mannerisms and the whole essence of Doc has been skillfully crafted by Val. He does get all the best lines in the film and he delivers them with a tinkle in his eye.I like that the film ends on a happy note with Wyatt finally going to Josephine and just living for the moment like Doc told him to. It is not to mushy for the boys who watch the film and there is enough romance for the girls to enjoy.",Tombstone
127,BoomerDT,A Truly Epic Western,10,2 March 2014,"The story of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and the Earp brothers taking on the Clantons at the OK Corral gunfight has been done on film numerous times. ""Tombstone"" came out before ""Wyatt Earp"" which was Kevin Costner's version of the Earp saga. I've never been able to sit through the entire thing, although I'm a fan of the earlier westerns. Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of Costner in dramatic roles. In fact the only thing I really care for him is playing the smart ass jock as he did in ""Bull Durham"" and ""Tin Cup."" Russell on the other hand may be the most versatile actor of his time. He can do comedy, action, drama or play the romantic lead. In ""Tombstone"" there isn't much comedy, but he gets to use all his other skills as Wyatt Earp, the legendary Kansas lawman. Russell's Earp is at a crossroads of his life, call it a mid-life crisis although no one used that term back in the 1880's. He and his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) have come with their wives to the booming silver mining town of Tombstone to make a new life and hopefully their fortunes. Wyatt is tired of law enforcement, they want to try their hand at being the house in one of the numerous gambling establishments in town. However they find themselves getting caught in the middle of the lawlessness that is rampant in Tombstone. The town is controlled by Cowboys, their leaders being Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) and Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) and his clan. A great western is only as good as the bad guys and this trio is superb. Curly Bill is a calculating, clever and opportunistic leader, who has a trace of likability and humor. Ringo is their gun. He's a sadistic cutthroat who truly enjoys killing. Ike Clanton is a vicious bully who turns coward when cornered. Gradually, against the advice of Wyatt, both Virgil and Morgan become Marshals and Wyatt is again brought back into it, along with his loyal friend, Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) Kilmer is excellent and really steals every scene he is in, whether it is at the poker table or with his woman Kate, or with a gun, something he can do better than anyone, except perhaps Ringo, as they move toward an inevitable duel. Doc is a man who knows his time is limited, he's dying of tuberculosis. It also makes him a dangerous foe.Wyatt has also had an unanticipated love relationship come to him in Tombstone, when he meets Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany) a lovely actress in a traveling theater troupe. There are both smitten almost immediately,although Josephine is also being pursued by the corrupt and cowardly Sheriff Behane, while Wyatt is still trying to maintain his marriage,although his wife Mattie is suffering from a drug addiction and neither seems to have any affection left for each other. Their love story is really secondary to the war between the Earps and the Cowboys although the film ends on an uptempo note, with Wyatt and Josephine getting ready to begin their lives together.So many great actors and performances in this. Kilmer is at the top, but Russell is very good as Wyatt Earp, a conflicted, flawed but fearless hero. Sam Elliott always plays the same character, but nobody does it better, especially in a western. Boothe and Biehn jockey back and forth as a pair contemptible outlaws, truly unconscionable. Billy Bob Thornton has a great bit as a local bully who has managed to bully and intimidate one of the towns faro games, until Wyatt Earp calls him down. Some legendary actors also have small parts-Chuck Heston as a local rancher who offers refuge to Wyatt and Doc, Bob Mitchum who is the narrator, and Harry Carey, Jr, the veteran of many great westerns who plays Sheriff Fred White.""Tombstone"" has plenty of gunfights, some great action and riding scenes, excellent cinematography and a rousing musical score. If you enjoy westerns it's one you can sit and continually watch, picking up something new every time.",Tombstone
128,CatRufus5591,"Way, way, WAY too long.",3,28 April 2019,"Every time I see a certain movie on my cable guide I feel compelled to write a brief review, based on my recollections of whatever film that might be. 'Tombstone' is my choice for today, since I just saw it scheduled to play tonight on some cable channel.
My wife and I rented this endless western
from Blockbuster in the early '90's. I think we must have looked at the video cassette box more than once to double-check the running time of the film. Why, we wondered, couldn't they have cut this film by 30 minutes?
I totally don't understand all the glowing reviews for this overlong film!
Got nothing better to do for over two hours?
-then watch 'Tombstone'. Maybe you'd like to enjoy it as a double bill with 'The Natural'.
But you'd better pick up a fifty-pound bag of popcorn (unpopped) first!",Tombstone
129,doug-balch,Disappointing Remake,4,21 August 2010,"This is a pretty well told and entertaining retelling of the Wyatt Earp story. I gave it only four stars in my IMDb ranking. It bombed in my ranking system, with only eight points out of a maximum of 24 points. That's well below the average ranking of 12.Here's what I liked:The story is well told. There are no plot holes. It moves quickly and is entertaining.Val Kilmer did a great job playing Doc Holiday. I'm still partial to Victor Mature's rendition in ""My Darling Clementine"", but I can understand why some think Kilmer's is the best ever.I just love Sam Elliot in Westerns. If he had been in his prime in the 40's or 50's I think he could have been one of the all time best leading men in the genre (the same could be said for Tommy Lee Jones).This ends up being a real good buddy movie. The Earp/Holiday relationship in the older films is more ""frenemy"" than buddy. I really cared about these two guys at the end and their loyalty to each other was touching.Unfortunately there were a whole bunch of things in this movie that chapped my grits:I didn't feel film gave us any compelling reason for retelling a story that has be told in a number of very good films already.I like Kurt Russell. Loved him in ""Overboard"". Wyatt Earp? No way. Didn't buy it. I'll give him credit for one thing though: he got the most he could get out of Kurt Russell for this. Also, he was very effective in the scene where he threw Billy Bob Thornton out of the bar.They had too many heavies, none of which were characterized well enough. And what did they do to poor Ike Clanton? He was a blatant coward and the butt of what little humor there was in the movie. Walter Brennan must have rolled over in his grave.The many female parts all felt gratuitous. There's only one interesting woman in this story and that's Doc Holiday's girlfriend. She gets very little screen time due to the cast of thousands. And did I miss something or did she just disappear from the story without explanation?Besides some sarcastic remarks by Kilmer, there was no comic relief.Very weak attempts to move the story out of the gnarly little town set into some interesting landscapes.The body count was unnecessarily high.And what's with the blatant reuse of the Book of Revelations ""rider on a pale horse"" sruff. Didn't Russell see ""Pale Rider""?There's a brief appearance by Mexican characters in the opening sequence, then the remainder of the film is 100% Anglo, which is odd for an area that is so heavily populated by Mexicans.And as is typical in almost every post Vietnam Western, they punt on the Indian issue. To introduce an Indian character opens up a can of worms i.e. due to PC concerns, an Indian can't be shown doing anything bad anymore, so you have to make room in the story for a maudlin ""aren't white people bad"" theme. That in turn doesn't always help sell tickets to white people. Easier and more profitable to punt and pretend they weren't there.",Tombstone
130,daviddaphneredding,Definitely a favorite of mine,10,10 July 2013,"I personally feel it's difficult to break away from this Hollywood Pictures production, directed by George Cosmatos, with all the excitement found therein, as well as being filmed in a just-right location: namely the Old Tucson movie site. Kurt Russell played a mean-but-just Wyatt Earp. Sam Elliott was excellent as his brother Virgil. Bill Paxton portrayed Morgan Earp well. And you had no sympathy for the following people: Curly Bill Brocius (acted to a tee by Powers Boothe), Johnny Ringo (the mean man portrayed by Michael Biehn) and Ike Clanton (a fine turn by Stephen Lang.) John ""Doc"" Holiday was exactly like Val Kilmer, I'd say. Charlton Heston, though his role was rather small and his appearance in the movie was rather brief, did a great feat as Henry Hooker. Billy Zane, who was mean in ""Titanic"" showed that he could adapt to any role, playing the sissified stage actor he was. (He was definitely disgusting in places!) Robert Mitchum had a deep and clear voice, and he the narrator was also very articulate. And who wouldn't have fallen in love with Dana Delaney, the beautiful, charming lady who played the actress Josephine Marcus? She was virtually realistic as the lovely lady so good for Wyatt. And too, the experienced actor Harry Carey, Jr. was good in his brief role as the lawman he was. The gunfights were exciting, and not only the gunfight at the OK Corral. The only thing I didn't like about it were the bloody scenes. The dry, Old West was fitting, since the setting of the story was in Arizona. Again, it is one of the best western movies I've ever seen in all my years. Great!",Tombstone
131,tjsdshpnd,One of the better Biographical Westerns,7,26 August 2010,"Biographical Westerns are special for the simple reason that it is even more fascinating to know that all this stuff had happened for real. These were real bad-ass cowboys. That increases the importance of the movie. This particular movie is about the peacemaker and part policeman Wyatt Earp, his family and friends and his most famous shoot-out in the wild west which is now considered a historic event. All the main characters in the movie are real, the events shown have historic backing. But still, I think, the director's job is very important here. He has established all the characters in a very believable way. This movie also may be the director's tribute to all his favorite westerns. There is everything in this movie - juggling of guns, bashing at the bar, poker, alcohol, opera singer beauty and loads and loads of gun fights.Two actors - Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are very impressive from the extended star cast, especially Kilmer. He has stolen the show from everybody. This is one of the westerns where the supporting actors have done well. Overall, a full on action western with historic importance.Rating : 7/10",Tombstone
132,knucklebreather,Almost great,8,25 April 2011,"""Tombstone"", a big-budget retelling/re-imagining of the legendary Wyatt Earp complete with the shootout at the OK Corral, is mostly an homage to the classic westerns of the 1950s and 1960s. And that's fine, they were cinema at its most fun, and it's always a pleasure to see their themes rehashed with a big budget, an updated script and more modern production quality. ""Tombstone"" mostly succeeds, with Russel's Earp approachable and enjoyable as he does battle with bad guys, despite seemingly wanting to just make a few bucks, after his arrival in boomtown Tombstone. The movie is full of great action scenes, mostly memorable characters (western clichés, to be sure, but longingly depicted and well-drawn ones).It's fun in the way the classic westerns were fun. If you like the genre there's really no reason not to pick up ""Tombstone"". However, this is a movie that seems to have had so many things going for it that it could have been that great movie that manages to capture all of the electricity of the western and distill it into one single, amazing film. So many movies came close, but ""Tombstone"" unfortunately falls short. The main problem is the sprawling cast of characters which populate the story, so many, and apparently so edited, that characters do things that aren't properly explained and that many seemingly important characters appear sporadically that I found myself asking ""Well where have you been?"" when some of them appeared after a few dozen scenes of absence.So it's not perfect. It's still a great western.",Tombstone
133,ingemar-4,Quantity over quality,2,16 July 2006,"I saw this movie a few years ago, and I won't see it again.The first half of the movie is a somewhat amusing low-quality western. The acting is poor, worse than most TV westerns, and the production is average at best, but the story works as a kind of parody of classic western stories. I wasn't impressed but somewhat amused. But the ending is a total disaster. A long hunt is summarized to many short cuts in very high tempo. It is almost a music video tempo, and there is absolutely no plot left, just a repetitive kill-kill-kill, a clear case of quantity over quality. The movie producer seems to think the movie gets better the more people that we see killed.The opening is tasteless and over-done, where the ""cowboys"" gang massacres an entire village because someone in that village killed a gang member. I see the point, it presents the bad guys, but it is too long, had been better left out. Again, there is no point in showing every separate death.So, the movie has its greatest moments in the first half, where something meaningful actually happens and there is interaction and tension. The death of the sheriff (by accident) is the only violent scene in the movie that is well done and memorable.Skip the ending (and trim the opening) and it is a decent low-quality western. But as delivered, it is garbage. Leave it in the bargain bin.",Tombstone
134,huggy_bear,A Must See,9,27 January 2003,"You have to see this one.  Kurt Russell is at his best, and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday gives one hell of a performance.  This is one of the best movies ever.  There is enough action throughout to keep anyone satisfied. The all star cast is second to none.  The chemistry between Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer is great, and the flow of the movie never slows down.  This is one you have to see, no doubt about it.  Best movie ever, hands down!!!",Tombstone
135,Manthorpe,`Why Johnny Ringo..looks like someone just walked over your grave.',9,3 February 2004,"I can't say enough about this movie...pure and simple. There are so many aspects that I like about this movie that it's difficult to even cover them in a review, but I'll try.First off, the cast is second to none. Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, and Michael Biehn are the definite standouts here. All give absolutely unforgettable performances and are complimented and multiplied by the rest of the cast which contains some big names in it's own right. Paxton, Elliot, Boothe, Zane, and on and on. The list never seems to end. This movie is a pure joy to watch even if just for Kilmer and Biehn, the two badasses. Kilmer plays the drunk and formidable Doc Holiday, while Biehn plays the deranged, demented and very dangerous Johnny Ringo. Their eccentric characters taunt each other throughout the film, alluding to an inevitable showdown..Tombstone is probably more of a guy's movie than a gal's. I mean, one of the main reasons to watch this film is just to see how badass all of the characters are, and trying to decide who is more badass and who has the coolest lines. I feel like scratching my balls and lifting up one cheek to let one rip just thinking about it. But that's not to say the ladies won't like it, it's just that it's kind of testosterone laden.which rocks because it's not overdone. The dialog in the film just reeks of badassness. I can remember more quotes for this movie than almost all that I've seen, and understandably so. `I want your blood, and I want your soul..and I want 'em both right now! Don't any of you have the guts to play for blood?!' `I'll be your huckleberry.' YES. Or, `You smell that? Smells like someone died.'Tombstone is an adapted story from real life events that took place before the turn of the 19th century. Of course not all of it is true as it's adapted, but it's cool to think about the fact that something very significant happened back then, enough so to be remembered 100 years later and worthy of the basis for a film.The sets are really impressive here and definitely have the boom town feel to it that the creators were going for. That goes for the costumes as well. The whole atmosphere of the film is executed quite nicely and is believable. I watched the special edition disc on the dvd and was impressed by the fact that they built the entire town just for the movie, and that it wasn't just some set that's been used in other movies somewhere along the line.
Tombstone never tries to be more than it is. It reaches epic status by keeping it simple. The movie is about the characters, and all are impressively created and depicted. And because of that, it is an epic for me. And epic of great acting and excellent characters. It's because of this that the movie has such a high replay value and is a wonderful edition to anyone's collection. It's a very pleasing movie experience that can be returned to time and time again.An absolute must for Michael Biehn and Val Kilmer fans.`Fight's not with you Holiday' `I beg to differ sir..play for blood remember?' `I was just foolin' about.' `I wasn't.' `Alright lunger.' `Say when..'",Tombstone

139,Steve-318,Lots of flash but you can bury this one,5,10 January 2004,"""Tombstone"" is one of those stylized movies that has a lot of good qualities--some fine players, nice camerawork and a couple of tense scenes. But, overall, it's a mess. Nothing hangs together. It's really just a series of scenes strung together and called a movie. Kurt Russell, no stranger to action hero roles, is Wyatt Earp but you never get inside this guy. We start off with a sense of family with Wyatt and his brothers but nothing develops. We just have scenes. Hugh O'Brian may have provided a clearer characterization on the old TV show. But Val Kilmer is good, playing the sharp-witted, weak-lunged Bat Masterson. The whole thing starts off like a documentary with Robert Mitchum intoning something about the old west while some silent picture is shown. It might as well have been the one of ""Beef--it's what's for dinner"" spots. I don't know who this director is but he was obviously trying unsuccessfully to recreate the spaghetti westerns of the 1960's. The violence is layered in like a cake. I think there must be a UCLA film course out there that might talk about the need for subtlety when trying to establish a sinister characterization. Otherwise, it's just another shooting gallery. If there isn't there should be.  This film is good for a couple of clips but it needs to be buried on Boot Hill otherwise.",Tombstone

141,SeptumSin,A pretty good western from more recent times,7,16 September 2010,"Ah the old west...we always romanticize about its wonders with all the sex alcohol and murder going on but we somehow make it though having it look like something out of a black and white Disney fairy tale. In more recent years the westerns have been darker in nature especially so after the Clint Eastwood era. Tombstone is somewhere in the middle of all of this.Well we are welling the story of Wyatt Eart and Doc holiday taking on the outlaws of the OK Corral. We have all the things that make our western's fun such as the violence and the drinking and the sex (well more implied). It also tends to have the oddly clean feeling that we got in the other old day westerns were most of the heroes cleaned their suits regularly and not like the Clint Eastwood type westerns where everything is covered by a level of dirt.The acting was very well done though I really wasn't' that impressed by Kurt Russels performance it like his character was more wooden than the others. Of course he was probably overshadowed by Val Kilmers spectacular performance of Doc Holiday, only Robert Downey Jr. Could have played the character better.The movie is easily watchable and though it clocks a little over 2 hours in length we can forgive it as you are entertained most of the time.

143,Asentiff2004,Ill be your Huckleberry....,10,25 December 2013,"Retired lawman Wyatt Earp, after a successful career in Dodge City looks to become rich in solitude with his two brothers and fellow friend Doc Holliday in the booming town of Tombstone, Arizona. But when trouble in the form of the ruthless gang known as The Cowboys threatens the lives of all they hold dear, Earp and his family must defend themselves and become legends in the process.What many consider to be one of the finest western films ever made, with superb action and a captivating story that brings the grit and raw determination of the old west on the silver screen. Kurt Russell puts up one his finest performances as the conflicted lawman, but it is truly Val Kilmer's rendition of Doc Holliday that truly steals the show. The action is top notch as there is substance behind it rather than just action for the sake of it. 1800's Western life is brought to life in a realistic fashion. The most legendary shootout in western history is portrayed brilliantly and is perfectly paced within the film. Western life is perfectly portrayed in all of its glory which only adds to the charm and realism of the film. Those who are not fans of the western genre will find it hard pressed to not enjoy this film as it is so brilliantly acted, directed and presented.",Tombstone
144,H_Spengler,"great western, visual eye candy",8,1 February 2009,"Seen both versions with both Costner & Russell. Must say I prefer this one. As a previous IMDb reviewer stated (""Kilmer & Russell together in the same picture is a treat for the ladies."") I'd have to agree, not only visually appealing, but also very talented actors.With that being said, this is a great ensemble cast. Russell, Kilmer, Eliott, Paxton. They work well together and make their respective characters in history come to life. Also keep your eyes peeled for cameos by Billy Zane, and a chubby Billy Bob Thorton.It's a simple story and it works. While others scream about any historical inaccuracies, Costner was better, etc. The fact remains that Costner's version was BORING. If your idea of seeing a movie is to be entertained, than Tombstone delivers.I just want to take a minute and reflect of Kilmer's performance, Definitely a highlight of the film. Kilmer is a talented actor, and I like him, his portrayal of Doc Holliday is nothing short of captivating. You're mesmerized by him when he's on screen as he steals every scene he's in. The real Doc Holliday was an educated man from Georgia (a trained dentist). Kilmer puts a touch of this elegance in his performance which I liked. But on the flip-side, plays him as fearless, as the real Holliday (dying from TB) was. Ironically true that he died in a bed with his boots off rather than in a hail of bullets or in s gambling dispute. Elliott is a wise casting choice, Western's are his forte, and he brings a polished performance. Russell is great as Earp, not to mention handsome. Paxton, I could take or leave. The locations and sets are good, and the movie doesn't keep you bored for a minute. A great and entertaining flick!",Tombstone

146,iamyuno2,One of the best westerns ever made,9,23 December 2013,"This is not just one of the best Westerns ever made - but arguably the best and most true-to- its-subject movie about Wyatt Earp and the men and women who surrounded him. Not to mention the fact that Val Kilmer does a tour de force as Doc Holliday that absolutely has to be seen to be believed - and if this isn't Kilmer's best film, it's right up there. (It's a shame that Kilmer has not since been handed such a great role that suited him perfectly.) That guy is off the charts in this film! But all actors in this film put in stellar performances and there's not a sour note in the whole film. Plus, it rises above its genre - this is almost more a historical biopic than a Western (not that I dislike Westerns - I don't; I LOVE Westerns). I think John Wayne himself would have endorsed this film. And it does justice to Wyatt Earp, too, who's portrayed as he should be - not a perfect man, but certainly, in the end, a hero and one whose bravery was almost unmatched (short of Billy the Kid, some of the Kid's cohorts such as Dick Brewer, and, of course, Earp's sidekick, Doc Holliday). What a great story, shot beautifully...it's a movie you want to see over and over again. And...is anyone unmoved at the end? Because there's tragedy and there's true romance. True romance. Read about it after seeing this movie - this story (including his lifelong romance with Josephine Marcus - which we only see blossoming in this film) is incredible and it's a big piece of Americana. The men who played Earp in the early movies - who knew him, in fact, in his latter days in Los Angeles in the 20s - cried when he died. I never get tired of seeing this movie. These are people you would have wanted to hang with and fight with if given the chance. This movie even motivated me to visit the real town of Tombstone, still standing where it was in Earp's time, a relic of the past. I felt the need to get closer to a man who was that great, so brave, so heroic, so admirable. And this movie makes you wish you could have joined his band of lawmen/vigilantes. Incredible story, superbly told in this movie. And perhaps you'll feel differently about vigilantes after seeing it, too. For who else was bringing justice to a corrupt and lawless region at the time? And yet this movie - to its credit - also brings out the humanity and tragedy even when the killing of bad men is necessary. And the thankless role Earp was forced into.",Tombstone
147,Thornfield2,Powerful Characters in possibly the best western ever made,10,23 May 2001,"There are very few films that blow me away and still keep me in awe hours after watching it. Tombstone is one of the few. The action scenes were wonderfully captivating and the scenery and costumes were splendid but I believe it was the acting and the characters portrayed that hit me so hard and the biggest reasons why I love this movie so much. First of all Doc was amazing and Val Kilmer should have gotten more praise for his portrayal of the quick-shooting, great-one liner Doc that I continue to adore to this day. The loyalty, friendship and brotherhood emanated between himself and Wyatt and their scenes together were just incredible. Kurt Rusell was perfect for the role of Wyatt Earp and I believe he played the part of this historical character the best out of any other actor playing the role. My favorite line in the whole flick is a quote of Doc's of course ""I got two guns one for the each of ya"". I also love it when Wyatt beats this guy, who was beating a horse and just gives him that hard look and says ""Hurts doesn't it?"" Dana Delaney was wonderful as the spirited Josephine and her scenes were all charming especially the love scenes with Wyatt. I especially love the part when he finds out she played the devil. And the crowning touch on this movie is how historically accurate it is. Excellent movie.The best western ever made (in my book). Four stars.",Tombstone
148,RyanEberhart,Amazing!,10,17 September 2013,"If I were to list my all time favorite Westerns, Tombstone would definitely be at the top. I even love the director's cut that was release not to long ago that explained some missing pieces. Some critics have compared Tombstone with Wyatt Earp, which came out a year later. I believe this is an unfair comparison since Tombstone dealt with the events that happened in Tombstone, AZ and Wyatt Earp spanned more of Wyatt Earp's life before Tombstone, his life in Tombstone, and a little of his life after Tombstone.I love this movie because everything was made to look authentic. The facial hair was real, which is awesome... no fake hair on these guys faces. There is a scene with a thunderstorm that roles in and... it's real.One of my favorite scenes is when Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton), and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) first meet Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang), and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). In this scene Wyatt is dealing a faro game and he has just signed an autograph for a patron. Curly Bill grabs the autograph out of the man's hand and reads it. Ike jumps in and says that ""law don't go round here."" Wyatt informs him that he is retired. Johnny Ringo joins the conversation by looking at Doc Holliday and saying that he must be Doc Holliday. An exchange between the two ensues that could have gone wrong when Ringo draws his gun and begins spinning it. However, Doc uses a cup to diffuse the situation by spinning it in the same manner Ringo did.Another favorite scene is when Ike and Frank Stilwell (Thomas Arana) follow Wyatt and the rest of his family to Tucson to take Morgan's body to California. Ike and Frank are tasked to kill Wyatt and Virgil. Before they can complete their task Wyatt kills Frank. Wyatt walks up to a cowering Ike and takes his spur and cuts him at the corner of the mouth. Wyatt informs Ike that he is now a U.S. Marshall and that he is going to hunt down every Cowboy and kill them.The scene at the OK Corral is amazing. It is as close to what really happened as the film could get it without going back to October 26, 1881. I won't describe it because I wouldn't be able to do it justice and I want you to watch the movie if you haven't or again if you have.There are other scenes I liked as well. The movie itself is very good. This would have to be my absolute favorite Western movie of all time. I like this movie so much that I have remembered many of the various lines. Many of the lines Val Kilmer spoke as Doc Holliday are great, including, ""I'm your Huckleberry"".I give this 10 stars out of 10. I love this movie. I also recently read an article that told a story in which the original director was let go from this movie. A new director was hired and the production company whittled the script down significantly. Kurt Russell is also responsible for rallying the other actors and crew to finish the movie, said the same article.",Tombstone

First off im not a big western fan so this made it difficult for me to watch it but after i saw this movie i changed my mind about westerns. I starter watching a bunch of westerns at that time like Silverado, Wyatt Earp, The Magnificent Seven(new version), Bad Girls amongst others and this one beat them all by far. Val Kilmer and Kurt Russel who is one of my favorites did an absolute excellent job. Even though Kilmer's role as Doc Holliday wasnt accurate he created a whole new character for all of us to like. Dennis Quaid was more accurate but not at all as appealing. Kevnin Costner did all right but i didnt care for him as wyatt earp even though i like him i just think that Kurt Russel did a better job. Above all this was a great film and i recommend this to all western go-ers, but be sure to catch wyatt earp as well to get the real scoop on wyatt's life.",Tombstone

151,celtic451-228-782719,Good movie but a couple of problems,4,24 December 2016,"******WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS. DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE******I live a hour from Tombstone and have been there several times and I have been at the gun site. A relative of Ike Clanton still runs a business there. I know a little bit about the history of the gun fight and of the circumstances that lead up to the fight.I was a little disappointed in the many big historical inaccuracies in the movie. I was hoping it would be the first movie to truly show what actually happened, but it didn't. That being said, the actual gun fight in the movie was pretty close to what actually happened, so that pulled the movie back up a little.The biggest disappointed was how Val played Doc Holliday. I don't know what he was thinking when he decided to play him as a kind of ""dandy boy"". Doc Holliday was a pretty tough character in real life and certainly wasn't a sissy. And they really lessened the real life role of ""Big Nosed Kate"" in the movie. She wan't some nobody bar girl in real life.Also, I didn't like how they portrayed Wyatt at all. They made it look like he was a fairly passive player in all this and didn't want to get involved in enforcing anything, which is absurd. He was a very experienced lawman in real life. What were they thinking in portraying him like this? Then they swung the pendulum the other way by making it look like he went out and killed about 30 cowboys - it was only 3. They also had Doc killing Ringo, but it was actually Wyatt that killed him.In the movie Wyatt didn't see Curly kill White, but in real life he did and even testified in Curly's behalf that it was an accident. Before White died he even said it was an accident.And for some reason they portrayed Josephine as some high class entertainer, when in actuality she was a low class prostitute.There are many other little incorrect representations of facts. One is concerning the timing of when Morgan arrived to Tombstone. 3 of the brothers did arrive in Tombstone at the same time, but it was Wyatt, Virgil, and James that arrived on the same day - Morgan arrived there later.And Virgil was made a US Marshall before they even arrived in Tombstone. In the movie they made it look like he wasn't even a lawman when they got there.I think if someone made a movie that more historically accurate, it would be even more interesting than anything they have done so far, so am hoping one day that will happen, but it didn't happen with this movie. But still I think it is a pretty good movie. It would have been a great movie if they would have portrayed Wyatt and Doc a little more realistically.",Tombstone
152,ShaeSpencer,Great!,8,18 August 2020,"This film showcases the best and worst of masculinity, oftentimes within the same character. The performances, casting, cinematography, and dialogue are startlingly good. The story is mostly great, though the women are pretty severely under-characterized. The editing is the one major flaw in the film, it's mostly passable, but several sequences are pretty rough in their construction and flow. The worst offense is the mood-murdering closing narration. However, what works in this film works very well. Val Kilmer's last scene in the film is shockingly powerful for both intangible and tangible reasons, chiefly that the scene is impeccably written, photographed, and acted. An underappreciated gem that I'm very glad to have been exposed to.",Tombstone
153,keesha45,"""I guess you could say we did our good deed for the day, Mayor""",8,7 August 2007,"Whether or not Wyatt Earp ever made such a statement, it sounds like something we'd expect from a full-fledged western legend: short and sweet, with a trace of modesty. While Kurt Russell was not the biggest star to ever play Wyatt (Such honors go to the likes of Henry Fonda, Burt Lancaster, Kevin Costner and James Garner and the quintessential TV portrayal by Hugh O'Brian), he does a decent job with the part and Val Kilmer heads an outstanding supporting cast. Many actors have played Doc Holliday on big and small screen, the earliest I can find on the IMDb website is Harvey Clark in LAW FOR TOMBSTONE (1937), while others have included Cesar Romero,Kirk Douglas, Victor Mature, both Dennis and Randy Quaid, even Willie Nelson and Adam West.Doc Holliday has always been my favorite among all the historic gunslingers of the Old West. Earp and Hickok may have been more of the white hat sort of hero, but Doc made no pretense about having redeeming qualities, except for one: he stood by his friend Wyatt when the chips were down. No lawman or cowboy could ask any more or expect any less from a true friend. Of all the portrayals of Doc, Kilmer's version is one of the best ever done for this complex man. His pathos and comic relief that he brings to his part turned this picture into an outstanding example of its genre. In real life, the western hero was never a totally William S. Hart/Hopalong Cassidy type of good guy, but a human being with flaws just like anybody else. In fact, sometimes the flaws that a western hero has to overcome make his character all the more extraordinary and entertaining, like the Duke does with his Ethan character in THE SEARCHERS. TOMBSTONE's not in a class with the classic all-time westerns, of which THE SEARCHERS is one, but it's a good tale of how a vicious outlaw gang gets its comeuppance from two of the greatest gunfighters who ever strapped on their shootin' irons to clean up their town.

The gunfight ""on the same block as OK Corral"" had many witnesses and is as well documented as any 30 second event with a lot of shooting can be.  I saw nothing in the film that contradicted written reports or court records.  The aftermath of the gunfight has always been open to controversy and the events in the movie, with the exception of Ringo's fate, are not outlandish.  Costner's Earp may have been closer to the true Earp persona, but it's just not as entertaining.  Kilmer, as mentioned by many, is great.  His relationship to Wyatt is just as touching but not nearly so somber and melancholy as the Costner--Quaid one.  For my money, Sam Elliott nearly steals the movie.

It is absurd that he was snubbed an Oscar nomination. Every line he says is an instant classic, from ""I'm your huckleberry"" to ""My hypocrisy goes only so far.""There are flaws however. The scenes on Wyatt's relationship with Josephine are annoying breaks from the tension and excitement of the rest of the story.

Looks like less than one percent gave it the minimum rating of one star, so I suppose that then gives me something to think about regarding human differences. Maybe if I had read where even just one person wrote something about a Hollywood treatment with its typical dramatization, costuming, and storyline, I might have passed on it. I recognize that many people like extreme melodrama, fancy gun twirling, very over-done shoot'em up and down gunfights, guns that don't run out of bullets, and much larger than life good-guy heroes and their extreme opposite, and the romance that gets tossed in, but I do not. And for something historical I prefer something somehow somewhat believable. And maybe even something somewhat original but that is certainly not the case with Tombstone.

It's a shame he wasn't nominated the year this came out, but then again some say the western has been dead for years. I beg to differ although this one does go on a bit too long and has a bit of an awkward romance between Wyatt Earp and Josephine. But I will have to say the fantastic cast makes up quite a bit and Kilmer commands it in the right direction along with Russell who through his weight around as the lead.

177,emdragon,Too long,4,3 March 2011,"Tombstone, a George Cosmatos directed picture from 1993: I am sorry, but I must give this kind effort a weak score. There is far too much laconic self importance among the principles, and very little typical human behavior. The fact that nobody ever uttered a humorous line in the entire picture says something about what Hollywood believes comprises entertainment these days. And this is a very long movie, full of melo-dramatic seriousness. (I suppose ""I'm your Huckleberry"" expresses humor on some level, but. . .) Set in the late 1800s, Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp gives a very serious performance finding revenge laden motivations around every corner of the picture. Val Kilmer, as Doc Holiday, helps him some. . .at least offering a glimmer of lightness, but certainly not enough. He is somewhat lighter, but I would understand I suppose, given that his gun contains a vastly superior chamber for bullets than anyone had ever seen before. In one of the numerous gunfights, I have slowed the video down to count 35 consecutive bullets coming from his 2 guns a blazing. Credulity has little business in current Hollywood fare for ingestion, I suppose. Sam Elliot is just slow, serious, and weak here. His natural sounding accent for slow and stupid never gets more play than here. The rest of the cast seem to continually try to give the very image of themselves something definite to be remembered on screen, but is'nt this the directors entire idea here? Impression!?!

183,theblackscythe,A last hurrah for the cheesy fun western.,7,4 November 2014,"Tombstone is not sophisticated, or deep, or emotionally weighty. However it is quite special nevertheless. In a time after 'Unforgiven' supposedly killed the traditional romanticised western, for this ball of cheese and fun to have been made is a happily defiant stance for simple and fun movies. Tombstone does not deconstruct, or analyse anything within its genre. It simply enjoys itself and tells a good story.The acting in tombstone is very good, particularly Val Kilmer in my personal favourite performance of his. Kurt Russel also delivers a strong, if cheesy, performance as the standard action badass (I am aware that this is technically a biopic, however I'm fairly sure that this is not an accurate portrayal of the man). Their acting is enhanced by the cliché and simple, but well paced screenplay. The film's humour is also pretencion free and charming, hearkening back to the golden age of westerns.Despite the obviously throwback nature of this film, it doesn't feel tired. The acting and writing is still slick and modern despite keeping the spirit of the past. It really is a fun little example of how to do a silly throwback well, and still have occasional moments of weight and gravitas (once again mainly through Val Kilmer).On the downside, the film lacks a satisfying enough conclusion and in general seems to lack direction in its third act. I was also disappointing by the lack of satisfying material for Sam Elliot or Bill Paxton, two actors I genuinely like in supporting roles.Overall however, despite hardly blowing my mind or challenging me, I enjoyed my viewing of Tombstone. After Unforgiven killed the genre, for a film the brazenly cheesy to come out a year later was a big risk. In my opinion, it paid off.",Tombstone
184,Petunia-2,"A Good, Old-Fashioned Western",9,25 September 1999,"Ladies, we have a fine ensemble of some of the best looking men in the business:  Kurt Russell; Val Kilmer; Michael Biehn; Billy Zane; Sam Elliott; Bill Paxton, etc.  So don't let the fact that it's a ""western"" deter you from catching this one.I love movies that pay attention to fine details: Kilmer's filthy fingers during a poker hand, a child soothing her doll after a street shooting, the size of paper money, spittoons in the theatre, etc., etc.  Even the colloquialisms were accurate for the time period:  ""savvy?"" ""ain't that a daisy?"" ""I'm your huckleberry"" and so on.  The women in the film were not overly made up, only a small amount of lip color.  And the furnishings, drapes and other decor made me feel I had stepped back in time.The historical details were not right on the money, but for a movie which must wrap up in a few hours, who cares?  The movie is so enjoyable.  Russell WAS Wyatt Earp - the steely eyes, the head-strong determination.  Kilmer did steal every scene he appeared in, however, and mastered a Virginian accent magnificently.  Powers Booth and Michael Biehn played villains who really get under your skin.  And those in lesser roles (such as Curley Bill and Mattie Earp, who in reality was never officially married to Wyatt) were greatly effective.If you rent this movie or watch it for the first time, take note of the extra's.

185,georgeredding,very exciting western action and great cast,7,25 November 2020,"In all me years of seeing western movies, this definitely a favorite mine. And I grew up in the 50's when the B westerns were still popular, though a few years old, so I remember well Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Johnny Mack Brown, Rex Allen, Bill Elliott, and Rocky Lane; naturally i remember John Wayne also.
The cast of ""Tombstone"" was well-picked. Kurt Russell was very adept at playing the lead as Wyatt Earp, a mean yet loving man when it came to his brothers. Val Kilmer was excellent as John ""Doc"" Holliday, a sometimes amusing yet at heart a very serious killer. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson was one who convinced viewers well that she, as Wyatt's wife, was a bitter, unhappy lady. Dana Delaney-and what red-blooded male could not be taken with her?-was very appealing as the actress who became Wyatt's love interest in no time at all, and she his. Powers Boothe, Stephen Lang, and Billy Bob Thornton each fit into each one's individual role well. All of these contributed greatly to the excitement brought about. And though his role was brief, Charlton Heston was good as the caring man Henry Hooker, even if his exterior was somewhat rough. I did like the color and the movie set Old Tuscon as well. For all these reasons it is definitely a favorite western of mine, and maybe even a favorite movie of any genre for me personally.",Tombstone
186,boomerchinde,Tombstone rocks as a great western,8,10 July 2007,"Someone once said, ""when the truth dies, print the legend"", and that's exactly what happens with this film. Although accurate in many respects, it is highly inaccurate in others, but what the hey, who cares when it's pulled off this well. George Cosmatos handles the directing reins wonderfully, and the pace of the film only slows down for the sappy romance between Kurt Russell and Dana Delaney. The Earps come to Tombstone to make their fortune and end up in a bloodbath of historic proportions. Oddly, the one scene where you're most likely to say ""Oh, that's phony"" is the scene where Wyatt walks into the face of a ambush and holds his own -- but that's highly accurate! The real Wyatt had bullet holes in his hat, boots, saddle and coat, but dished the dirt to the baddies. Great dialog, and an absolutely movie stealing performance by Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. Joanna Pacula is gorgeous as always, and plays Big Nose Kate Elder, Doc's ""girlfriend"". Look fast for the bar scene where Wyatt tosses out a loud mouthed braggart -- Billy Bob Thornton in one of his first roles.

The chronicle from childhood to the 20th Century felt complete. BUT Then came Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott and Powers Boothe (Deadwood 93) etal and left me entertained to the ninth degree. The sheer pace of this one leaves you breathless. these movies should be seen back to back and not compared as they tell two different stories occurring at the same time and place. Costner as Wyatt was more believable But Russell's Earp was more fun. Quaid was Doc Holiday but Kilmer had a holiday with the role.

I thought Dennis Quaid's Holiday was good, but I hadn't seen Tombstone. Quaid was good, which goes to show just how outstanding Kilmer's is. The writing is great and Kilmer brings it to life. And the interaction between Holiday and Ringo make it worth watching every time it's on. Oh there are flaws in this film, sure. People firing off twice as many rounds as their weapons will hold without real loading, is one that come to mind. But it's still worth seeing if only to watch Kilmer bring the character to life. The other actors are good as well, but Kilmer steals the show.For the first time viewers, in case you were wondering what the hell Doc is talking about, a ""Huckelberry"", is a specific man, for a specific job.

190,vinnieboards,It can't be historically accurate but who cares?,9,30 July 2010,"Right lets get the one negative out of the way. This film isn't and never could be historically accurate. So reviews applauding the historical content of this film are nonsense.The history of the Earps and Doc Holliday is shrouded in claim and counter claim based on the conflicting accuracy of eye witness accounts. No one truly knows who murdered Johnny Ringo, it could have been one of a dozen people including Johnny Ringo himself (as per the Coroner's report which indicated suicide). Doc Holliday could have murdered him but he was in court on the day although he may have been represented by his attorney. Guns were terribly inaccurate at the time and shooting whilst riding a horse was all but impossible. As in all shooting films both historical and modern, the ability to shoot with the accuracy of a laser is virtually nil (unless the shooter is a modern scoped Sniper of considerable skill). Nuff said.But as I mention in my summary, I couldn't care less!! This film is nothing short of magnificent. Val Kilmer gives a career defining performance as Doc which single handedly shamed the Oscar Academy (if there is a best supporting actor winner out there thats more worthy I would like to know). The relationship between Wyatt and Doc is compelling, with Wyatt as the honourable law abiding gunman vs his friend who is embroiled in a world of excess, drugs and death defying duels.Michael Biehn on the face of it, looked mis-cast as Ringo and yet delivers an understated and assured performance, Powers Booth is on top form as Curly, the Earp brothers all chip in, especially Sam Elliot who is always good value.The sets are lavish, the cinematography is breathtaking and the pace is perfectly balanced between rich story telling and stunning action set pieces. It would have been easy to make this film based around the climax at the OK Corral but not so - its almost a buddy movie, which is driven to conclusion at the private gunslinging showdown between Ringo and Wyatt.Personally, I would take this film any day over Unforgiven which whilst an excellent Western, never quite lived up to its own hype. Costner's Wyatt Earp doesn't hit the spot either. Tombstone definitely does.",Tombstone

Like the whole movie was made to serve up a lot of still shots for lobby cards.  What blows me away the most is all the praise for Val Kilmers performance as Doc Holiday.  His pathetic attempt at a southern accent is excruciating to watch.  I don't know how he did it with a straight face.

Kurt russel is one of my favorites, and he didn't disappoint me, and Val Kilmer steals every scene he is in. His potrayal of Doc Holliday wasn't as accurate as Dennis Quaid's in Wyatt Earp (another good movie) but it was just as awesome. i also really liked  michael biehn as (the good gut from terminator 1) as johnny Ringo.

194,sherbetsaucers,They DO Make Them Like That Anymore,7,6 February 2007,"The reason I love movies is my father. Because of him I grew up watching westerns and war movies, his two favourite genres. While I loved the fact that a huge number of things generally blew up in war movies, I always found the westerns to be more to my taste. The sun glaring off the sand, worried townsfolk scurrying indoors and the single gunman facing down the bad guys. Tombstone is a fantastic tribute to these movies.Leaving historical accuracy aside, the plot is fairly straightforward. Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) brings together his two brothers, Virgil (Sam Elliot) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) and their respective spouses to seek their fortunes in the mining town of Tombstone. Personally I would have chosen the sister town, Happyland; still, what's in a name? There they meet old friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) and set about making money. Unfortunately, lawless gang 'The Cowboys' ruin everything by being loud, obnoxious, spitting, and shooting the occasional town sheriff and curse-laying priest. Wyatt gets involved though he doesn't really want to, and then Virgil takes the place as the new town sheriff, forcing the two brothers to become deputies. One thing leads to another and suddenly it's all guns blazing as the Earps and Holliday head to the OK Corral.The Earps and Holiday kill three Cowboys. In retaliation the women folk are shot at, Virgil is crippled and poor Morgan killed. Earp decides enough is enough, becomes a US Marshall, and accompanied by his good friend Doc and three other companions, goes to seek bloody vengeance. We see the descent of Earp into vengeance-reaping killer, a man who loses himself until, at the end of the movie, he finds true love.This is a movie of the myth of the Earp story, rather than some kind of Hollywood biography. Accept it as such and then we can talk.Stylistically this movie owes a massive debt to the classic westerns of the past, and is in many ways a homage to them. However, please don't think that this makes it some simple movie. Although the good guys and the bad guys are clearly defined, there is still plenty of symbolism to look out for. The priest at the beginning curses the Cowboys, saying that death would come on a pale horse, which initially is incorrectly translated as death riding on a sickly horse. Then Johnny Ringo shoots the poor priest in the forehead. As the Earps first go to face the Cowboys for the showdown at O.K. there are four of them, like the four horsemen heralding the apocalypse for the cowboys. Behind them we see fire. Now, it may just be a fantastic opportunity to make a great looking movie poster, or it may well be the fires of hell that Wyatt talks about following him later as he and Holliday begin their vendetta ride.Of course it is this vendetta ride where the priests curse/prophecy comes true. Wyatt being death and the pallid Holliday could easily be called the 'sick' horse. Finally Johnny Ringo is shot and dies in the same way he killed the priest, one shot in the forehead.The performances in this movie are generally good. The supporting cast are very supportive, and throughout the movie faces pop up that are unexpected. Charlton Heston is the most obvious, but Billy Bob Thornton, Terry O'Quinn, Billy Zane and Michael Rooker all appear in relatively small parts. Kurt Russell is totally convincing as Wyatt, at times doing what appears to be a fine Clint Eastwood impression, but he's believable and looks good. The person who really shines of course is Val Kilmer. Playing the consumptive 'Doc', he's the cowboy all the little Goths want to grow up to be. He delivers every line with panache, his natural charisma turned up to eleven, and no matter what, there is always a look in his eye that says 'You may be holding four of a kind, but I know I've got me a royal flush. Call me, I dare you.' No, this isn't the greatest Western ever made, but it's probably been the most popular for the last 20 years. Give it a go if you're in the mood for some good old-fashioned gun slinging.",Tombstone

196,dapplegrey13,One of the best ever!,10,7 February 2012,"I saw this on the big screen when it came out in 1993. After enjoying most every minute of this rich, colorful, and gripping movie, I just couldn't believe it wasn't getting more attention. It's one of the most quotable, fun, moving, memorable films ever. THIS is what movie-making is really about --creating and celebrating unforgettable characters in a compelling story.And they managed to make it tense and moving with minimal cursing, sex, nudity, gore, etc. It is simply wonderful. Certainly not a family film; but tame on some levels, and I love it. I especially adored Dana Delaney in her role --she was breathtaking and fascinating. Oh, and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday? Are there words? He SHOULD have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor by the Academy Awards for that performance. It's a crying shame he was not. To this day, it is a crying shame he was not nominated.There were many good performances in Tombstone. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson was achingly sad and believable as the morphine-addicted Mattie. Sam Elliott was in top form. He was so calm and reserved --when he lost his temper in one scene, it was really frightening. Billy Zane, Thomas Haden Church, Billy Bob Thornton, Powers Boothe, Kurt Russell, Stephen Lang --many of the actors were simply fabulous. And WHAT a cast of actors! My gosh! If you watch it today (2011), it's amazing how many actors you recognize who were fairly unknown then.Wonderful character development. It was so easy to get involved in the characters' stories and to pull for them. Yes, they took a few liberties with historical facts; but they brought the gunfight at the OK Corral and its back story to life in a grand, wildly enjoyable film with rich, interesting characters.Tombstone is a ""10"" in my book.

197,mjscarface,"Dramatic, epic and downright cool!",9,23 November 2007,"Tombstone is one of all-time favourite films. It's definitely my favourite western. It features one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen, many of who take meagre supporting roles in a film that never stops entertaining.While perhaps not accurate, Tombstone is the story of retired lawman Wyatt Earp who moves to the title town and plans to go into business with his two brothers Morgan and Virgil. Before long, his reputation attracts the attention of the Cowboys, a gang of vicious outlaws who essentially rule the region. When the Cowboys target Wyatt's family, he and longtime friend Doc Holiday declare all out war on the gang.Tombstone contains some quality acting, sharp dialogue and tense set-pieces which combine to form a truly rousing package. Production values and the score are also top notch. The story takes the odd detour now and then, giving the impression that a much longer version is around somewhere (with lots of characters and sub-plots touched upon). Nevertheless, the appeal of the film comes from it's strong characters.Kurt Russell makes a career-best performance in a role he was born to play. Both quiet and intimidating, he commands authority whilst able to show his more personal feelings and concerns. Val Kilmer is also fantastic as Doc Holiday and for many, he is the stand-out performance.Compared to it's counterpart 'Wyatt Earp', the film goes straight for the jugular and pulls on the heartstrings. As a result, the film is unapologetic in it's violence but also at times very moving.Tombstone is definitely a gem of a western and never have moustaches looked cooler.",Tombstone

It's been one of my favorite films since the day it came out. It's got everything- drama, romance, action, and an honest to goodness story. There are even interesting themes, like the moral dilemma that Wyatt finds himself in-- Is he compelled to help fight the Cowboys even though he's ""retired"" and just wants to live out his life in peace? Is there a moral equivalence between killing for justice and killing for retribution? How far can a man go to sacrifice his own integrity and better judgment? Even though the Earps are the ""good guys"", the movie doesn't glamorize violence. Doc Holliday and some of the Earps' other sidekicks (""Creek Johnson"" and ""Texas Jack"") are obviously pretty shady characters, but at the end of the day, are forced to choose between right and wrong, and they choose correctly. It doesn't get much better than Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, and I can't for the life of me understand why he didn't get nominated for it. I also appreciate the fact that the love story between Wyatt and Josephine didn't dominate the film and take away from the real plot, ala ""Titanic"". The love story simply served its purpose in helping viewers to better understand the character of Wyatt. Also the friendship between Wyatt and Doc was portrayed tenderly but not wussily. And okay, as a woman, let me just say that there is no one sexier than Sam Elliot. Man alive, if there ever was a person born to portray a cowboy, that guy is IT.

205,Mr_Vai,Simplistic and Rushed,1,11 January 2005,"Word has it, that several years ago, a big time Hollywood actor and a major studio expressed an interest in making an epic film over Wyatt Earp. Well, a rival studio got wind of this and decided they would beat them to the punch. So they rushed out a silly and moronic version of the events that led up to the events at OK Corral. Well, Tombstone is that inferior movie. I'm sorry, I like Kurt Russell, but he had little to work with here. Oh sure, the 7th graders will tell you that Tombstone is the better film, but only because it was written at their level. For my money, the Costner version is much better and more intelligent.

His expressive eyes say so much, even when he isn't saying anything, you know what Ringo is thinking, and Biehn does super in this role and is my favorite character! Kurt Russell is also very cool in this film and pretty tough! And of course, who can forget Bill Paxton, his fifth and final film alongside Michael Biehn to date, after first appearing together in The Lords of Discipline 10 years previously.

Great story with historical characters (While not always historically accurate). Still a well done and entertaining Western.A cult classic and one of my favorites. This film has an all star cast and is full of 'Movie moments' that you won't soon forget. Shot entirely in Arizona (only a few miles from Tombstone) the story centers on the Earp's retiring from the law business and settling down in the quiet town of Tombstone to raise their families and start a new life. They soon find out a local gang (The Cowboys) extort and terrorize the citizens and basically run the small town. All this is about to change when the Earp's get involved and return to duty as lawmakers! Great fun from start to finish. You'll be quoting this film for weeks. One of my favorite quotes: ""You tell 'em the laws comin', ..You tell 'em I'm comin', and Hell's comin' with me!, you got that? Hell's comin' with me!""

Here, Wyatt Earp biography is told like a fable. Sure, the facts are often recalculated in this film. But this is not looking to give a straight-on accurate view of Wyatt Earp's life. This is trying to take a man's life as a basis and then add to it to make a cinematic joyride. As opposed to the overlong and plodding ""Wyatt Earp,"" this film decides to have a good time with the story and not get too bogged down in the misery. Kurt Russell is powerful as awful, and no man can deny that Val Kilmer, in his finest performance to date, was fully due for an Oscar nomination, if not an Oscar win.

223,Freak-10,"Perhaps the last, greatly-overrated American western",1,16 December 2004,"After finally viewing this movie in its entirety, I am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike. Is it the worst Western ever? No, I wouldn't say that. But ""the last great American Western"", a phrase I saw applied to it more than once? Not even close.A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that I've ever seen. The movie can be measured in groaners per minute; as in, how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life? There's so many instances of this that it's distracting. Cheesy lines come at you in waves; predictable, unoriginal, and often. If bad dialogue doesn't bother you, then how about bad gunfights? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously. It's okay if there's a comic edge to such gunfighting, such as in Silverado, but in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good Westerns. The final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score, but by then, I was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving.Other than those flaws, I can say the visuals are stunning - the movie's well shot and the settings all look great. The acting is passable, especially considering what the actors were given to work with. However, if you're looking for the last great American Western, do yourself a favor - go rent Unforgiven instead.3 out of 10",Tombstone
224,Antithesys,I got two guns - one fer each o' ya!,8,26 December 2000,"Tombstone is pretty darn good; it's a kind of epic story, a great example of post-modern Western storytelling in the same vein as Unforgiven, portraying the Old West as a strange mixture of the best and worst of humanity, sometimes clean, civilized and chivalrous, sometimes harsh, filthy and barbaric. It has a good story, although it runs a little too long, and the direction and cinematography is splendid. But Tombstone is a great film because of its cast, especially one Val Kilmer, who turns in the best performance of his career as Doc Holliday, a legend with both the pistol and the shotglass. I can count at least two dozen of Holliday's lines that qualify as classics (""Maybe poker's not your game. I know! Let's have a spelling contest!""). Kilmer's delivery is the real key, and he gives a memorable performance that really carries the film, and makes Tombstone not just a good drama but an excellent entertainment.",Tombstone

The depiction of the time and place seems thoroughly authentic, and the acting is top-class - while Kurt Russell makes a fine central character, Val Kilmer displays effortless cool as Doc Holliday, and Michael Biehn is suitably menacing as gunslinger Johnny Ringo.  The fabulous script allows every actor to shine, and many of Doc's lines especially will stick in your mind, such as ""I'm your huckleberry"" and ""Isn't that a daisy?""My only criticism would have to be the love story in this film - it just doesn't work.  And while I would praise it for trying, the fact is, there just isn't room for much romance in the genre.Should Val have won an Oscar?  Of course he should.

Russell is good, Kilmer steals the show, and Delany is miscast in a role that required a more fiery, vivacious persona; her scenes with Russell generate zero heat, and their romance, such as it is, goes nowhere.The earlier parts of the film have their moments (notably the Bird Cage scene, which probably captures the reality of Wild West entertainments pretty well), but in the third act everything unravels in confused montages of Peckinpahesque ultraviolence.

Throughout the entire film, his acting and character embellishments are so nuanced and well done that by movies end, we feel his loss in a very personal way. Credit must also go out the the costumers and make-up artists for their contribution to the overall effect of his role. All the way through the film, he looks sickly, pale and world-weary. His mannerisms and intensity of gaze profoundly establish this character as a focal point in this production. But as for what I started this off with, I consider this role as probably the very best for Val Kilmer. It required subtlety and careful restraint and made the viewer believe that we weren't watching an actor merely regurgitating lines and hitting their foot-marks. I, for one, was entranced by the carefully studied body language and facial expressions...the sweaty desperation of a man who sensed his own mortality but strove to enact his own justice for justices sake.

231,k_luifje,too much is never good,6,9 November 2001,"Tombstone		 Title: Too much is never goodThis 130-minutes during film doesn't give you a very good feeling. Sure, the actors are all playing their parts well (not good, just well) and Val Kilmer is really terrific as the tuberculosis patient Doc Holliday (it is one of the best roles Kilmer has ever done) and the scenery is very well done, but there is something not all right with the movie. The problem is that there are simply to many characters in this work. Besides the three Earp brothers Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan there are the three wives of the brothers, Doc Holliday and his Hungarian Kate, the tempting Josephine and her colleague Mr. Fabian, Billy Breckenridge, a good role from Jason Priestley, and a hole bunch of bad guys. It just isn't possible to put all of these persons lives and problems in 130 minutes of film. The headaches that Wyatt Earp's wife has, for instance, don't get enough attention to get involved in her situation. The same goes for the whole Morgan Earp-character, played unenthusiastic by Bill Paxton. He hasn't got enough screentime to get you interested in why he does what he does. He seems to be in this movie for the reason that it's impossible to make a movie about the legendary Wyatt Earp without mentioning his two brothers Virgil and Morgan.The second thing not making the movie a very good one is that you don't know who the main character is: Wyatt Earp or Doc Holliday. In the beginning it's obvious that Kurt Russell's Wyatt Earp is the most important person in the film, but slow but sure the Doc Holliday-part gets bigger and so much more interesting than Earp. This is because Val Kilmer is playing Doc Holliday with his whole heart and because you feel more for Holliday that for Earp. Wyatt Earp (in this motion picture) is a man who just wants to get a lot of money with doing as little as possible and Doc Holliday is the kind of person who wants to be there for Earp whenever he needs him, ill or not, Earp can always count on Doc Holliday. Writer Kevin Jarre and director George P. Cosmatos should have made a choice between Earp and Holliday and they didn't. That's a shame and it makes 130 minutes a heck of a long time. Luckily, like I mentioned before, Val Kilmer is a pleasure to watch and Jason Priestley and Billy Zane are acting very good as well. The scenery's are very impressing and Joseph Porro's customs are nearly perfect. All of this keeps the movie watchable, but not much more that that I'm afraid.",Tombstone

236,BigBirdtheBum,"Great performances and gunfights make ""Tombstone"" a western to enjoy",7,4 November 2008,"Great performances and gunfights make ""Tombstone"" a western to enjoy. Well at least for me anyway, personally I have never been a big fan of westerns. So I may be to harsh or too lenient in my review, as I am vastly unfamiliar with what makes or breaks a western. So I will try to do my best to address all aspects of the film. The film ""Tombstone"" concerns three brothers; Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), Virgil Earp (Sam Elliot) and Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton) venturing to a town called Tombstone (a developing mining town) and settling in. Here Wyatt meets a close friend Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer). Together they attempt to rake in the bucks gambling at a local saloon. Unfortunately several misfits and murders land them in trouble with the cowboys, a ruthless gang of maniacs, who appear to be in control of the town more than the police, or the town Marshall. After a murder of the town sheriff the trouble really begins. This trouble leads Wyatt and his brothers fearing for there lives, and as a result they join the police force. Although Wyatt initially was reluctant (as he was once a law man) he decides to help his brothers. Violence and mayhem persists and a war breaks out between authorities and cowboys, with moral and physical losses on both sides. Now what everyone man or women seems in my opinion to like about westerns is three things; number one- cowboys, number two- shootouts and number three the presence of the classic saloon. ""Tombstone"" dishes this out in healthy doses. Some of the memorable shootouts include the; Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (a real shootout) among others. Now these shootouts are quick paced and feature casualties on both sides, and include a great variation in weaponry used. This is mixed in with moderate amounts of blood that don't move interest away from, neither the brilliant sets nor the costumes, but succeed in adding realism and occasionally shock value. Now the sets and costumes are something to really wonder over. The costumes appear authentic and the sets just as authentic. The sets also have a distinct warn down feel; which assists in placing viewers in a corrupt and dusty western environment. Now aside from feeling like a western movie, the acting and the dialogue is quite authentic and enables you to really soak up the atmosphere of the picture, without being distracted by poor dialogue or bad acting. Now the best acting is given by Kilmer, who portrays Doc Holiday in such a way; you really will believe he existed. Kilmer doesn't overact at all and portrays him as a calm, but an in control man. Dialogue associated with good acting include; ""All right, Clanton... you called down the thunder, well now you've got it! You see that?"" said by Wyatt and ""The Cowboys are finished, you understand? I see a red sash, I kill the man wearin' it!"", also said by Wyatt. Now what makes this dialogue authentic is it doesn't seem forced and seems to be dialogue in which someone would come p with on the spot in an actual situation. What also mesmerised me about the film is the substantial character development that occurs. At first Wyatt and his brothers are to varying degrees attempting to avoid fighting the cowboys, but after a while they literally launch a personal vendetta against them, which historical became known as the ""vendetta ride"". Not only are changes and conflict intriguing to watch, it also makes successful drama which makes ""Tombstone"" seem very sophisticated. Now I didn't enjoy everything about ""Tombstone"", one thing that really bugged me about the film, was the lack of time and detail spent on developing the cowboys. Now this effected my viewing of the film quite substantially. I began to feel as if the movie lacked in presenting villains that has emotions, had motives and had lives. They just seemed to pop up and disappear. The only cowboy who is talked about in some detail is Ringo (Michael Biehn), the motive for his villainous actions are; he is simply a sick, sadistic man. Now this is probably one of the biggest flaws, and won't concern most viewers aside from the very picky viewers (like me). Summing up, ""Tombstone"" is an enjoyable western flick that presents believable characters and sets, combined with compelling gunfights and realism that sets it apart from other ""action flicks"". Overall I give ""Tombstone"" a well earned 7.3 out of 10. Not the best western I have seen, but pretty damn good for a modern one. Now I mentioned the film does have some blood in it. But the blood is rather quick and occurs infrequently throughout the film and is not very disturbing, so anyone 11 and older should be all right watching this film. Although many of them may find it too slow moving.",Tombstone

I won't admit that I own a western, so plain and simple, this one is not.It's a good movie, the one-liners will have you quoting them over and over. So, go pick it up, draw the blinds (so no one will see.. I mean for optimal movie watching) and enjoy.",Tombstone
241,cbrueggemeyer,A Great Modern-Day Western,8,21 April 2011,"I think that overall, this movie was very good. This movie takes the iconic western theme and mixes it with a modern storyline and witty humor, mainly produced by the character of Doc Holliday. This movie has great twists, and makes the audience feel uncertain and anxious about the fate of the characters. Different types of characters in this story make the audience question who can be trusted, similar to the movie Stagecoach, where no one really knows who is bad and who is good until the characters develop. The storyline of the movie is very exciting, and an array of terrible villains always provides a challenge for the Earp brothers. My favorite thing about this movie is that there isn't just one villain. When one villain dies, it seems like there are many more to take his place. Even though this happens many times, at the end of the movie the audience still has that wonderful feeling of relief seeing the main character succeed. The Cinematography and editing in the movie Tombstone is great. Fast, cutting action scenes and quick close-ups of the main heroes and villains make this movie very enjoyable. One of my favorite scenes that shows great filming techniques is the scene where Wyatt Earp kills a few Cowboys next to a train with his shotgun. At the end of the scene, the camera takes the position from a dead body, showing Wyatt Earp standing over the body with a dark coat holding a shotgun. This scene is one of those iconic scenes that make you think of movies such as The Wild Bunch and The Searchers, where the main heroes/villains show their authority over other characters by standing over their dead bodies. The editing in this movie is below average. This movie is very good, but some scenes seem to serve no particular purpose, like the scenes with Wyatt and his wife who is addicted to laudanum. The movie is 2 hours and ten minutes long, and it should be about 1 hour and 50 minutes long. I think the acting in Tombstone was above average. This star studded cast seemed to live up to our expectations, no more and no less. Some usually great actors, such as Charlton Heston and Stephen Lang, seemed to contribute almost nothing to this movie. Kurt Russell plays Wyatt Earp, the enigmatic cowboy with a habit for finding and stopping crime. Russell does fairly well in this performance, he executes the romantic scenes well but I have a hard time believing him to be the hardcore cowboy that he plays. Russell's performance in Tombstone is over shadowed by his performances in movies such as The Thing and Death Proof, both extremely scary movies where Russell gives stellar performances. Russell's performance overall is good, but I think that he could have easily been replaced in this movie by actors such as Kevin Costner and Daniel Day-Lewis. Val Kilmer plays Doc Holliday, a doctor battling problems such as alcoholism, a gambling addiction, and tuberculosis. This, in my opinion, is Kilmer's best acting role. Although Kilmer is great in movies such as Heat and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, I think this is by far his best movie as an actor. The role of Doc is a very difficult one to play, he lingers between depression and happiness constantly. Kilmer executes this role perfectly, giving insight into the effect a terminal disease can have on the human soul. Also, Kilmer has many scenes where he provides comic relief to the action packed sequences of death and destruction. I would compare Kilmer's character of Doc Holliday in this movie to Thomas Mitchell's character of Doc Boone in Stagecoach. Both are veteran grizzled doctors that wander aimlessly through life battling the effects of alcoholism. Both characters provide necessary comedic support to the stories that they are in. Overall, I think that Russell's portrayal of Wyatt Earp and Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday are both essential to the success of the movie, and both actors once again prove why they are among the elite in Hollywood.The music and sound effects in the movie Tombstone are effectively used, but are nothing extraordinary. A man named Bruce Broughton does the sound for this movie, and he does a great job adding dramatic effect to the scenes that need it. However, I think that some scenes could have used music more effectively to set the mood of the scene. For example, the scene at the beginning where Wyatt and his two brothers are just arriving in Tombstone. Scenes like this are a composer's dream. Most composers will start with a cheery, uplifting instrumental piece that will capture the audience's attention and get them ready for the scenes to come. Also, I think the movie needed more dramatic dark music during scenes where there is killing going on. This kind of music, used very effectively in The Searchers, brings the movie down to earth, and doesn't make it seem corny. The direction in the movie Tombstone is great. It seems like this would be a very difficult movie to make, having to balance the historical expectations of the story with filmmaking expectations of making the story original. I think that the director, George P. Cosmatos, did a great job with this. Costamos employs great cinematography to makes his scenes realistic, and he uses wonderful sound effects to set the mood of certain scenes. Overall, I think that Cosmatos' greatest strength regarding this movie was his casting. The cast of this movie is great, and they really help to make this movie as memorable as it is. I think that Cosmatos' greatest weakness regarding this movie is the editing. I really think that the movie was too long, and that some scenes seemed extraneous and not relevant to the storyline. I think that Cosmatos did a great job with this movie, he showed how important it is as a director to have experience.",Tombstone
242,elgee,Great Stuff !!,8,11 November 1999,"Out of all the Movies made about Wyatt Earp and The O.K. Corrall, to me, Tombstone is the finest. Kurt Russell playing the stoic Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer as the tormented gunslinging Doc Holliday, really did a job in this version of THAT gunfight as they swaggered through the film both looking invincible ( as indeed they were ) and I must say looking highly credible also. Tombstone reminds me of the fifties when most good Westerns were made, full of action, romance, a dash of humour here and there, and full too of heroes showing us how to get their man, ( or men.) And, like Westerns in the fifties, Tombstone ignores some of the truths about what happened before and after the gunfight just off Fremont Street and concentrates more on what we all pay our money to see.....men doing what men had to do. The facts? Who cares. Tombstone has the right balance of history and fiction to make it work and keep us interested in the Movie, as it gives us glimpses of the truth, then decorates it with heavy doses of Hollywood and it's determination to entertain. Val Kilmer almost steals the show as Earp's loyal side kick, but Russell held on to his character well and I think it's fair to say they came out about even. My favourite part is when the Dentist gives us a rousing rendition of musical mugs in the Saloon while responding to a testy cowboy from across the table. A table also where Earp, always in control sat with his trusty shotgun pinned underneath it and aimed at the cowboy's underbelly. That scene was about as far away from the facts as night is to day, but is was riveting stuff and the thought of it ever actually happening never really crosses our minds. Tombstone is a slick Movie, well directed by George P. Cosmatos who along with most involved in the film was hell bent on giving us a story, rather than a history lesson.",Tombstone
243,wntuc,One of the best,10,13 May 2006,"In my opinion this is one of my top 5 movies of all time--definitely the best western. How do I know--because when I come across it while channel surfing, I have to stop and watch--after all these years! Its clean (no sexual acts), fast moving and colorful. Its a movie were each character has a unique personality and appearance thus you can separate who is who. Which is my favorite character?? How can you pick one. Each was entertaining in his own way. I can also excusing the guns that never empty or historical inaccuracies. I should also add that this is a man's movie--no time wasted on the typical male bashing by macho women. The men were men and women were women.",Tombstone
244,jeffcoat,One of the best westerns of the last 3 decades,9,22 January 2004,"As with any movie involving the legend of the OK Corral, this is not history.  Script writers were limited only by their prolific imaginations.Kurt Russell plays a believable Wyatt Earp, Sam Elliot a phenomenal Virgil Earp, Powers Boothe a perfect Curly Bill, and Val Kilmer a bazaar Doc Holliday.  Kilmer's entertaining interpretation of the role is unlike any done before.This movie has a radical change in character at the mid-point.  The first half consists of introductions and character development.  There is plenty of action to carry the story forward, plenty of the tension of anticipating the next act of violence.  The focus is on the Earps and their friends and love interests, the Clantons and their allies, and the dynamics of Tombstone.  The second half is unbridled action, with no effort to tell a story.  There is little story left to tell, but the action sustains the adrenalin flow, keeping the viewer absorbed while waiting for the final details to unfold.Though the violence is more graphic then the westerns of the John Wayne era, gore doesn't become a co-star.  One of the best westerns of the last three decades.",Tombstone
245,ichobodcrane,Val Kilmers finest hour....so far...,10,18 March 2004,"""I'm your Huckleberry."" I watched this again yesterday after nearly ten years since the first time. It was like meeting up with good friend. Val Kilmer's Doc Holiday is one of the finest characters in motion picture history.Every line he utters is a gem. The director manages to get the very best from all the actors used. Powers Boothe is mesmerising as Curly Bill. He should play the Joker in the next Batman movie. Did anyone else notice the the similarities between him and original Joker, Caesar Romero. I never thought Burt and Kirk's Gunfight at the OK Corale could be bettered but this is a ""Daisy."" Bring back Michael Beihn. I haven't seen him in anything for ages. His Johnny Ringo is great. Just as psychotic as his role in the Abyss. Only one thing wrong with this and that's Bill Paxton. Not because he plays it badly, it's just that Morgan was not a good role to play.",Tombstone
246,monika-woods,Tombstone is for everyone,7,18 November 2006,"I NEVER watched Western movies. When they came on TV, I would have rather pulled weeds. ""Tombstone"" takes a classic plot, a little bit of history and a lot of action to pull you in. Kilmer's performance as Doc is beautiful. His palid complexion is by no means an indication of his performance. Doc puts heart into the old west, and gives tenderness to the harshness of what was. Kurt Russel made Earp come to life for me. Sam Elliot was perfectly cast, as he has the perfect rugged, western look. Though Tombstone was loose in the interpretation of fact (as Hollywood always is), it opened up the reality of what the wild west was to a whole new generation. It put Westerns back on the books and intrigued me to learn more about the interesting life and times of some of the earliest contributing members of our western United States.",Tombstone

How he missed out on an Oscar I do not know.Kurt Russell was very good as Wyatt Earp and played the role very well. All the acting was superb. The 'Cowboys' who are the baddies of the film had presence and style and gave the heroes some proper competition.But this was Val Kilmers film.

251,baenos,weak as hell,6,5 July 2004,"I watched this right after having seen most of ""Wyatt Earp"" on TV, and I gotta say, that movie beats the hell out of this one, even *with* Kevin Costner.  Whereas ""Wyatt Earp"" is a movie about the legend of the man, ""Tombstone"" is a dumbed-down Hollywood depiction of one instance in the West that happens to revolve centrally around that man.  Most everything that happens in ""Tombstone"", from the very first scene with ""the Cowboys"", is stylized to the Hollywood convention; ""Wyatt Earp"" presents its story in a much more realistic manner.  Everything in it feels more down-to-earth. People seem to react more in the way real people would.  This film comes across as too contrived.  The best thing about it is Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday, which I think I like a little more than Dennis Quaid's in WE, but he was quite good as well.  The facts that I've read seem to line up more with WE, too, so I'd recommend skipping this one and seeing that.",Tombstone

It uses all the tropes of the classic westerns of the 50's and 60's. Lots of gunfights, spurs and mustaches but at a certain point, one realizes there's nothing new here, everything has been done much better in other films.

257,Lady X,EXCELLENT! Highest recommendation!,10,30 April 2004,"This is one of my all-time FAVORITE films! I'm not particularly partial to movie westerns, but I AM very much interested in history, and even though there were minor liberties taken with certain details, this version was surprisingly accurate in MOST aspects of the story of the Earps, the Clantons, the ""Cowboys,"" and Doc Holliday -- moreso, in fact, than in any other film that I've seen on the subject.  (The DVD version comes with a great ""bonus"" disk which includes interesting interviews with cast and crew members, and behind-the-scenes production information.  It's fascinating to see how much painstaking effort was put into the production details, by cast and crew alike, in order to make the sets, costumes, and characters appear as authentic as possible).  The story is SO well-acted, and so engrossing and entertaining, that I found it impossible to sit and nit-pick about historical accuracy; instead, I just relaxed and went along on a VERY enjoyable ride! As an example, in one scenario in which fact is unknown but theories abound --i.e., the circumstances surrounding the demise of the real Johnny Ringo -- the screenwriters presented a theoretical, but AWESOME, showdown scene between Ringo and ....oops!...won't spoil it for those of you who haven't already seen the movie -- but it's a MUST SEE!The cast was SUPERB, with special kudos to Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp -- EXCELLENT!!! -- (made me realize that he's capable of SO much more than I'd ever seen from him before) -- and to Val Kilmer, for his BRILLIANT portrayal of Doc Holliday -- he came, he saw, and he conquered the HELL out of that part! Also, Sam Elliot delivers his usual high-calibre performance, as Virgil Earp, and...well, there really wasn't a weak link in the entire cast! -- It is truly one of the greatest groups of actors that has EVER been brought together for any one production! I've bought the DVD for myself, and two others as gifts for friends/family. I think that most people -- male OR female -- would find this film more than worthwhile. Enjoy! :o)",Tombstone
258,ravenlll,Amazing performances ...,10,4 January 2003,"by Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton (as Wyatt Earp, his two brothers and his friend, Doc Holliday).  I must start out by saying; I have a strong dislike for ""westerns"".  Even having been raised from the age of 6 in Colorado, my tastes run more contemporary, modern and sometimes even futuristic.  My partner in life and I have recently been talking about our all time favorite movies.  We have discussed many and have about 60% of our choices in common.  The other day, we began discussing ""Tombstone"" and I interrupted him saying that he could ""just stop because I was not going to watch a Western.""  He convinced me to watch the movie based solely upon Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday.
Well, I thought Val Kilmer was magnificent in ""The Doors"" and ""Heat"" and have been a fan of his since ""Real Genius"" so I grudgingly agreed to watch the movie.  Even as I put the VHS tape in the VCR, I was dreading my promise to him.  I waited to watch the movie until late last evening, ensuring a smooth transition into dreamland because I would be bored to tears and let's face it:  a boring movie is better than a sleeping pill.  Okay, here: ""You were right, honey."" This film captivated me in the first 5 minutes.  I went into the movie having little to no knowledge of the story of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday. Basically I knew their names from history; however before last evening I couldn't have told you whether they were ""good guys"" or ""bad guys."" 
The performances by Mr. Russell and Mr. Kilmer were phenomenal as I was transported back to the day of the Wild West.  Val Kilmer *was* Doc Holliday.  He oozed sex appeal, emotion, and honesty; every woman who has ever watched this movie wishes she were Doc's Kate.  Holliday was extremely attached to Wyatt Earp ~ the depth of the friendship beautifully portrayed by both actors.   Either would have given his life for the other.   The additional performances by Elliott as Wyatt's brother Virgil, and by Paxton as their brother Morgan, gave us a further glimpse into the dynamic lives of the Earp Family.   This movie has everything:  good vs. evil, comedy (Holliday's response to Johnny Ringo's pistol twirling show), action, suspense, romance and some incredibly moving and emotional scenes.  I cried twice, once almost to the point of sobbing.  It has been a very long time since I had been so moved to that point by a film.  I have watched it three times in the last 24 hours and am planning on purchasing it for my own VHS collection.

Kurt twitches a remarkable fine moustache and gives a stand-out performance, Val easily steals every scene he's in (""Nobody move!!""  ""Nonsense!

Val Kilmer gives a great performance as Doc Holiday, and Dennis Quaid did an equally fine job in the Wyatt Earp film.Tombstone has all the things you'd expect in a classic western film-- action, romance, some comedy, etc., but it's played in a way that steps out of the box. Not, perhaps, as much as something like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but you won't be disappointed. The good guys are clearly the good guys, but they are also human. The bad guys are clearly bad guys, and they are human, but evil.This is an R-rated film, but is not overly violent.

I also enjoy Michael Biehn (Sarah Connor's original protector in the Terminator movies) as Johnny Ringo.The only part of the movie that I felt was a little thin was the love story part. The scenes between Earp and Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany) felt a bit cheesy to me, and her character just struck me as being too full of herself. Also, the mental illness of Earp's wife isn't very well-explored.So, the movie works very well as a masculine/violent fantasy of rugged individualism; the love scenes aren't great but they don't get in the way too much.",Tombstone

How many people want to see two different versions, one much longer than the other? Me, for one. I think Tombstone is bad, and not in a good way. The performances are comical at times. Kurt Russell does OK in the role. Val Kilmer is terrible as Doc Holliday. Dennis Quaid nailed that role to perfection. Joanna Going is a beautiful Josie Earp and Dana Delaney is just OK. The entire cast of Wyatt Earp are so good and believable, you actually feel like you're in the room with them and seeing history play out before your eyes. Maybe some truths were stretched.

Kevin Jarre (writer) can die a happy man knowing that every movie buff who calls himself a man will continue to utter ""I'm your Huckleberry"" from their lips as a taunting provocation towards an opponent. George P. Cosmatos (Director) rounds up a cast filled with so much talent for the genre that you could say the movie was almost doomed to become one of the most popular westerns in fandom. First of all, all characters have to sport a real man's mustache, and Kurt Russell, Sam Elliot (especially Sam), Val Kilmer and Bill Paxton meet the cowboy challenge with flying colors. Even though Russell's portrayal as Wyatt Earp was solid, Val Kilmer nearly hijacks the movie with one of the best performances (arguably) of his acting career as Doc Holiday. He almost steals the movie from the main protagonist, Wyatt. The historical accurateness concerning the Earps and Clantons at the OK Corral is good enough to indulge the history buff to a satisfactory level. Some facts would clash, but minor details are most often sacrificed to the movie gods so that maximum enjoyment for the audience can be achieved. The movie involves many themes. Obeying the Law. Love. Loss of love. Addiction. Retribution. Loyalty has a strong influence in the movie on both the Cowboy side and the Earp side of the conflict. The Action is good and heroic, but the greatest part of this movie is the dialog. This aspect is were Tombstone shines above all other western films.

The evil Curly Bill (that doesn't sound so evil) and his red rag gang run amok in the Earp's newly found retirement heaven. Soon things get out of control, a few deaths are involved, and vengeance is sought, then found, then forgotten just in time for retirement #2, which costars Dana Delany. Crazy run-on sentences abound and commas come flyin' from out of nowhere. The movie itself is very solid and tells a cromulent story that is sure to embiggen the hearts of all who witness it.

This rendition of the OK corral legend, although not all that accurate from a historical perspective, was without a doubt the finest ever filmed.  Kevin Costner's ""Wyatt Earp"" was a slow moving, plodding disappointment compared to this masterpiece.  The dialog in ""Tombstone"" is simply amazing, some of the most memorable lines in American movie history. Val Kilmer came of age as Doc Holliday in this movie, he should have won an Oscar for his portrayal. If you like good movies with a great cast, run, do walk to your nearest video store and add ""Tombstone"" to your collection!!",Tombstone
269,ncochris,Best Movie I Ever Saw!!!,10,28 November 2002,"This film is amazing. I have watched it about 20 times and i never get bored of it. Kurt Russell is excellent as Wyatt Earp but by far the best performance is by Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. From the moment the film starts to the very end there isn't a moment that wont keep you enthralled. I personally am not that bothered by Western movies but this one is amazing, so even if you don't like most westerns i would recommend you watch this one anyway. The rest of the cast are also fantastic, from the Earp Brothers Virgil and Morgan to Johny Ringo. This film changed my opinion of Val Kilmer. 10/10!!!!",Tombstone
270,bigpeeler,"One of the best movies I have ever seen, western or not.",10,4 March 2003,"This movie is aces.From beginning to end, it is cinema at it's best. The cast, from stars to the extras are amazing. Please get the DVD and listen to the director's commentary. The little details about the film will endear it to you for life.The story is awesome. I'm not going to go mental as to whether or not it's 100% accurate historically. This is simply a great story.Val Kilmer is killer. Powers Booth gives a stellar performance. Michael Biehn is downright evil personified. Dana Delany is absolutely delicious. My personal favorite in the movie is Ike Clanton, played by the wonderful and underappreciated Stephen Lang.I find myself watching this movie every other week. I simply never tire of it. I have turned more people on to this film than I can count. It has everything from comedy to action to romance.I guarantee that you'll not just like, but love this movie. It is a treasure and will become a classic.""Ain't that a peach?""",Tombstone
271,alphervs,It hardly seems almost 30 years ago!!,9,17 July 2021,"""Tombstone"" is probably the best modern western--absent the syrup in the finale of John Wayne's ""Alamo"", I suspect that even though I have seen several documentaries including well-known western authors, the movie speaks for itself. As a narrative, there seems to be very little out of place here. This is a story about the gritty men who civilized the West, and those who tried to prevent it. Eventually they would clash in some very well-known confrontations, with the OK Corral being among the best known.The choice of actors is brilliant--even Val Kilmer's marvelous performance as the ""lunger"" Doc Holliday, spirited as it is, there are luminary performances in every set, especially from the extras who make Tombstone what it was in the 1880s, a boomtown fighting civilisation. When I see movies with these actors around this time period, I'm very impressed at how they got into their roles for this epic movie--the kind you see once in a generation, even with the homage to Charlton Heston! It has been nearly 30 years and there has been no western to compete with this film--and only increasingly dreary and propaganda-filled science fiction movies. That's why Tombstone was one of the last English-language DVDs I've purchased--I don't anticipate a replacement with the advent of ""cancel culture.""",Tombstone
272,QteCuttlfish,Excellent Western!,10,12 July 2004,"""Tombstone"" is a gem of a movie. It has everything a good movie should have: action, drama, romance, and comedy. An all-star cast and good writing round it out to make it an awesome film.Kurt Russell did a good job starring as retired lawman Wyatt Earp. Along with scene-stealing Val Kilmer as the best on-screen Doc Holliday to date, the chemistry between those two was awesome. They played well off of one another, and showed a deep friendship between the two legends. Other notable performances include Michael Biehn as the contemptible gunfighter outlaw and rival to Doc Holliday, Johnny Ringo; Sam Elliot as Wyatt's older, more world-weary brother, Virgil; and Bill Paxton as Wyatt's light-hearted and more innocent brother, Morgan, whose best moment in the film came with Morgan's realization of what it felt like to really kill someone, even doing it to save Doc's life.Someone else mentioned that this movie is more ""popcorn"" fair, as far as Westerns go. I don't agree. I think this movie, while not going as far as some, still manages to convey character depth, just more subtly, and I must admit, taking a back seat to much of the action. I have two complaints about this movie. One, some of the scenes were incredibly graphic. The opening sequence at the mission, designed to make the viewer despise the outlaw gang, The Cowboys, did a good job at that. But it was a little hard to take, as was the part after Doc shot Ringo. The camera angles were strange, and jarring to the eye. Two, the parts of the women in the film, aside from Josephine, were too small and not very developed. I would have liked to know more about Louisa and Allie, Virgil and Morgan's wives. But for all that, this movie is an excellent movie, and I would recommend it for anyone who likes Westerns.Note: the majority of this film was filmed at Old Tucson, a movie studio built in 1939. It's a place tourists can go. However, a fire nine years ago has changed what it looks like now, as opposed to then. But if you'd ever been there before 1995, you can recognize the places they filmed in Old Tucson!",Tombstone

However, I was stunned by the movie, not as much by the plot, even though it deserves a grand chunk of admireing, as I was impressed by Val Kilmer's interpretation of Doc Holliday - The fastest gun in the west.I strongly recommend this movie even if you do not in paticular enjoy westerns.",Tombstone

This is a Hollywood western, overacted, cliché, horse manure, the 90s equivalent of a Roy Rogers, all flair, with no depth or reality. Every line is this movie sounds like a catch phrase. Every shot in this movie looks like it belongs in a commercial or a music video.I suppose if you just want to be entertained, with brain left at home, then this crap might be for you.

Hench the reason all cowboys and harden gamblers moved in causing an extremely volatile town and ultimately the infamous GUN FIGHT AT THE OK CORREL!! Wyatt Earp is a legend that moved to Tombstone with his family and close friend Doc Holiday!

I've probably seen it ten times.This movie was very exciting and I liked many parts of it, but Val Kilmer ruled this movie.  Everyone should watch Tombstone just to see Kilmer's performance.  His Holliday was one of the best characters I've seen in a movie.  I'll never forget ""you're no daisy"".",Tombstone
280,TMoney46,Tell Em I'm Coming - And Hell's Coming With Me,10,23 January 2012,"This movie doesn't get the credit it most clearly deserves. The casting, acting, sets, script and story is magnificent. It shows a rough Arizona town - Tombstone - in the lead up to the event that put it on the map - the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.We're introduced early in the piece to retired lawman Wyatt Earp. Earp, whilst spending time on both sides of the law, was for the most part a peaceful man. At different times in his life he was a gambler, a law enforcement officer, an investor, a buffalo hunter, a boxing referee, a teamster on a wagon train and a barkeep. Kurt Russell's Wyatt is sharp, hard and rough - but behind his eyes you see a man just trying to live his life. Russell does a tremendous job of conveying the struggles of Wyatt's life as well as showing his ruthlessness in pursuit of the cowboys.Moving to Tombstone seeking his fortune (not for the first time) he gets caught up in a feud with the cowboy faction led by Curly Bill Brocious and Johnny Ringo. Earp's brothers Morgan & Virgil, their wives and the cunning gunman & outlaw Doc Holiday also move to Tombstone.It is the relationship between Wyatt & Doc which forms part of the remarkable story. One man, Wyatt, a strong lawman with values of loyalty and family and the tuberculosis ridden, womanizing, card playing murderer Doc. Holiday's only loyalty lays with Wyatt. Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc is one of the history's great pieces of character acting. How Kilmer was ignored for honours (bar 2 MTV awards) is astonishing. You could watch Tombstone just to see and hear Kilmer, who also gets most of the best lines. Playing a character racked with illness is no easy task and Kilmer carries it off with what seems like relative ease. No doubt Kilmer is one of the great actors of his time.Wyatt's develops a friendship with travelling actress Josephine Marcus whilst his relationship with his partner Mattie collapses due to her laudanum addiction. This partnership was to develop into the main one of Wyatt's life and Delaney's performance as the bubbly Marcus, while easy to ignore with all the star power around her, is quite good.Wyatt's rivalry with County Sheriff John Behan is tested due to their feelings towards Josie, and Behan's need for the cowboys to stay in town as they are good for business. Jon Tenney plays the part of politician Behan perfectly - outwardly friendly while devious behind closed doors.The shoot out at the O.K. Corral is a famous and often viewed spectacle in film - but none does it better than this. The scene is one to remember - the Earps and Doc slowly walking towards the impending gunfight in a line across the street is now an iconic image.The gunfight leads to severe retribution from both sides with Wyatt leading a vendetta against the cowboys who are seeking their own revenge on the law. One famous (and true life) scene is the face off between Wyatt and Brocious at Iron Springs - hopelessly surrounded, Wyatt treads defiantly to the middle of the river to face Brocious one on one. Powers Boothe's portrayal of the dastardly Brocious is chilling. He is able to bend the minds of his cowboys to his will, while for the most part protecting himself from capture.Michael Biehn plays the mentally unstable Johnny Ringo marvellously - he is quick to enter into a rage and his Latin wordplay scene with Doc is one of the movies memorable moments. The other cowboy offsider is Ike Clanton, played by Stephen Lang. Lang does dirty well, and he had his job cut out for him with Ike who came up against all the Earp boys and Doc at one time or another.Doc's showdown with Ringo shows the best parts of Kilmer in Tombstone before a heartfelt final goodbye between old friends Holiday and Wyatt. Their final scene together brings together the story of the two who despite their differences have a love, loyalty and respect for one another.While some aspects of the story are embellished for the film, left out entirely or changed, there is still no denying that this is one of the great Western movies. Considering there were times when it wasn't going to be made, was written off by Kevin Costner as the inferior Wyatt Earp story (he made his own attempt the following year) and all but abandoned by the studios, it's amazing how spectacular Tombstone is. The acting is absolutely top notch and the actors gel so well they make you believe they're really as bad or good in real life. Tombstone was the first Western I ever saw and is still my favourite movie of all time. One for lovers of Westerns and one for movie lovers in general.",Tombstone
281,adrian-77,a superb western of the old school,8,14 March 2001,"Tombstone overshadows its much heralded counterpart, Wyatt Earp in many many ways.  The performances are strong all round, but special mention must go to Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday, who was ridiculously overlooked in the Oscars that year.  His laconic, brave, and whimsical take on a western icon is at all times fascinating and richly textured.  He may be difficult, he may be arrogant, but Jeez can he act.  The whole film harks back to the great John Ford westerns of the past - a strong story, well acted and brilliantly told.",Tombstone

Russell is flawless as Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer, puts in the greatest performance of his life as Doc Holliday.. he is funny, moving and tragic, and steals the film away from Kurt Russell. Although I have since heard of the real events in Tombstone, and realised that these characters wre portrayed in, a very favourable light, I cannot help but feel the impact that Tombstone produces. This is thoroughly entertaining and is a good example of great story telling.  Watch it if only for Val Kilmer, even non-western fans will find it hard to flaw his performance. 9/10...Excellent adventure!",Tombstone
283,cashby,One of the best movies I've ever seen.,10,17 July 2001,"Tombstone was everything a western should be.  Considering it was filmed in the 1990's, you have to give it serious credit for authenticity in western lingo, as well as costumes, scenery and the like.  I was absolutely floored by the story and the acting.  Kurt Russell was the greatest I've ever seen him.  And as far as Doc Holliday goes, a better part for that character was never written than in this movie and no one ever played a better Doc Holliday than Val Kilmer.  I think Val is great, no role is beyond his ability to play it.  The characters he has played is in such variety, that his fans must never know what character he will play next. Tombstone made me love westerns, a genre I had not embraced (though I am a movie buff).Sam Elliot was wonderful, no one has a more serious mustache than this man, and boy does it work in a western.  Charlton Heston was a nice choice for a cameo role.  Kudos to the writer (who also wrote Glory and The Mummy). This movie is in my top 25 of all time greatest.",Tombstone

This film takes some classic historic figures from the wild west and brings them together into a well-oiled ensemble. The acting is the most impressive thing about this movie. Val Kilmer's portrayal at Doc Holiday impressed me to no end. It was one of his best performances in film. This movie certainly isn't for the grandmas or grandpas, but for the rest of the family, this movie is a sure-fire winner. This movie fits quite well in the genre of action, but it still keeps the qualities of a drama and a comedy. I approve vehemently of Tombstone. See this movie expecting a good time.",Tombstone

As Wyatt Earp (Russell) prepares to face certain death Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) moves to go with him. Texas Jack tries to stop Doc and and asks Doc why he would go to certain death with Wyatt. Doc says ""Wyatt Earp is my friend"". What follows is one of the greatest exchanges in cowboy history in my mind. I bought the whole shootin' match. I watch it a couple times a year. Good to horses, passionate with women, good drinkers and gamblers, no cussin' and truthful to their friends. Those Earp boys and the posse they traveled with in this film were Americana at its finest. You cannot go wrong with this one if you're looking for good 'ol cowboy fun.",Tombstone

After I got older and with the advent of the Clint Eastwood ""Spaghetti westerns"" I presumed good movies of the genre was of days past. Then I saw this. I knew Kirk Russell from his body of work, likewise other cast members, save Val Kilmer, was not that familiar with his body of work. If you are a fan of the ""Western"" movie genre, welcome home. This one will take you back. Thanksgiving day, 1996, my Dad sat on the edge of his seat watching this and smiling. This was the last ""Western"" he saw before he passed 1.5 months later.

In comparison to the Kevin Costner's movie with similar biography i would like to Go with this one.its pace is well set so that it doesn't get boring or feel sloppy. But still could have been a better movie maybe even a epic one. The anti hero characters are not elevated properly.i mean to stand against a Highly decorated lawman...not just him along with his brothers and a deadly Loyal friend..you should have a strong character as a anti hero.

To discover it happened in the middle of town was only one of the educational experiences.Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp gives a strong portrayal of a man who didn't want to get involved until circumstances gave him no option.However, the movie does 'belong' to Val Kilmer. He gave a real sense of fatalism as 'Doc' Holliday, wanting to die in a blaze of gunfire rather than fading away from tuberculosis.A great view of the Wild West.",Tombstone

The leading ladies without an exception failed badly in their performance. Am not sure how many have felt this. I do come across cases like this were the actors seemed to be aware of the greatness of the movie they are going to deliver that stops them from acting and trying to be part of ""history in the making"".

Walk by the TV with this playing, and kiss your next two productive hours goodbye.The script is solid, but it's performances, direction and editing where this film makes its mark. You can also throw a nice nod to the score, which supports the mood of the scenes, rather than attempt to create it.Simply put, Val Kilmer should have been nominates for Best Supporting Actor. He and Kurt Russell give the move its soul. They are the emotional core and they nail it. Russell's Wyatt Earp is my favorite of all time.George Cosmatos is an enigma. He's capable of doing this kind of work, yet he's also made some real crap during his career. The man obviously has talent and it shines brightly here. He came into the production after shooting had started, replacing the film's writer, Kevin Jarre.Despite all the scenes that were cut, this film qualifies as a western epic, and I consider it a classic. I also think this movie is what Kurt Russell will be most remembered for.""Tombstone"" is closer to the true story of the town, but is not meant to be factual.

In fact, Kurt Russell was 33 during filming and Val Kilmer was 41, thus not too young, but slightly too old for the roles.

The ridiculous moustaches worn by most of the cast put me in mind of Groucho Marx: maybe they should have titled it Duck Shoot. The screenplay had some truly unbelievable scenes, such as the terminally sick Val Kilmer arriving from his deathbed to the final shoot out. Credibility had taken a suicide dive out of the window long before this with some questionable casting and/or extreme playing of the part (Kilmer again was too Oscar Wilde-ish as Doc Holliday - he would have been blown away long ago by the hard men). There was one classic scene, though, with Kilmer upstaging Johnny Ringo's gun-twirling act - with a beer tankard. Only Powers Booth survived with his reputation in tact.

301,mreid-00151,"Good, but not THAT good.",6,15 February 2021,"I rewatched Tombstone for maybe the fourth time last night, while this is certainly not a bad film it is not what other people make it out to be. The majority of reviews on here comment on Val Kilmer's performance and I can't decry him of that, it really is superb (and I think was the inspiration for Leonardo DiCaprio's performance in Django: Unchained) furthermore Sam Elliot's portrayal of Virgil Earp is by far the most interesting of the Earp brothers and solidifies his position as one of the greatest western actors in history. This film is also one of the most accurate portrayals of western life in the 1880s and any history buff will be thrilled with this depiction.However, I find the love sub plot tedious and somewhat unnecessary but I understand why they put it in the movie, it makes it accessible to a wider audience and admittedly it does make the Wyatt's failing marriage subplot slightly more interesting. Overall I find this film deeply unsatisfying, the shootouts feel over-choreographed, bloodless and a little boring and everyone is able to fire 500 shots before reloading (I know this is common in movies, but in westerns its never been so overt).My least favourite aspect of this film though is its ability to make me cringe. Starting with the mirroring of the 3 couples in the glass moving on to the awful 'latin scene' and theatre show and ending with I think we can all agree is one of the worst slow motion ""no""s in history.To conclude, this film is worth a watch but mainly for Kilmer and Elliot the rest of the cast is fairly boring with the exception of powers booth, the story is average at best given that they had one of the most interesting sources of history to work with and the shootouts are underwhelming.",Tombstone

This was the best Western genre movie since The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.  It contains some moving emotional moments, enough humor to make you smile a couple times, and some great action scenes.  Tombstone can be watched and enjoyed at any point in the movie, yet the storyline flows effortlessly.  It doesn't contain any wasted scenes or leave any loose ends when the movie finishes.

Natuarlly being fans of Tombstone we had to check it out.I was not expecting much from Kevin Costner you seen one of his movies you seen them all.It was crap and it didn't compare in the least to Tombstone. Tombstone was awesome I am a big fan of Western movies.Val did a great job portraying Doc Holiday he's always been a virtual acting chameleon. Favorite scene besides all Doc's banter is in the first 5 minutes when he clears out The Oriental and bitch slaps Billy Bob Thornton and says fav quote ""you gonna do something or are you just gonna stand their and bleed"".You gotta watch this movie if you like westerns or action movies it's sorta of a guy movie but it's one of my all time favorites and I'm a chic in case you hadn't guessed.

There is one point I'd like to make though: the moment when Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday proves he ""wasn't as ill as he was making out"" and reaffirms he's still by far the ""fasted gun in the West"" by taking out Johnny Ringo- the pretender to his aforementioned throne before he can even draw the gun from its holster, is still Kilmer's all time screen highlight.

309,mstewart-1,My favorite Western,10,20 February 2002,"Not being a big fan of Western's, I wasn't overly excited to see this film. However, fifteen minutes in and I was hooked.  Kurt Russell gives a convincing performance as Wyatt Earp, the Kansas lawman who moves to Tombstone to start a new life with his three brothers.  There he meets up with old friend Doc Holliday (played superbly by Val Kilmer),and the story takes off.  Tombstone is tormented by an organized crime ring of men called ""The Cowboys"".  The tension builds between this group and Wyatt's group, and creates a memorable drama.  The acting is superb, and the fast paced story keeps you hanging on each scene.  I especially enjoyed Val Kilmer's adaptation of Doc Holliday.  I found myself cheering for his character, genuinely moved by his acting.  The movie has action, drama, romance, and leaves you wanting more at the end.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and recommend it highly to all movie fans, even those who do not typically enjoy Westerns.  I rate the movie 9/10.",Tombstone

Some of those one-liners were direct quotes from present sources, so using an argument like ""things people would never say,"" just because they aren't intelligent enough to research verbiage from the late 1800's, is ignorant. The Tombstone set was set up incredibly close to the real town's specifications, taken from maps, census', charters, and journals. This movie is incredible.

Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp is simply gorgeous with his steel blue eyes and cool handlebar mustache. Also, Val Kilmer was fantastic in the role of Doc Holliday as the witty, cavalier and charming gunslinger pal of Wyatt Earp. Dana Delany plays the ultimate siren as Josie who captures Wyatt's heart.The backdrop for Tombstone was a typical small western town with saloons, corrals and lots of shooting. The movie thanks to the great acting does capture the audience. The pace may be slow in places but not enough to have the viewer lose interest. The other great thing about this movie was the music.

I was not happy to see Wyatt end up with the other woman at the end, the way they obviously thought we should be. I would have been much happier if his wife had gotten her act together, and Wyatt respected his marriage, and his wife much more. Rather than going for someone who planted seeds of discontent.

This is a brilliant, brilliant film - and I'm no fan of westerns.Val Kilmer gives a stand out, career best performance (and I'm no fan of him either!!) as Doc Holliday. Kurt Russell shines as Wyatt Earp but is supported so ably by one of the best ensemble cast's of the 1990's that it never becomes a one man show. Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, Billy Bob Thornton, Charlton Heston and more put in great efforts.If you judge a film by the amount of ""moments"" that come to mind after viewing it, this is a goldmine. The shootout at the OK Corral, the confrontation between Russell and Thornton, and my two favourite moments - the drunken brinksmanship between Johnny Ringo (Biehn) and Holliday (Kilmer) in the saloon, and the climatic gun fight, when Holliday beats Earp to the confrontation in the woods with Ringo. The hairs on the back of my neck stand up just thinking about that electric scene.The film's ending is sheer joy, despite the demise of Holliday.I would strongly recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it, and you don't have to be a fan of westerns to enjoy it.

317,loserpoopoo182,Val Kilmer is absolutely brilliant.,10,30 August 2004,"Most people find Westerns a bit on the boring side, but ""Tombstone"" fits that description in no way whatsoever. This movie takes you on a ride during the actual showdown and during the events that lead up to the O.K. Corral. in Tombstone, Arizona and does a terrific job on the historical actuality of the whole story. During the journey you meet retired lawman, Wyatt Earp and his two brothers, Morgan and Virgil. Kurt Russell does a superb job playing Wyatt and I must say Bill Paxton and Sam Elliott do their rolls justice also as his brothers. BUT, the most excellent and brilliant performance comes from Val Kilmer who plays the part of the legendary, Dr. John Henry ""Doc"" Holliday. Without Kilmer's awesome performance, this film, in my opinion, would just be mediocre and no better. Instead, it is a fun-filled, action-packed blast that is just waiting to have you sucked into the story throughout it's entirety.",Tombstone

319,mojo_and_me,Overlooked Gem,8,23 July 2003,"I rented Tombstone on DVD the other night because Roger Ebert had said something about it in his Movie Answer Man column.  I had missed it at the theater, as I suspect most of America did.  This is a pretty dang good western.  The story of the shootout at the OK Corral has been told in countless films (perhaps partly because Wyatt Earp himself lived in Hollywood during the early years of the film industry -- two of his pall bearers were Tom Mix and William S. Hart) but never quite like this. Firstly, this film uses the shootout as the beginning of the story, whereas all the other films used it as the end of the story.  Also, Doc Holliday is on the same side as the Earps throughout and is portrayed (by a pale, sweaty and shaky Val Kilmer) as an educated Southern gentleman who, after being diagnosed with tuberculosis, decides to turn his remaining days into an orgy of his three favorite pursuits: Drinking, Gambling, and Killing.  The movie even intimates that he wants very badly to be put out of his misery in a gunfight, rather than die the slow miserable death imposed on him by his disease.
Kurt Russell has never been more kickass commanding as he is playing Wyatt Earp.  In a scene early on -- perhaps the most fun in the movie -- he has a confrontation with Billy Bob Thornton. Russell's steely glare and resolute bitch-slapping of Thornton establish Earp as a man to be reckoned with. I never knew Russell had it in him.  The movie itself looks great.  Lots of period detail and spectacular scenery.  The strong supporting cast includes Sam Elliott, Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, Dana Delany, Terry O'Quinn, Bill Pullman, and Jason Priestley.  Especially good is Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton, who shows us equal amounts of bravado and cowardice and sweats almost as much as Doc Holliday, but out of fear, not fever.Unforgiven was a better movie, but Tombstone is more fun. 8/10",Tombstone

""I'm coming, and hell's coming with me!"" etc. Iconic scenes: Johnny Ringo and Doc Holliday in saloon, pistolero/tin cup scene; gunfight at OK Corral; gunfight at the spring; Ringo/Holliday shootout, etc. Unusual depictions of opium-smoking, Earp's wife's addiction to laudanum, old Western funeral.

321,Vantek,Doc Holliday saves this otherwise bland production,8,4 May 2011,"Excluding him, this movie is just a typical good guy action movie off the Hollywood assembly line, of the western flavour in this particular case. A bunch of macho men blah blah blah intent on leaving their fighting days behind blah blah blah, but it doesn't go so well blah blah blah and they need to fight again blah blah blah. Obviously some romance in there as well, blah blah blah.I mean don't get me wrong, it accomplishes that kind of movie very well and that's perfectly approvable 6/10 fun in itself, nothing bad about it. Just nothing special about it either.However, there *is* something special about this movie - and that's Doc Holliday. What can I say, Val Kilmer manages to create just an absolutely hypnotising character whose magnetism would captivate you all the same no matter what genre this movie belonged to or in what setting it happened to take place in. I feel like the rest of the movie is just an inconsequential container vessel for this one mesmerising individual. I feel like all the clichés and banalities are there so that you could for only a brief moment make eye contact with Doc Holliday, nod in agreement, and just laugh together silently about the stupidity of all of it, each knowing that the other understands *exactly* how he feels.I suppose if the ""typical good guy action movie"" REALLY isn't your thing, then just this one supporting character won't be enough to bother with the whole thing, but if this kind of movie is acceptable for you like it is for me, then you will find yourself impatiently waiting for the next moment with Doc Holliday, and you'll find the wait was worth it every single time.",Tombstone

Although it is a Western movie (a type which I am not too fond of) the movie is bright, witty, and entertaining as compared to the typical drab, dull Western. Val Kilmer makes the movie with his portrayal of Southern gentleman turned drunken gunslinger =  Doc Holliday. In one week I watched the movie a dozen times. Obsessive? Yes, I admit to it. It's the type of movie that can never be seen too many times! I recommend this movie to absolutely anyone. It's a fabulous blend of action, drama, adventure, and overall fun.",Tombstone
324,rainpeace87,Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer at their Best,8,4 May 2006,"Tombstone really surprised me. I am not usually a Kurt Russell fan at all but as Wyatt Earp he was quite good in this movie. This is probably his best performance. I was not expecting much so I walked away pleasantly surprised. The plot is nothing especially unique, tension between good and bad leading to a showdown, but it does have some special qualities. The characters are well-rounded; the humor is dry and wonderful.Val Kilmer's character, Doc Holliday, is especially witty. Aside from being comic his character seems to have much more depth to it. He keeps up this persona of careless living even as he is slowly dying from tuberculosis. Maybe the fact that death was imminent encouraged the idea that he had nothing to lose. Underneath the drunken exterior Doc shows himself to be a true friend to Wyatt. Even though he is very outgoing he does not have many, if any, other true friends and that means a lot to him. I especially like the scene where Wyatt is supposed to meet Johnny Ringo for a shoot-out. He knows Ringo is faster than him and that there's no way he can beat him but he goes anyways because he feels that he must in order to get things settled once and for all. Before he can get there, however, Doc (who has a very quick hand) shows up and takes his place. Even though he was so ill at that point that he was incredibly weak he still did that for his friend because he didn't want Wyatt to die. He probably figured that since he was going to die anyways he might as well take a crack at Ringo. If he could beat him then Wyatt wouldn't have to risk his life. If not, well, at least he tried.Dana Delany is also quite good as Josephine Marcus. She is not your average woman who was ruled by men and whose only purpose was to get married and look pretty. She does not want to settle down in one place. Rather, she wants to travel around the world and see everything and, as she put it, ""live off of room service."" If she happened to meet someone (which of course she did) who could meld with her idea of life then wonderful but she wasn't going to settle for any less than she believed she deserved.This movie is definitely worth seeing. It has it all; action, romance, justice, wit and most importantly well rounded characters that you can empathize with.",Tombstone

Val got THE part of a lifetime and brought the most accurate portrayal of Doc Holiday ever to grace the silver screen. The rest of this ensemble cast work perfectly together. The movie is gripping, dramatic, while at the same time it's funny and touching. I've watched this movie more times than I know, sometimes with a woman or two trying to watch it as well.

If it was too accurate it would have been boring. Val Kilmer may not be as gaunt as Doc was in real life but I bet Doc didn't get the laughs Kilmer did. Dana Delaney was perfect as Josephine, although I have to admit the constant wagging of her head annoyed me a bit. The one major flaw in this movie is that at the very end, as Wyatt and Josephine are dancing in the snow, the music is drowned out after three seconds as the final narration begins. They should have let the music carry on for a bit. But Hey Ho. Rent it, buy it, watch it. Let yourself be immersed in this movie. It will make you feel great.

It's a powerhouse film of sheer acting talent, with Val Kilmer in what is undoubtedly his finest performance (overshadowing his triumphs in The Doors and the more recent The Salton Sea), the always enjoyable Bill Paxton, the rock-steady Sam Elliott, and a surprisingly intense Kurt Russell.  Dana Delaney is also stunning, striking the perfect balance beween the free spirit and the vulnerable artist, and making even the most jaded man-of-the-world's heart melt for her.  Michael Biehn's villain is chilling, and it's such a treasure to see this journeyman character actor show off his dark side for once. My only complaint about this film (other than wanting it to last forever!) is the direction, which is sterling in most cases, but fails to maintain the various moods in the different ""acts"" of the film.  The audience feels the foreshadowing of evil a bit too early, and then the intensity of the hunt-and-slaughter episode leading to the climax is broken by a lack of sufficient atmosphere.  Bear in mind, however, that this inconsistency is not enough to ruin the film, only a minor blemish in what is otherwise a triumphant success. No, this is not a western.  This is a great film, that just happens to be set in the old west.  I give it 8 stars!",Tombstone

Sure, I was interested but the movie was more like a photo montage than anything else. There was almost no character depth and little character development. It was if the director was trying to cram as much action in as possible. I felt as if I were watching one big commercial for over two hours. While I am a fan of many of the actors in the film, they weren't given much to work with by the director so their performances were less than stellar (but they did a valiant job). I did like Val Kilmer's acting a lot though. So, the acting was good but mainly the character depth was terrible.6/10",Tombstone

This is undoubtedly the best performances of Kurt Russell's, Michael Beihn's, Sam Elliott's, Powers Boothe's and Bill Paxton's careers.  It is amazing that all you have to do is slap a killer mustache on Kurt Russell and its like your looking at an actual photograph of the real Wyatt Earp.The main characters aren't the only ones carrying the weight.  Surrounded by an amazing cast of supporting actors are Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Zane, Jason Preistly and the long-time Hollywood favorite Charlton Heston and even Robert Mitchum's voice is familiar for the narration.The accents are extraordinary. Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday is superb, with the best accent of any of the actors in the movie.With the exception of the Blues Brothers there isn't a movie with so many classic quotable lines.  Doc Holliday and Curly Bill have some particularly memorable dialogue.The scenery and cinematography are great. I am a huge fan of the old western's but I have to admit the special effects and cinematagraphy are extraordinary in Tombstone.The biggest complaints I've heard about this movie are because of its seemingly historical inaccuracy.

I thought that the ending was absolutely perfect. The way that Doc prefered to die alone than with his friend Wyatt Earp, who was probably one of his only friends, beside him was appropriate.

What's amazing is that with all the hefty boy girl and brother stuff going on, the deepest, most moving part of the film is the love between Wyatt and Doc. As a matter of fact, even Wyatt's seeking the love of his life seems just to be the legitimate expression of his love for Doc. Val Kilmer's Doc is Bob Dylan finally showing up in the Old West -- ironic, laconic, fragile, and lovable...and just too cool for words. What satisfies in this film is that everyone in this film is over the top macho, in the most positive sense of the word. The cowboys are macho-ly bad guys, the brothers are macho-ly brothers, the wives are macho-ly wives, the actress is macho-ly woman, the coward is macho-ly cowardly, and the suggested gay actor is macho-ly suggestedly gay.

Fantastic portrayals by the tough Kurt Russell and an amazing supporting performance by Val Kilmer create the perfect relationship between the two legendary westerners. Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, Jon Tenney and Powers Boothe provide amazing roles in the background of the legend that was Tombstone. As Wyatt Earp heads to Tombstone to retire his badge for a life in business, he is joined by longtime friend John Henry ""Doc"" Holliday, as well as his young, eager brother Morgan (Paxton), the experienced, older brother Virgil (Elliott), and James and Warren Earp, (not portrayed in this movie). Trouble brews and Wyatt is caught up where he didn't want to be. The illegal cowboy faction made up of the Clantons (Stephen Lang, Thomas Haden Church), Curly Bill Brocius (Powers Boothe), John Ringo (Michael Biehn), and several other outlaws runs Tombstone, until the Earps move in.The lighting and scenery is believable, the roles are all incredibly well-portrayed, and the plot is fantastic.

I have to write a lot of things because of the 10 line rule, uggh. I visited the real O.K corral and saw a gunfight. Also, I visited the actual Birdcage Theatre, and it was really creepy, since it was the real thing. All in all, i think that the movie was mostly historically correct. Come and visit Tombstone, its amazing to see all the history here. The real Theatre, old saloons, shops with movie memorabilia, its awesome!

Val Kilmer also gave a good performance. I also saw good performances by Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, Sam Elliot, and Bill Paxton. I also loved the previews and scenes in the movie, my favorites were the confrontation of Johnny Ringo and Doc Holiday .."" vino veritas"" and the the Gunfight at the OK Corral. It had a really good cast, one of the best I've seen that worked together. I think Kurt Russell, of all actors who played Wyatt Earp, gave the best performance of all actors. He played Wyatt Earp as a larger than life figure.I like a lot of westerns, but ""Tombstone"" was most likely my favorite out of all of them. I also looked at some cool features the DVD...

What didn't work for me was the whole romance thing, but if you see it on tape, you can FF through all these.  The movie is actually a lot more clever and deep than it might appear at first. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER alertFor instance, the scene where Johnny Ringo translates the Spanish ""behold the pale horse, the man riding him was death"" foreshadows Wyatt's actions at the end (""You tell 'em I'm coming.. and hell's coming with me!"") along with the shot of Wyatt riding on the horse.  At the end, we see a glimpse of Doc Holiday's motivation.  Having lost the only thing that he ever wanted, and dying besides, what does it matter that he acts so recklessly?  It doesn't - he really has nothing to lose.  The similarity of Johnny and Holliday - both are reckless, both great gunslingers, both ""educated men"" - is neat.  And the word-off in Latin is unique to all films.   I also believe many critics miss the entire point of this movie - it's really about friendship and the western is just there as a vehicle.END SPOILERSAnyway this movie is in my top10.

It gives you a feeling of being much more realistic than most westerns while still maintaining the magic of an old west dime novel.  If you haven't seen it, your missing something.

Val Kilmer gives a solid performance as Doc. But if you watch the uneven Kasdan/Costner epic you will see a fantastic and far better performance by Quaid as Doc. Both are strong, but Quaid's is nearly by far more convincing and well rounded. Quaid went through major weight loss for the role and does an excellent job giving an ""accurate"" depiction of Doc. Outside of these performances both films fail, but Tombstone is much, much worse. Just watch the film with intent you can pick up some silly Hollywood crap.

356,bobswife,A movie to watch again and again,9,17 April 2001,"*** tiny spoiler about romance included **  I do not like action films.  I do not like shoot-em-up scenes.  I do not like movies with cursing and taking God's name casually.  I do not generally stay awake and alert during Westerns.  Why, then, did I run out and buy this after one viewing? Why do I drag family and friends over to enjoy it with me?  This movie is visually beautiful but deals with rough times and difficult themes.  The characters are full of contradiction, just as in real life. The acting is great, down to every bit part. The action does not get boring even after you've seen it enough times to know exactly what will happen.  There are more quotable lines than you can shake a Peacemaker at.  Kurt Russell -- I still have trouble believing it is he! -- is so good at creating a persona who is admirable yet unsure of the deeper aspects of life.  Val Kilmer is riveting in his portrayal of Doc Holliday: it is a hypnotically intense portrait, brimming with pathos.  PLEASE don't get the idea that it is some cerebral, talk-filled flick.  I watch the shooting and horse-riding scenes over & over because they are so clever.  But even if you only like action and bang-bang-you're-dead stuff, I guarantee you will be doing a mental ""compare & contrast"" of the characters days later, and discussing them with others. You'll be sifting thru the many fan sites devoted to this multi-layered movie and watching again and again to catch some trivial background action or piece of dialogue.  Don't expect historical accuracy -- it's a movie! -- and don't expect it to be either totally realistic or squeaky-clean. My only two complaints are that the DVD comes in widescreen while my husband enjoys full-frame (wah wah), and I don't like the silly romance between Wyatt and It's-Obvious-To-Whom, who is an unattractive person, being a 10-year-old mind in a woman's body.",Tombstone

359,alkoffice,A great American Western,10,31 July 2013,"I don't watch movies to learn great things about history, I watch movies to be entertained. For me, the desire to watch a movie more than once is telling, and Tombstone is one of those movies that remains highly entertaining with repetitive viewings. The cast is perfect, Kurt Russell is a perfect Wyatt Earp, and Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holiday is nothing sort of amazing. How Kilmer was denied the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award is beyond my understanding. In my opinion, the very best American westerns include: (number 1) The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Unforgiven (along with most of Eastwood's other westerns) and now Tombstone should be added to that short list. If you watch movies to be entertained, as I do, even if you are not a Western fan, Tombstone is an entertaining classic. Watch it and you'll agree.",Tombstone
360,diegobwriting-76940,Great Western with a Cheesy Twist,8,31 August 2021,"I was urged to watch Tombstone after my father watched a Val Kilmer documentary and was reminded of it. While I wasn't too interested at first, he forced me to watch it and I was not disappointed. Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holiday was stellar. He steals the show in almost every scene he's in, most notably in the hospital scene (""I'm dying, how are you?"" is probably one of my favorite lines in any movie ever).This movie was entertaining the entire way through, which is rare in westerns. The dialogue is great and so is the casting. My one complaint comes in the movie's pointless subplot, A. K. A. Wyatt Earp's (Kurt Russell's) relationship with Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany). I just feel like it didn't need to happen. Every scene with the both of them felt trope-y, and it kind of ruined the gritty tone that the rest of the movie had.In summation, Tombstone is a great western with some great actors, but it suffers because of the needless insertion of a romantic subplot. Had this movie not had Josephine Marcus, I probably would've given it a 9 or an 8.5, but since it does, I'm going to have to give it an 8/10.",Tombstone

Val Kilmer is great, and Kurt Russel is pretty straight up too.  I couldn't believe the number of faces I recognized.  There's a pretty green and chubby Billy-Bob Thornton that took me a minute to notice.  Towards the end the glamorization (word?) goes a little bit over the top.

I never was into western movies -- until I saw this one. After having watched Tombstone all the way through and expecting to be unable to tolerate it, I found it was completely the opposite. I was drawn into the movie. The casting, the writing, it was all phenomenal.This is not a cheap knock-off of the classics or a poorly-filmed wanna-be. Nope, this is the real deal. As far as the cast goes, Val Kilmer did an excellent job in the role of Doc Holliday. He was very convincing, especially when Doc was very ill. Kurt Russell was never a favorite actor of mine, nor did I even really care much for him, until I saw him as Wyatt Earp. His performance was similar to Val Kilmer's in that it was powerful and well-delivered.Even if you hate westerns, even if you hate some of the actors... this movie is a must-see.

I like how the director leaves the audience to figure out certain scenes as opposed to carrying the scene further than is needed.  He also is well versed it the art of filming.  The variety of shot angles was terrific to watch. No doubt about it: This is Val Kilmer's best performance ever.  I'm not much a Val fan at all, but I am a huge fan of the Doc Holliday that he portrays. These folks did their homework and it shows when details are being looked at.

I mean he can REALLY act. His best role easily. He steals the show from start to finish as Doc Holiday. Kurt Russell even exhibits some talent as Wyatt Earp, and of course a Western wouldn't be a Western without Sam Elliot. The actor who portrays Johnny Ringo also gave a great performance.The gunfight at the OK Corral is probably the highlight of the film, although there are many excellent scenes. I'm not sure if Doc Holiday says ""I'm your huckleberry"" or ""I'll be your huckleberry"" but whatever he says you'll be quoting it for months anytime someone challenges you.In summary, it's a simple story of good guys being punished for being good, and then kicking the living crap out of the bad guys - something many of people would enjoy seeing considering recent world events.",Tombstone

381,van_ecko,"Kilmer shines, the movie doesn't",5,3 November 2005,"Tombstone suffers from the weight of its cast. Including all that star power costs money, and in order to ensure a good ROI on such films you can count on the producers to gut the script of any intriguing or complex character development. The good guys will be good and the bad guys will be bad. The only morally gray area in the film is Wyatt Earp's extra-marital affair with Dana Delany's character and even that apparent stain on his reputation is rendered acceptable by portraying his wife as a self-absorbed drug addict. The only interesting aspect of the movie is Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday. He steals every scene he's in and his sardonic delivery of lines works perfectly because he knows, as well as the audience does, that he can back it up with his pistol if need be. The rest of the acting is ho-hum. Michael Biehn does an admirable job as the evil sharpshooter Johnny Ringo but he's not given enough opportunities. In my opinion the movie would've benefited from more Holliday/Ringo scenes. Their interactions were far more interesting than the pitiful clash between Wyatt and Curly Bill. In fact the final duel between Wyatt and CB just might be one of the most anti-climactic scenes in cinematic history. I've had more emotional moments brushing my teeth.And poor Kurt Russell demonstrates his inability to be a real leading man. His attempts at manifesting his internal struggles (pacified retiree vs. ruthless lawman and committed husband vs. adulterer) never quite hit the mark. It's clear that he's better suited to roles such as Big Trouble in Little China and Tango and Cash in which he's asked to do nothing more than look tough and kick ass.Tombstone is worth watching just to see Kilmer's performance, but calling this ""one of the greatest westerns ever made"" is a bit of a stretch.

I share the opinion of lots of people when they say they never really liked westerns, but after watching Tombstone...Wow!! What can I say?  Val Kilmer definitely deserved some sort of recognition for his portrayal of Doc Holiday.  This is his finest work ever. (including his role as Moses/God's voice) He carried the movie, his lines were classic, he really threw himself into this role and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I know he has a bad rap, but I find him one of the most interesting actors out there today. That's all for today...I'll be back with more praise of the GREATEST ACTOR AND MOVIE EVER!!!!!  thank you for bearing with my incredible love of this movie. (I'm biased)",Tombstone

388,Rogo-2,What more could you have asked?,10,11 April 1999,"Tombstone is my favorite movie of all time.  This film really has it all. Action, romance, comedy, and more memorable lines than any movie I can remember.  This film put Val Kilmer on the map as one of our finest actors. I've yet to see a better acting performance than his of Doc Holliday.  The feeling he puts into this role is unbelievable.  I think you truly understand the character when after saying that Wyatt Earp is his friend, the response he gets from his partner is that he has lots of friends.  Doc replies, ""I don't.""  You really have to see it to understand it, and this film is no doubt worth seeing...and not just for Kilmer.  Russell, Elliott, Boothe, and everyone else put in a five star performance.  A true modern classic.",Tombstone
389,mstsandman,Val Kilmer deserved an oscar,10,3 December 1999,"How the academy overlooked Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday just goes to prove that the best performances do not always get nominated, just the ones that are in movies considered box office gold.  I am not a huge Kilmer fan but his performance as Holliday was one of the best by an actor in a real long time.  Those of us that have seen this movie know that he was wrongly omitted from the ballot, but at least the video will let us see a great performance for years to come.",Tombstone
390,BettieB,A VERY favorable review of a fine film.,9,17 September 2003,"The mystery to me is why the Buena Vista brain trust failed to see what they had -- an incredible performance by Kurt Russell (he's so angry at one point that smoke seem to come out of his ears a la Yosemite Sam!) and an Oscar-worthy one by Val Kilmer. Were they scared of the ponderous, overlong Wyatt Earp with Kevin Costner? Did they just not watch their film? The sight of Russell, Kilmer, Sam Elliot, and Bill Paxton heading to the OK Corral is breath-taking. There's not a false note -- the wives and girlfriends, particularly the two Danas, Dana Delany and Dana Wheeler-Nicholson, are real people, not Western caricatures. The bad guys, Powers Boothe (more menacing than when he played Jim Jones), Michael Biehn, and Stephen Lang are truly scary. Billy Bob Thornton is very funny in his pre-""Sling Blade"" mode. And the wonderful narration by the late great Robert Mitchum tops it all off. I always seem to end up watching it whenever it's on. Thank Heaven for HBO, videos and DVDs -- without most of us would never have had the chance to see this fine, exciting film.",Tombstone

Believe it or not, this is an even more satisfying movie, and the biggest surprise of all is that Val Kilmer can really act. He steals the show from start to finish as Doc Holiday.  Kurt Russell even exhibits some talent as Wyatt Earp, and of course a Western wouldn't be a Western without Sam Elliot.  The actor who portrays Johnny Ringo also gave a great performance.The gunfight at the OK Corral is probably the highlight of the film, although there are many excellent scenes.  I'm not sure if Doc Holiday says ""I'm your huckleberry"" or ""I'll be your huckleberry"" but whatever he says you'll be quoting it for months anytime someone challenges you.In summary, it's a simple story of good guys being punished for being good, and then kicking the living crap out of the bad guys - something many of people would enjoy seeing considering recent world events.",Tombstone
393,zerojatrix,Brief comments...,10,14 February 2001,Tombstone is the best western movie every made. Doc Holiday is executed perfectly to bring out an overwhelming sense of loyalty to Wyatt Earp.

394,iwasahighwayman,My Favorite Movie,10,27 May 2006,Tombstone is my favorite movie because it is 90% accurate and it has everything a good western needs gunfights revenge and a love story. It builds up a feud between the Earp's and the cowboys and another one between Doc. and Ringo The only thing wrong with this movie is that Doc didn't actually kill Ringo. The acting in this movie is amazing and the actors actually look like the people they're suppose to be playing. The gunfight at the OK corral in this movie is portrayed exactly how it happened. The only two people missing in this movie is Warren Earp Wyatt's youngest brother and Old man Clanton the leader of the cowboys. This movie is the best western ever mad and it is a must see for any one.,Tombstone
395,mcadoo,Powerful,10,24 March 2001,"Tombstone is without a doubt the best oater that I have ever seen.

The Earp brothers, looking for a change of pace after their law protecting ways, head to Tombstone with their families for a new start. After a renegade group of ne'er do wells called the Cowboy try to exert their influence, the Earp's come out of retirement. Along with good friend, expert rifleman, Doc Holliday, the battle is on. Kurt Russell is at his squinty eyed best, but as mentioned, the true star is Kilmer.

So already this film has a plus point.Val Kilmer, well he is just an excellent actor and I've enjoyed every movie that I've seen him in, from Willow to Heat, to Batman Forever and many more.Now Bill Paxton, well he's just great, from his slightly manic roll in Aliens to his smooth talking cop in Predator 2, he's just a good actor.Now Michael Biehn, isn't he just one of the greatest actors around? Yes he is, Aliens, Terminator, The Abyss. He's excellent.And isn't Johnny Ringo the best character ever, his  interplay with Doc Holiday is excellent.But I think Val Kilmer steals the film just with the line, ""He's probably so drunk he's seeing double.""

It is simply the best western/action/drama to be made in the last forty years. The characterizations written for the actors and the portrayals by every actor were flawless. I love watching the scene where Wyatt is confronting Johnny, the Faro dealer, in the saloon. You see Kurt Russell's eyes change from serious to deadly serious in an instant. It's magnificent. The attention to detail in every area of the movie was phenomenal. I had never seen the West as a vibrant, colorful, flamboyant place. Yes, there was dust and guns and good guys and bad guys but these characters seemed very real to the era and easily relates to life as we know it today. I recommend it for every person who loves movies. If you particularly like westerns, it is on a par with The Searchers, Red River, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, or Stagecoach.",Tombstone

Val Kilmer in particular gave what I think is his best performance of his career. The story is very well told, and the historical details were quite accurate even if not perfect. This is a movie I can watch over and over and not grow tired. Wyatt stares down all his opponents and makes then feel they've lost before they start. Doc Holiday presented the class of a southern gentleman and the brutality of a frontier gunslinger. Complelling story and wonderful performances.

What kind of magic Kurt Russell made with this film will infect the first time viewer and bring them back again and again like a hit song. The direction, actors and costumes and sets set a high mark for all westerns.I guess I watch this film over and over because I want to live in this movie. Not many know Kurt Produced and directed with a ghost director, He would review the days shooting and then go to work. Also this script was turned down by Kevin Costner to do his version of Wyatt Earp which pales in the face of this film. A Classic that will stand with John Ford films.",Tombstone

Kurt Russell is one of the most underrated actors of all time, but he pulls off Wyatt Earp as none have before. But just when you see Russell making Earp come to life, Val Kilmer takes Doc Holliday to a new level of brilliance! It is mesmerizing to watch Kilmer BECOME Holliday as none have done it before. His manners, his words, his drunkeness, are so incredibly wonderful to watch, that as good as Russell or anyone else in the cast are, you could throw them all away and just watch Kilmer doing Doc. Many people have wondered why Kilmer didn't win any award for this, and I can only say that it is a travesty of the system. There is no finer performance in any role by any one. The Val Kilmer interpretation of Jim Morrison is almost as dead on, but Val just lives Holliday in this, they are one and the same, and it is so real that you actually forget it's a movie. The drunken sweating cup twirl is fantastic, but even before that, when he talks Latin to Johnny Ringo and then just watches as Ringo twirls his own gun in Docs face, is sheer wonderfulness.

Kurt Russell gives a fine and heart-felt performance as Wyatt Earp; Val Kilmer's interpretation of Doc Holliday is the best performance of his career [IMO] and really makes the role (and the movie) come to life. I was doubtful as to whether or not I would like this movie because (1) I'm not a huge fan of Westerns in general and (2) how many times can one possibly see the story of the shootout at the OK Corral retold? However, my fiance bought it and insisted we watch it one night, and I'm very glad we did. _Tombstone_ has become one of my favorites (thanks to Kilmer's fine acting). _True_West_Magazine_ calls _Tombstone_ ""One of the 5 greatest Westerns ever made.""Try to buy or rent the Director's Cut on DVD - lots of special features including a 3-part ""The Making of Tombstone"", audio commentary, storyboards, and an interactive time line make it worth the extra bucks.",Tombstone

410,Pscottparker1,"What a great movie!! Russel, Kilmer, and the character actors all shine.",10,2 March 2002,"One of my top ten movies of all time.  It is a great Western.  Much (but certainly not all) of the dialogue in the movie actually occurred according to the biography of Earp written by Wyatt Earp's wife.  The site of the shootout is not true to history, which is common in this genre.  After the Earp's were shot, the demise of the Cowboys was creatively characterized. In reality, Earp actually killed Johnny Ringo with a rifle shot at about 100 yards as Ringo was attempting to flee.  He did shoot him in the head, and laid him up against an oak tree, which was accurately represented in the movie.  All in all, it is probably the most entertaining and true-to-form movie on the Wyatt Earp saga yet to be made, including Costner's boring movie: Wyatt Earp.  Hope you enjoy it.  Val Kilmer steals so many scenes as Doc Holiday.  The character actors are all top notch, with excellent performances!",Tombstone
411,ryanwittenborn,Death in Tombstone,9,24 September 2007,"And behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.-- Rev. 6:8 In a time when rumors of gold and silver swept across the nation, adventurers, entrepreneurs, and criminals packed up their belongings and left home. It was the idea of striking it rich that drove these prospectors to head west. Eventually many would settle down in mining camps like Tombstone, Arizona. Liquor, gambling, and hostesses all twenty four hours a day, Tombstone had it all.Wyatt Earp (Wyatt Berry Stapp), who had made a name for himself as a peace officer in Dodge City, Kansas, was now ready to retire and try his hand in gambling. Wyatt, his younger brother Morgan (Morgan Seth Earp), older brother Virgil (Virgil Walter Earp), and their wives were going to Tombstone. One thing that the Earps hadn't counted on was trouble from the ""Cow-Boys,"" an ever-growing clan of outlaws. As Town Marshall Fred White (Harry Carey Jr.) put it, ""they're it, nobody does anything with 'em or without 'em."" The turning point is when the ""Cow-Boys"" leader Curly Bill Brocius shoots Fred White. Overwhelmed with guilt, the Earps step up to the task of keeping law and order in Tombstone. Virgil, Morgan, Wyatt, and Doc Holiday (John Henry Holiday) went to disarm five of the most dangerous Cow-Boys in what became known as the ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral."" Virgil and Morgan are both wounded, but two Cow-Boys are dead. This sparks even more violence and this time the Cow-Boys strike, under the cover of darkness, and Shoot Morgan in the back and Virgil in the arm. Virgil suffers shotgun blast to the arm, while Morgan is shot in the back with a pistol. Morgan dies less that an hour later.The enraged Wyatt has had enough, and he and his posse are out to rid the west of all who wear the Cow-Boys' red sash. Now this movie, this story, is all about one man's determination to avenge the lives cut short at the hands of the Cow-Boys. At times he seems nothing short of invincible as he travels the countryside destroying them with severe prejudice.This movie does an impeccable job of depicting what it would have been like to be in Tombstone in the early 1880s. I feel that the mindset and mentality of the frontiersman was truly captured. When I watch this movie I never feel like I'm watching actors, but rather seeing what happened as though it was recorded in some way. To me that makes a truly enjoyable movie.",Tombstone
412,www-soulreaper555,I'm your Huckleberry,10,28 September 2007,"Probably the best Western I have ever seen, if mostly due to Kilmer's outstanding portrayal as Doc Holliday. He lacks, in my opinion, much of the gruffness of John Wayne which, although good, gets boring after so many films. The look on Ringo's face when he realises his opponent is Holliday, not Earp, is priceless, and shows you just how great a reputation Doc has that a man praised as ""The deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill"" is now making excuses not to go up against him. Russel's performance is also commendable, showing a man who has seen too much blood in his life and wishes simply to settle down, but Kilmer simply cannot be ignored as the drunken but suave gambler.",Tombstone

415,adonaldson-4,Tombstone Review,10,9 November 2007,"Tombstone is possibly one of the best movies written about Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) and his brothers, Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan(Bill Paxton). The film begins in 1879 with Wyatt and family arriving in Tombstone, Arizona. Wyatt comes to here to be retired, however he doesn't get the peace he wanted. The violent cowboys led by Curly Bill (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) run the town and have in a state a of lawlessness. Soon it became a showdown at the OK Corral between the Earps and The drunken gambler Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer) against a ban of the cowboys. After that the war continues until only one side is left standing. Kurt Russell brings a great deal of heroism to Wyatt. He does extremely well in scenes where he uses his reputation to make other men back down. The cowboys parts are played quite well also from Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) The coward to Johnny Ringo the fastest gun in the west. The real star of this film has to be Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday. His lines are all said with a sort of sly confidence. This is what make his character s great in the movie. His Smart and witty which brings in humor to his part. He brings out one of the best roles played in this film. Tombstone is definitely a grade A movie. From the intense action to the humorous remarks from Doc Holiday. One of the top films of its time.",Tombstone

If only Val could bring the same quality performance to some of his other movies. Dana DeLaney is believable in her role as well. Sam Elliott can always be counted on for his contribution to a western. This is always the movie we break out on a winter afternoon and the whole family goes along for the ride! Kevin Costner didn't even come close with his offering of ""Wyatt Earp"" the next year and doesn't redeem himself until he teams up with Robert Duvall in ""Open Range"".",Tombstone
417,joynbrouwer,The Spiritual Wyatt Earp,9,19 February 2008,"""Hurts, don't it?"" Those are the first words uttered by Wyatt Earp in Tombstone, an amazing rendering of the story of the Earp brothers, the O.K. Corral, and of the Cowboys on the Arizona frontier. Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, the main characters played by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer respectively, are loyal friends. They have come to Tombstone separately to make their fortune, Earp with his two brothers, Morgan and Virgil, Holliday with his companion Kate. The Earp brothers attempt to live a quiet life, not getting involved in the lawlessness of Tombstone. Yet, the increasing violence pulls at Virgil and Morgan Earp who both agree to be town marshals. Wyatt at first resists the pull of the law, but his loyalty to his brothers win out before the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Loyalty motives Doc Holliday, as well. In a memorable conversation with Turkey Creek Jack John, Holliday reveals the depth of his feelings: ""Turkey Creek Jack Johnson: Why you doing this, Doc? Doc Holliday: Because Wyatt Earp is my friend. Turkey Creek Jack Johnson: Friend? Hell, I got lots of friends. Doc Holliday: ...I don't."" In the Old West, a man could not count on much; a true friend may be the difference between life and an early death. Earp benefits from his friends as he rides to end the reign of the Cowboys following the death of his brother, Morgan. There are deep spiritual truths within Tombstone. As mentioned above, friendship and loyalty are highly valued in this film, even by the ""bad guys."" The Cowboys back up each other's actions, just like the Earp brothers and Doc Holliday. Another is the difference between revenge and a reckoning. ""Sherman McMasters: If they were my brothers, I'd want revenge, too. Doc Holliday: Oh, make no mistake. It's not revenge he's after. It's a reckoning."" What does Holliday mean by this? How does he differentiate between revenge and the Old Testament idea of a reckoning? The Cowboys have certainly done some horrific things. They had created a hell for the people of Tombstone; Wyatt Earp put an end to that. Yet, it was not until Morgan was killed and Virgil was maimed that Wyatt took decisive action. This would certainly put his actions into the revenge category. Personally, I think there is more weight for the revenge argument, but the Cowboys were not innocent. Wyatt did not have crystal clear motives, but his actions are justified. I loved this movie and enjoy watching it over and over! Full of great lines and interesting characters!",Tombstone

The cast is wonderful, and they ALL did a SUPER JOB!! They paint the PERFECT picture of those days and it makes me wish I lived in Tombstone when this all took place.

427,leecalypso,You're a daisy if you do miss this film,9,17 September 2005,"Val Kilmer's turn as Doc Holiday has a cult following among film fans. Watch ""Tombstone"" and see why. His Holiday -- an alcoholic, tubercular Southern aristocrat who spouts Latin in one scene and kills a man in the next --resonates even with those of us who don't like Westerns. Kilmer delivers some hilarious lines, and he plays Holiday as the dandified rapscallion we expect. But what makes this portrayal so unforgettable is that he gives us a peek into Holiday's self-destructive soul, too. Kurt Russell is wonderful and subtle as Wyatt Earp, but it's Kilmer who walks away with the movie. Surprise casting alert: Wyatt's wife, Allie, is played by Paula Malcomson, who a decade later plays Trixie on the HBO series ""Deadwood.""",Tombstone

The Good Guys are rough and the Bad Guys are rougher! Powers Boothe IS Curly Bill Brocious! Russell's slap down of B.J. Thornton and Michaels Biehn's showdown with Kilmer is worth the Rent/Buy of the movie alone. Russell, Elliott & Paxton turn in great performances as the Earp Brothers. As in true western genre, its great to have movie icons make appearances - Charlton Heston, Harry Carey Jr & Robert Mitchum (narrator).",Tombstone

Add kilmer in the mix as doc holliday and you got yourself a hell of a movie. If you like westerns you will no doubt love this film. Russell plays a good Earp displaying a powerful internal conflict between doing what he thinks he's earned and doing whats right for his family and the community.

When I think of all of Val Kilmer's performances that I have seen ( which believe me are a lot)this one always comes to mind first as well as The Saint and The Ghost and The Darkness. Kilmer has the most memorable lines combined with awesome action scenes that all really come off nicely. Kilmer definitely deserves an Oscar for this performance. I love the action and personality each character brings to the table. If I had not already seen this movie I probably would have critiqued it for my Film class. The side track it took sometimes with Wyatt's wife and her addiction to Laudanum was detracting to the overall picture but nonetheless it is still extremely entertaining. Also any movie that shows Billy Zane that pale and girly is worth watching",Tombstone

Tombstone does an excellent job capturing the look, feel, and grit of the old West.Val Kilmer steals the show as Doc Holliday, and the rest of the all star cast is what pushes this movie over the top.  The first time I went to see this movie, I had no idea what it was about or what to expect.  Needless to say, it was one of the best movie surprises of my life.
I also purchased the directors edition of this movie on DVD.  While the extra scenes were nice, and a few questions were answered, I don't think it added much to the overall theme of the movie.  In fact, there was one part with Doc Holliday doing a monologue type thing to the camera.. which should have been cut.  I had no idea how that scene added to the movie.

This film also has dozens of quotes that are fun to intermingle with every-day conversations (""I've not yet begun to defile myself"").

435,zqtoler30,Tombstone,10,9 November 2012,"""Tombstone"" wow what can I say it's just an amazing movie. I think this one of my all time best cowboy movie. I think it is up there with John Wayne's movies. The villains are great, the backgrounds or scenery is mind blowing, and don't forget the gunslinging. It makes you feel like it was real. It is just an all time classic movie. Also what makes the movie even better is that it is based on true people and events. ""I'll be your huckleberry"" says Doc Holliday and in this case I'll be your guide to seeing this movie.The acting is very good, the main actors are Kurt Russel (Wyatt Earp), Val Kilmer (Doc Holliday, Sam Elliot (Virgil Earp), Bill Paxton (Morgan Earp) and Powers Boothe ( Curly Bill Brocious). They all did a splendid job as villains/heroes. They made it feel like it was back in the 18th century and we were all deputies and cowboys. The scenery was all so very good. It was filmed in Arizona, because of the plateaus and the red sand which mimics the area where tombstone actually was. They probably would pick Arizona because there are many spots that are inhabitant to people, and because there aren't as many roads every where like California. The gunslinging is always the best part of cowboy movies to me. Doc Holliday in my opinion has the best gun slinging part. It seems like the hero's always win but there are twists in this movie that you won't see coming. People may not like this movie because there isn't much gore or blood but there are good amounts.The movie ""Tombstone"" is a great movie, for those cowboy fans! It's about a ounce was deputy Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russel), who was from dodge city and cleaned it up, who just stopped working as a deputy and moves to tombstone to become rich. He meets his brother up there and a gunslinger, drinker, and gambler Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer). When Wyatt just gets there he notices that there are people every wear who have red sashes. He asks the mayor why they are wearing sashes and the mayor says that they are a gang of outlaws who call themselves the ""Cowboys"", and they have been starting trouble in that region.",Tombstone

437,mkarindash,Val makes it a masterpiece,10,9 February 2008,"This is one of the best westerns ever made, and one of the best movies ever made. What makes it one of the best is VAL KILMER. Without him, it would've been a good one, but with him, it is a masterpiece. Doc Holliday himself was sure bigger than life. And Val is bigger than him, and much bigger than life. Not giving him the Academy Award he unquestionably deserved here is more than a mistake, it's a wrongdoing. I am certainly one of the many who would never forgive the Academy for that. This usually-underrated suprastandard master should be given his value and respect. And he should be in such exceptional themes more, no matter ""leading"" or ""supporting"". He leads even when he supports. He enhances, and he makes it prime. As a movie critic of decades, if I'm asked the best three performances (leading/supporting) in the history of cinema, I would admittedly take my time to choose the second and the third, but I would say the first without thinking a second: VAL KILMER's DOC HOLLIDAY. He just diffuses the whole movie into your bloodstream. He makes you love watching it and keeping it in your memory forever.",Tombstone

I love that movie. That movie was the best. I want to watch it every day. That graphics they put in that were awesome. The other actors were great. I love Doc Holiday in that movie he's so wise and funny. Sucks that he dies though. Kurt Russel is a amazing actor I thought he was excellent. My dad likes that movie also he thinks it's great.

Good vs. Evil. The Western movie genre is one of the backbones of modern western world. Tombstone is more than a western, it's a tale of greatness and courage. Where would a hero be without his faithful followers? Well, Wyatt Earp is not alone, as no man can fight and win a war alone. His two brothers and his old friend Doc rides with him to war like the four horsemen, as predicted by Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn), as he speaks of the horseman on the pale horse. The script includes a line that burned to my memory: ""I'm coming, and Hell's coming with me!"". Wyatt (Kurt Russel) unleashes Hell on the Cowboys, the first gang of organized crime in American history.All characters are top notch casted and it's just a great story. Normally, Kurt Russel don't impress me that much, but he's magnificent as Wyatt Earp. My favorite, however, is Powers Boothe as Curly Bill. Buckle up and enjoy!",Tombstone
440,maryyoung1,Excellent- Kilmer at top of his game,10,6 March 2005,"This movie is excellent. Val Kilmer absolutely should at least have been nominated for an Oscar- more than any previous actor I have seen-Douglas, Mature, and more recent portrayals, he WAS Doc Holliday. The physical debilitation, the polished gentleman on the skids, the whole nine, was there. Whether the genius was actor, director, or both- his Doc Holliday is a tough act to follow. All the other actors were top notch -making the ensemble seamless. Newer efforts like Deadwood are interesting experiments in ""realism"", but real art is worth watching over again and enjoying. Tombstone will stand the test of time.",Tombstone

Val kilmer gives a masterful performance in imitating the irrepressible ""doc"" Holiday who seems to care not whether he lives or dies as long as he has a good time and looks out for his inner hero ""wyatt Earp"" doc has an almost hypocritical love for his only real friend and in turn Wyatt equally hypocritical uses his friend's obvious love of violence and cavalier attitude to life to drive home his own rules of obedience.",Tombstone

A far cry from the dark brooding and pathetically boring Wyatt Earp with Kevin Costner which came out the same year. And not as dreary as Unforgiven. The box office doesn't lie. Tombstone cleaned up just like the Earps cleared out the Clantons. And this may have been Val Kilmer's finest appearance on film as Doc Holliday.

I loved his arrogance, vulnerability. Doc Holliday was very noble even though he did a lot of bad things like killing a lot of people.

Sam Elliot, although never straying too far from his characters in film to film, is pretty solid in this. Kurt Russell does a fairly good job in his role.

Every scene of this movie is exceptionally memorable, exciting, and important to the plot. Tombstone encompasses all of the aspects of a true western, including shootouts, action, loyalty, right vs. wrong, law and order, cowboys, and horses without being campy, played out, or predictable. In addition to being an overall entertaining film, it has a lot of style and substance. There is also the connection that can be made to the Book of Revelations This is made apparent in the opening scene when Johnny Ringo, a cowboy, acts a a translator for a Mexican priest who quotes the bible saying ""behold the pale horse. The man who sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."" This parallels Kurt Russel's character, Wyatt Earp, and provides some foreshadowing for the rest of the story. A compelling, action packed classic and one of my absolute favorite movies (you also can't beat Sam Elliot as a cowboy)!!",Tombstone
448,AbigailBar,"Amazing Film, but could be more accurate",10,22 April 2016,"Tombstone is my favorite film. However after learning about the historical OK Corral shootout that the film was based off of, many details in the movie are changed, like the relationships between the historical figures. Its lead me to feel the importance of historical accuracy is something that needs to be discussed.History is an important subject, it can help people learn from past mistakes, learn about their heritage, their family, different cultures, and by Hollywood films changing things in order to make some money, it hurts the learning of the truth. People are watching these movies and mostly assume that they're accurate, and it leads to a lack of true knowledge and understanding . By simply making these movies have more accuracy or possibly at the end of the movie encourage their audience to research the historical event, we as a society can gain knowledge and continue to make history.Until directors and actors are able, historically based movies will continue twist and change historical facts and events. The problem with this is that they will continue to cause a false sense of knowledge, it will disrespect the people who were there during the time depicted in a film if the director decided to paint them as someone they weren't and will continue to teach our generation false information.",Tombstone

455,nick-1227,"A winning combination of violence, romance, thrill and heroism",10,21 December 2005,"The opening to the film sets the scene beautifully. What appears to be an old film, cleverly well captured to create the illusion of a historic background. However note the spoof of the obvious silhouette of Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday.The first scene is an interesting sketch, gaining the audience's favour against the cowboys. This is an important point, as it is the basis for the film. What is most impressive about this scene other then the introduction of the well read Jonny Ringo, is the end of scene cut. This should be highlighted to any director of when, and how to cut. The scene ends with the quote from Revelations ' Beyhold the pale horse, and the man one him was called death, and all hell followed'. This is very well directed as the next items to appear are Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp riding a train. Reading more into this, it is a premonition of things to come, mainly Wyatt Earp being the destroyer of the cowboy gang, in other words the one bringing death to the cowboys.The next, and perhaps most delicious, extrovert and intriguing item i wish to draw to your attention, is the relationship between the cool, calm and sophisticated John 'Doc' Holiday; and the legendary peace officer Wyatt Earp. These pair somewhat resemble the odd couple, and make the movie what it is, in particular Doc Holiday. IT is this type of skillful writing and acting that make you wish you could travel back in time and become that character. The perfectly timed whit rivals modern day comic actors, and the slick comments make you want to base your existence around being Holiday's persona.Furthermore the scene toward the end of the film, in which we see the final showdown between Holiday and Ringo, is one of several climactic events. This in my opinion is the greatest of them, because of the lighting, and because we get to see for real how quick Holiday is at drawing, combined with his skill, and deadly aim. When Holiday does draw his gun, it is like a perfectly rehearsed dance move, the elegance of the movement, and the calm, effortless look on his face add to the hype of this single moment. This scene is why i class this film as my favourite movie of all time.Finally, a very good reason why this film is so entertaining, is because it offers more then a well plotted western. Aside from this, it offers a captivating tale of love, lust and flirtation. This intricately worked love story is between Josphene MArcus, and 'the tall glass of water' Wyatt Earp. This is different to most chick flick love stories, because it seems real, and is believable.In conclusion, i may not be an expert on films, but i can give many, many reasons why you should watch this film. It appeals to varied audiences, and because it is based on a true story, it makes every aspect more thrilling.",Tombstone

457,TheRealGrizzlyMan,Legends don't just fade away,8,11 January 2006,"A very entertaining film, with plenty of action and some very strong characters.Famed lawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) goes to Tombstone, Arizona, to retire with his brothers Morgan and Virgil (Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot) as part owners of a saloon. Upon arriving in the lawless boomtown, they run into Earp's old companion, ""Doc"" Holliday (Val Kilmer).Trouble soon begins when the local bad guys, a group that calls themselves the ""Cowboys"", learn of the Earps' arrival, and try to show the Earps that Tombstone is their territory. Further complicating matters, at the same time, a new woman enters into Earp's life. Despite his wishes to retire to a quiet life at the poker table, Earp and his brothers are drawn into yet another fight, having to choose between living out the rest of their days as they'd planned, or doing what's right to save their town. After the Cowboys go too far, however, the decision is clear to Wyatt Earp: the Cowboys need to be taught a lesson, and he's just the man to teach 'em.A tale of revenge, vengeance, and legend, this movie is well made and exciting. Kilmer is fantastic as the brash, suave, gambling Holliday, and is a perfect compliment to Russel's Earp. Michael Biehn gives a solid performance as the dastardly Johnny Ringo, main nemesis of Holliday and the Earps.
