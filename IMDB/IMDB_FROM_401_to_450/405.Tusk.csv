0,SnoopyStyle,disturbing without tension,5,4 September 2015,Wallace Bryton (Justin Long) and Teddy Craft (Haley Joel Osment) do a podcast in L.A. Wallace's girlfriend Ally Leon (Genesis Rodriguez) doesn't like his new mean nature. He goes up to Winipeg to interview an internet sensation who accidentally cut off his own leg. He finds the kid is dead and he has a new target after reading a note in a bar bathroom. He meets Howard Howe (Michael Parks) at his isolated mansion who has many wild stories. Guy Lapointe (Johnny Depp) is an ex-Quebec police inspector.Kevin Smith seems to be mashing many disparate things together. It has a little bit of Misery and body horror of David Cronenberg. It's nowhere near as good of either of them. There is no tension in this movie. Then Johnny Depp shows up with yet another one of his wacky characters. Smith has added some Wes Anderson style and created something very strange. It's not without its appeal. This is very quirky rather than anything actually scary.,Tusk
1,Horst_In_Translation,You will never see walruses the same again,6,22 May 2015,"This is a 100 minute movie by prolific writer and director Kevin Smith. The cast is pretty good It only consists of four people really, but all of them played their parts well. The first half belongs to Justin Long, the second half belongs to Johnny Depp (almost unrecognizable). Also in there are the stunning Genesis Rodriguez and Academy Award nominee Haley Joel Osment (""The Sixth Sense""). The latter two have an affair with Long's character being the real boyfriend to Rodriguez' character. However, he constantly cheats on her and treats her and everybody else like crap. Osment's character really loves her and comforts her and this is how the two became a couple. Obviously they made Long's character as despicable as possible, so you will not really have too much sympathy for what happens to him as the film goes on. The two guys have a show together, so Long's character travels to Canada to find interesting people to talk to and interview for their program. He finds a note and visits an old man's house. Sadly, that one has no good things in mind and intends to transform his victim into a walrus to re-enact a scene from his life from many decades ago. In the end, the evil guy gets into a walrus costume himself and the two fight like real animals.This was one of the weirdest things I have seen in a long time. The moment Long's character was seen for the first time as a walrus was like the biggest wtf-moment ever. The whole thing can probably be categorized as a horror movie, but it is all so absurd that it can also be described as comedy. There were a couple funny scenes, like when they call the police in the car and say ""not-see party"" and the police officer immediately hangs up. This was the funniest moment for me. Or another (not so) funny scene when he says he does not want to die in Canada. And it works as drama too. That final shot one year later was actually pretty sad. I recommend this film especially to people who liked ""The Human Centipede"". It reminded me a lot of this one. Or just to people who are looking for something different. As weird as it gets.",Tusk
2,nogodnomasters,"Man you been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long",6,24 January 2018,"Shock pod-caster Wallace (Justin Long) not to be confused with Walrus, has a bad day when he encounters Howard Howe (Michael Parks) who lives a life inspired by Hemingway, Coleridge, Kathy Bates, and Centipede. There are a number of humorous scenes that worked and some of the humor grew tiresome such as the poorly scripted Guy Lapointe (Johnny Depp) character. The flashback scenes attempted to create a story that had meaning, but fell short. At times, the film's sole purpose appears to be to make fun of Canadians, picking up where ""Canadian Bacon"" left off. While I loved the smart ""torn between Devils and Kings"" line, the Lapointe character drove the satire into the ground.Cult Movie.Guide: F-bomb. Sex. No nudity. Male walrus bone. No Trojan marching band.",Tusk
3,kosmasp,Better than the Human C...,6,5 July 2015,"Kevin Smith came back. While he said he was done with filmmaking the idea of making this gross movie somehow got him to retract from his original plan. As Pacino would say ""Just when I thought I was out ... they pull me back in!"". In this case ""they"" being stories about what the movie is about, not Human Centipede (with which this is kinda rightfully being compared).Kevin Smiths talk track on the movie is insightful, though it might be a bit too much for some. A bit too much can also be attributed to the movie as a whole. This is not for the faint hearted mind you. This is not your Clerks movie or anything like it. Though the bits with Haley (I know, if you watch Sixth Sense before this and then this, it might be a shock to see him like this) and Justin could be attributed to that genre, but they are not the main focus here.The fact that Michael Parks is in the main role (was also in Smiths Red State) elevates this movie for me. While it still can be unbearable (even unwatchable) to some, the acting cannot be faulted",Tusk
4,classicsoncall,"""...is man indeed a walrus at heart?""",7,28 March 2015,"With apologies to John Lennon, you'll not be singing 'I Am The Walrus' when this is over. Had I known the end result myself I might not have gone into the picture, as it's generally a disgusting journey into a unique kind of depravity. One might suggest that this is what happens when one has an abusive childhood like the character of Howard Howe (Michael Parks) did, but going off the rails like he does here is just beyond the pale. Nor am I a fan of the casual gutter language expressed by idiot fanboys Wallace (Justin Long) and Teddy (Haley Joel Osmont). For that you need a master like Joe Pesci. I don't doubt the movie has it's niche of fans who go for the quirky and the offbeat, but for most viewers, enter at your own risk.",Tusk
5,gavin6942,Surprisingly Absurd,7,24 March 2015,"When podcaster Wallace Bryton (Justin Long) goes missing in the backwoods of Manitoba while interviewing a mysterious seafarer named Howard Howe (Michael Parks), his best friend Teddy (Haley Joel Osment) and girlfriend Allison (Geneis P-Orridge) team with an ex-cop (Johnny Depp) to look for him.I approached this film with more than a bit of hesitation. Reviews have been mixed or negative, and it is no secret that Kevin Smith makes more garbage than winners these days. His only real high point since the 1990s was ""Red State"". So, this was not likely to be good.And yet, I liked it. Maybe there is something wrong with me. Despite the sheer madness of it, and the rather annoying character played by Long, there was so much dark humor in here to really make me laugh. And Johnny Depp gives his best non-pirate performance since... well... a long time. Michael Parks is in top form, and is the driving force of this movie. But then, Michael Parks is always the driving force of the movies he is in (again, see ""Red State"").Even Kevin Smith failed to ruin this for me. His writing is not as tight as it once was, but Parks knows how to take a weak script and give it life. And the direction is actually much tighter than Smith is known for (he tends to excel on small sets, not knowing what to do with the camera if it needs moving, but actually kept it together for multiple locations). This might be because James Laxton (""Bad Milo""), a newcomer to Smith's world, was handling camera duties.Anyway, I liked it. I am probably in a small minority, though.",Tusk
6,BA_Harrison,Kevin Smith does body horror.,5,1 June 2019,"Kevin Smith is a film-maker who has pretty much always done things his own way, building a rather unique and diverse filmography; Tusk is definitely one of his strangest efforts. It's a bizarre body-horror movie that sees a twisted Canadian serial killer called Howard Howe (Michael Parks) using makeshift surgery to turn brash American podcaster Wallace Bryton (Justin Long) into a walrus. The whys and wherefores I'll leave for you to discover, suffice to say that the film is totally insane.Unfortunately, as messed up as Tusk undeniably is, it's not one of Smith's better efforts: it's far fetched (albeit intentionally so), overly talky (as per every Smith movie), and at over 100 minutes, about 20 minutes too long. The dialogue isn't terrible - Smith is more than capable of writing witty conversation - but there's simply too much of it, and this causes the movie to drag. And as much as I admire make-up man Robert Kurtzman, his man-turned-walrus effects aren't among his best work.I'm glad that Smith is able to get such weirdness out of his system, and admire his willingness to explore material that most film-makers would leave well alone, but Tusk proves that if body horror is to be done by any Canadian, then that person should always be Cronenberg.",Tusk
7,paul_haakonsen,When you turn into something that you never thought you could be...,5,8 July 2018,"I was recommended to watch ""Tusk"" granted my fascination with horror movies and the macabre. And I hadn't already seen this, so one of my friends strongly recommended that I did so.So I did. And I will say that the concept of the movie was very interesting, sort of as a modern twist on the Frankenstein story.""Tusk"" did indeed have some good acting performances that helped carry the movie, and there was a good cast in the movie. I will say that Justin Long really carried the movie well, and it was sort of an interesting thing to see him in a movie as bizarre as this turned out to be. But the icing on the cake had to be Johnny Depp's character and his performance, that was just hilarious. But it was also a rather good performance by Michael Parks, although it was far from being the crowning achievement of his entire acting career.The walrus creature, however, looked so horribly fake that it just didn't work out for the movie. It was laughable to look at, and it was so difficult to take it serious in any possible means. And the way that one would isolate oneself and assume the demeanor of an animal just didn't make much sense to me.""Tusk"" is hardly the type of movie that you will watch more than once, because the storyline and the movie itself just doesn't have enough material to support more than a single viewing.",Tusk
8,Coventry,As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a  Walrus?!?,5,15 May 2015,"It's been several days now since I watched ""Tusk"" and I still can't figure out what to make of it At least I can state in all honesty that I didn't hate it. That already means quite a lot, because many reviewers around here and members of this website's horror forum absolutely loathe ""Tusk"" with a passion. Personally I admire writer/director Kevin Smith for the variety and creativity that he inserted into his career since 2006 or so. I've always been a fan of his crude comedies (particularly ""Clerks"", ""Dogma"" and ""Mallrats"") but admittedly the formula and style became rather derivative after the Jay & Silent Bob movie and the redundant sequel to ""Clerks"". Apparently Smith realized this as well and thus brought more versatility in his repertoire, first with a different type of comedies (""Zack and Miri make a Porno"" and ""Cop Out"") and now with horror/thriller/comedy hybrids. I liked the raw and gritty atmosphere of ""Red State"" and I definitely also appreciate the grotesque absurdity of ""Tusk"". The horror concept of turning human beings into animals – or vice versa – certainly isn't new. There are the legendary adaptations of ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"", but also titles such as ""The Alligator People"" and more recently the infamous ""Human Centipede"" franchise. However, I don't think that anyone ever came up with the idea of a human walrus, and even though it doesn't immediately sounds realistic or petrifying, ""Tusk"" certainly does contain a couple of uncomfortable and shocking moments thanks to a handful of terrific dialogs and the fantastically menacing charisma of lead-actor Michael Parks. The legendary Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez regular stars as Howard Howe, an eccentric adventurer at rest living somewhere upstate in the backwoods of Manitoba, Canada. Howe captures the attention of Wallace Bryton, a popular Californian podcaster – with a ridiculous mustache – who's in the area and desperately needs a replacement interviewee because the one-legged kid he had an appointment with committed suicide. Wallace is a guest at Howe's mansion, but rapidly and physically experiences that he's a deranged psychopath who wants to bring Mr. Tusk back to life. And who's Mr. Tusk, you ask? Mr. Tusk is the walrus – either real or imaginary – that Howard Howe met and unfortunately had to kill during one of his arctic adventures. While Wallace surgically transforms in Mr. Tusk, his girlfriend Allie and fellow podcaster Teddy team up with the odd Canadian detective Guy Lapointe in order to trace his whereabouts. ""Tusk"" is mostly entertaining, but also far too talkative and full of flaws. It's kind of like a ""light"" version of the aforementioned ""The Human Centipede"", with a lot less sickness and gory make-up effects. I really liked the scenes with the crazed and mad-raving Michael Parks, but all the interactions between Wallace and his girlfriend (mainly through flashbacks) are boring and pointless. Oh, and that kid from ""The Sixth Sense"" got really ugly",Tusk
9,LeonLouisRicci,"Creepy, Spooky, and Kooky",7,13 March 2015,"Director/Writer Kevin Smith has made statements about Giving Up Filmmaking. Insecure Notions, it seems, to bait People with a Seeking of Approval. There is No Need. He is a Gem. A Unique Talent that has gained a Cult Following and Mainstream Dollars are only Likely to Corrupt His Vision.An Underrated Movie Maker, Kevin Smith is not afraid to Genre Hop and try New Things and the Fans of B-Movies are the recipients of an Entertaining, Offbeat, Bizarre, and Edgy Imagination that is Welcome in Fanboy Circles.

10,zardoz-13,Walrus--NO!!!,1,5 January 2015,"When I saw this movie for the first time, I didn't know whether to laugh or puke or laugh while I puked. ""Clerks"" director Kevin Smith has clearly lost his wits and this tale of the love of a psychopath for a walrus and the deranged state of being of the psychopath sees him at his creative nadir. This is the kind of nonsense that would go down well at a kegger bash in a basement with a disenfranchised fraternity. Despite the splendid cinematography and Michael Parks' devil-gone-to-hell performance, ""Tusk"" is not worth watching more than once to grasp its infamy. The psycho named Howard Howe that Parks portrays with brilliance is a victim of the scores of pedofiles who raped and sodomized him at an insane asylum. Howe managed to escape their clutches and take refuge aboard a ship. Inevitably, he didn't get far because his ship sank and everybody perished but he. He swam to and island and befriended a giant walrus. The relationship didn't last and Howe wound up dining on walrus. Afterward, he returned to his native Canada where his misfortune began and turned to murdering innocent victims.This is where ""Tusk"" takes its malicious twist. Howe turns his victims into giant walruses. Enter Wallace Bryton (Justin Long of ""Live Free or Die Hard""), a radio personality who has found a likely subject for his depraved broadcast. He wants to interview for his show a child known as the 'Kill Bill Kid' because this lad accidentally sliced off one leg with a samurai sword. Indeed, Smith based his 'Kill Bill Kid' from the 'Star Wars' Kid of many years ago. Unfortunately for the insensitive Bryton, the 'Kill Bill Kid' commits suicide before Bryton can interview him. Despite his chagrin, Bryton refuses to leave Canada until he can find somebody to interview to replace the ""Kill Bill Kid.' While he is relieving himself at urinal in tavern, Bryton spots an offer of lodging from an individual who claims to have many stories to tell. Intrigued by this enigmatic person, Bryton arranges to meet him. This turns out to be a tragic mistake for the cocksure Los Angeles-based broadcaster. The sneaky Howe laces the hot tea that he serves Bryton with knock-out drops. When our protagonist awakens, he discovers to his horror that he is missing his left leg from the knee down. Desperately, Bryton calls his girlfriend as well as his best friend by cell phone, but he is too late. Howe carries out insane operations that transform Bryton into a human version of a walrus. Eventually, Bryton's partner Teddy (Haley Joel Osmont) and his girlfriend (Ally Leon) rush to his rescue and enlist the aid of an Inspector Clouseau-like detective, Guy Lapointe (Johnny Depp of ""The Tourist""), who helps them track down Howe.Mind you, Smith has some quirky ideas about what constitutes humor. Bryton looks hilariously awful as a fake walrus; he appears to be a man stitched up in a sack with tusk protruding from his face. At 104 minutes, ""Tusk"" wears out its welcome. The first 30 minutes is given over to setting up this nonsense. Smith doesn't indulge in bloody montages. The cameras sway over bloodied instruments and then we are shown the hero in a sack of skin. ""Tusk"" isn't insane enough to be perverted and just lackluster enough to be intolerably bland. This movie is a half-baked joke with not enough stitches. Skip it!",Tusk
11,grantss,What on earth was Kevin Smith thinking?,2,23 April 2016,"What on earth was Kevin Smith thinking?Two friends, Wallace (played by Justin Long) and Teddy (Haley Joel Osment), produce a pod cast show out of LA. They interview (mock, more like) weird people on their show. For their latest interview, Wallace goes to Canada, only to discover that the interviewee has died. Loathe to return to LA with nothing to show for his efforts, he sets out to find an interesting person or story. His search leads him to the middle of nowhere and Howard Howe (Michael Parks), who has a very keen interest in walruses...Directed by Kevin Smith, this is one of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen. Kevin Smith made his name making stoner-slacker comedies in the 90s and 00s: Clerks (which is brilliant), Mallrats, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, to name but a few. In 2011 he made Red State, a drama that focused on religious cults and terrorism. While not brilliant, it was reasonably good and, moreover, was quite a radical and interesting departure for him. Surely this was the start of the new Kevin Smith, the one who makes biting, insightful dramas?Sadly, it was a false dawn. Tusk is his first feature film since Red State and it is atrocious. Plot is very stupid, going out of its way to gross people out. It reminds me of Boxing Helena (1993), and that was pretty perverse, and dumb.There are some lighter moments in the second half which help ease the pain of watching the movie, and it is those that prevent this from getting the lowest possible rating.The fact that there are known actors in this makes it even more perplexing - who would want this on their CV? Justin Long tends to do B-grade movies, so not too much of a surprise there, I suppose. Haley Joel Osment's star has clearly waned significantly since the heights of The Sixth Sense. The biggest surprise is the appearance of Johnny Depp, in more ways than one. Don't know why he took the gig, and he is barely recognisable.Fleetwood Mac / Lindsay Buckingham must be regretting allowing ""Tusk"" to be used in the soundtrack. This is not the sort of movie you want to be associated with.",Tusk
12,oscaralbert,Europe may have had THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE . . .,9,14 March 2015,". . . but TUSK shows that the Clownish Claudes of Canada are just getting started butchering Americans where CENTIPEDE's Dr. Heiter left off. Anyone who has survived Canadian border guards knows that Canada is the Number One enemy of the U.S. It surely would have been nuked many times over by now, were it not for the risk of prevailing winds causing radioactive collateral damage in America. But since TUSK is ""Based upon actual events,"" it should serve as a cautionary account to deter any American from spending so much as a nickel attempting to enter that forbidding country. Even if you managed to get past the sadistic border guards, Canadians likely would lure you to their dens in the middle of nowhere. Then they would drug you, most likely with tea. When you woke up, you'd already be missing at least one limb. Not content to merely dismember you, they would try to outdo the crazed experiments of the infamous Nazi Death Camp surgeon, Dr. Josef Mengele, through grotesque body modification techniques. Depending on whether you were small-boned or large, they'd turn you into either a walrus or a moose (Canada's national symbols). Bottom line: Yankee stay home, and pray that we can overcome this drifting nuclear fallout conundrum before the scalpel-wielding Canadians invade us!",Tusk
13,george.schmidt,Filmmaker Kevin Smith's continuing threat to ending his career just may have hit its nadir (or is the joke on us?),2,21 September 2014,"TUSK (2014) *1/2 Justin Long, Michael Parks, Genesis Rodriguez, Haley Joel Osment, Johnny Depp. Filmmaker Kevin Smith's continuing threat to ending his career just may have hit its nadir (or is the joke on us?) To wit: douchy podcaster Long (replete with porn'stache and redonkulous girlfriend) treks to The Great White North to follow up on a story but when it falls thru finds himself in a surreal nightmare when he encounters mad-as-a-shithouse-rat storyteller Parks off the beaten path in the middle of nowhere whose dream to recreate a past experience (i.e. turning a man into a walrus!!!) comes scarily a reality. The utter ridiculously vulgar premise has its hiccoughs and moments of black humor and dread (largely thanks to the grotesque make-up concocted by Krisz Drouillard and Robert Kurtzman) can't make up for the WTF extended (unbilled) cameo by Depp as a wall-eyed Canadian homicide dick that borderlines Peter Sellers' Jacques Clouseau cartoonville and easily some editing to the long-winded dialogue that has one eye-rolling than eye-hiding hideousness.

14,FlashCallahan,I'm so very tired Mr. Tusk......,8,11 December 2014,"When podcaster Wallace travels to Canada to interview someone, his plans don't go well as the interviewee has unfortunately passed on.He ends up meeting a strange man named Howe who has many stories to tell about is past life. But halfway through the interview, Wallace passes out.He wakes up the next day finding out Howe isn't the person he thought he was, Howe has plans to surgically and mentally turn him into something from his past.....,There are so many people who have lambasted this film for its strange content and weird shift in narrative, but this is part of the films charm. It isn't meant to be an all out horror movie. It isn't meant to chill the soul as some would expect.The film is almost a self deprecating parody of all those tiresome torture movies that have been made in the past twelve years, and this is Smiths reply to all those dozens and dozens of abhorrent movies, and for goodness sake, its a blast from beginning to end.Long is already in Walrus mode with that wonderful moustache when we first meet him, and he is your typical educated person who's life is ruled by all things viral, and his podcast is the type of laugh in that we all listen too, and this half of the film is the more serious part, even though it has some hilarious moments (aboot), and some random flashbacks.But when Wallace wakes up from his 'sleep', the movie goes all out bonkers and throws absolutely everything it can into the mix, and thankfully, lots and lots stick to the wall. When a film has the audacity to go this leftfield, it's very risky, but Smiths gamble pays off.What makes it more interesting isn't the body image element, even though using the femur as a Tusk is genius, it's the fact that when you think its just going to be Osment and his girlfriend looking for him, Johnny Depp pops up in what can only be described as his most bizarre role ever.It's not worth even describing what he does in the film, but its funny, surprising, and makes an already silly film,even more bonkers.Granted, it's not for everyone, but I though it was a good movie, and a return to form from Smith.",Tusk
15,siderite,Human Centipede. Canadian.,6,17 March 2017,"Let me be clear from the get go: I didn't like it. The problem, as far as I was concerned, was that captivity and body horror require a certain type of mood while Canadian self deprecating comedy requires another. It isn't like a horror movie with some comic relief sprinkled in, it is not a dark comedy, it's like someone butchered a horror and a comedy into an unholy hybrid to soothe their twisted psyche. I also feel that the very ending spoiled whatever pleasure I took from the film.I liked the acting and I think that they made a really good effort with the special effects and the sets and everything. I also found interesting, although not all original, the idea to have a completely unlikable character as the victim, only to show that they were not that bad in the first place.If you are satisfied with the story and plot, then there is no reason not to like this film. Unfortunately for me, I didn't like them.",Tusk

In another words, by the starting few minutes I thought this movie would be a treat. However after the first few minutes, the movie really started to plummet. The movie is like ""The Human Centipede"" except without the shock factor, nor is it suspenseful or scary. I am not sure if the movie is trying to be funny with some goofy scenes, but it isn't funny either. The movie isn't super awful, but it just seemed like the movie was done as a joke. Or it's just a movie made with the thought of putting Smith and Depp's daughters in it.

17,Hellmant,If you don't mind 'crazy' it's really entertaining!,9,16 December 2014,"'TUSK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Writer/director Kevin Smith's new horror-comedy flick about a deranged, wheelchair-bound, retired seaman who attempts to surgically transform a popular podcast host (who's also a house visitor, at his home in Manitoba) into a walrus. It was written and directed by Smith and based on an idea from his own SModcast podcast show (Smith hosts with his buddy Scott Mosier). The film stars Michael Parks (who also starred in Smith's last feature film, 'RED STATE'), Justin Long, Genesis Rodriquez, Haley Joel Osment and Johnny Depp. It's the first in a planned trilogy of films, Smith calls the 'True North Trilogy', using many of the same characters and cast. The movie is really weird but if you don't mind 'crazy' it's really entertaining as well.Wallace Bryton (Long) and Teddy Craft (Osment) are friends that host a popular podcast show together, called 'The Not-See Party'. On the show, the two viciously attack, and ridicule, popular viral YouTube videos. Wallace travels to meet the unfortunate internet stars and then tells Teddy (who doesn't like to fly) about them on the show (which is why it's called 'the not-see party'). Wallace makes a trip to Canada to meet a guy who accidentally cut off his own leg but finds out he recently killed himself. He spots a flyer, at a local bar in Manitoba, advertising free room and board, in a big old house, and a lifetime of interesting stories. Rather than going home empty-handed Wallace decides to meet the retired seafarer (Parks), who put up the add, and interview him for his show. The visit turns out to be a horrifying mistake as he's soon drugged, by the madman, and turned into part of an insane experiment. Wallace's girlfriend, Ally (Rodriquez), and Teddy go looking for him, when he goes missing. They enlist the help of a quirky Quebec ex-cop (Depp), who's investigating the crazy seaman.I'm a huge Kevin Smith fan and I'm really excited in the direction he's taking, with his movies. I really like indie horror flicks as well, especially the comedic type, and I think Smith is a perfect writer/director to produce this type of material. 'RED STATE' is a slightly better film, because it is more serious and frightening, but as a spoof this movie really works as well (and it's also pretty disturbing). It's kind of like a more comedic version of 'THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE' (not quite as violent or disgusting though). Although I hate the 'HUMAN CENTIPEDE' films, I loved this movie. Depp and Parks are both perfectly cast, zany and memorable in it. Long makes a good unlikable antihero lead and it's great to see Osment doing anything. Rodriguez is way too beautiful (and hot) to believe she'd ever be with Justin Long, but she's good in the movie even so. I also really liked Smith's directing choices, throughout the entire film, and the dialogue is brilliant. It's everything you could possibly want in a Kevin Smith movie, or an indie horror-comedy flick. I loved it and I'm sure it will become a beloved cult classic (just like most of Smith's films).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/hS02wz4z3uU",Tusk
18,thesar-2,The Human Senseless,2,11 April 2015,"I can imagine and even know where this idea smoked from, but it's still dumb, nonetheless. Kevin Smith is an intelligent filmmaker that finally made his modern Adam Sandler film: a fvck you to his fans. This Human Centipede rip-off was supposed to be part comedy, part horror, but when you add those together you are not only left with neither, you're stuck with an hour and a half of meaningless dribble. OK, that's not entirely true. The movie starts off interesting enough and follows with a real interesting character of Howard Howe. Beyond that, it dives deep into stupidity only a stoner might appreciate. I see where Smith was going with this, but his humor fell flat time and again and the overall experience, once finished, feels more like a waste of time than anything you can take from it. Too bad. Just hope Smith remembers what it was like to be human again.",Tusk
19,bowmanblue,A film of two halves,5,6 August 2015,"Ah, Kevin Smith – I knew him well (mainly in the nineties during his Clerks, Mallrats and Chasing Amy period). I would always say that he's one hell of a writer of dialogue, whether his work falls straight into the 'comedy' bracket, or he dabbles in other genres, i.e. romance, science-fiction fantasy or horror. And, this time round, he's playing with the 'horror genre.' 'Tusk' tells the tale of a complete idiot (played delightfully by Justin Long). He's a typical product of the modern age – a podcaster with ideas way above his station. Yes, he's a little bit famous, but it appears that a little bit of fame corrupts almost as much as absolute power. He thinks he's 'it' and lets everyone know it, whether it's his co-presenter, his doting girlfriend, or generally anyone he meets along the way.One article on his upcoming podcast is an interview with a Canadian 'celebrity' who's also made his name on the internet. Sadly, the 'celebrity' in question is so traumatised with his newfound fame that he kills himself, 'selfishly' leaving our glorious podcaster with nothing to report on while in Canada. That's when he happens upon an interesting offer in a men's restroom. It leads him to a reclusive hermit, played brilliantly by Michael Parks, who offers to tell him his life's story.This is the fun part. The interaction between the two is just about as perfect as dialogue can be. The two exchange tales and taken on life in the setting of Park's Gothic mansion. The tension is cranked right up to the max – you know something is going to happen (something bad, obviously), but you just don't know what. This atmosphere is just electrifying when combined with the snappy dialogue. Everything is going great until......the film just kind of switches atmosphere and great dialogue for cheap shocks. And shocks that look pretty bad rather than shocking. The second half of the film is everything that the first half isn't, i.e. cheesy. Yeah, there are a few moments of brilliance thrown in there, but, when you realise what's actually happening, you'll probably just shout, 'What... seriously?' It just doesn't work. It feels like someone has tacked a second (lesser) film onto a good one. If I was rating the first half I'd say it was awesome. If I was rating the second half I'd say don't bother. Fans of Kevin Smith may like the dialogue (like I did), but most people will not really go for this on account of the sudden change in mood that doesn't fit where the film was originally heading.Best to watch this one for free however you can before you invest in actually paying for it. Some people may find the second half as shocking as it was intended. Personally, I just found it a let down and stupid. Pity.",Tusk
20,cosmo_tiger,This is not supposed to be taken 100% serious but it's hard to shake off the feeling it leaves you with. I really liked it.,8,29 December 2014,"""Your life as you knew it is over Mr. Bryton. Should you wish to continue living you will be a walrus or you will be nothing at all."" Wallace Bryton (Long) is a pod-caster that makes his living making fun of others. He heads off to Canada to meet a kid who accidentally cut off his own leg in a YouTube video. While at a bar he reads a letter a man named Howard Howe (Parks) wrote and is intrigued. He drives out to see him and is engrossed in his life stories, but when Wallace wakes up his life is forever changed. I have to open by saying that I am a huge Kevin Smith fan and I love everything he does. Clerks is one of my favorite movies and I though Red State was outstanding. I also have to say that this is NOT a movie for everyone. I have never seen the Human Centipede but to me this is a toned down and lighter version of that movie. While the premise and many parts of the movie are pretty comical (Johnny Depp really breaks the tension), this movie is unbelievably disturbing and creepy. Smith walks the line between horror and comedy perfectly. This is a movie that is not supposed to be taken 100% serious but it's hard to shake off the feeling it leaves you with. I really enjoyed this and I recommend this but a movie about a man being turned into a walrus is not something everyone will be into. I thought Red State was better but I still liked this. Overall, fans of Smith or bizarre movies will really enjoy this. If you are more into mainstream fare then pass this up. Somethings can not be unseen. I give this a high B+.",Tusk
21,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,22 December 2014,"Tusk  The best part about being a walrus is that Sea World trainers are more  focused on abusing the whales.  Mind you, Sea World looks like Heaven compared to the Hell this walrus  must endure.  Brash podcast host Wallace (Justin Long) travels to Winnipeg to  interview a viral-video star for his web series.  Unfortunately, the star committed suicide - leaving Wallace without a  story.  Desperate, he answers a cryptic ad for a roommate.  Arriving at the remote mansion, Wallace is drugged and encased in a  walrus suit constructed by his psychotic host (Michael Parks).  Based on his own podcast, writer/director Kevin Smith masterfully  brings this aquatic nightmare to life in the film's first half.  However, that fear fades in the ladder half when a badly disguised  Johnny Depp masterfully fails as a French-Canadian detective.  Besides, how can Canada have a viral-video star when the country  doesn't even have the Internet?   Yellow Light",Tusk
22,Bored_Dragon,What is seen can not be unseen...,8,30 March 2018,"I love Kevin Smith and I saw all of his movies, those he wrote, directed or acted in. Johnny Depp is possibly my favorite actor. I saw all of his too, even those in which he had just cameo appearances. Movie with Johnny in it, written and directed by Kevin Smith, for me is definite must watch. I thought I knew exactly what to expect from those two, but I was so wrong. This has no similarity with anything any of them ever did. IMDb says comedy, drama, horror, and although it has elements of each, I can not agree with that classification. True, there's humor, but if you are in for a comedy, you're in for extremely unpleasant surprise. Although it has elements of eighties B horror, this movie is not scary. It won't frighten you or keep you tense, but most of it is both psychologically and visually unpleasant. And whether you will characterize it as a drama, I think it depends on your subjective experience. It's surreal, awkward, nasty and sick. Whether you like it or not, it's certain you won't easily forget it.8/10",Tusk
23,851222,Pointless,6,24 December 2014,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Tusk"" (2014) is a passable comedy horror flick. It's nicely acted and it has some suspension but the plot is beyond absurdity. What was the point of this picture? When it will end, don't even start to think what you have just saw - it would be as pointless as the movie itself. Now i don't say that this flick is bad, but if you will skip it you won't lose anything.The only interesting thing was to see Haley Joel Osment on screen probably the first time since ""Artificial Intelligence: AI"" back in 2001. Once considered one of the most talented young actors that ever walked the earth (and on my opinion he truly was), he quickly was forgotten probably after his voice broke. It was very cool to see him again, of course far from a movie or role he was famous for. Hope to see him more often in a future, and in far more better roles then this one.",Tusk
24,ironhorse_iv,"What the eh? This surreal body horror film is weird as hell, but it made a splash with me. I kinda like it.",5,7 April 2016,"In 2013, a fake ad created by prankster, Christ Parkinson on England's free classified site Gumtree, stated that a retired man was looking for a tenant and was willing to offer free rent to a person who was willing to dress up in a walrus costume for roughly two hours a day. Fascinated with the odd request of this ad, director Kevin Smith discussed it with co-host Scott Mosier on Smith's SModcast podcast that same year. After talking about it even more, this fictional ad inspired Kevin Smith to make this fictional film similar to it. He took the concept into a much more sinister path, with an American podcaster Wallace Bryton (Justin Long) goes missing in the backwoods of Canada while interviewing a mysterious seafarer named Howard Howe (Michael Parks), whom wants to turn his body, into a living breathing human walrus. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the film is somewhat sophistical with its dialogue and message, despite the silly concept. The film is full of symbolism, metaphor, and moral meaning, all related to the topic of Walruses. Smith is able to show the important of the animal in the eyes of Howe, very well. It seem to me, that Kevin Smith has always been interested in the animal, ever since reading the 19th century, children author Lewis Carroll's novel, 'Through the Looking Glass'. Smith always tries really hard to fit the poem, ""The Walrus and the Carpenter"", whenever movie, he is working on. One good example of that, is his lengthy and verbose philosophical dialogue in his 1999's 'Dogma'. Interpreting that the Walrus to be a caricature of the Buddha and the Carpenter to be a caricature of Jesus Christ, Smith is able, make a convincing argument, about going against God's wishes. Nevertheless, the Walrus metaphor in his movie is differ from the film, 'Dogma', with Smith saying the Walrus is God, in animal form & the only way to meet God, is for humans to unleash their animalistic urges. Even when Howe speaks, ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" by the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. You really get the sense of loneliness and guilt, he has, about his past and why Mr. Tusk is important to him, by Smith's dialogue for the Canadian Serial Killer. With this, you can really see, why Howe is so disturbing. All, very well recite by season actor, Michael Parks in his chilling performance as Howard Howe. Though, to be fair, his character does go a little over the top cartoony, toward the end with his walrus fight with Wallace Bryton. I really couldn't stand him, by then. In return, Justin Long turns in, what might be, say, his best performance yet. Despite, his character, being a bit unlikeable and so clichés. I was really interested in his struggles against Howe. I just wish, the walrus costume, he wore, toward the last part of the film was a little more realistic. It look a little too fake for some people. The supporting cast is also a mixed bag for me. Genesis Rodriguez and Haley Joel Osment are fine as Wallace's girlfriend Ally Leon and best bud/c-podcaster Teddy Craft, respectively. However, their characters does seem a bit underdeveloped by the story. The movie hints on a romantic subplot, between them, but it's never truly explained, or explore, past a certain point in the story. While, those characters were a bit disappointing. As least, they weren't as annoying as the Canadian stereotypes supporting characters in this film. I really couldn't stand them. The only character, I kinda like, was former Sûreté du Québec inspector, Guy LaPointe (Johnny Depp). His scene with Teddy and Ally at the Gimli Slider Restaurant is a lot of fun. Depp is so good, at character acting, I really didn't know, he was, in this movie, until later. He was kooky as hell. What a great character! I'm glad that LaPointe will return in 2016's Yoga Hosers; as well with the cameos of Kevin Smith and Johnny Depp's daughters, Lily Rose and Harley Quinn as the Canadian clerks, Colleen McKenzie and Colleen Collette. In many ways, this movie, not only, introduce the daughters of Smith and Depp to the world, but also introduce us, to the True North trilogy of Canadian horror films that Kevin Smith has made, because of it. (2014's Tusk & 2016's Yoga Hosers & 2018's Moose Jaws). While the concept of a human into a walrus might seem dumb to most people. For me, it's a guilty pleasure watch. Smith to me, seem to pull this movie off, because of his flair of turning the subject into a very serious subject, despite it, being play as a horror comedy. It gave the movie, a lot of fun. Though, Smith does overindulges at the silliness at certain moments. A good example is the spider killing scene, between LaPointe and the killer. It could had been cut down, a bit, as it's very clear, that these two were really chewing the scene, way too much. Some of the other scenes, also feel a bit disjointed, and bad paced. However, for the most part, this bizarre film was so entertaining, that you rarely notice, the runtime. Overall: This movie is well shot, and had a unique astrosphere. While, I wouldn't say, it's the best movie, from him. It's still funny, strange, disquieting, and occasionally gory enough to stand out. So, check it out! It's not that bad.",Tusk

26,sol-,Skin I Live In,7,1 October 2017,"While on assignment in Manitoba, an American pays a late night visit to wheelchair-bound war veteran with devious plans in this horror film from Kevin Smith. 'Tusk' has been compared to 'The Human Centipede', but it more heavily resembles 'The Skin I Live In', and the less else said about the plot the better to avoid ruining a fresh experience. Whatever the case, the first half is compelling stuff. Justin Long plays such an arrogant jerk that one almost wonders if he deserves his fate, and yet Smith carves a sympathetic enough character that we feel for him during his strife. Michael Parks though is the actor who steals the show as the war veteran whose poetic eloquence and charisma (waxing poetic about the sea) makes him all the more chilling as he goes about discussing his surgical plans for Long with a straight face. Learning of his struggles, he is oddly sympathetic too. The second half of the film is not quite so strong though with lots of time spent away from Parks and Long as two friends investigate his disappearance and encounter an over-the-top caricature of a French detective, played by Johnny Depp. This in turn renders 'Tusk' more of a comedy than sad horror film, which doesn't quite seem like the right note to end on. Obviously, Smith is having a lot of fun with his material, but a less comedic approach to the tale may have well made it more haunting.",Tusk

28,filipemanuelneto,"Peculiar, bizarre, boring and pointless",2,17 November 2017,"When I decided to watch this movie I was very curious. I thought it was a horror movie or a thriller, but I was very disappointed in what I saw. The film is original, even bizarre, but it cannot in fact be considered a horror movie, and anyone who does it must be deeply easy to scare. It doesn't scare anyone, although its provocative and has strong scenes. The script is based on a podcaster's trip to Canada, where he meets an old sailor who is actually a psychopath obsessed with walruses. But the biggest problem is that the film seems only interested in provoking, not in accomplishing something. It's not a comedy, it's not a horror movie, it could never be a thriller because we can predict everything that will happen with great ease... I just don't know how to rate this movie.Kevin Smith is far from a good director and this film only served to solidify the certainty that he doesn't deserve to be taken seriously. The construction of the script fails in many ways, none of the characters goes beyond the caricature, the performance of the actors is also a caricature of themselves. The only exception is Michael Parks who, with a generally good and somewhat serious interpretation, prevented the film from completely sinking in the mud and didn't allowed me to give up watching it. About Johnny Depp ... I'm just not surprised to see him here because he's gotten used to expecting anything from him.",Tusk
29,leonblackwood,Weird but original! 4/10,4,4 July 2015,"Review: What a strange but original movie! Justin Long plays a cocky podcaster who goes to Canada to interview a boy who chops of his leg on YouTube by mistake. When he reaches his destination, he ends up interviewing a mysterious man after finding a letter that was left in a bar toilet. The guy has all of these wonderful stories about his past but all is not what it seems. He takes Justin Long as his hostage and he converts his body into a walrus after several operations and mental torture. His girlfriend and best friend start to question his disappearance and they go on the hunt to save there best friend, with the help of a private investigator who has been investigating the disappearance of other people. Personally I found the movie quite disturbing because of the graphic walrus transformation and the mental pressure on Longs character. I liked the PI who took on the case to find there friend because he brought some humour to the extremely dark project. I thought that it was a walrus suit that could have been taken off but there was obviously more to transformation than I thought. Justin Long and Michael Parks made this warped storyline feel quite realistic which was why it was hard to watch in parts. I'm basically in two minds about this film because it's intriguing and mysterious in one hand but disturbing and graphic in another. Based on my assumptions, it's worth a watch just to get another opinion on this Fly type movie. Weird but watchable, if you can stomach it!Round-Up: This is a different direction for Kevin Smith who usually makes comedies like the awful Cop Out, the Jay and Silent Bob franchise, Zack and Mary Make A Porno, Dogma and the Clerks franchise. He does have a warped sense of humour so I'm sure that there was a weird reason why he made this film. He's a man that doesn't have any boundaries, like with the subject matter in Dogma but I still found this movie quite shocking in parts. Justin Long has had a up and down career which has seemed to have slowed down at the moment. Although Die Hard 4.0 wasn't that great, he did have a major role next to Bruce Willis, which should have pushed his career to new heights after starring in over 60 movies. He's another person which is mostly known for his comedic roles in movies like Funny People, Dodgeball, Galaxy Quest and the Break-Up so I don't know if he would have been my first choice for this film. That's not to say that he didn't do a good job but judging by the box office takings, it might have been taken more seriously if it had a major star playing the lead. Budget: $3million Worldwide Gross: $2millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their disturbing horror/thriller movies about a man who takes a promising podcaster hostage to convert him into a walrus. 4/10",Tusk

33,jtindahouse,An unexpected gem,10,27 December 2014,"I knew absolutely nothing about 'Tusk' going in other than it was a Kevin Smith film and it was a horror/comedy. I'm a huge Kevin Smith fan so I was looking forward to it. It started off like any other Smith film with brilliant dialogue (that I could happily listen to for hours on end) and an interesting set up which I had no doubt was going to lead to hilarious results. What I had forgotten by this stage was the 'horror' element previously mentioned. So what took place for the second two-thirds of the film came as quite a shock.I think the way I went into it, knowing nothing about what I was in for, was the best way to enjoy this film. It really did come as a massive shock out of left field. You can go into a 'Saw' or 'Hostel' film and there's no doubt what you witness is shocking, but it's also expected which eases the discomfort of watching it somewhat. Here I felt completely unprepared for what I was witnessing and that heightened the intended affect.Twice in the movie I had to look up the credit list to check whether I was losing my mind or not. The first was to check whether that was actually Haley Joel Osment. His transformation has been monumental to the point where even after checking it was him I still didn't feel 100% certain. The second time was to check whether that was actually Johnny Depp. That was an incredibly pleasant surprise. An actor of his brilliance reading lines written by Kevin Smith is nothing short of pure ecstasy. Michael Parks was brilliant in his role and Justin Long was well cast in the lead.I'm glad there is no mention of the truly shocking element to this film in its synopsis as I think this will lead people to enjoy the film a lot more. I really didn't know Smith had a film like this in him but I'm so glad he did. He's more than just a one-trick pony. I read that Quentin Tarantino turned down a cameo which I found interesting because I couldn't help feeling a lot of scenes had a touch of his style to them. I wouldn't be surprised to later find out he gave advise to Smith on a few things here and there. Altogether a brilliant film that I will be recommending to a lot of people.",Tusk
34,CubsandCulture,I mostly feel bad for Justin Long. Not the character the actor,7,3 November 2019,"There is a lot about this film that is quite wonderful. Parks is a just perfect in the role of the old misanthrope with a malevolent fixation on walruses. Depp shines as the bumbling French Canadian detective. Long is just right for the arrogant pod caster who gets what is coming to him. Several scenes-Howard and Wallace's first meeting, Guy and Howard being of note-are extremely pleasing. Sure some of this stuff, like the film itself, overstays its welcome. But Smith's dialog crackles as it always did and the characters are just so.But on the whole the film is rather misjudged. The second half is disturbing and gore filled in a way that the first half just doesn't set up. Wallace's fate is utterly creepy and several of the torture scenes are far harsher, vivid than the lighter comedy that comes before them. Part of this film just makes me feel terrible for Justin Long. I hope he was paid well.The film is striking and outside of Dogma it is Smith's most unique film. That aspect is a good thing.",Tusk
35,drownnnsoda,Its own kind of beast,7,30 September 2014,"""Tusk"" takes the premise of twenty-first-century podcast writers to harrowing and grimly humorous levels; Justin Long plays Wallace Bryton, a podcaster who interviews eccentrics around the world for his podcast show. After a trip to meet an interviewee Manitoba goes bust, he finds a phone number for an old seaman on a bulletin board in a bar restroom. The man claims he has many stories to tell, and Wallace jumps at the opportunity. Bad idea.I went in knowing virtually nothing about this film, aside from the fact that Kevin Smith had written and directed it, so my experience seeing ""Tusk"" was one hundred percent uncolored by any preconceptions; I hadn't even seen a trailer. In fact, I didn't even know the film existed, and was fascinated when I saw the Gothic poster among the ""now showing"" at the local theater. I'm not particularly a Kevin Smith fan; I've only seen one or two of his films, so I'm not sure what most people expect of him, but I found this film utterly head-scratching and fascinating. Smith's signature humor bleeds throughout the entire script, but ""Tusk"" is just as much a horror film as it is a dark comedy. Comparisons to ""Misery"" and ""The Human Centipede"" are apt I suppose, though ""Tusk"" is miles more enjoyable than ""Centipede""— perhaps because the uncomfortable humor is slightly more digestible— and even brassier than ""Misery"".Grimly humorous moments revolving around Wallace and his captor, serial killer Howard Howe, are punctuated and offset with jaw-droppingly emotive monologues from characters (Genesis Rodriguez's is particularly powerful and exemplifies legitimate talent); where there's humor, there's also sorrow, and insanity, and monstrous violence. Johnny Depp's appearance in the film as a token French Canadian P.I. from Quebec is appropriate to the film's overall zaniness, and Justin Long is annoying and lovable as the mouthy Wallace. Michael Parks' turn as the villain is utterly insane, funny, and macabre all in one, and the chemistry with Long on screen is great. The visual aesthetic here is more than accomplished as well; the film is slick and effective, and the photography at Howe's remote rustic mansion is brooding and dark.As I said, I knew virtually nothing about this film before seeing it, but I do know afterward that some people will enjoy ""Tusk"" and other people will be completely baffled and/or confused and/or repulsed by it. It's outrageous and darkly humorous while simultaneously catering to the tropes of the abduction thriller and the horror film, and the concoction is ridiculous and oftentimes hilarious while still somehow managing to be absolutely compelling and suspenseful. My only gripe is that the final act felt rushed, though the Fleetwood Mac soundtrack almost made up for it. 7/10.",Tusk
36,kluseba,An innovating cult movie for decades to come,8,25 February 2015,"''Tusk'' is a movie that goes off the beaten paths. It's a potential cult movie which will be adored by some and despised by others for decades to come. It's almost impossible to have a neutral or no opinion on this controversial movie. It's not a question about getting it or not, it's simply a matter of personal tastes.The story is quickly told. An American pod-cast host ends up in the isolated mansion of an old seaman in Manitoba who wants to share some stories about his life. One gets to know that the old fool is in fact a dangerous serial killer who despises mankind because he got intimidated, raped and tortured by the society after the brutal killing of his parents. The only thing that has ever shown respect to him was a walrus that saved him from a shipwreck in Northern Russia. In order to survive on an isolated island, the serial killer had to make the decision to kill his saviour just hours before he got saved. He regrets that decision and in order to relive this pivotal moment in his life again and to take revenge on a society that made him suffer all life long, the serial killer kidnaps, mutilates and tortures young men to transform them into walruses. While the imprisoned pod-cast host gets now mentally and physically unstable and begins more and more to act like a wild animal, his grounded partner and his cheating girlfriend realize that he is in danger. They arrive in Canada and team up with a drug addict and ex-police officer from Quebec to save their friend or what remains of his human body and soul.The film is a grotesque that mixes black comedy, drama, horror and thriller elements all at once. The movie has many changes of tone. When you see the two main characters fooling around, the tone is humorous. A few moments later, you assist a burial after a suicide and the tone gets accusatory. The movie then cuts to an actress who is crying her heart out and complains about her cheating boyfriend as the tone gets depressing. Seconds later, she herself cheats on her boyfriend and the whole scene suddenly feels ironical. This film is filled with these fascinating changes of tones. You constantly change your mind about the different characters as well. The main character looks like a superficial idiot during his show in the beginning of the movie. His partner looks like the friendlier and smarter guy. His girlfriend looks like a confident, faithful and serious person. The villain of the story looks like an innocent old fool. Thirty minutes later, the main character has some intellectual dialogues and proves that he is not as dumb as one might have thought. His partner betrays his best friend by sleeping with his girlfriend who suddenly looks fragile, superficial and unfaithful. The old fool has become an intimidating criminal with a horrible past. It's not just the tone that changes, the overall mood also does. What starts as a juvenile comedy movie in the key of ''The Interview'' turns into a bleak body horror film like ''The Human Centipede'', gets a touch of a crime comedy movie like ''Good Cop, Bad Cop'' and becomes an existential and nearly philosophical drama like the ending of ''I Saw The Devil'' for example. Those who say that this movie is bland, superficial and thoughtless are wrong. This movie has more memorable scenes than ten others together. It's a matter of taste whether you like these scenes or not. The scenes of the burial and the close-up on the crying girlfriend shook me up. The ring-tone of the main character's cell phone and the weird dialogue between the French Canadian police officer and the serial killer in front of a shack made me laugh out loud. The torture scenes in the old mansion and the closing part in a zoo made me feel disgust, horror and sadness at once. The movie also includes many cultural elements in a humorous way. The idea of including the topic of Duplessis' orphans in the movie was brilliant and shows that the makers of the movie know what they are talking about. The food topic and especially the details about poutines in the movie were completely absurd and hilarious at the same time. The discussions about hockey and especially the Quebec Nordiques were the best jokes about Quebeckers I have ever heard and I have witnessed many lukewarm attempts.I'm going to admit that this movie is difficult. Those who are looking for a typical American comedy movie might get shocked by the explicit torture scenes. Those who are looking for a sinister body horror film may not dig the humorous parts. This film is not for closed-minded and light-hearted people who just want to get entertained. This movie will haunt you long after it ended in one way or another. All the things mentioned above make this film something really special. It's one of the few movies that still try to innovate at all costs. The more I think about the movie, the more I appreciate it and feel like watching it over and over again. If my review intrigued you and you consider yourself an open-minded and tough cineast, I can only warmly recommend you this incredibly entertaining mixture of the joyful and the woeful. For anyone else, try this at your own costs but don't tell me I didn't warn you.",Tusk

The Wallace character is annoying, full of himself, I guess based on the director himself. Clearly this movie starts with a really bad idea, based on a real life...podcast. I guess that's what happens when someone actually has the money to realize any dumb stuff he ends up talking about with his friends. However, many movies start with a bad idea and make something of that idea. Here too after having to endure the Wallace character for too long, we are finally introduced to the brilliant Howe character who's a literatus, adventurer, collector of weird things. Things start getting tense but then devolve into weirdness to end in some uncomfortable emotion.In a way you want to like this movie for its audacity, but it's the director who gets in the way of himself. Apparently nearly everything in this movie is based on something relating to his life. Worst of all, he doesn't know when enough is enough. Yes, there is too much of a good thing. The passport control scene and Canada/America jokes go on way after you've had enough. ""Guy Lapointe"" gives a wild performance and Parks, too, does a good job, but these just drag on, and on, and on to the point of annoyance. A lesson all these alleged movie aficionados-turned directors haven't learned from movie history is that often less is more. The drive for explicitness in movies has often had the opposite effect intended. In monster movies rarely does it help to show the monster for too long and from every angle conceivable.We are told that this is the first of the director's Canada trilogy. Canada trilogy? Where has this guy been the last 25 years of globalization? I'm quite torn about this movie. A lot is brilliant and a lot is retarded, as the kids would say. I'm afraid the director thrives on the latter as evidenced by the original and moronic walrus podcast during credits.",Tusk
39,dworldeater,"Kevin Smith's Tusk is not for everyone, but I like it",7,29 January 2015,"First off, I have a lot of respect for Kevin Smith for not going the mainstream route and making movies for exorbitant amounts of money that he has little passion for. As an alternative, I think it is great that he can switch gears and take his film career in a different direction by making the films he wants to make, even though they are less accessible and/or marketable for a mainstream audience. Tusk, is definitely not meant to please the masses. I found it to be an enjoyable, macabre and unusual horror comedy. Tusk gets compared to The Human Centipede a lot, while both films are similar in many ways, Tusk is a different kind of animal.(no pun intended) The Human Centipede films are much more geared to pushing the envelope on the extreme end of horror and to make people sick. Tusk has very little gore and is driven by black comedy and dialogue. Michael Parks is brilliant as a highly educated psychopath with a severe fondness for the walrus. Justin Long is Wallace, a snarky douchebag that does not quite deserve what is coming to him. Wallace may be an unlikeable scumbag, but Smith does leave room for empathy for his character. For a budget just under 3 million, the film looks good. The score helps to create atmosphere to elevate the terror and help the audience feel uneasy. Tusk is much more cohesive than Smith's last movie Red State. If you want to see another Chasing Amy, this is not for you. However, if you want to see something unusual, creepy and have a twisted sense of humor, you may possibly enjoy this.",Tusk
40,I_Ailurophile,"I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob",4,4 February 2021,"'Tusk' makes an impression. I just don't know what that impression says.It's also pretty unforgettable. But what's most memorable about it is no reflection on quality, good or bad, but simply how bizarre it is.Kevin Smith has a very particular brand of comedy that he's brought to so many of his films, and there are elements of it to be found in Justin Long's obnoxious podcaster Wallace; in the attempts of his friend Teddy (Haley Joel Osment) to trace his steps; and in the very, very, very surreal absurdity of the entire scenario. Yet if 'Clerks' or 'Dogma' made you laugh out loud, don't rush to jump on the 'Tusk' bandwagon, because Smith's offbeat humor - any humor it all - is kind of sparse here.'Tusk' also brings to the table big slabs of body horror and the trope of the psychopathic captor. It's in the latter that this film finds its shining star, as Michael Parks is brilliant and morbid as odd, storied recluse Howard Howe. I regret to say that I haven't seen a great many of Parks' films, but just reflecting on his performance here, I kind of want to try to find more. He's creepy, and funny in a creepy way, but also creepily endearing in a funny way.I could remark on the camerawork, or the script, or the appearances by Johnny Depp, his daughter Lily-Rose, or Smith's daughter Harley Quinn. I could try to tell you whether it's good or bad, or give a recommendation. Yet everything about 'Tusk' is just rather overshadowed by how very, very odd it is. Those disparate elements of sparse offbeat humor and bizarre takes on horror tropes combine into a feature that is difficult to pin down in any shape or form except ""WALRUS.""If I had to give a definitive opinion on 'Tusk,' my first impulse is to be very middle of the road: I didn't dislike it, but I'm also hard-pressed to say I liked it - again, it's just so... odd. And it's that very quality of oddness that somewhat tips the scales for me to the negative side, because despite its best efforts, 'Tusk' gets so wrapped up in its own absurdity that it fails to give us much of any other reason to watch.Strangely, I recall 'Tusk' more fondly in hindsight than when I'd just finished watching.Recommended if you're a fan of Michael Parks, or if you specifically try to find the most strange of films. Otherwise, 'Tusk' is best approached with a very open mind and highly tempered expectations.",Tusk
41,masonsaul,"Fun, weird but the tones don't mix",7,29 March 2019,"Tusk is an extremely weird, bold and fun film with good acting and direction and it's definitely unashamedly ridiculous. However the tense and uncomfortable 1st half doesn't mix with the very funny and comedic second half.",Tusk
42,Seraphion,Haunting even after the movie but countered with the strange comedy,6,4 December 2014,"The story is nicely put for a horror. But the drama aspect, as this movie is billed as, does not make itself appear to the surface. The comedy is nice although the humor selection is just kind of lame. The horror aspect is really the significant part of all the mixed genres. The horror imagery even still haunts as the comedic inserts are being shown. For me the drama and comedy seems like a waste for this movie due to the overwhelming presence of the horror aspect. This movie feels like a down- played version of The Human Centipede. It's because of the comedic and dramatic insertion, which again is kind of a waste. Justin Long did his comedic parts nicely. I suppose that's normal because comedy is kind of his specialty. Genesis Rodriguez did nice in balancing for the drama parts. Haley Joel Osment can't seem to bring himself to be funny. He only seem like he enjoyed all his character's laughter.",Tusk
43,Matt_Layden,Never Go Full Walrus.,5,15 December 2014,"Smith's second attempt at a genre other than comedy. His last effort Red State was Smith's homage to the Coen brothers, specifically their crime film Fargo. I applauded that film for being Smith's most ambitious film, taking him out of his comfort zone and always pulling the rug out from under me. I had no idea where he was going to take it and I was along for the ride. With Tusk we have Smith dipping his toes into the horror genre a bit further. This time he seems to be channeling more Cronenberg-esque with body mutilation, but knowing the history behind the creation of this project, I can't help but think the entire thing was a big joke.A lot of what happens has to be seen to be believed. After seeing this, I have to ask people who have also seen it a simply question. Should this film have remained a smodcast idea? Was there enough story here to justify Smith making it? I asked myself these questions when the film would oddly throw in some flashbacks. One set of flashbacks are told in black and white from Parks' lifetime, while the other, in colour, belongs to Long. As mentioned earlier, the idea was from a smodcast that Smith and his long-time producing partner, Scott Mosier did and you can actually hear them talking about this idea near the end of the credits. They laugh at the ridiculousness of it all and ask fans to vote #WalrusYes #WalrusNo. Well, as you could have guessed, #WalrusYes won and we have our film. Tusk awkwardly tries to honour the original idea of it being a horror film, the grotesqueness of body horror and also try to be hilariously stupid at the same time. Smith doesn't balance this tone very well and the reason is the cameo performance from a Hollywood A-lister.I'm not going to spoil who the actor is, but he plays the role so comically over the top that I sat there thinking; did Smith give him 100% free range to do whatever the hell he wanted? I was on board with the seriousness of the film until he showed up, then it went off the rails in ways I can't even describe. Smith goes for an ambitious mixture of tone and I think he fails here. Played half for laughs and half for seriousness, I couldn't help but feel a little let down by it all. I think the horror aspect works better than the comedy here. The humour here is lacking, especially with the Long character. He comes off as obnoxious and not funny, despite the numerous jokes he tries to throw out there. Does he deserve what he gets? That question is left in the viewers mind. Some people might make the argument that this film exists merely to give Parks a juicy role. Verbally eloquent, vaguely sinister, Parks spews his lines so well and with such gusto that he gives his performance in Red State a run for its money. It's one of the most successful elements of the film. I am interested in Smith's career direction now. Red State and Tusk aren't receiving as much praise as his previous films, but the man is stepping out of his comfort zone to try something different. He's been accused of being a lazy filmmaker that only makes poop jokes. Not anymore, so I applaud him for this, he's finally making interesting films, good or bad, they are interesting.",Tusk
44,brando647,#WalrusYes -- Kevin Smith Has Gone Insane (and it's Wicked Fun),7,20 August 2015,"I am biased in the realm of Kevin Smith movies so, for the record, my thoughts on TUSK are probably going to be a little more forgiving that what I believe is the general consensus (this movie gotten beaten down on Rotten Tomatoes). I've been a fan of Kevin Smith for years and I know I'll always give his movies a chance. Since the completion of his Jersey series (the Jay/Silent Bob era), his movies have certainly been hit and miss. None have been able to recapture the same level of fun but many have come close. TUSK is one of them. I love the Smith has reached a point where he's not trying to reach general audiences, opting instead to make movies for his existing fans. He's not afraid to go wild with a bizarre idea if it sounds like it could be fun. TUSK is the first film in what will be a trilogy of films set in Canada and opens with our introduction to Wallace Bryton (Justin Long). Wallace is a podcaster with his best friend Teddy (Haley Joel Osment), living a successful life of producing his zany web show and failing to be faithful to his beautiful long-time girlfriend Ally (Genesis Rodriguez). He sets off alone into a remote area of Manitoba for an interview bit and finds a story in the mysterious Howard Howe (Michael Parks). Howard has lived a life of adventure and wishes to share his tale of sailing the sea, meeting Ernest Hemingway, and forming a friendship with a walrus on a deserted island.TUSK is a horror/comedy but it really struggles to fully function in either capacity. It finds a decent balance and I thought it was a weird, fun movie but it's never all that scary or funny enough. This isn't much of an issue for me because the movie's insane premise keeps it interesting and the performances, particularly Michael Parks, are so well done. The biggest problem with TUSK is actually the main character, Wallace. Not the performance; Justin Long does an awesome job. The actual character. Wallace is thoroughly unlikable. He's dismissive of his girlfriend and early scenes show how little he cares about her outside the bedroom. He proudly brags about his infidelities to his best friend/fellow podcaster Teddy, and he's got no moral qualms with taking advantage of others for the sake of producing his show. He's crude, self- centered, and arrogant and, when he finds himself in a horrifying situation, I had zero sympathy for him. Go ahead, Mr. Howe. Wallace deserves it; he already lacks any humanity. So right there, the movie is lacking suspense because I don't care what happens to our protagonist. I care more about Ally and Teddy who, despite how much of a jerk Wallace is, still rush off to Canada to find him when they learn he's in trouble. The real star (and most people seem to agree) is Michael Parks. His raving zealot character in Smith's RED STATE has got nothing on Howard Howe. He gets to go full- blown lunatic in TUSK. He starts off seemingly harmless: an old man in an electric wheelchair with a flair for elegant (if awkward) speech and a desire to share his stories with an interested party. But soon he drops the pretense, reveals his true self, and goes off the chain. It's almost hilarious but you know, if you were trapped alone with this man in the middle of nowhere, you were be scared out of your mind.What I enjoy most about TUSK is that it was done on a super-low budget and has to get creative as a result. That means practical effects. No CG. Any film using practical makeup FX is going to earn bonus points with me. We all know what's coming from the start of the movie and we're waiting anxiously for it. When the suit finally makes its appearance halfway through the film, it does not disappoint. Of course it's going to look fake. I don't care about that. It's a physical prop with presence and weight, it's hideous, it's a little funny, and it works 100% for me. The suit comes out. The walrus training begins. Things get weird. Meanwhile, Ally and Teddy are on the case and, for a while, their story is the more interesting one. Their adventure in Canada to investigate Wallace's disappearance leads them to an encounter late in the film with the film's second strangest character Guy Lapointe. I hated the character the first time I watched TUSK, thinking him too goofy for the film, but he'd grown on me by the second viewing. A former police investigator who's gone solo in his investigation of the weird series of missing persons in Manitoba, he's a surprise cameo (if you've managed to avoid spoilers) that is going to play a larger role in the second film of Smith's Canada film trilogy. I'm annoyed that he shows up so late in the game and it feels like it leads to a rushed conclusion to end the film. The first hour or so of the movie is very slowly paced and then it all gets wrapped up in a quickie of a climax at the finish.TUSK is a movie for Kevin Smith fans and I'm sure not all of them are going to dig it. It's a movie for people with a taste for the weird. It's got good (some great) performances, awesomely disturbing makeup FX, and Smith's unique style of writing running through it. Smith fans will probably have already sought this movie out, but I recommend others give it a shot as well.",Tusk
45,begob,Fascinating,1,2 December 2014,"I enjoyed the first half of this.Took me a while to get past my annoyance at the lead character's smarm, but the back story of how he'd changed and the twist with his cheating girlfriend and buddy made it interesting. The old guy was good and spooky, his menace growing, and the story looked like it could deliver more than a padded out spoof horror-short.Then some idiot turned up in a beret and rambled on pointlessly in a Peter Sellers voice, there were more funny voices, a perfunctory investigation and conflict, and a postscript where everyone obviously thought it was so absurd it had to be entertaining.Then I looked at the credits. Kevin Smith and Jonny Who? Fcuk me!",Tusk
46,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Completely and utterly hilarious, enjoyable, weird and demented, Kevin Smith's ""Tusk"" is unlike anything else you'll likely see.",7,25 September 2014,"I went into ""Tusk"" with some worry and reservation.I consider myself a fairly big Kevin Smith fan. Particularly admiring his films ""Chasing Amy"", ""Dogma"" and ""Red State."" And I think the (fairly recent) ""backlash"" against Smith is unwarranted for the most part. His films have always been unique and had a flavor all their own. And the man himself has always been open, candid and participatory with his fanbase. (Heck, this film's production was decided by his Twitter followers.) I just don't see why, in the past year or so, an increasingly vocal portion of the internet has turned against him.But I wasn't sure what to make of this new film. Knowing it was inspired by an episode of his podcast left me worried it would be one-note. Knowing it was his first real foray into the world of ""body horror"" (a sub-genre that is incredible when done well, but laughable when done poorly) left me worried it might not quite work. And knowing full-well of its ludicrous premise left me worried it would either be too restrained or go way too far. I was worried this might be the first Smith film that I just couldn't get behind or even like. (And yeah, I even kinda dug ""Jersey Girl"", albeit admitting it was flawed.)But boy, was I wrong. While it's definitely far from perfect, and far from being his best work, ""Tusk"" represents a bizarre, hellish and hilarious thrill-ride that left me constantly gasping and laughing. It's a terrifying fun-house ride and a twisted clown show that should please Smith fans and horror/comedy audiences looking for their fix of ""weird.""Justin Long stars as Wallace Bryton, an American pod-caster who savagely makes fun of people in popular viral videos with his co-host. (Haley Joel Osment) When his trip to Canada goes wrong, and he discovers the subject of an interview he had scheduled has passed away, he attempts to salvage the journey by finding someone new to talk to for the show. He stumbles upon an open letter from ""Howard Howe"" (Michael Parks), a reclusive old man seeking someone to share his lifetime's worth of stories with.However, Wallace soon discovers Howe has an ulterior motive. Obsessed with a hatred of humanity and an idolization of a wild walrus he had ""befriended"" while at sea, Howe wishes to use surgical means to transform Wallace into the animal friend he had known years ago. As Howe slowly begins to alter Wallace's body into a grotesque new form (while mentally conditioning him to embrace his wild side), Wallace's girlfriend Ally (Genesis Rodriguez) begins a desperate struggle to find Wallace and save him from his demented captor.The acting is excellent all around, but Parks steals the show. Howe is equally charming, amusing and perfectly over- the-top, while also still able to be threatening. As weird as it is to say, I could see Parks winning some major awards for the role. Long is fantastic as Wallace. Though undeniably unlikeable, you still feel for him, and get a sense that beneath his cruel exterior, there's a fragile soul. And his role as the ""transforming"" Wallace/Walrus is just a hoot to watch. Rodriguez and Osment ground the film perfectly, giving wonderful weight to their smaller roles.The only actor I cannot really comment on is the well-known and even mythical guest-star who shall go unnamed, to save the surprise. But what I can say is that this guest-role will definitely leave audiences polarized, as it's VERY ""out there."" But I felt that, within the context of the film, it worked. The movie is quite zany on its own during the second half, and I think this character did a good job ""ushering in"" the audience to the film's true craziness when he showed up. And he supplied PLENTY of laughs.Smith's work on the film is an undeniable sign of growth as a storyteller. His script is tight, concise and full of great moments of shock and hilarity. And I found this to be by far his most visually striking work. Smith often used to sort-of belittle his own skills as a director and visual storyteller. (In part because his first film films were basic and simple in their execution) But this film is slick, stylish and wickedly shot. His guidance of the camera and performances is expert, and the senses of dread and humor he builds are wonderful.However, this is definitely a film of some flaws, which is where it loses some points. The film has some ""fat"" to be trimmed. (Or would that be ""blubber"" in this case?) A few sequences feel too drawn out, which creates a somewhat inconsistent pacing that makes it feel jarring at times. I also felt that the (rather radical) tonal shift that occurs midway through could give some viewers a sense of ""stylistic whip-lash."" And it could be argued that the movie is a bit clustered in it's final half-hour, attempting to juggled a variety of emotions including fear, dread, sorrow, bemusement and amusement. It's almost too hard to concentrate and be mindful of how the film makes you feel, which is a pretty big problem.That being said, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't completely absorbed in the movie from start-to-finish. And I most certainly will admit that I completely and utterly enjoyed myself. (And was quite shocked by just how darkly hilarious the film was, even at its bleakest moments.) It's not a film for everyone. And I can understand the polarized reaction. But for me (as a Smith fan, a fan of horror, and a fan of ""the weird"" and ""strange"") this was definitely worth seeing. And I will be buying it the second it's out on Blu-Ray.I give ""Tusk"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Not for everyone. But if you're even remotely curious, it's well worth giving a shot.",Tusk
47,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,"Trying Too Hard, Feels Forced",2,19 March 2015,"This film was designed to offend, shock and gross out its audience with loads of crude humour, swearing, gore, sexual perversion and Canadian stereotypes, and it shows. When I think of some of the funniest horror comedies I've seen, like Shaun of the Dead, Sleepaway Camp or The Paper Boy, there's just something about them that are effortlessly amusing and lovable in their own twisted way, whether it was intentional or not. With Tusk, the horror feels cheap and silly, and the comedy feels forced and annoying, not funny. The ending wasn't what I was expecting, but again it's just more low-brow shock value, and in the golden age of indie films getting their time in the spotlight more often than ever, it's honestly not all that unique of a plot device. I could see this one appealing to twelve-year-olds who still find dick jokes funny maybe, or people who want to creep out their friends at a party, but I just didn't see what all the hype was about. Johnny Depp was especially obnoxious and annoying in this one; was the point of it supposed to make viewers want to punch every character in the face?",Tusk

The great exception here is Johnny Depp, his role is truly one the greatest stinkers in the history of cinema (and there's a sequel, too! - wíth his daughter, who was in this one, also). Genesis Rodriqguez and Haley Joel Osment deserve a prize for keeping straight faces while facing him in that cafeteria. But actually, the whole team who made this deserves a kick up the ass for not recognizing beforehand what crap this would turn out to be.Nuff said. 2 out of 10 (one point for Long and Parks, and one bonus point for all the hard work on the walrus suit).P.s.

49,gedikreverdi,Walrus or nothing!,7,28 January 2021,One of the podcasters Wallace went to Canada to do an interview about the kill bill kid whom they find very amusing because he accidentally cut off his own leg on camera with a sword. He arrived to Winnipeg and saw the funeral of the guy who just took his own life with the very sword. Back home his girlfriend is cheating him with his podcaster friend Haley Joel Osmend because Wallace is being rude to her. He saw an ad at the bathroom of the bar and called the guy who says he has a lot of stories to tell because he was a sailor. Wallace arrived to his secluded house in the middle of nowhere. They sipped their teas and Wallace passed out and woke up to see himself on the wheelchair and one of his legs were amputated. He wanted to turn him into a walrus because he was saved by a walrus in a uninhabited island after their ship sank. Howard How's backstory was sad as he was an orphan and became a sailor to run away from people who abused him as a kid. He wanted to turn a person into a walrus because he had to kill and eat that savior walrus before they found him so he wanted to give a chance to him this time to fight for his life. They fought while the other two found the house with the detective thanks to the girls in the gas station. They fought like two walruses and Wallace as the Mr.Tusk killed him with his teeth which are actually his shin bones. Then they keep Wallace in an exotic animal house as a walrus and visited him with fish as a gift. It was such an original horror comedy with even touching moments. It was good to see Haley Joel and Johnny Depp as the weird funny detective.,Tusk
50,KnightsofNi11,Tusk is everything I love about Kevin Smith,8,30 January 2015,"I am so incredibly happy that this world has a human being like Kevin freaking Smith. In a cinematic age polluted with writers telling uninspired stories and directors taking no risks in their filmmaking it's always so refreshing to see what old Kevin is up to. He's always been that filmmaker who makes the movies HE wants to make, so now that he's earned millions to put into ridiculous films that are part art and part excuse to hang out with your friends making a crazy ass movie, we get the traumatizing horror/comedy Tusk. Tusk stars Justin Long as Wallace Bryton, a podcaster who goes to Canada to interview an old fisherman named Howard Howe who claims to have incredible seafaring stories to tell. However, Wallace gets more than he bargained for when he's abducted by Howe who reveals himself to be a fisherman with what must be a pretty great background in surgeon practice when he turns Wallace the human into Wallace the walrus. Yes, you read that right. A walrus. Tusk is a movie about Justin Long getting turned into a walrus by a crazy old Canadian man. It's at this point that you should know whether or not you want to see this movie, and if you share my taste for the twisted and deranged then you REALLY want to see this movie. Tusk is essentially Kevin Smith's 102 minute long trolling of the film community. It's a big F-U to high brow comedy and ""sophisticated"" horror, and a slap in the face to typical B-movie fare, because of it's B-movie concept packed with great actors and excellent production value. But really Smith doesn't give a damn what you think of his film because he's busy laughing it up with his buddies who I'm positive had an incredible time making such an absurd film. If you're at the level of success enjoyed by Smith then making this kind of a film is a win in every way. He's not trying to impress anyone here and obviously isn't trying to be taken seriously. And that approach to filmmaking definitely rubs off on the film itself because Tusk is an absolute blast. It's got all of the comedic brilliance that one expects from Kevin Smith dialogue, and it also brings you the joy of being able to watch such an impossibly bizarre concept actually play out on screen. The blend of funny and disturbing works so well here, which is in part due to Smith's writing, and also because of the killer performance by Michael Parks who is one of the creepiest old men to ever grace the silver screen. Not only is Parks great but Justin Long surprisingly kills it as well. He's convincingly terrified for most of the movie and his walrus performance is...well... that's something you have to see for yourself. Tusk also has one of the most unexpectedly brilliant cameos I've seen in ages. So brilliant in fact I'm not going to tell you who it is. I will tell you that that performance is far better than Haley Joel Osment or Genesis Rodriguez who are good, but forgettable. The great thing about Tusk is that there's so much twisted entertainment value and it's so disturbingly unique that all of its shortcomings become so forgivable. Tusk is certainly a movie wrought with issues, but it's nothing major enough to detract from how much fun it is. Smith's writing is mostly fantastic, but there are some scenes considerably weaker than others. It's also got some weird pacing issues going on, with some scenes playing out way too long, probably because Smith was just having too much fun watching his actors do what they do. I would have liked certain things to be cut down to allow more time for other more walrusy things to happen, but honestly I'm fairly certain there will never be another movie about a man turned into a walrus, so I am pretty damn satisfied with what I got to see in Tusk. There's no two ways about it. I really did love this movie. The vomit-inducing terror that unfolds on screen has you laughing and cringing all at the same time. My stomach churns as my brain smiles, and honestly I wasn't asking for anything more. Admittedly I have some Kevin Smith bias as I'm a big fan of the fat-man's work, but even putting all bias aside I honestly believe that Tusk is a stroke of horrible, disgusting, hilarious genius.",Tusk
51,Hollywood_Yoda,WTF?? Kevin Smith Should Stick to the ViewAskewniverse,4,22 July 2019,"I don't think Kevin Smith should be writing or directing horror films, it's definitely not his forte. This film is so messed up beyond belief, it was gut-wrenching to watch, not just because of the horrible things going on, but the writing and acting were terrible. Justin Long overplayed his character; he should not be the lead in any production, good or bad!!It's really hard to believe this film is the start of a Canada trilogy by Smith, produced by his wife and acted in by his daughter, Johnny Depp and Depp's daughter! Oy vey!! This flick is hard to watch, but honestly, I liked Depp in this film, and that's saying a lot.

It starts running off the rails when Michael Parks is doing his own VO narration during one of his operations. In a way, this might encapsulate one of the errors: Instead of opting for the terror of The Unknown, Smith resorts to a cheap VO narration gimmick to spoon-feed us way, way too much cluttered backstory. And there's much clutter to come.Also, tone becomes bizarrely mismanaged. While Smith had not-ineffectually blended in a modulated bit of Canadian stereotyping, his detective Lapointe (Depp) is absurd, stupid, and way, way beside-the-point. This, and so many other directoral false notes utterly savage the very real tension Smith had built, up to that point.It's a drag. I'd heard the premise of this flick, and looked forward to seeing a smart, horrific, fun product brought successfully to the screen. I'm one of those folks who very sincerely wants to see Smith succeed and prosper (and I rejoice when he does), and Tusk really let me down.Don't bother watching it.",Tusk
53,gregsrants,Creation from the creative mind of sick Kevin Smith,7,13 September 2014,"Kevin Smith is one of the most fascinating men working over multiple platforms today. Whether its movies, podcasts or television, Smith continues to bring his geeky playfulness to mainstream audiences that lap it up like Pavlovian experiments.If you have every listened to any of Smith's SModcasts you will learn quickly that Smith is open to talking about anything from politics to masturbating into a beer can. Whatever comes to Smith's creative mind is fair game and his ingenious warped brain cells have pulled together to give us his latest theatrical event titled Tusk.Tusk stars Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers) as podcaster Wallace Bryton who travels from Los Angeles to Manitoba, Canada in search of a story. When his original intentions are met with unexpected results, Wallace answers a barroom washroom ad and finds himself in the company of Howard Howe (Michael Parks) who might just be the 'most interesting man in the world'. A few war stories into their meeting over a cup of tea and Wallace can't hide his excitement of finding such a treasure trove of historical references as seen through the eyes of the elderly Howard.But things then take a turn to the macabre. Wallace succumbs to the drugs hidden in his tea and when he awakes he is faced with the horror of being a medical experiment to which Howard wishes to transform the young podcaster into the likeness of a creature that provided him friendship and warmth after a shipwreck of his past.What happens next is a Jackson Pollock of WTF-ness that is weird, funny, repugnant, awkward and downright fascinating – sometimes all within the same scene.Michael Parks is perfectly cast as the sinister Howard Howe. His exact pronunciation gives the perfect delivery to Smith's script that gets as close to the edge as it can without losing his audience down the cliff. Justin Long is terminally committed to his role and his Wallace Bryton and subsequent transformation are likely to become part of cult culture lore.In an effort to keep audiences engaged with a possible fairy-tale ending, Smith enlists the help of actors Haley Joel Osment (yes, of ""I see Walrus People"") and the drop dead gorgeous Genesis Rodriguez as two friends who engage the services of one Guy Lapointe (an over-the-top Johnny Depp) to assist in tracking down Wallace's whereabouts in Winnipeg. Say that last bit five times fast. We dare ya.Tusk is more strange than good. But it's a good strange so that will just muddle things even further. As if Kevin Smith watched The Human Centipede and Boxing Helena in a double feature then dropped some mushrooms and started pounding out a script. If you take the film for what it is – it is great fun. Only Depp's overexposure as Lapointe takes any wind from the film's sails. If you are expecting a serious toned horror film, then you must look elsewhere. Do not forget that this is the same mind that didn't think twice of putting a naked dancer and a donkey together in his earlier works so there is no line in the sand that he's afraid of crossing.The audience at our Toronto International Film Festival screening seemed almost confused as they left the theatre. A mark to which I am sure Smith would take great pride. But we had a ball. An unabashed rollicking time revelling in Smith's creative juices.www.killerreviews.com",Tusk

55,bryank-04844,"'Tusk' won't be for everyone, but if you're curious, you might find that you're glad you bought the ticket and took the ride.",7,12 August 2015,"There is no doubt that Kevin Smith belongs in the same bracket as some of the best directors and story tellers of all time. He along with Quentin Tarantino and a few other filmmakers in the early 90s made their own creative films on a very cheap budget and hit success and have continued to make films still to this day. But Kevin's story is quite the fun one. This is a guy who loves comics and movies who dropped out of film school, worked at a video store and maxed out his credit cards to the tune of $20k to make his first film 'Clerks'.When that debuted, it was met with critical and audience praise and launched Smith's and his friend-producer's careers that are making bank today. Kevin is mostly known for his Jay and Silent Bob films such as 'Mallrats', 'Chasing Amy', and 'Dogma'. He's made several other films which have all garnered a cult following and are still enjoyed today. Yes, even 'Jersey Girl', which I happen to love. Needless to say, Smith is known for his dick and fart joke type of humor in his films with a bit of life and lessons thrown in. During this time, Kevin branched out from his usual comedy genre and made a straight out action thriller with a movie called 'Red-State'. It starred Michael Parks and John Goodman and was loosely based on the Fred Phelps (God Hates Fags) clan out of Topeka, Kansas. It was very different for Smith, both stylistically, visually, and story wise. And he completely owned it and made a successful and entertaining film. Now let's fast forward a few years later and now we have a new film called 'Tusk' from Kevin Smith who has said publicly that ""this is the result in my career where I don't give a hoot."" And man, does that ring true. I love when a filmmaker has made it and is happy with themselves that they can make anything they want without any interruption from any studio, and that is what Kevin has accomplished.This film was thought up on one of his podcasts and he just went balls out and made an unrelenting and darkly funny horror film. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll climax before the end. The film opens up with Justin Long and Haley Joel Osment (Wallace and Teddy), who are indeed shock-jock podcasters who have made it big. Their shtick is interviewing and looking for crazy and embarrassing people over the internet and talking with them and making fun of them. Needless to say, they aren't all roses and sunshine. Wallace hears about a kid online known as 'Kill-Bill kid' and sets out to Canada to interview him for the show. Once he is there, he is no longer able to interview the kid, but he sees a bulletin board at a local bar that promises amazing stories, adventures and a free room and board.He heads out to the middle of nowhere and to this very nice, large house and is greeted by an elderly man named Howard Howe (Michael Parks). Howard is well spoken and full of great stories from his past that Wallace is just eating up. However, Wallace is knocked out unconscious from the tea he just drank and things get out of hand very fast. Wallace wakes up, not remembering much and is confined to a wheelchair where one of his legs is missing. Thing get a bit scary as Howard might not be the jolly guy he made Wallace think he was. In a funny yet very tense scene, we see what Howard is truly up to as he tells Wallace he made friends with an actual walrus a few decades ago and that he aims to re-connect with his old pal both physically and mentally with his long lost friend through Wallace.The film sort of plays out in two segments. On one hand, you have Wallace going through some pretty horrific stuff at Howard's house. And on the other, you have Teddy and his girlfriend Ally (Genesis Rodriguez) out looking for him as he was able to leave both a message before his phone was taken. Teddy and Ally enlist the help of a police detective named Guy Lapointe (Johnny Depp) who is almost unrecognizable in this role, but it quite comedic in nature. But once the big reveal happens mid way through the film, Kevin let's it all out for everyone to see, as if he's saying, ""Yes, I went there and here's more."" It's quite good. My only complaint really is the pacing of the film. It really drags through the second half of the movie, as we see Wallace's friends and Lapointe looking for him all over Canada. But this is a journey that you should make, because you haven't seen anything like it before.Long, Rodriguez, and Osment are all great in their roles and sell each character perfectly. And Depp is of course perfect under makeup and with an accent as he slips into a new character he can add to his impressive resume. But the movie really shines when Michael Parks is on screen. His character, who we never fully meet, except that we know he is indeed crazy, is played so flawlessly that in one minute you can be terrified at Howard, then the next, be laughing with him. Parks truly deserves some sort of acting award here. As for Smith, you have to hand to him. He made a completely insane film and made it work on almost every level. 'Tusk' won't be for everyone, but if you're curious, you might find that you're glad you bought the ticket and took the ride.",Tusk

Well if you've seen Human Centipede you kinda know where the plot is gonna go... If you haven't perhaps it will shock you and you'll find it disturbing but in comparison with Human Centipede not so much, I guess the most disturbing part is that the viewer is supposed to laugh at Justin Long's character's undescribable painYeah he's a moron for making a living of making fun of other peoples pain and misery but I don't know maybe I'm just too nice but I can't say that he ""got what he deserved"" cause frankly even tho the people he was making fun of in his Podcast went through crappy stuff, like with the Kill Bill Kid stuff that was at least his decision to swing that sword around and causing that accidentIt has a couple moments, but not many... Johnny Depp plays his detective character like it belong in a goofball comedy like THE RATRACE or something, while Haley Joel Osment and Genesis Rodrigues plays there character more seriously...

57,DarthVoorhees,"If you want a good bad movie, 'Tusk' is an exceptional example.",4,10 January 2015,"I sort of dug Kevin Smith's last horror film 'Red State'. I thought both Michael Parks and John Goodman were brilliant in it and it felt like a genuine horror film with legitimately suspenseful moments. This thing is another beast entirely. The whole thing is a giant horror freak show and I guess comedy if I were to be generous.'Tusk' could have been a complete waste and a disaster. Fortunately for the audiences with the right palate 'Tusk' is salvageable in the campy bad movie sense. 'Tusk' is the best kind of bad horror movie, the one that goes way over the top that you kind of have to admire it's misguided and stupid audacity. Michael Parks and Johnny Depp are too actors who have problems with subtly and they fit right at home here...Michael Parks again is let off the leash to be as crazy and bizarrely mad as he can be. His nonsensical monologues are actually kind of entertaining in the way bad horror material delivered by a good actor can be. Johnny Depp steals the show in this thing though. This thing makes his Tim Burton eccentricities look subtle by comparison. Smith does give them some insane dialogue and they both go all the way with it and maybe more. This is entertaining, maybe ironically but it is entertaining nonetheless. I imagine some audiences would find this to be a criticism and maybe it should be but it is fun nonetheless.That being said there just isn't enough material to sustain this movie. This thing has so much filler and it's horrific human-walruspede is just really stupid looking. Kevin Smith can still write quirky fun stuff but for every gem there is just goofy garbage. I don't care about the world of pod casting. The Wallace character is just stupid and inorganic. I felt as if Smith didn't quite know what to do with him. He's just a kind of repetitive bland jerk and so there can't be a great deal of empathy to be felt with him. If he didn't have Parks in the walrus scenes than this thing wouldn't have been watchable.The joy one gets out of this is over the top acting in a bad horror movie, nothing more. If that isn't your cup of tea than skip this but I can dig it sometimes. 'Tusk' isn't a good movie. It's an entertaining bad movie which I didn't mind watching once and I will never watch it again.",Tusk
58,Darkside-Reviewer,# Walrus NO Kevin Smith,3,13 August 2019,"This movie is meant to be a dark comedy but anyone who found this movie to be funny needs a serious mental health check as the movie focuses on a Podcaster who gets abducted mutilated and stitched into a Walrus the ""Comedy"" aspect in Kevin Smith's opinion is hilarious but is really just disturbing I am a fan of horror and Slasher movies and enjoy body horror movies but this film just lacks any compassion for the tortured character by not ending his suffering at the end of the movie when he's shouting in pain instead of putting him out of his misery after finally taking revenge on his captor and torturer they keep him alive unable to speak or have the process undone they put him in an animal sanctuary to suffer as his best friend and ex girlfriend who are now together come visit him and feed him a fish the part that made me feel sick was actually during the credits when a recorded discussion is played with Kevin Smith describing the ending of the movie as he laughs hysterically at the Idea of mutilation and suffering as well as mental torture.I wouldn't recommend watching this movie if you have a weak stomach as it isn't plesent to watch.",Tusk
59,CANpatbuck3664,So Bad Its Scary,2,19 January 2016,"Kevin Smith has been experimenting with different genres lately. He made Red State not too long ago (which I admittedly I have yet to see) and now he's trying out the horror genre with the movie Tusk. Upon hearing about this movie, I thought the concept was bizarre but I wanted to see it for 2 reasons. 1) I haven't seen many of Kevin's movies but the ones I have seen have been really good and surprisingly memorable (Zack and Miri Make A Porno is hilarious and Chasing Amy is one of the most unique romantic comedies I have ever seen) and 2) The fact the movie is set in Canada was supposed to be a big part of the plot, as it is part of Kevin's True North Trilogy. After popping in the Blu-ray, my brother (who I had told about the plot beforehand) warned me that it was going to suck but I laughed him off as just being pessimistic, little did I know how awful the movie would be.*Minor-Major Spoilers Ahead* Wallace Bryton (Justin Long) and Teddy Craft (Haley Joel Osment) are pod-casters and they run the popular pod-cast The ""Not-See Party"" (I know..... so funny right? Not even a little). They have quite the following and they primarily mock popular internet videos and the people behind them. Wallace especially is a jerk who seems to have very little compassion for these people. Because Teddy has something against flying, Wallace is travelling to Manitoba, Canada to interview the Kill Bill Kid. Even though he has a dedicated and beautiful girlfriend Ally (Genesis Rodriguez) he insists on travelling alone because he can't be the jerk he needs to be around her, that and also because he constantly cheats on her while he's travelling.When he gets to Canada, he finds out the guy he was supposed to interview, the Kill Bill Kid, has committed suicide. Wallace is angry as he no longer has a story. While he's in a restroom in a bar though, he sees a bill posted by an old man who claims he has lived a fantastical life and wants to share his stories if someone would just come see him. In need of something to report on, Wallace heads to the address which is a typical secluded, creepy looking mansion. He meets the old man Howard Howe (Michael Parks) who is confined to a wheelchair. He starts to tell him a story about being shipwrecked and while he is explaining what happened Wallace mysteriously faints. He wakes up strapped into a chair with his leg missing, wondering what had happened and what Howe's intentions truly are.I have very little to say about this movie that's positive but I'll do my best. I found some of the cast to be pretty decent despite the crap they were handed. I haven't seen Genesis Rodriguez in many dramatic roles but I was surprised how effective she was, she gets a nice monologue and she delivers it well. Haley Joel Osment is fine, Michael Parks is good when he's not cackling maniacally or torturing Justin Long. The only other thing is that the poster looks cool. That's it.I maintain that this could have been an interesting horror movie but it's shocking how slapped together this movie is. It was made cheap and that's okay but it feels like there was so little effort put into it. The plot is all over the place, the characters are unlikable (Wallace is such a dick that I didn't feel sorry for him at all even when he's being tortured). Tusk makes good/decent actors look bad (Tusk makes Justin Long and *spoiler* Johnny Depp look terrible)and drags them down into the muck that is this movie. The ending was so ridiculous and off putting that I slowly started shrinking in my seat just watching it. The one thing that I didn't expect despite the low budget was how awful the makeup and effects would be. The completed walrus suit looks like crap, I couldn't believe they put it on screen.I don't want to go on about how unbelievably bad this movie is. I'm not trolling, I don't enjoy just ripping on the team of people that put this together but I can't help but wonder if this movie was intentionally made to be awful on purpose. I don't rate a movie worse than a 3/10 often, to me if its lower than that, it really did something to make me mad or did something special to rate that lowly. This movie did, it shook my faith in Kevin Smith even though I have enjoyed other movies he has made. If anything it just reminded me that sometimes I need to be a little more selective about what I decide to watch. Don't watch this movie, it's not worth it even if it seems appealing to you.",Tusk

Also disturbing is to realize that a lot of people will consider this as farce or ""gore porn"".There are relationships like those in the movie hiding in front of our face in various forms that we don't recognize or of which we are fully aware and do nothing (and intend to keep) as they serve some (sick) purpose under the guise of something harmless as sustenance.Brilliant, a masterpiece.",Tusk

(they couldn't get them closed again fast enough)If I were to make a list of worst movies ever made, all-time - this would easily make it on there. Maybe even Top 5. It was horrible, horrible, horrible. Oh, did I mention that it was horrible? Yeah ... it was HORRIBLE.Podcaster, Wallace Bryton (Justin Long), travels to Manitoba, Canada to interview someone known as the Kill Bill Kid, famous for severing his own leg with a samurai sword - however, upon arrival, he finds out that he'd committed suicide. So, not to waste his time or money for the trip, he decides to interview a retired seaman instead with the promise of free room and board in exchange for hearing his story. Bryton goes and has dinner with the old man - never to leave the house the same again.The first 30 minutes or so of this film was actually very good. It had my attention, it intrigued me and pulled me into the story. Up until the point where Bryton is drugged and the transformation from human to walrus begins. Then the movie, just plain and simply, became sick and disgusting. Michael Parks is one of those actors who isn't afraid to take a chance and as the disturbed seaman in this movie, he turns in his weirdest performance to date. I don't know how anyone in their right mind could be entertained by such filth.I highly recommend this movie ... for the incinerator. Throw it in the fire and let it burn. This is absolute and utter crap. It takes someone who is disposed to sick and gross stories in the first place to enjoy it - in my opinion. Go ahead and click that ""Not Helpful"" button.

63,RevRonster,The concept is better than the produt...,4,26 December 2014,"""Tusk"" seemed like a deliciously wicked and amusingly strange film that seemed to parody ""The Human Centipede."" I was pretty excited for the film but ended up deeply disappointed when I actually got to see it.The film starts terrifically and feels like it is building to a promise land of dark humor and total shock value but after a decent opening and great build up, the film proves that the premise was too thin to support a feature running length and ends dragging very badly during the second half. Additionally, the humor falls flat and feels more hacky than a great use of unfunny humor being turned into brilliant gags, the ending I found to be super disappointing, the surprise appearance of Johnny Depp starts fun but ends up a dead horse being viciously beaten and overused, and Justin Long is entirely unbearable in the film. However, Michael Parks' performance is amazing beyond words and that becomes the film's saving grace.I really wanted to like ""Tusk"" but it ultimately just felt like a waste of time after its great buildup. I hope the rest of Kevin Smith's unofficial Canadian trilogy is better.",Tusk
64,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Walrus Maybe: Never Stretch a Star Cameo,5,20 September 2014,"""It's such a fine line between stupid and, uh, clever,"" said a member of the fictional heavy metal band Spinal Tap. And the same can be said of Kevin Smith's TUSK, in which a snarky podcaster is trapped inside the rural manor of a crazy old man with an obsession for walruses! The first half is pretty great, aiming headlong for horror film parody The doomed claustrophobic setting of MISERY combined with the mad scientist agenda of SSSSSSS pits two polar opposites in the middle of nowhere, Canada Justin Long's Wallace delivers the Kevin Smith dialogue with perfection. Spouting one-liners and poking fun at just about everything, and then some, he's more a brash Jason Lee than, say, the Ben Affleck style nice guy protagonist.His show partner, Teddy, played by a fully grown Haley Joel Osment, is the straight man of the group – and the least adventurous. With a cheating heart piercing his (way too) gorgeous girlfriend, the perpetually flawed Wallace makes for a victim who reaps what he sows: although no one deserves what's eventually coming to him...Enter veteran character-actor Michael Parks as the ""wise"" old fella with many tales to tell. His eccentric Howard Howe delivers Gothic monologues while Long bends a caustic ear to every overly-pronounced syllable, often lifted from literary quotes. Their conversations could have gone on forever: If only we remained indoors...Sadly, TUSK hits a massive wall with the introduction of Johnny Depp's would-be rescuer, Guy Lapointe. A combination of Dr. Livingston, Inspector Clouseau and Columbo, Depp lets loose a 15-minute string that hardly progresses the story at hand. With phony makeup befitting an SNL skit, not only does he reveal an otherwise mysterious lunatic, we get a narrative flashback turning the deliciously sinister Parks into a nonthreatening clown.It isn't Johnny's fault, entirely. Any character intruding upon such offbeat potential would have done the same amount of damage. But one gets the feeling indie director Smith was getting his big name money's worth with this prolonged ""surprise"" role – damn shame all that cotton candy had to ruin such a wonderfully devious Fun House/Freak Show ride.",Tusk
65,bbickley13-921-58664,Brilliantly disturbing effort by Kevin smith,7,21 September 2014,"I was always a fan of Kevin Smith films. He's a great story teller but lately I notice, especially after watching his last awesome movie Red State, that he's really becoming a better filmmaker.The movie resembles The Human Centipede. Justin long plays an pod cast host looking for an interesting story to tell in Canada, and gets lured into being the latest victim of a psychopath looking to create the only true friendship he has ever had.Based on what seem to be just a really drawn out conversation Kevin Smith was having on his pod cast, the movie was told on the show in such a funny matter, but translated on the screen, the humor is still there, which makes the horror of the whole thing give you a sick and twisted feeling inside.The special effects make up on this move totally makes it. The look of the ""monster"" they created was amazing. I was shocked, like I just smoked a joint then I saw the Walrus shocked, Making it perfect Kevin Smith.Always a good with the dialog, I felt that Smith is coming into Tarantino type status here with the look and feel of the movie.

66,MattBrady099,Wallace the Walrus,6,16 December 2014,"Wallace Bryton: ""I don't wanna die in Canada!"".The story to Tusk is about a young man goes searching for his best friend, and pod-cast co-host, after he goes missing in the backwoods of Canada, along with his friend's girlfriend.Tusk was a movie that I never heard of until last week when I got a chance to watch it. But before seeing it I heard a lot of mix reviews for this movie, some people say it's like a guilty pleasure to them and they had a good time with the film, but with other people who said the movie is laughably bad and nothing to it.In my opinion Tusk is a okay movie and I was actually surprised that I didn't laugh as much as I thought I would, but there are some scenes that made me laugh a little bit like Justin Long character (Wallace) start's to scream for help and the mad man who's turning Wallace into a Walrus played by Michael Parks, he start's to make a weird but funny scream while pulling a mad face, that scene was pretty funny.Kevin Smith as a film director can make good, okay and really bad movies during his career. Dogma was brilliant, Zack and Miri Make a Porno was descent flick and Tusk falls into the okay pile.Justin Long's did a good job in this movie, not fantastic, just good. His character is supposed to be a big douche bag, but even a douche bag in real life wouldn't be like this guy, because Justin Long made his character so unlikable and so stuck up at the beginning that I truly didn't care for him, until the end where I didn't hate him as much and I think that's what the movie was going for.Michael Parks did great in this film playing the insane person who's obsessed with walrus, and he got all the craziness and the comfortableness in just one character. Haley Joel Osment also was good in the movie, just like Justin not great just good.The movie itself and I'm not joking around here but it's actually pretty enjoyable, you don't see much of the gore just the after math, like one of his body part will have been removed and judging by the way it's been cut off or removed it looks extremely painfully and a lot of hard work.The movie has a lot of problems like the film is trying to be it's so bad that it's funny but it really didn't work for me, because the writing is amazingly mix for me and it's very usual for me to say that. The comedy wasn't funny at all and it just left me into silence, until that weird but funny scream while pulling a mad face scene was pretty funny. The all movie should have been a shock fest kind of film and I normally don't request a horror movie to do that, but a story like this is like a shock fest film that never got the big picture.Johnny Depp french accident in this movie was just god awful and to be honest he should have been cut out of the film. I like Johnny Depp as a person and as a actor but this wasn't his movie to shine in.Overall Tusk is okay film, but I wouldn't really recommend it but if you're the kind of person who likes to watch stupid horror flicks like this then go ahead.",Tusk
67,MovieHoliks,Didn't Completely Hate This...,4,1 June 2015,"Over the years, Kevin Smith has given us a series of films, starting with 1994's ""Clerks"", all set in the same universe (with the exception of 2004's ""Jersey Girl"" and 2008's ""Zach & Miri Make a Porno""), revolving around a group of characters- with Jay and ""Silent Bob"" at the center of all the madness. A few years ago, he wondered outside that territory with his take on the Phelps family (of Westboro Baptist Church fame) with the thriller ""Red State"". I wasn't terribly impressed with that movie, but thought it was a decent effort.With last year's ""Tusk"", he attempts a really dark comic take on such movies as ""Human Centipede"" and ""Boxing Helena"". I heard, while this movie was not a solid box office hit, it's budget was so low, that it actually did decent business-?? Justin Long stars in the titular role- a man kidnapped by some nutjob who attempts to turn him physically into a walrus. And I'll tell ya, maybe it's just my twisted sense of humor, but this is one of those movies I found myself chuckling at during some of the excruciating torture scenes- then wondering to myself- why???Well, I definitely canNOT recommend this movie for really ANY audience- certainly not Kevin Smith fans.

68,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Bound to be polarizing - it's twisted and perverse, but very Smith-esque",9,22 December 2014,"Kevin Smith's vanity film Tusk is sure to be polarizing: either you will love it or hate it, there won't be any gray area. Archon Cinema Reviews happen to love it's crazy ass.Tusk is a half comedy and half horror film where podcaster Wallace Bryton goes missing while in Canada out looking for content for his radio show.Wallace's cringe-humor podcast with his best friend Teddy revolves around Wallace going out interviewing zany people and then telling Teddy about it, the podcast is aptly called the Not-See Party. Wallace ventures out to the great white north of Canada to the boonies of Manitoba for an especially gnarly story. When it falls through, Wallace finds a plan-B and decides to interview this odd and mysterious seafarer Howard Howe. At this point Tusk turns from straight comedy to straight horror when Wallace goes MIA and his BFF and girlfriend Allison team up to look for him.If you don't know the idea behind Tusk, Kevin Smith came up with it while talking on his own podcast with his own friend. Can the film be more of a vanity project under these circumstances? I don't think so! Smith makes the film he wants with complete disregard for appeasing the viewers – and it pays off big for his fans and others who are simply dark and twisty in their gooey center.Tusk is neither comedic-horror or horrific-comedy and a clear and defined line can be drawn (or spliced) in the film where the two shant meet. The first thirty minutes contain joke after masterful joke playing into American stereotypes of Canadians and Canadia in general. The latter portion making up about an hour of the film is perverse horror. It is unnerving and unsettling with completely weird and off-kilter imagery.Justin Long, who plays Wallace, is the quintessential American who just can't keep his mouth shut and is marvelous. Michael Parks was made to play serial killer Howard Howe and both Long and Parks are perfect together. Relative newcomer to mainstream audiences Genesis Rodriguez is smart, beautiful and most importantly believably real as Allison, girlfriend to the consummate nerd that is Wallace. Even Haley Joel Osment is the perfect beta-geek as Wallace's bestie Teddy. There is an A-lister in Tusk that I think should remain a surprise cameo until you watch the film. With that said, Kevin Smith's Tusk definitely could have done without it and it was a massive distraction that cheapened the horror half of the film. If you heard about the cameo then you should know who I am talking about.Kevin Smith's Tusk is a film for the oddball freaks, when it comes down to it, but nobody can say it's not original. A good litmus test as to whether Tusk will be your cup of tea, in our opinion: If you like the 1981 original The Evil Dead or From Dusk Till Dawn's overboard but fresh take on their associated genres (especially when they were initially released and before they garnered cult-like acclaim) then you probably won't dislike Tusk.Check out our WEBSITE for all the 2014 horrors and recent releases reviews in FULL.",Tusk

This is a pretty amazing combination of acting and makeup. I was also surprised to see that the two young clerks were played by the daughters of Kevin Smith and Johnny Depp! Michael Parks (who I'm not familiar with) is very good in his role, as is Justin Long. And Haley Joel Osment is just fat.The movie is basically a rip off of ""The Human Centipede"" (with a bit of the atmosphere of ""Hostel"") and I can't decide whether the walrus makeup was good or bad - it had some nice qualities, but it was too unreal and distracting.",Tusk

72,eagandersongil,An acidic mix of humor and terror,7,2 January 2020,"Kevin Smith's Tusk ""has a trash soul but an exquisite execution, not that the film is an artistic milestone or even a great movie, but its Amazing virtues need to be praised.As soon as we look at the script we realize the great difficulty of cataloging and creating the meaning and rhythm necessary for the feature, and this problem is present, Kevin tells us the story of a podcaster in search of a good story that ends up falling into the hands of a psychopath who wants to turn it into a walrus, yes, a walrus, we realize an influence with the Dutch ""Human Centipede"" but Kevin eventually leads us to the less eschatological side of the thing, and prioritizes seeking a suspenseful atmosphere that flirts with the dark humor, which ends up creating a tragicomic that is not deep in fear nor is it funny, but it is fun and holds the viewer.Technically the movie is good, Kevin Smith is a great director, and even with the limited resources the filmmaker can pull off strong acting and great actors, as well as being able to fit a beautiful photo and set composition, the editing of the film is also very good and its narrative pace is compelling, and its use of cameras and framing is wonderful.The performances of the film are good, especially Michael Parks, the late American actor is a separate show with his performance completely out of place, is a perfect and scary performance, and is responsible for creating the suspense core of the film, and especially for serve as a pillar for the second act of the movie, which is very good, Justin Long is also a pleasant surprise, the actor permeates very well from humor to terror.""Tusk"" that came out of a director's joke on twitter is another Kevin Smith movie that we like for its pleasant surprise, we expect a weak and flawed movie but we get a cool movie with virtues, either for its acting or direction.

73,jawneyfloros,Kevin Smith does horror,10,21 November 2018,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you be careful who you trust or be careful who you agree to interview. The direction is really good especially because Kevin Smith proves that he doesn't have to work on some sort of stoner comedy or romantic comedy. This is Kevin Smith's second horror movie and it is much closer to a horror comedy in a sense but it turned out great. I am not sure any other director could successfully make this movie. The screenplay also by Kevin Smith is fresh and original which is something I haven't come across in a long time. The casting and acting are really good especially by Justin Long as the Pod caster and Michael Parks as the mysterious person to be interviewed: All in all I would u-give this five out of a possible five stars.,Tusk
74,DuskShadow,Dark comedy and b horror are cruelly skewed....but deviously well.,7,2 January 2015,"Without giving too much away (in fact I shall try to be as vague as possible) I enjoyed enjoyed this movie. However not all things seen are meant to be enjoyed, merely taken in as a new experience.This latest Kevin Smith film is sooo far removed from what he has done in the past as actor, writer or directer that is almost creates its own genre. A genre not unheard of in some circles, twisting the imagination toward such dire straits that the film almost mocks the premise it tries to present. YES...it is a contradiction: a somewhat dark comedy that is horrifying and disgusting to most people and funny only to those that have seen more than most people ever have...or will. One must almost certainly be jaded to a point in order to laugh or chortle under ones breath or smile even the slightest at the scenes of dark hilarity that make themselves so easily identifiable. Like watching someone trip and fall and go ""OW!"", sometimes we cant help but le hah hahahahaaa. The cruelty of both men AND women often afford us no safety from how we truly feel or what we say and too late cannot take back. Yet it works. Yet it works to offer one of the few plot devices within this film to envelop us into its web, its woven yarn or ichor and filth. Cruelty.Call me jaded, but I say I have seen much, call me callous, I say I have a tougher , more open minded imagination than others; not libertine in my acceptance of the grotesque and mad, but merely ready to accept my choice of viewing the gift of a film created with time and effort by noted film shapers...film...Smiths..( =p) for truly Kevin Smith holds true to his familial name. He is embarking upon new territory for himself, forging ahead of many other cowardly 'artists' in this growingly unbold world and its growingly unbold medium. P.ost S.cript Most likely I would have given this an 8/10 if it had more realistic looking gore, flesh etc, didn't have J Depp in the film, and one or two other things. Still a 7 (6.9/10) is not bad.

75,gavinp9,"Odd, grotesque, unnecessary weirdness",3,2 January 2018,"What. The. Hell? That pretty much sums up 'Tusk'. It's basically a ""trapped with someone evil"" horror movie, with some Kevin Smith humour thrown in here and there. Sure, there's some laughs, but they're mostly incredulous. Now, I'm a pretty big fan of Smith's and I used to listen to SModCast (but haven't heard the one this was based on) and I've seen all his films and stand-up DVDs. But even still, this has to be the worst thing he's done. I admire him for taking a risk and doing something unexpected, but 'Red State' was at least new, exciting and inventive. 'Tusk', not so much.Before this turns into a total bagging, let me point out some of the pros - the score is great, the use of Fleetwood Mac's 'Tusk' (""don't say that you love me!"") is pretty great and fitting in its scene and some of the language and nuances that Parks uses are fantastic. Depp is also pretty funny as the unrecognisable (thanks to a fake nose and, I think, contacts) detective.But it's just hard to ignore the total and complete nonsensicalness. Why is it set in Winnipeg, Canada, but filmed in North Carolina, USA? Why would Parks leave the phone lying around for Long to find? How is Parks supposed to be 90+ when he's only 74? Why do we need to see Joel Osment & Rodriguez pretty much talking to the camera when Long's not there, adding nothing to the story? Why does Parks do what he does? There's no real motivation there. Why does none of the plot make sense? Why do we need over half of the movie being exposition before anything happens? All I'll say is, see it if you're curious, but be prepared to be grossed out and simultaneously underwhelmed.",Tusk

77,trublu215,"While a clever idea does exist, Smith is nowhere near his target",3,1 February 2015,"Tusk tells the story of Wallace, a hapless podcaster as he treks across Canada in hopes to get an interview with an internet sensation But when things don't go according to plan, he meets an old man who promise Wallace a good interview but instead kidnaps him for a dark and sinister plan. Directed by Kevin Smith, Tusk marks his return to the horror realm since Red State. And as Red State proved (at least for me), Kevin Smith can't direct horror. Tusk is a film that is bogged down by bloated scenes of quirky dialog that couldn't be more unfitting for the tone. One minute Justin Long is delivering a typical crude Kevin Smith line and the next he is being tortured physically and emotionally, it is an absolute mess. Smith's urge to become the next great writer is so evident here that it comes off as more pretentious than anything else. The dialog is the biggest issue with this film. It is long scenes of spacey dialog that tries to be clever without ever really telling us why. Michael Parks is an amazing actor and honestly, he was as good as he was going to be here but his character was by far, the most annoying. Justin Long comes in as a close second, half the film he spends his time screaming and wallowing in pain without every uttering an intelligible word. Haley Joel Osment was, surprisingly, one of the better actors in this film as he plays Teddy, Wallace's co-host on the podcast. The real stand out here is Johnny Depp as Quebec detective Guy Lappointe, the opening scene for his character is extremely Tarantino-esque. Everything down the to dialog reeks of Tarantino inspiration for Smith, which isn't a bad thing because it actually was very good. The storyline with Wallace's girlfriend and Teddy trying to locate him is among the better portion of the film but it doesn't nearly last long enough to sustain anymore interest in anything outside of when the hell the movie ends. The bad part about it all is that the storyline and Depp's performance come in so late in the film, its hard to care about it. The screenplay is the downfall here, Smith spends too much time on the little picture instead of the big, worries about bloating a conversation instead of shrinking it. It isn't character development, it isn't even banter, its completely useless scenes surrounded by genius that is struggling to get out. Nothing is more sad than watch a great concept go to waste and that is exactly what Tusk is.",Tusk
78,TheRedDeath30,Bad on Many Levels,5,31 January 2015,"There is certainly no shortage of hatred for this movie on the boards and reviews here, but my curiosity and a long-time admiration for most of Kevin Smith's work made me watch it nonetheless, sure that most of this vitriol was unwarranted. Alas, I walked away from this movie thinking what a fool I was not to listen to the bad reviews in the first place.Let's get one thing out of the way. There is pretty much one positive to this movie and that is the performance of Michael Parks. He truly does deserve the solid praise he's received for his mad scientist role. Even when the movie tips the scales into outright ludicrous towards the end, Parks plays the role with enough seriousness that he's still convincing as a villain. The rest of this movie left me wondering what the hell Smith was thinking as he made this. I mean, he's always been a lot quirky, sure. Movies like CLERKS and MALLRATS thrived on that offbeat humor. Maybe I was just the right age to think it was funny, but even years later I still appreciate those movies. Smith had made a few bombs in recent years, but I did think that RED STATE was a pretty decent movie and showed that Smith might actually be able to make a good horror film, but...NO he cannot.Justin Long plays a fairly unlikable character in this movie. On top of that, I found that his acting in the ""dramatic moments"" just never really carried the weight that it should have, or maybe they weren't really trying. It's hard to tell.The plot is obviously supposed to be outrageous and doesn't disappoint in that territory. The first half of the movie begins looking like it might turn into something promising. It's a parody of movies like THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE and does a somewhat effective job of setting up that tone, mostly due to the aforementioned Parks. By the midpoint, though, the story just starts unraveling. The relationship between Parks' character and his lost protector, Mr. Tusk just becomes ridiculous. The makeup job on the walrus-man itself is laughably stupid. I know it's supposed to be that way, but I was expecting at least a good makeup that would have the laugh factor of ""Look, it's a half man/ half walrus"". Instead, it's just awful.The worst part of the movie is when Johnny Depp shows up. Many have bashed the performance and for good reason. He essentially plays another variation on the same ""quirky"" character he's been playing for the past ten years now. While it may have been fun the first few times, it's now become a parody. He's playing a character that's supposed to be over-the-top, but it's revealing in how close it is to every other character he's played in the past few years since he forgot how to be a realistic actor.I guess I was hoping for ""so ridiculous, it's good"" territory here and instead I got ""so ridiculous, it's ridiculous"".",Tusk

I would rather watch all three Human Centipede films one right after another, because at least they succeed in what they want to do for the most part.

Did you want to be funny, with your annoying protagonist and awkward conversation scenes that drag on forever? Cause it wasn't funny, either.Did you perhaps just want me to revel in your protagonist getting what he arguably deserved? Well maybe you achieved that a little bit, but did I enjoy it even slightly? God no.I wanted to stop and do absolutely anything else the entire time. That's what you achieved, Kevin. Your directing is terrible, you've got no imagination for interesting shots, your characters suck (yes I know they're intentionally terrible people, but that's all they are, and simply being terrible people is not enough to make them interesting), and your story is one that I couldn't wait to be over.And I'm not familiar with your other work, but at least when writing a feature film, you're not funny or scary in the least. I'm sorry, but sometimes it's just got to be said.You've made a film that I legitimately wish had worse acting so that I could justify giving it a half star, so count yourself lucky that the people you hired for this are more talented than you.And you couldn't even get the rights for I Am The Walrus to play over the end credits.

Some worse than others..but sometimes, you can't help but feel bad for the ones who plead for their lives or freedom, and whom are denied that right. It's freakishly demented, one that is difficult to stomach. I don't think I've ever seen a film in which the original ""bad guy"" is the one punished by a second, and it's a lose-lose situation. One in which the end of the movie will almost have you fighting back tears.

83,chappywatched,Chappy Watched: Tusk,6,7 May 2016,"Wow this is some screwed up sh*t!This is no stoner comedy like Kevin Smith's previous directorial works; this is a dark comedy – with a focus on the dark part!For those of you who don't know, the story is based on an ad that was placed on Gumtree where a free room was offered to anyone who would dress up as a walrus for two hours each day, communicate as a walrus; not as a human and eat the fish and crabs that are supplied to you.It has a small but good cast with the most focus being on Justin Long and Michael Parks. Wallace Bryton (Long) is an arrogant douchebag but in the end you still feel sorry for him and his very unfortunate situation.I was kind of surprised that he did actually get turned into a walrus. I was waiting for him to be rescued or even fixed before the full transformation.The costume design is really good; you can tell it's a walrus but one that has been pieced together.There are lots of cameos (Johnny Depp and Ralph Garman), appearance's by Kevin Smith and Johnny Depp's daughters and tidbits to Smith's previous works and podcasts.I found Johnny Depp and his character of Guy Lapointe really over the top (as a movie about a guy who gets turned into a walrus can be) and kind of actually ruined the flow for me.An enjoyable movie that can be watched more than once (not in close proximity to one another) and I will probably even buy when it comes out in Australia.",Tusk

85,FilmMuscle,What If Kevin Smith Made The Human Centipede?,8,21 September 2014,"Tusk ultimately works as both a hauntingly grotesque horror film and a thoughtful exploration of contemporary society—things that this generation have brought to existence from the likes of addictive technology to silly podcasts. The film centers on an abhorrently obnoxious and presumptuous twenty-something, named Wallace (Justin Long), who pretty much epitomizes the narcissistic and insensitive youth of our culture. But not only that—it's also about what really separates man from animal; humanity from plain rock and coldness. Wallace hosts a comedy podcast with a friend (Haley Joel Osment!), and their interactions/behavior very much resemble Kevin Smith's ""broship"" with Scott Mosier on their actual podcast (goofily titled ""SModcast""), incessantly guffawing and joking around. One day, Long gets the opportunity to interview a one-legged teenager who infamously chopped his own leg off with a samurai sword on accident in what became an incredibly viral Youtube video (totally fictional, by the way). Fundamentally, we have a couple of fame-hungry young adults seizing an opportunity to further popularize their show off of a deathly maimed kid. What's new? Sooner rather than later, our main character meets the pure definition of Karma's wrath when planned business goes awry; he, instead, ends up visiting an eerie, sequestered mansion two hours away from Winnipeg where his worst nightmares become completely realized. I know this has been said more than a thousand times already, but Tusk is somewhat of a hilarious Human Centipede. It's that rare taste of a shockingly twisted and dark comedy—a daring and uncompromising terror story that's astonishingly uproarious at the same time. You'll lay witness to some of the most disturbing sights you've seen in a long time while guiltily attempting to repress your laughter. This is the exemplar of ""twisted"" at its finest—characters wailing, weeping, begging for dear life, and suffering through the most agonizing of torture while audiences are in hysterics. What also substantially elevates the hilarity of it all is a really surprising cameo that's easily the funniest part of the entire film. The very nature of this movie is also an amusing tease throughout in the manner that it's edited and in regards to its camera angle choices, keeping you in apprehensive wonderment as it refrains from revealing any startling details too quickly. Frequently, you will see a look of shock or any other given reaction long before you see what truly stands before the characters.Now, after I left the theater with satisfaction, I gave SModcast a listen, quickly browsing through the catalog to find the specific episode where this tale was brilliantly envisioned between two jesting buddies in ceaseless cachinnation (Episode #259"" The Walrus and The Carpenter). Following the finish of this episode, one can clearly tell that while almost everyone's ready to vomit at the horrific sight on- screen, Kevin Smith is having a field day and breathlessly laughing. On the other hand, the film can certainly feel, at times, like it's being stretched out, especially concerning the last act. Normally, Kevin Smith's screenplays utterly shine brightest, capturing the compelling essence of conversation like the greatest of screenwriters (think: Quentin Tarantino, Woody Allen, and Richard Linklater), but that sheer ability unfortunately wasn't convincingly showcased in this entry. In fact, many of the conversations/dialogue go on for far too long, and I presume Smith's script just wasn't exceptional enough to engross us through fifteen minutes of anecdotes and aphorisms. Eventually, you just desire for the narrative to finally move along from the transparently prolonged discussion at hand and continue the ghastly tale that we all came to see in the first place. At the end of the day, you surely won't see anything quite like Tusk, which makes it worth the price of admission alone. Strong performances from Justin Long and Michael Parks (portraying the creepy owner of the mansion), a gradually terrifying plot, and the outlandish humor will ensure that moviegoers won't soon forget how (positively) f*cked-up this picture really is.",Tusk
86,MattBirk,Canadians vs Americans,4,20 September 2014,"While I went into the movie totally open to the idea of someone being  kidnapped and turned into a walrus(horror is by far my favorite genre),  the execution was thoroughly lacking. The biggest issue being its  pacing, some very long and monotonous scenes of dialogue that kill the  pace. On the other hand, the movie is effectively silly and ludicrous  in the best possible way.....if you are able to buy into it. But it is  hard to look past how much time 'Tusk' spends on outside characters  searching for the 'hero' and not enough time inside the mad house where  all the excitement lays. The movie is surprisingly far less gory than I  expected it to be, so you if are worried about that, don't be; and if  you are looking for a more, less intense horror movie(as in silly or  comedic tones), this is sure to please you. In the end I wanted to like  this more than I actually did, too many slow moving scenes compared to  true mayhem the story deserved. Perhaps the New York Post said it best  - ""There's a fine horror film inside Tusk, but it's only 20 minutes  long. The rest is just blubber'.",Tusk
87,sinnerofcinema,"Inventive ""Tusk"" takes you on a journey, finding a new story in terror.",8,19 September 2014,"If you can stomach some of what Kevin Smith's ""Tusk"" has to offer, you will find this film to be a fascinating joyride into the macabre.Justin Long stars as podcaster Wallace Bryton who travels from Los Angeles to Manitoba, Canada in search of a story to boost the ratings for his show. Upon discovering the story that originally brought him to Canada is no longer there, he sets out to find a new one. This time his latest story is found in Howard Howe (Michael Parks), an older eccentric gentleman living in an isolated mansion. With many sips of tea and vintage stories being told by old man Howard, Wallace finds himself attracted by the visual details of storytelling by which Howard candidly shares with his latest victim. What happens next leads to several unexpected surprise changes for Wallace. He is heavily sedated and cured from an apparent poisonous spider bite. Such generosity found in private health care can only be found in these sort of films where disgruntled sociopaths practice their craft on unwilling patients. However, as ""Tusk"" may have it, we soon find out that Howard has very different plans for his now captive guest. Not much should be revealed here in order to really spare the viewer from any unintentional leaks, however, I will say the film takes you on a ride with a strong message about humanity and mankind as a whole and more importantly how you reap what you sow. Wallace went to Canada looking to expose and exploit a story for his show's ratings, but soon he becomes the main attraction in a story that would skyrocket the ratings of his own podcast off the charts had he known he would have much of himself to thank for becoming the kind of story he sought in the first place, a road kill attraction for his next internet circus show. Director Kevin Smith tugs at many raw emotions simultaneously as the events degenerate into a Frankenstein like metamorphosis of Wallace revealing the true dark side of human nature and how if left unchecked can result in pure unfiltered madness. The introduction of a special appearance by quasi detective Guy Lapointe played by an over the top Johnny Depp leaves much to be desired. First, his monologue fails momentarily by extracting your suspension of disbelief from the successful track the story was headed. What may seem like a very long moment of Johnny Depp, being well... Johnny Depp, was in my opinion unnecessary, redundant and just plain tedious to watch. That's without saying that it slows down the film to a screeching halt for a good moment. But once this ""detective"" is reintegrated and relegated back to the main story, then the pace accelerates to a very unusual ending worthy of much debate afterwards. If you enjoyed the premise and originality of ""Tusk"", you may want to remain seated during the end credits just to make sure you don't miss the commentary by the director himself and other images that may help give you some insight and maybe closure as to the ideas that went behind the making of this film. The director himself comments on what he was looking to achieve by the third act. With that said, Tusk will certainly take you somewhere where you have yet to go this year, this is the film to help you escape to another dimension where the depths of human depravity combined with some very solid performances with lead to a jarring experience that you are not soon to forget.",Tusk

89,CowherPowerForever,The Not-See Party,8,22 September 2014,"Having watched the trailer, and hearing some good early reviews I thought I would finally check out Kevin Smith's new movie. First off I want to say I'm normally not a big Kevin Smith fan outside of a couple comedies he worked on. This film however is surprisingly on the edge of being great. With Tusk you are asking yourself what is going on early in the film, and it only gets stranger from there. The following is my review of Tusk.The film was written and directed by Kevin Smith. Smith is widely known for his popular films such as The Clerks, Mallrats, and Dogma. The Clerks and Mallrats are really my only favorites from Smith. Which is why I was worried about going into this film. Smith recently did another original film called Red State. I found that film to be awful, and going into this film I was worried this film would suffer the same fate. Thankfully it did not. The story is fairly strange once you dig deeper into it. However, I not be spoiling the movie in this review. The film follows podcaster Wallace Bryton(played by Justin Long) who heads up north to Canada so he can interview someone. Bryton is basically an internet shock jock host and he wants to interview people with some wild stories. As the story continues he finds a posting from a crippled man, Howard Howe(played by Michael Parks), who is interested in someone helping him out around the house in return will tell them interesting stories and give them a place to sleep free of charge. Things go south very quickly and things take a very strange turn from there. Just when you think this film is very strange, it gets even more stranger. For most of this movie it contains character buildup or development from the characters just sitting around talking to each other. This works the best in two instances. One where Bryton and Howe are talking for a good bit about some interesting stories Howe had about his past, and the other with Teddy Craft(Haley Joel Osment), Ally Leon(Genesis Rodriguez), and Guy Lapointe(Guy Lapointe, wink wink). These two scenes where there is a good bit of dialogue are actually very fun to sit back and watch. Some could easily find these scenes boring but, if you love some good acting, these scenes are for you. Overall, Smith delivers some fresh yet very strange storytelling here. He gets a big thumbs up from me.As I mentioned above, Kevin Smith also directed this film. The film plays out like a good slow paced horror film without any major action scenes. There are some disturbing scenes in this film but, that is about it. The film is shot amazingly and the attention to detail is very nice. As I mention above, there is a good bit of character driven scenes with a great deal of talking. Most of these scenes play out well as I talked about, however the scenes with Ally and Bryton are very boring in my opinion. Genesis Rodriguez delivers a very wooden performance is this film, while every other actor is fabulous. The actor who steal the show for me is Michael Parks. His banter back and forth with Justin Long is excellent and really a joy to watch, even if it does carry on for a good while. Guy Lapointe is also an interesting character, and when you see the movie you will see why. The actor playing him comes as a shock as you can't really tell who it is right away. Overall, Smith does a mostly good job handling the directing and the actors in this film.Christopher Drake is the composer of this film, and is one of my favorite composers as he does most of his work in the animated comic book movie genre. His works in Batman: Under the Red Hood and Batman: The Dark Knight Returns(Parts 1 & 2) are amazing work. This genre of film is different from his usual work, with this being a horror film. He really adapts well I must admit. The score can't be described as groundbreaking or one of my favorite but, he brings a nice chilling aspect to the film. Drake overall gives a great performance for this film as the composer.In closing, fans of Kevin Smith and those who aren't should enjoy this film. This is a horror film for the most part, so remember that. If you aren't a horror movie fan, then watching this film would likely only make you upset. Those of us who love horror films will find this original and very strange. That is missing lately in this genre. So give this a watch sometime soon if you can catch it in it's current limited run in theaters.7.5/10",Tusk
90,joker-4,The awful TOOTH about TUSK,6,6 April 2015,"Amusing and certainly original, TUSK makes a nice mockery of the horror-torture clique without becoming an all-out parody. Unfortunately, when the film obligingly reaches into the realm of the complete ridiculous, the cleverness of it all falls apart. What TUSK does to correctly, and does well, is rely on the one strength of writer/director Kevin Smith: fantastic situational dialogue.Smith is, when he wants to rise from his all-too easy reliance of mediocre potty humor, a good story-teller. He knows how to sculpt and pace dialogue, to craft an engaging tale, and how to mix in well-timed humor. Examples of such are immediately evident in three scenes: Wallace (Justin Long) in the Canadian convenience store, Howard Howe's (Michael Parks) introduction, and Guy Lapoint's flashback tale. The story itself is both comical and disturbing in a self-deprecating way, but a messy third act is ambiguous in deciding which swim lane to take – deadpan horrific or goofy schlock. The straddle ultimately presented leaves the film unfulfilled.Smith being Smith, is an equally-opportunity offender making fun of Canadians, podcasters, mustaches, and Latino accents. Regrettably, a majority of the film's blatant third-act humor comes as the result of the ridiculousness of the ""guest-star,"" setting the final focus of the film as murky as aquarium pool water drastically deviating away from any self-righteous statements on horror-torture films but also of any clever wittiness.",Tusk
91,jonnytheshirt,Kooky Kevin Smith with flashes of brilliance,8,3 December 2014,"I quite enjoyed this rather ridiculous movie for the sheer audacity of its story along with its flashes of brilliance. It is a stew pot of ingredients with some exceptional acting performances mixed in with ridiculousness. Some of the dialogue is sublime almost, especially Howard How's monologues and there is a juxtaposition to the crassness of Wallace's podcasting sell out character. There is a lot of thought in this script and possibly a lot to talk about however I must say that the third act where Johnny Depp generally steals the screen when I'm not distracted by the almost joke rubbery suit kind of takes off in a different kooky direction. Justin Long and Michael Parks really were fantastic together, and whilst I awaited the resolution of the third act I think the movie should have ended in the high gear it was for the first two acts. However the story is there and still stands regarding Wallace's extreme journey from himself to his objective humour and eventually becoming an extremity of what he laughed at. This is a rather unusual movie and certainly a cult one at that for its deeper than you may think. If you are after popcorn stay away, however if you're after some non-standard crazyness that actually has a point to make come on in.",Tusk
92,Eric_Cubed,No words in the human language to express how I feel,6,7 January 2015,"What happened to Kevin Smith? Clerks and Mall rats are two of my favorite movies of all time, and I laughed my ass off every time I re-watch them, with Chasing Amy his crowning achievement. And along with his pod-casts, stand-ups and comic books, Smith has shown to us all he is an unusually gifted, and humble creative artist. And now for Tusk. I'll admit I laughed out loud on several occasions at this horror/comedy grind-fest, but I must admit,with my pot smoking days are behind me, I couldn't help but to imagine Smith and friends high as s--t as he conceptualized and wrote this one. In fact, it nearly made me return to the bong just to watch it again and see if it would get even funnier. As in Evil Dead 2 funnier. But alas, I knew that it wouldn't. Not even Johnny Depp could save this Human Centipede Want To Be.ADDENDUM: In the 3 or 4 days after watching this film, I could not help but to notice that the pathetic mewling and howling agony of of the Human Walrus intruding upon my mental continuum, and I could not help but to laugh out loud as during these intrusions. If you think about it, is that not a sign of a totally unique film. Not necessary a good film, but a unique one, one that leaves us thinking and questioning and wondering about the kind of mind that conceived of it. Because of this, I've upgraded it to 6 out of 10, for the ingenuity and innovation aloe, and I hope there is a TUSK 2 coming soon (: Thanks Kevin.",Tusk

Combining a fine mixture of comedy and horror, Tusk delivers on what it promises. Totally bizarre situations are complimented with a very creepy soundtrack and a well written script.

101,ianwagnerwatches,"Strange, Twisted, and Fascinating",7,9 November 2019,"This is a very strange film. It combines absurdism and realism within the world of the film, and does so almost cohesively. The pacing is kind of jarring, but it adds to the strange feeling this film gives you. It's interesting to see such incredible acting in service of such an odd script. I truly believe and understand the characters, for a moment, but then everything crumbles. It crumbles right before your eyes, and the movie takes on a completely new shape, becomes a wholly new animal. The only thing that remains throughout is the very bizarre and deeply twisted sense of humor baked into the world's very foundation. It's so, so strange. I love strange films. I'm not sure if I love this film, but I did find it extremely fascinating, and I'd argue that's more important.However, the jumbled pacing is a significant problem, and the film loses its steam in the final stretches, sort of rushing to an end that didn't feel terribly climactic due to the directing. At least that's the feeling I had, and it left me unsatisfied.But, again, this film was truly strange, and that is, to me, the greatest thing a film can be.

I normally like horror, but this had nothing from a good horror (suspense, thrills etc). It just had gross out factor and disturbing images.This film is for a REALLY niche market. The 5 stars are for the acting and the first half. The second half is best avoided.Oh, and the Canadian accents are HORRIBLE. I live in Canada. Nobody talks like that.

103,fathersonholygore,Tusk is one whale of a good time,8,7 December 2014,"I just love the premise of this movie. Kevin Smith is not particularly one of my favourites, though, I really love Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma, and Red State a lot. I think his move into a bit of horror while still holding onto the comedy roots he works so well with really is spectacular. Red State was a lot of fun, and I've re- watched it a bunch of times since the first; for me, it holds up time after time.The story of Tusk follows Wallace Bryton, a rising podcast star, who interviews weird and wild people everywhere; he travels to different locations, interviews different characters, and then retells his experiences for Teddy Craft who never travels. There emerges a side story involving Wallace's girlfriend Ally; the two share a bit of a rocky relationship, as we see both Wallace's infidelity, as well as Ally's eventual, secret at first, indiscretions, too. Wallace goes up to Canada to interview the Kill Bill Kid - a young man who chopped off his own leg with a sword accidentally - but once he arrives in Winnipeg, he discovers the kid has taken his own life, and the story is quite literally now dead. Unfairly angry, Wallace heads to a bar before moving on home. In the bathroom he discovers a wanted ad: an old man, once an adventurer at sea, has a room for rent, and stories to tell. Out in the woods of Manitoba, Wallace finds Howard Howe in a beautiful, sprawling estate type home. Howe seems just a little eccentric at first telling stories of being at sea, meeting Ernest Hemingway, however, soon enough it's really damn clear the old man doesn't just want company. He misses an old friend, and Howe is determined to bring him back by any means necessary.Once Wallace goes missing, Ally and Teddy wake up to a frantic message he left them both; he claims Howe has kidnapped him, and wants to turn him into a walrus. Worried, they seek out the police, who are of course sceptical. They then meet a man named Guy Lapointe. He has been hunting a serial killer across Canada, and it turns out this is most likely Howe. They join together hoping to track down and save Wallace.I think a lot of people have trouble with the way Tusk shifts gears between horror to drama to comedy, and back, and forth. I don't necessarily see the problem. If either of these genres were being inappropriately served up, then I would understand, but to my mind it's all carried out pretty well. The horror works. Some may say the ""transformation"" is silly. I understand. I mean, the comedy of Long's ""transformation"" is not lost on Smith - he knows it looks a bit funny. Aside from the initial laugh it might get, I think the ""transformation"" is pretty disturbing. Especially when you couple Long's appearance with the shrieking and moaning he does after being transformed.The bits of drama worked into the storyline served things well. I think once you get to the end and look back at the drama Smith infused into the screenplay, they really add to one another. The ending sort of makes you look at how both Ally and Teddy feel about Wallace, deep down, regardless of everything which came before. It's how Smith closes out the emotional angle he'd been playing at with the Wallace/Ally/Teddy story. I thought it was probably the best way for Tusk to end. In a way, it's sentimental, yet still a bit horrifying.The comedy really works. I'm Canadian, and I thought a lot of the Canada jokes were hilarious. I still think the 'aboot' thing is a bit overworked, but other than that it's really funny. Also, near the opening Long's character goes through the airport, and one of the Canadian guys working there is just so ridiculously funny it makes me tear up - plus, his beard is gnarly as all hell - played by the dude from Epic Meal Time.I loved the performances - Depp especially had me rolling in laughter - and the script itself is gold. I can't wait for this to get out on Blu ray. Hilarious and horrific little film on Smith's behalf.",Tusk
104,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,A crazy old dude tries to turn a not so crazy dude into a walrus!,4,8 August 2016,"IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, WHAT THE F#CK HAPPENED TO KEVIN SMITH? (Do I Mean That in a Good or Bad Way? Find Out Here)Tusk is written and directed by one of my favorite directors Kevin Smith (Clerks, Chasing Amy). Tusk is about a U.S. podcaster, played by Justin Long ( Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, Live Free or Die Hard) ventures into the Canadian wilderness to interview an old man, played by in my opinion, a very underrated actor Michael Parks (Red State, Django Unchained) who has an extraordinary past, and the American learns the man has a dark secret involving a walrus. Kevin Smith is a very talented director and writer. I love his films, Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma, you name it. I also respect what he has done for the filmmaking business, and his passion for storytelling. For instance, he sold his comic book collection, and stayed up for countless hours just to make an independent movie called Clerks. Clerks is a great movie, well-rounded characters, great dialogue, it's funny, it changed the way we look at independent cinema, and overall the film has a large value of entertainment. He comes off like a cool person, a fan of comic books, and someone you could easily have a conversation with. In my opinion, Kevin Smith has not directed a great film since Clerks 2, and has not directed a decent movie since Zach and Miri make a Porno and Red State. If anyone would love to give the film Tusk a good rating it is me, because I really like Kevin Smith. On the other hand, I believe Tusk is the worst film Smith has written and directed. I was so interested in this movie, because the plot seems so interesting. The positive outcomes of the film are the tension is there, builds up horror; Justin Long does a good job, Michael Parks is phenomenal in his performance, it's well shot, and damn it I wanted to see a man turn another man into a half man half walrus! In my opinion, this is the Michael Park's film. If you want to see a creepy old man, who will scare the hell out of you, see Michael Park perform. He was in another Kevin Smith film called Red State. I did enjoy that movie. Accordingly, this is a nice throwback to old school cinema, and grindhouse/exploitation films. However, the same problems I had with Red State finds its way into Tusk.For instance, our main character is not very likable. He comes off as sleazy, rude, and arrogant. There are scenes throughout the film where they try to mix horror and comedy, and for me this doesn't blend all that well. I love when horror and comedy can combine, and make a well- crafted film. But, it comes of a little confusing, and downright awkward at times. I can't tell if this film is trying to be so bad that it's funny, or is it just that bad of a film? The horror elements work beautifully; to me this should have just been a straight up horror flick. In addition, there is a cameo in this film, and I actually didn't recognize him at all! Therefore, I give props to whoever did the design/makeup. Once I found out who it was, I was actually surprised, and I found it to be funny. What I didn't find funny was how long the scene goes on for. It drags, and drags, to the point where it is not funny anymore. They had a good joke, and just like that, it died. So my biggest issue with the film is the writing. Why do walruses go to Tupperware parties? To find a tight seal.Okay, that joked sucked. Let's get to what everyone cares about, the damn walrus. All I have to say is when you see it is disturbing and you can't help but to look away, but find away to still look at what's on screen. (Does that make any sense?) Once you get a good look at the walrus human hybrid, that's when you know the film is once again trying to be an awkward blend of horror and comedy. So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the film Tusk. It is far from Kevin Smith's best movie. What works is the horror. What doesn't work for me is the writing, characters, and honestly how Kevin Smith went from amazing films to this. I believe the movie has more weak spots, than good spots. I really hope Kevin Smith can come back and make a spectacular film. Maybe, it will be his next upcoming film titled Moose Jaws. It's like Jaws but with a mooseI can hop can't I. Maybe I just didn't understand the movie. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea, even though I like tea. If you truly want to know the history of filmmaker, writer, and entertainer Kevin Smith, you should definitely check out his previous films before this one. I believe the film Tusk earns a4/10This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie.

Now he needs to promise that he will stop writing and directing total turds like this. There are a lot of problem with this film, that looks every bit as low budget as the actual budget. For the purposes of a film that asks the audience, can a man be made into an animal, the effects of this film are straight up Seasame Street! Actually, I'll take that bad. Big Bird and friends look much better than the transformation played out here. To even have a shot of convincing me that the plat was real, you would need an effects budget of 5 time the total budget for this film.The acting of Kevin's daughter and Johnny Depp's daughter was laughable, and further showed that this looks like a high school production rather than a major motion picture.I seam to recall Smith paying $1 to own this film after Sundance and I can tell you, he paid too much.Smith 1st got off track with Zack and Miri and has been attempting to emulate directors every since.

107,chrislawuk,Modern classic horror comedy,8,4 January 2017,"Its a really good horror comedy, judging by the reviews it just hasn't found its audience yet. A lot of Kevin Smith fans are clearly disillusioned with his more recent turn towards horror comedy. There are very few decent horror comedies being made these days with decent acting, tight stories and scripts; this is one of them. Personally I found it refreshing and original. Not for the squeamish though as it is ridiculously morbid. Michael Parks does a great job acting his part as Howard Howe, as does the other lead actor Justin Long. The script is what really carries the whole thing. In a comedy sfx etc always comes secondary to acting and script, so it doesn't really matter if the effects aren't really great, in fact it puts the audience at ease, allowing them to not take the film so seriously and gross out.",Tusk

I will not give a synopsis (that having been done in the other reviews) but have to give special mention to Michael Parks for his nuanced and demented performance as Howard Howe. Depp's performance as detective Guy Lapointe was hilarious and his introduction stood out as a high comedy moment.

I didn't even recognize or suspect the character he plays was him ... not at all ... it is a complete chameleon role (not to be confused with the little creature he played in the animated kid's film a few years back) ... he was so complete and perfect that it wasn't until i watched the q&a and Smith started mentioning Depp and I went back to IMDb to look at the cast ...my god ... even if you are adverse to scary/disturbing movies but are a Depp fan, you MUST struggle thru this one to see his performance ... one of his very best ever ... and that's saying something when one considers he is certainly one of the top 10 (or 5) actors of our time and has done some amazing work ... this is a show-stopper role ... the character was fantastic before I even knew it was Depp and it just impressed me all the more once I knew okay, just some thoughts on the movie and such is all this review is but it is one of the best movies I've seen in a couple years ... and the heart-breaking ending is further accented by the yearning version of the old Scottish (I believe) folk song ""The Water is Wide (Oh Waly Waly)"" sung by Gerard Way best known as the front-man of the now-defunct My Chemical Romance ... a beautiful version of this song which prompted me to pick up my guitar and start learning it (my voice cannot match Way's but I get by lol) this is one of Smith's top 5 or even top 3 films in my book and as mentioned walks that fine line so well without slipping into something that the audience would laugh at rather than be disturbed by which is the intention",Tusk
114,reallyevilboy,Get Out of My Head!!,5,4 December 2014,"On a previous review I mentioned that I personally did not enjoy a movie but it was not a forgettable movie and so there is some accomplishment gained.Same thing applies here.I found myself upset with this movie, unable to look at the screen at times. Pacing in front of the screen, hoping the whole thing would soon be over.The imagery never, ever escapes you.And you want it to escape you, you want to forget this one.But it sits on the forefront of your mind and does not leave.I guess I have become squeamish over the years and certain things effect me more than they used to. If you're not so inclined maybe this is a movie for you.This one hurt me, hurt me bad but it can be said that there is some accomplishment, that it a memorable movie.As opposed to the hundreds of forgettable horror movies out there, I will be remembering this one.Hopefully the imagery's impact will dilute over time.",Tusk

This is absurdly hilarious and just plain silly. It's shocking, wild, amazing and the acting is stellar. As one of the previous reviews stated, the beginning is very typical of a true horror movie but it never lets that silliness feel go so you are ready to anticipate the craziness that comes.

118,sjensenstrad,Kevin Smith up his own.....,4,30 January 2015,"Basically this movie is Stephen Kings Missery and Silence of the lamb mixed together poorly rewritten by a teenagerI think this most be the result of a man/director/writer (Kevin Smith) getting so desperate, self centered and out of sync with reality that the best he can come up with is idiotic and with out heart. His ego will properly find reasons for this movie to be good and justified.This guy created Clerks, Mall rats and Dogma and haven't made quality since. It shows in this story how desperate he tries to be original, edgy and a provocateur.... but it fails. A weird idea do not make originality. Edgy without normality displays fear for being average. A provocateur with out integrity never gets his message through.Writing: 5, Acting: 8 (even Justin Long did a good job, but Johnny Depp was awe full), Message: 0 (Humans are stupid and evil) A few funny lines does not make a comedy A few cut off limbs does not make a horror movieBut drama Michael Parks can deliver even with a story of nonsense......Great job 10 stars to him he was the reason I saw the movie throughJay and Silent bob where funny as a teenager, time to grow up Kevin!

If you take an ill conceived idea, which is a bad enough foundation, then mix in a terrible script, cheap gore and terrible walrus outfits you could end up with something unique. Sadly what you end up with here is a disaster, absolute disaster. Was it funny? no, OK maybe i laughed at the schlock twice. Was it scary/disturbing? maybe once,OK twice i raised my eyebrows. Its just a mess that tries and fails at everything, humour, gore, believability. Johnny Depp has truly lost the plot, his latter day Poirot on pot character was neither warranted or enhancing to this turkey.I just found myself looking at Long in his walrus suit and asking myself..why, why are you doing this, why are you in that f@@kin' suit? was it the money? did Smith lure you in with his vision of the masterpiece that would unfold, did Long really think this would enhance his career?

I avoided ever watching movies like 'The Human Centipede', 'Hostile', etc. You catch my drift. I watched it because it was under 'the ""psychological thriller"" category on Netflix, and I love those. Totally wrong description, though. The reason I stuck through it, although it was hard to watch, was because of the impeccable acting. I found it odd that he actually gets treated like an animal in the end. He even lived at the zoo. The writer was reaching too much at that point when you thought he could reach no further. It ended ridiculously. I would've rated it higher if he would've died by either committing suicide or just letting the psycho finish him off. He was so disfigured that he could never go back. It ended on a ridiculous note, when it didn't necessarily have to end that way.",Tusk
121,anthonymora2,Major Movie Review: Tusk,7,8 February 2015,"I'm a huge KEVIN SMITH fan. I've always found ways to enjoy his movies, even the ones that have divided audiences and fans like RED STATE. TUSK might just be his most divisive movie yet, it's seriously unlike anything I've seen from the creator of CLERKS and MALL RATS or any filmmaker out there and MAN, it's quite the disturb fest!Wallace Bryton (JUSTIN LONG where have you been) is a pod caster, who, with his buddy Teddy (HALEY JOEL OSMENT), host a radio show called the Not-See Party. They look up videos on the internet of people humiliating themselves and laugh about it. Sounds like my kind of career. After watching a particular video featuring the Kill Bill Kid, Wallace decides to travel to Manitoba, Canada to meet this internet sensation. However, circumstances come up and Wallace is forced to find a new story to cover and finds it in a public bathroom post by a man named, Howard Howe. Mr. Howe writes that he has many grand stories to tell which is what our main protagonist is looking for, so Wallace finds this man in hopes of hearing a decent, replacement story for his show. Well Wallace goes missing shortly after meeting with Mr. Howe and it's up to ""best bro"" Teddy and Wallace's girlfriend (GENESIS RODRIGUEZ) to find him in the backwoods of Canada. That's the best I can do without spoiling anything!For my full review of TUSK, head over to my InstaBio and click on the link my Tumblr.

122,joris-nightwalker,Could've been better,6,22 December 2014,"""This could've been way better."" That was the first thing that went through my mind after seeing this. It's something I've experienced several times with Kevin Smith (except for his debut Clerks, which was just perfect). Tusk, the first part of a conceptual trilogy, is funny and inventive, but misses an original approach in writing. The unexpected take on body horror by Smith was something I loved very much, as well as Johnny Depp's quirky character Guy Lapointe. However, in general the movie was a bit too much hit and miss, especially in dialogue. Definitely one of those films that will generate its own following (like with everything Smith directs) and be called ""underrated"" several times. Not by myself though. Nevertheless I'm looking forward to the next two episodes: Yoga Hosers and Moose Jaws.",Tusk
123,Pulpthatsfiction,Could've Been A Great Horror Film,4,7 March 2015,"But sadly Kevin Smith had to be the one who made this film. I don't know why Smith tried so hard to inject comedy in a film that is clearly a horror film.The film stars Justin Long, Michael Parks, Genesis Rodriguez, Haley Joel Osment, and Johnny Depp. I will say I think the acting for the most part is really good, especially Michael Parks and Genesis Rodriguez. I've been a huge fan of Michael Parks even since I saw him in his double role in Kill Bill. Parks is having so much fun with this role and adds a truly terrifying atmosphere to the film. Genesis Rodriguez adds a wonderful level of emotion to the film. You feel her pain all throw out the film and gives a performance that really did move me. The last scene between her and Justin Long where she talks about her grandfather is heartbreaking. Everyone else does fine but those two are the ones that shine.The biggest problem with this film is the tone control. Kevin Smith has no control over the tone of this film and the constant back in fourth between horror and comedy is very confusing. I will admit that the parts of the film that is horror is actually scary and at times horrifying. But sadly all of that is ruined by the switch to comedy. The comedy in this film is so unfunny and at many times just mean spirited and just made me uncomfortable(and not the good kind of uncomfortable). During the credits we get a audio clip of the ""infamous"" podcast that lead to this film. Kevin smith is talking about the final scene and laughing all the way throw pitching the movie. He's laughter shows the total misinterpretation of his own script and shoes the mean spirited humor that is laced throughout this film.""Tusk"" could've been a great movie. With a great cast and an interesting plot but Kevin Smith just destroyed it by trying to inject his so called ""Humor"" in it. If he had just gone and made a straight horror film he could have had something special here. I see Kevin Smith's comedy something along the lines as George Lucas's use of special effects.It's not needed.1.5/4 Stars",Tusk
124,jmillerjr-00983,Do not watch this film,1,30 July 2018,There aren't many movies I would advise people to stay away from. This is absolutely one of them. You don't want this in your soul.,Tusk
125,BrentHankins,A ridiculously silly idea that actually works - for the most part.,7,23 September 2014,"Kevin Smith's Tusk is about as far removed from the director's early body of work as one could possibly get, yet still carries that personal touch that made Clerks resonate with so many audiences. While Smith's debut was influenced by his years working at a convenience store, it's no coincidence that Tusk's protagonist, Wallace Bryton (Justin Long), is a successful podcaster whose long- running weekly show features himself and his closest friend laughing themselves into a stupor.The film opens with one of these conversations, where Wallace and Teddy (Haley Joel Osment) are taking mean-spirited jabs at a YouTube celebrity, whose fame comes from the fact that he accidentally managed to slice his own leg off while wielding a samurai sword. Wallace has booked a flight to Canada to interview the young man, much to the chagrin of his live-in girlfriend Allie (Genesis Rodriguez), who disapproves of Wallace's cruel brand of comedy.An unfortunate turn of events finds Wallace north of the border without a guest for the next episode, until he stumbles across an advertisement on the bulletin board of a local tavern, where an elderly man offers to trade room and board in exchange for someone willing to listen to his tales of a life spent at sea. Two hours later, Wallace finds himself at Pippy Hill, a sprawling estate full of eccentricities and inhabited by the wheelchair-bound Howard Howe (Michael Parks), whose musings about meeting a young Ernest Hemingway fascinate Wallace. But Howe's story of being shipwrecked and rescued by a walrus is the most bizarre of all, and his strange devotion to the creature that saved his life masks a sinister plan.Peppered with Smith's signature vulgarity, Tusk spends the first 40 minutes or so establishing a genuinely creepy vibe, before taking an abrupt detour into a realm that few filmmakers would have been brave enough - or stoned enough - to explore. There are images in this film that can't be unseen, and Long deserves a tremendous amount of praise for stepping into a role that's so far out of his comfort zone it might as well exist in another universe.But Tusk is not without its problems. A bizarre cameo from an A-list star during the second half of the film is amusing at first, but quickly overstays its welcome and becomes far too indulgent. Likewise, the decision to reveal the darker side of Wallace's personality makes it difficult to sympathize with his predicament, which is further complicated upon discovering that his two friends aren't exactly saints, either.While Tusk doesn't quite measure up to the bar Smith set with Red State (my personal favorite), it's another positive step in his ongoing evolution as a filmmaker. Smith took a ridiculously silly idea for a film that most people never would have dared to attempt, and somehow made it work - for the most part, anyway. It's definitely Smith's least mainstream-friendly offering, but that's okay, because his passion and vision is alive in every frame, and it makes me excited to see what he does next.",Tusk

133,olovsimonsson,"Well, that was a surprise!",7,25 May 2018,"I had given up hope of ever seeing a Kevin Smith movie that didn't annoy me. Thus, I didn't see this until quite recently, on the suggestion of reliable movie nerds. And I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised.I have seen movies with a similar premise; a person is trapped with a lunatic (Creep, and Misery, for example), or persons in the same situation (The Human Centipede, and Split), but unlike those movies, this one does things right. It keeps the perfect balance between humor, drama, and horror. And unlike most movies in this genre, the focus is not on the gore and sadism (like the Human Centipede). Instead we have a villain that I could not help but feel for, in-between the utter insanity of Michael Parks' character. As for the actors, I have never been a fan of Justin Long (which was another reason why I didn't want to see this movie), but he did a very good job! And Michael Parks is absolutely brilliant. Without his performance the movie would not have been half as good. Haley Joel Osment and Genesis Rodriguez are giving very convincing performances. In fact, the only actor that I didn't like was Johnny Depp, who seemed to under the impression that this was one of Smith's adolescent comedies (and Smith clearly didn't correct him). In fact, had Johnny Depp not brought the movie down with his ridiculous overacting, I may have pushed the rating up a star. It was almost embarrassing to see him try to perform whatever he was doing, and whatever it was it was far from convincing, and honestly, I think the character does very little for the story. He only tells the audience what we had already figured out, or didn't need to know. So give it a chance. It certainly is not as bad as so many here have claimed.",Tusk

Acting is very believable, music is on point, cinematography is very well done. If you have a weak stomach, this isn't for you.

135,Matt-144-792009,"My Name is Brandon St. Randy, and I Love Tusks in my Mouth!",6,17 December 2014,"In Tusk, Justin Long and Haley Joel Osment play podcasters Wallace and Teddy. Wallace, (sounds like walrus) travels to Canada to interview an internet viral video star who slices his leg off with a samurai sword imitating the movie Kill Bill (2003). Upon arriving in Canada Wallace learns of the internet stars suicide given the online ridicule he received, partially to blame is Wallace and Teddy's podcast. Not wanting to make the trip a total loss Wallace tries to find another interview. He stumbles upon an ad in the men's room offering free lodging to anyone willing to come to the a mansion in the middle of nowhere and listen to an old man tell of his astonishing life story. Intrigued by the ad Wallace rushes out that night and meets Howard Howe (Michael Parks), a man with stories just as interesting as promised in the ad. Yet he has a dark ulterior motive to the rendezvous that ends up with Wallace a missing person. Once missing Teddy and Wallace's girlfriend Ally (Genesis Rodriguez) venture up to Canada to find him. With the help of detective Guy Lapointe, played by an unbilled A list actor for your surprise enjoyment. Director Kevin Smith created this adventure during one of his own Podcasts. It was voted upon via social media to green light or not the project. It is actually set to be a trilogy of B movie horror flicks set in the great white north of Canada. Kevin Smith has always been a Fan's Director. His series of Evening with Kevin Smith films and Podcast give fans an all access backstage look at his productions. Letting Fan Boys fell like Hollywood insiders. I don't necessarily belong to this cult of followers, but I've been to a few of their church services. I know enough to make Tusk more enjoyable than it might be to a total Kevin Smith outsider. I was happy to see Kevin's daughter Harley Quinn Smith as a convenient store clerk in Tusk. A kind of homage to what made her father famous, Clerks (1994). I haven't always been on board for all of Kevin's creations, Red State (2011) and Jersey Girl (2002) I was less than a fan. Much like how Kevin Smith feels about George Lucas and Star Wars, I feel the original trilogy is the best; Clerks (1994), Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997). His first three embodied all that was wonderful about independent film in the early 90's. Like punk rock in its infancy. The audio commentaries on those three are just as enjoyable as the films. The next two films, Dogma (1999) and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) felt like Cannon Ball Run films to me. Tusk and the promise of the next 2 Canada themed B horror movies have me excited. Tusk was just good campy fun, and in moments a little scary. The real treat in this film is the unbilled A list actor hidden in the middle. His costumed performance is reminiscent of the great Peter Sellers Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther (1963). I will not spoil who the A list actor is, my surprise in figuring it out was half my enjoyment of this film. I think this film works well on a campy horror film level. If you were a fan of Cabin in the Woods (2012) or the Evil Dead Franchise you should like it. I loved Justin Long's character Brandon St. Randy in Zack and Miri Make a Porno(2010) so much I was excited to see him working with Kevin Smith again. If you haven't seen it, it's a very quotable raunchy comedy. Michael Park's is a standout role in this movie. I have been a fan of him since his brief role as the Texas Ranger in From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). He is a great character actor, and his performance in Tusk is unsettlingly haunting. As for the soundtrack, I couldn't help but hear Fleetwood Mac's song Tusk in my head when thinking about the title to the movie, there is a scene where my waiting paid off. Thank you. Tusk knows what it is, a cheesy horror film. It doesn't venture out of the dairy isle and try to be any more than that.

I say not a bad job considering this whole movie was created from a podcast discussion. The movie is stale at times and some of the dialogue runs long, (no, not Justin Long), but it was funny. Johnny Depp's character was hilarious, Justin long's performance was notable, and Michael Park was amazing. I literally believed the man was bat shi* crazy! There was some gore and bloodshed, but this isn't a horror movie, and I think a lot of people went into it thinking it was and that explains some of the bad reviews.For a movie based on a totally absurd premise, Tusk was pretty good, unfortunately I don't see it having much re-watch value. I might watch it again just to laugh at some of the dialogue, but it certainly isn't Clerks or Chasing Amy. Tusk is basically The Human Centipede with some humor thrown in Kevin Smith style.

The Wife, Son(17,) and I, did the research, gassed up the car and drove a reasonable distance. We were very eager, and ready for whatever would be released upon us. First, the story is very different. Not very may walrus movies spring to mind. Or transforming someone into a lost loved one via the creepiest way possible movie. My wife did come up with ""Boxing Helena"" as a comparison. But, as good of a pull as that was, nothing is even close. So, credit for being so weird and different. All of the actors were good and the overall look of the movie was good as well. I didn't look or sound cheap/cheesy. After the movie the opinions broke down like this. Wife: Did not like it.

This is very similar in feel and style to the 70's film ""Ssssss""---which I always enjoyed and thought was underrated. Add in a little dose of Cronenberg's ""The Fly"", and a touch of ""Dead of Winter""(the one with Mary Steenbergen). The acting by Depp, Parks, Long,Osment and all the cast was spot-on. Depp's performance was truly original and inspired. Smith's direction took the story to an almost unbearable level of horror-tolerance, without going over the edge like the ""Saw"" films or the disgusting ""Human Centipede"" films---so, if that's what you're looking for, torture-porn horror, then stay away, you WON'T like it. But if you're looking for a good, creepy, funny, somewhat disturbing horror film, then this will put a smile on your face. Really reminded me of the 70's horror films, in content and style. Lots of talking in spots, but all relevant to the plot---tightly and expertly directed by Smith. I was not expecting this when reading all the horrible, hateful reviews, and makes me wonder if those reviewing even actually watched the film, or are just trolling to stir-up anger in people.

145,AnDread_The_Blind,"Tries to be funny and disturbing, fails at both",3,19 January 2016,"Kevin Smith seems to be a love-or-hate type of director. Most of his movies are pretty similar, even though he's tried to cross genres. I like to think I'm one of the few who is not that biased either way; I don't hate the guy's work the way some seem to, but I'm also not gushing over it with praise. Having said that, Tusk is one of the most painfully bad movies I've ever had to watch. It has a really strange premise (and don't read below if you don't want spoilers on this), and this alone might make you give it a chance. Some were taken with it; I, however, was not, even though I'm a huge fan of horror movies, including over-the-top ones. Some people appreciate the outrageous humor Smith injects into horror; I did not, even though it often takes the most extreme humor to get me laughing.Tusk tries to be both funny and disturbing, and fails at both. Each character is more ridiculous and unlikable than the last. The protagonist is a narcissistic exploiter whose suffering you neither come to care about nor rejoice in, because it comes along with such an over-the-top and unconvincing scenario. The villain, though at first somewhat creepy, quickly devolves into a caricature of a parody. The other characters are one-dimensional or silly, such as the hyper-emotional girlfriend and the goodie-two-shoes best friend, or the eccentric, ill-mannered detective played by Johnny Depp.I think we're supposed to laugh at the absurdity of the plot, and the American and Canadian stereotypes of each other that come up (there's a drawn=out border crossing scene between Wallace and a customs agent that attempts to play on these). But at the same time, the movie takes itself very seriously, which I found impossible to do after the initial build-up. I was irritated by the horror movie cliché of a waste of a human being protagonist turned victim, and thought his podcast humor was tasteless, stupid, and boring. It's the kind of thing that tries to be ""edgy"" or like Howard Stern, while just sounding like some juvenile attempts to push the envelope. Still, I saw the podcasters aspect as an embedded critique of online media and the exploitive cruelty of viral videos (though somewhat hypocritical given this movie was based on Smith's own podcast), and was willing to roll with it. I was also somewhat intrigued about how the movie would play out, knowing that (SPOILERS AHEAD) this was supposed to be a movie about a man getting turned into a walrus.Michael Parks does a decent job as Howard Howe, the deranged villain experimenting on poor Wallace (Justin Long), and some of his banter with Wallace in their first meeting is actually interesting. And as a literature lover, I appreciated the allusions to Hemingway and Coleridge. But as the horror kicked in, I found myself getting increasingly put off and unable to do more than check to see how many more minutes were left until the end. The actual transformation scenes were meant to be realistic but looked completely hokey. The whole thing is so inane that it doesn't even work in some absurd, quirky-but-still-disturbing way. Some people find this part unsettling, but I can't see why. Richard Roeper claims it was one of the few movies he ever had to close his eyes during. I wanted to close my eyes because it was so godawfully bad.Other than the walrus suit, visually, the film looks good; some of the shots do a good job of drawing your attention or setting tension. The visuals right before we see the results of Howe's butchery do a good job of ominous suggestion: we see surgical instruments and stains of blood as Parks rants about walruses and human cruelty. All the atmosphere shatters when we zoom full on to the Wallace-walrus.I'm not sure what Smith could have done to pull this off. It's such a ludicrous idea--I give him credit for trying to make it work, but there isn't much redeeming value to it. Perhaps not showing us the walrus suit so baldly; perhaps the suggestion of what was happening to Wallace would have been more disturbing than what we saw. (I thought the title and poster did a good job of creating a creepy image and mystery.) Or maybe it could have been much shorter. Smith is obviously a competent filmmaker. I just don't think he's either very scary or very funny.",Tusk
146,quitwhileyouareahead,wanted to love it,5,12 March 2015,"It started so well. I happen to love Justin Long so the first half of the movie was great as it was mostly him. A great scene at the airport with the line ""it is either a Canado or a Canadon't"" reminded me of Johnny Depp's line in Once Upon a Time in Mexico. You are either a Mexican or a Mexican't. It should of prepared me for his surprise appearance later in the movie. I continued to enjoy it as it turned dark and unpredictable. But when Justin literally lost his tongue, it started to fall apart. Without his humor the interaction between him and Parks became more like sick humor than dark humor. Depp's hilarious portrayal of a Canadian detective kept it watchable but couldn't save the disappointing second half.I really wanted to like this movie. Sure the Walrus looked fake. It is a dark comedy, it doesn't supposed to look real. You do have to accept the genre for what it is but in this case they just lost it at halftime.",Tusk
147,befoulmetalroosa,Truly unexpected.,10,9 April 2016,"What can I say? This movie was horrifying, horrible and heart-wrenching, all in one. Justin Long plays a podcast host to a web show that deals with unusual topics. It's hard to describe the podcasts; the film doesn't really go into much detail. His girlfriend, who he frequently cheats on, is completely clueless, and is also clueless to the fact that the podcast partner, played by Haley Joel Osment, is deeply in love with Justin's girlfriend. On his way to see a sea captain for the best story ever, Justin finds himself in dire straits, as the nutball decides to turn him into the walrus who saved the captain's life when he was shipwrecked. What the movie descends into is something along the lines of Human Centipede. Seeing Long as the walrus, with his big, soulful eyes communicating his pain, suffering and anguish just makes your heart bleed for him.In a surprising role, which I believe he's unbilled for, is Johnny Depp as the detective hired by Long's girlfriend and podcast partner to find the missing man. The hunt is amusing, and if I wasn't so familiar with some of Depp's mannerisms, I wouldn't have known it was him in the role. The movie, whether you like it or hate it, grabs you from the get-go, in a stranglehold that doesn't really let you go. It's rather unforgettable.",Tusk
148,lwood28,What Did I Just Watch???,8,20 September 2014,"*Plot: When a pod-caster goes missing while interviewing a man name Howard Howe, his best friend Teddy and girlfriend Allison try to find out what happen to him.*Review: Tusk is probably one of the most disturbing and strangest movie that I've ever seen. The plot of this movie just sounds stupid. It's about an old guy wants to turn this other guy into a walrus. And does it work. Yes it does. I think Kevin Smith proved to himself that he can direct a horror movie. The acting in this movie is really good and Michael Parks is just fantastic in this movie. There were a couple scenes in this movie that made me laugh too. Also there's a great cameo in this movie that was pretty funny too. The movie also feels original I can tell you that this movie is better than Human Centipede. However there is some problems in this movie. There were a couple of dialogue scenes that dragged on for too long. Also when you finally see what the walrus looks like it seemed a little to early for the film to show what it looks like. Also there's a point at the end of the film where it kind of got a little ridiculous and a little confusing. Those are mostly the problems about the film. I think Tusk can be related to the films Enemy and Under The Skin. Mostly because they feel like a Twilight Zone episode but longer. I heard that this film will be part of a trilogy. The final 2 movies are Yoga Hosers and Moose Jaws. I think in a couple years this film could reach of being a cult classic. Also this film is very memorable because when people say Tusk then another person will say ""Oh I remember that film"". Overall it's just a solid horror flick and I think it's a movie where you get a couple of your friends and just enjoy the film.""There, there. It'll be all right, Mr. Tusk"".- Howard Howe",Tusk
149,cammymadden,Pretty Much What You'd Expect,4,19 April 2016,"Many of the other reviews of this film sum up exactly how I now feel about it having just finished watching 'Tusk'. A film that on the surface sounds like a bizarre combination between a disturbing horror and a comedy, ultimately winds up being not much of either. While the film does have a few perhaps laughable moments, they do not make up for the all the other areas it falls behind. Similar to the Human Centipede (1, 2 or 3) this film is nothing more than bizarre torture porn that simply leaves you feeling regret...at the fact that you just wasted an hour and 45 minutes watching it.If you have absolutely nothing (and I mean literally nothing else to do at all: no wet paint to watch dry, no grass to watch grow, no water to watch boil) then I'd perhaps recommend giving it a watch simply because it is such a bizarre film.",Tusk
150,embracing_silence,Like nothing you've seen before (except Human Centipede),7,7 November 2019,"I originally had no interest in watching this, because I had no idea what it was about. I watched Yogahosers which was meh. Then I saw this movie on a top 10 list on YouTube, and they showed the Wallace walrus. That made me want to watch it.I did like Human Centipede (the first one) because it was more of a drama and reminded me of Saw. Tusk is very similar to the former, but has a bit more backstory to it, and it is a lot more gruesome than HC. The walrus suit is so very disturbing.It's nothing amazing, but it was a fun watch. Very dark comedy with disturbing body horror. It's not for everyone, that's for sure. I wish the story after he was turned into the walrus was fleshed out a bit more, it seemed like it just hurried to have his friend and girlfriend find him, then that was it.Don't go in expecting this to be a serious movie or a masterpiece, just enjoy it for what it is, especially if you have a dark sense of humor or like messed up movies.",Tusk
151,HagenSteele,Comically horrifying and disturbing take on a classic genre,7,4 January 2015,"This flick was surprisingly effective at creeping me the hell out, despite the somewhat tongue in cheek nature in which it was filmed.Michael Parks gives another awesome performance as the antagonist, and his performance lends credibility to the somewhat ridiculous premise. The dude is creepy. Period.Justin Long does an excellent job as well, as the protagonist / victim. In fact, the performances were solid across the board except for one character played by Johnny Depp. Johnny D sured does give off an inspector Closeau / Pink Panther klutz kind of vibe with his character./shrug Regardless, while I think the film might be a bit too gruesome for some, and to comical for others, for some, like me, it was a pretty good ride.Good effort Mr. Smith.Oscar for Michael Parks imo!",Tusk

I know everyone is looking for something new, fresh, different in their story lines but this wasn't it.This movie is really bad in every way. It was listed as a comedy/drama/horror. Definitely labelled incorrectly. Maybe a fantasy/horror, even though it did not instill fear. Not fair to release a movie and list it as something it is not as the viewers expect something totally different and they don't get it. If I want to view a comedy I expect it to be one.And I know this is a very small point and does not affect the outcome in any way but I am so tired of watching movies that when taking place in Canada they have all Canadians speaking as if they were in the movie Fargo. Small or large I would at least try to make everything as accurate as possible. If a movie has a lot of errors it gives one the impression it was just thrown together. It was very distracting listening to the ridiculous fake accent. Maybe this was the comedy portion.The worst ending possible. There were many ways this movie could have ended. Are we to believe this is how everyone's life continued? No attempt made to correct anything? Why not just stop the movie half way through.Justin Long sure has been in a lot of stinker movies as of late. He should be more careful when choosing work in the future or his career will soon be gone.",Tusk
153,AStormOfSwords13,Stale,3,15 May 2015,"Oh boy. I don't think ideas for horror movies get so over-the- top than Tusk, though a comedy horror is a risky genre that has paid of before, courtesy of Zombieland back in 2009. If you've seen the trailer, you can probably guess what the premise here is. If you haven't, don't worry. If you can stick around long enough to get to where the horror aspect begins, which is a chore to do all by itself, you should be able to figure it out by that point.Journey to another boring horror movie, that tries to be a comedy and fails miserably. Despite the Comedy genre I saw attached to it on the Redbox machine, what it has, way more than it does laughs, is exposition that makes The Last Airbender shït in its pants. The flashbacks seldom ever add anything to the plot and is more likely just there to make the movie longer so that it fills an hour and a half of wasted time instead of maybe 50-60 minutes of it. There are laughs, but they are few and very far between and the movie was stale as a result.Also, I couldn't care less about these characters, except maybe Teddy. Of course, the only reason I even followed Teddy is because Haley Joel Osment, the guy portraying Teddy, is Sora's Voice Actor for Kingdom Hearts, so really, I am really only rooting for Sora more than I am Teddy. As far as the other characters, they were too underdeveloped and, outside of being a victim, they just were not memorable.That said, the horror aspect of the film is served as there was a slight sense of dread and even the tiniest bit of sadness come the film's end. I am even willing to admit that the villain of the film was cringe-worthy enough to be somewhat worthwhile. But this can't really save the film here. The cons far outweigh the pros because it failed as a comedy. I see what it wanted to go for, but the execution could have been a lot better and it failed to give me enough to like it. Tusk had the potential there, but it was wasted and the end result was not satisfying.",Tusk

At that point, we were thinking along the lines of, ""So, when does this character get what he deserves?"" But it's the audience who gets the short end of the stick here, and no one deserves to see a movie this BAD. Tacky isn't funny, characters you hate, when it's literally all of them, and a ""plot"" that makes less sense than a surreal dreamscape from psychedelic mushrooms (I can only guess) do not make for entertainment. There had to be some sort of drugs involved to make such a strange and senseless storyline. Senseless plot, no logic at all, tackiness pretending to be humor, and shock value pretending to be scares; no, just no. Not good, not entertaining, not thought provoking, just stupid. Worse that stupid. Anyone who claims to have enjoyed this movie needs a shrink. Seriously. If I knew someone who said they did, I'd cut off all relations with that person. Fast.

156,bloodclay,Destined To Be A Midnight-Movie Classic,8,7 December 2014,"The experience that I had with Kevin Smith's new film ""Tusk"" is unlike any other. And when I say 'any other', I mean ANY other. It doesn't draw similarities with films of the same genre (or others for that matter), both in the style and the characters. The whole concept in and of itself is one of the most original ideas for a movie I've ever seen, and the execution of it is surprising and strange. And though it may not be the kind-of movie I would frequently recommend, mostly due to the odd looks I'd be given, it directly proves that sometimes weird is good.The film centers around a podcaster named Wallace (Justin Long) who, on a quest to find his next interesting interviewee in the backwoods of Canada, encounters a creepy and mysterious old seafarer that has an obsession with walruses. Yes, you read it correctly, walruses. And due to the fact that I don't want to spoil the film's many plot surprises, let's just say that Justin Long's character becomes the victim of that obsession. What ensues is a bizarre (yet seamless) mixture of comedy and horror that never fails to entertain.It's easily one of the most surreal movie experiences I've ever had, and it's destined to be a midnight-movie classic. You certainly need to know that what you're getting into shouldn't be taken seriously, and once you're in that mindset, you'll revel in its outrageousness. And for a movie so out- there and different, it's startling how great some of the performances are. Michael Parks (who plays the sinister antagonist) is outstanding, and Justin Long complements him perfectly. It's definitely a B-Movie in every sense of the word, but that's why I found it so enjoyable.",Tusk

I mean, there are fewer holes in North America's finest groundhog territory than in this odd plot. I suppose some credit can be given to everyone for attempting something so weirdly original and Smith definitely gets my respect for embracing every genre. Sadly Tusk is a little too disturbing to work as a comedy and way too implausible to succeed as a horror-drama. It does, however, work on all sides to be a true contender in the ""worst movie ending of all time"" championship!Maybe if I had taken the time to listen to Smith's podcast ""The Walrus and the Carpenter,"" which this movie is based on, my feelings would have differed.

160,olympicator,Review from a person who is not the biggest horror fan,4,12 January 2015,"Recently, I watched the movie ""Se7en"" for the first time; then, about eighteen hours later, I watched the movie ""Tusk."" ""Se7en"" is much bloodier and more violent, with a wider variety of gruesome images; yet I honestly thought ""Tusk"" was more disgusting somehow. So, if ""Se7en"" was too much for you, I'd like to warn you that ""Tusk"" won't go down any easier.The movie is about a guy named Wallace, who has his own radio show and takes a trip to Canada to interview someone for the show. The interview does not work out, and so Wallace decides to take a risk and seek out a recluse who claims to have had great sea adventures. The recluse, Howard Howe, drugs Wallace and ties him to a chair.I won't give away what follows, but I will tell you that this movie goes fully, completely over the top. It is about one human being's search for contrition, his belief that his very species is a terrible abomination; and that we must seek, not to transcend our condition, but to relinquish it and reduce ourselves to the level of animals. This is the philosophy of Howard Howe, and it is the only fully-expressed set of thoughts that make their way on screen. He is not particularly intelligent, but he has conviction. He is a mad creationist, a cross between Victor Frankenstein and Captain Ahab.I guess what really turned me off from this movie was that, in spite of how wacky it was, it just wasn't that funny. It starts with a Youtube video of a kid playing with a samurai sword and accidentally hacking his own leg off (seriously, how is that funny?). The radio show is called the ""Not-See Party,"" and Wallace somehow does not think this title will horrify people. It seemed almost as if Smith imagined that if something is offensive enough, it will automatically be funny. Maybe it was, to the targeted audience. But I think that horror should serve a purpose, to show an audience the torment of the inner soul in an apathetic world (or something like that). One of my favorite movies is ""Beetlejuice,"" which is effectively funny because the characters are self-aware enough to notice how absurd and ridiculous the story is, yet they must work within the rules of this alternate world in order to seek what they desire. In ""Tusk,"" the horror existed for its own sake, and I got the feeling that I was just supposed to laugh at the expense of the hapless victims.In spite of how over-the-top it was, the movie was underwhelming. It was crude, half-baked, linear, and used an overly conventional approach to a thoroughly unconventional idea. There was no climax, no point where the characters appeared to learn anything. There is a theme in the movie of animals being morally superior to human beings, but that theme was underdeveloped. If there had been more animals throughout the film, more interaction between man and the wild, this theme might have shone through more effectively. The script needed a few rewrites. I felt like Smith was kind of exploring the idea, without realizing it.I will admit that the acting was good. Michael Parks is terrifying as Howe. Justin Long is convincing as Wallace, though his character was bigoted, unlikeable, and without any redeeming values (I don't know if this was Smith's intention). Depp was at least amusing as the bumbling Detective Lapointe, a cross between Inspector Clouseau and Kid Shelleen, though at times he went on for too long with too little to say. I thought Lapointe had the potential to be intelligent, a benign force to counteract the insanity of Howe; however, it did not play out this way, and Smith missed an opportunity.I give this movie four stars out of ten, because at least it had the courage to go where no other movie has gone before. It was frank about its disturbed nature. But I felt no connection to any of the characters, except perhaps Howard Howe. Like Macbeth, Howe is imaginative without the release of being creative, and by the end of the movie I was too horrified by his actions to feel any sympathy for his intentions. I felt as if Smith made this movie just to see if he could pull it off. I guess that just doesn't seem like a good enough reason to make a movie.",Tusk

It was quite disturbing that we were left with a unremitting frown of disgust and a lump in our throat making it unbearable to swallow.Podcaster Wallace Bryton sets out on a Canadian journey from Hell to interview loner Howard Howe. After being mysteriously ""bitten"" by a brown recluse spider, native to Canada (said sarcastically), Wallace wakes up only to soon discover his leg had been amputated. Howard is a strange man and we quickly learn his love for walruses, yup walruses. Howard has plans, including patterns, to turn Wallace into a human walrus, tusks and all. Similar to everyone's favorite horror film, The Human Centipede.Wallace Bryton, the comical quirky podcaster, reluctantly becomes Wally the walrus, or in Howard's eyes the love and savior of his life, the one and only Mr. Tusk. We just can't even make this up. Luckily, Haley Joel Osment (yup, the Sixth Sense kid) is Wallace's podcast partner and he is all too familiar with this type of mystery and comes to the rescue with Ally, Wallace's girlfriend. We're surprised the dead walrus's at the bottom of the pool didn't speak to him, that seems like something that could have happened. Wallace's friends come to the rescue just as he's using his newly created tusks to stab crazy Howard. #Nightmaresfordays.

The role which Justin Long plays is a seemingly unredeemable douche, yet his world is written as though he's the complete opposite, it's odd because in the scenes with his girlfriend and she treats him like a good guy yet even with her he's an unbelievable douche. The problem with Kevin Smith and horror seems to be that within the script he makes his protagonists unredeemable. The problem with this movie, feels like the length they had to fill to have a full movie, I can still listen to the Smodcast episode and laugh.

I have to say this film stayed with me for a long time after watching it.. it gave me a real sense of dread and for some reason it disturbed me more than anything i have seen in recent years. I am giving it a solid 9 because it achieved what it set out to do! It is a shame about the low rating as i do think this is a real hidden gem and will eventually become a cult classic,Tusk
170,leonthesleepy,"An uneven, quirky horror comedy.",5,23 December 2014,"Well, if you don't already know the plot, a podcast Journalist, Wallace goes to Canada to interview a youtube sensation. When the interview is cancelled he chances upon an Ad about an old man with great stories, not wanting to go back empty handed, Wallace takes a chance and goes to his house.Then it goes off the rails, the old man seems intelligent and friendly at first, and then takes a sharp turn into a deranged madman. The movie then splits into the perspective of Wallaces' girlfriend looking for him.The problem with Tusk for me, is that its so tonally inconsistent that it almost's forgets the atmosphere it builds in the first half. The first half was funny, and intriguing as you wonder how in the world is he going to get transformed into a Walrus. After you see it tho, and it is horrific, the movie drags on its second half, barely surviving on steam as it becomes a comedy about a silly detective trying to find the killer.I will admit, i enjoyed the first half, Kevin Smith mixes horror and comedy quite well, and the performances, all around are Great! The ending tho is absurd and seems to be weird for the sake of being weird. Unlike something like Fargo, where the eccentricities give the movie charm, here it just derails the movie bit by bit.Its hard to recommend unless you want something really different that doesn't have a nice payoff.",Tusk

172,michaelmunkvold,A movie for people who like movies about human walruses,6,18 March 2015,"""Tusk"" is a carny freak show - it's bizarre, ridiculous and disturbing, and the laughs it does provide are of the guilty, deeply uncomfortable variety. It doesn't so much stay in your mind as infect it with images that you really don't want in your head. It's definitely a mixed bag of a movie, but for better or worse, it's writer/director Kevin Smith's most original work.Podcaster Wallace Bryton (Justin Long) travels to Canada in search of a story, and stumbles across Howard Howe (Michael Parks), a recluse who promises to tell Wallace about his lifetime of adventures. Howe then drugs Wallace, and turns him into a walrus. You heard me. He mutilates Wallace, sews him into a walrus costume, and conditions him to be a barking, fish-eating sea mammal. And then it gets REALLY weird...Smith is known for pushing boundaries and exploring new territory, but with this movie he just wanders out into the wilderness and throws away the map. His only real goal seems to be to make ""Tusk"" as freaky as possible. He succeeds, but in so doing forgets to put much thought into his characters or have much of a story - Howe turns Wallace into a walrus, and that's pretty much it. The end. Aside from the scenes between Howe and Wallace, there's not much going on here. The other characters - Wallace's girlfriend (Genesis Rodriguez) and best pal (Haley Joel Osment) and a burned-out Quebecois cop (Johnny Depp, uncredited and mumbling) - are boring. It's all about the geek show. If you like geek shows, you'll be pleased. If you don't, you'll just be really uncomfortable for two hours, and wonder why you spent the time.That said, ""Tusk"" still has a lot to recommend it. For me, horror movies rise and fall on two things: the movie's ability to make us share the protagonists' terror, and the villain's scariness. In these, ""Tusk"" is a success. Wallace's plight is uncomfortable to watch; he's really suffering, his eyes screaming with panic as he waddles helplessly in Howe's torture pit. He can't believe this is happening, and neither can we. Parks, meanwhile, is truly frightening as Howe, alternating between sinister charm and raving madness that would make Kathy Bates in ""Misery"" proud - often in the same scene. ""Tusk"" may well be the definition of ""not for everybody"", but it makes no apologies for its weirdness. Indeed, it's proud of being weird, and seeks the approval only of those who let their freak flags fly. There's a victory in that. For all of its imperfections, ""Tusk"" is an original, and how many movies have you seen lately that can claim that?",Tusk

I have a lot of respect for anyone who just grabs a camera goes out and gets it done, you have to. This movie showed me a lot of new levels of him. He has chops, skills, whatever you want to call it. The whole execution of this movie was pretty much flawless. The directing, editing, acting, all of it were worthy of any ""A"" listers. Michael Parks, like Depp, is a human chameleon and always blows me away with his performances. Tusk is no exception.

The comedy, as you can expect, is amazing. If you're Canadian, even more so (the subtle Canadian jokes were unreal). But at the same time, the movie is terrifying bordering on disturbing.

181,MediaboyMusings,One of the worst movies I've ever watched...,1,15 September 2014,"Kevin Smith, whose repeated threats in recent years of permanently exiting the world of filmmaking have taken on the dubious credibility of retirement announcements from, say, most classic rock bands, has apparently found his creative mojo once again with the batsh*t crazy Tusk. Smith's previous film, 2011's Red State, was justifiably poorly received by critics and audiences, souring him even further on the filmmaking process. Then in 2013, a bizarre discussion on an episode of Smith's SModcast podcast hastily inspired him to write and direct Tusk, a high-concept movie (in more ways than one, I'm sure) that can be summarized with one sentence: Los Angeles podcaster visits Manitoba and gets kidnapped by a lunatic who turns him into a walrus. Still with me? Smith, during the film's second TIFF screening I attended after its world premiere the night before, joked that he had reached the point in his career where ""I don't give a fu*k anymore"", but just because Smith has reached a bitter crossroads in his career that's resulted in quite literally one of the worst movie experiences I've ever sat through doesn't mean you should also be subjected to the man's lack of impulse control. Two main things drew me to Tusk: 1) I was a modest fan of most of Smith's work (which you probably can't tell from the contempt being leveled at him in this review, but that just speaks to the permanently scarring effects of this abomination) and 2) the film is mostly set in Manitoba and promised plenty of Canadian references and jokes. The humour, like almost everything else in Tusk, never works, however. I can count on one hand the number of times I laughed during the film and I was surprised, frankly, that Smith, a man with both a sharp wit and an extensive knowledge of this country (as he'll gladly point out any chance he gets about the latter), stooped to such lazy and predictable jokes about not loving hockey and the word ""aboot"". Johnny Depp shows up briefly to chew scenery as Guy Lapointe, a quirky Quebec detective constructed entirely of French-Canadian stereotypes that become tiresome very quickly. For further evidence of the film's humour deficiency, the name of the comedy podcast hosted by protagonist Wallace Bryton (played by Justin Long, who goes heavy on the douchebaggery) and his sidekick, Teddy (played by The Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osment), is ""The Not-See Party"", whose theme finds the hosts making fun of people they've read about or seen on the internet. That kind of half-assed and witless screen writing also extends to key plot points, like the one that conveniently allows Wallace to contact his friends after being kidnapped by the deranged Howard Howe (played by Michael Parks, who's decent performance is the only thing remotely redeemable about the movie). I could go on about how the supposed big payoff of seeing Wallace transformed into a walrus disappoints mightily with shoddy special effects (the sight of him is slightly disturbing, but not Human Centipede-level disturbing), or how the tease of some much-needed action at the movie's end is practically over before it begins, or how the dreadful final scene provided a fitting end to this turd of a filmbut I'm sure you've gotten my point. As I write this, I've gotten six days of distance from watching Tusk and having to revisit it for this review has genuinely made me feel, well, annoyed. That annoyance was felt during the screening, too, as a packed audience heavy on Smith fanboys and fangirls at the sizable Bloor Hot Docs Cinema inexplicably laughed and cheered throughout the movie. Normally I stick around for festival Q & A sessions, but as the credits rolled and Tusk was met with rapturous applause, I couldn't head for the exits quickly enough to get as far away as possible from Kevin Smith and anyone who thought his latest film was worthy of such adoration. And fair warning: Smith has two more films in the pipeline that'll complete what he's calling his ""True North Trilogy"". Yoga Hosers is currently shooting and centres around the pair of surly teenage girl convenience store clerks (played by Smith's and Depp's daughters) that get about five minutes of forgettable screen time in Tusk, to be followed by a Jaws-inspired movie about a killer moose. God help us all.",Tusk

183,Dar_Sargent,"Complete failure at comedy, horror, or anything inbetween",1,20 October 2019,"Tusk is a film with a very quirky premise that should be fun, or eerie, or at least entertaining. A melancholy old man abducts a podcaster and surgically alters him to resemble a walrus, which he thinks is the world's finest creature. Anyone with half a brain could make this bizarre idea either really funny or really creepy; it would take a lot of incompetence to fail. Yet Kevin Smith and his hangers-on are clearly such a black hole of talent that they managed to fail dismally.The comedy is nonexistent. The movie throws in bad Canadian accents, an old guy saying ""poop hole"" and ""hyuk, Canadians like hockey a lot."" If you think that's side-splitting, then this movie was clearly made for you. The humor in this movie makes Family Guy look like comedic genius.Since the comedy is dead in the water, you'd think the movie would try to do something worthwhile on the horror element, but we are not so lucky. We're treated to the gimmick of a guy in a lame costume, and then... well, that's it. It's just scene after scene of a guy sitting around in a lame walrus costume while nothing interesting happens. At that point, it's clear that the creators knew they could make a lame, boring time-waster and still rake in a ton of cash thanks to Kevin Smith's name in the credits. Hurray for pop culture.The ""creative"" team was so lazy that they actually have to pad out the movie with tedious love triangle dreck about these characters we don't care about. It's nice knowing they spent millions of dollars to make this happen.So the content of the film is pathetic; how about the performances? Justin Long is just another limp-wristed white guy as our protagonist, and he spends half the movie in the stupid walrus costume. Nothing to see here. Michael Parks does the best he can as the villain. He has one great scene where he tells Long a made-up story about a poisonous spiderbite; in this scene, he is an unpredictable, compelling character. But outside of those 5 minutes, he just plays a generic crazy old guy who exposits a lot and sometimes makes lame literary references.Haley Joel Osmont plays a forgettable non-character, and Johnny Depp appears as a pointless detective with a ""hilarious"" accent like some amateur SNL comedian. Genesis Rodriguez stands out as the stinkiest log on this pile, appearing as the obligatory airbrushed girl who couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Most of the actors are forgettable, and they clearly understand this movie isn't worth much effort. But Rodriguez is trying way too hard, and her godawful lack of any acting ability is painfully bad.I enjoy B movies and ""so bad they're good movies,"" but this one is just a time-waster.

196,malbanese,A long way from Clerks.....and not in a good way!,1,10 December 2014,"When ever I see directed by Kevin Smith, my excitement and predisposed disappointment set in. I'm always hoping the film will be great (Dogma, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back,Red State), but usually they turn out to be garbage (MallRats, Clerks 2, Cop Out, Tusk).Kevin Smith's venture into the horror realm could have been so much more, but you can feel the punches being pulled in every scene. The disappointment I felt after watching Tusk was angering enough to lead me to write a review about it. Now, I know that the premise for the story was first introduced to Kevin Smith on his pod-cast when a caller called in with the idea for the movie. What I don't understand is, how did anyone think this was a plausible or original idea. Having also seen the Human Centipede, I can't help make the comparisons every step of the way, and the problem is that firstly, I'm making comparisons to a Tom Six film, and secondly (and I can't believe I'm saying this) the Tom Six film is much much better.Smith's film has all the hallmarks of a psychological thriller, but the huge let down is (and again, I can't believe I'm saying this) is Johnny Depps appalling attempt at a Quebec/French Canadian accent (Not to mention how camp the role was played). It detracts from the seriousness of the matter at hand and turns the whole film into a rather poor joke. What would have been more effective, would have been a less accentuated farce, and a more serious approach to the matter at hand. I felt myself cringing in embarrassment at every scene wishing it would end sooner rather than later. Justin Long and Michael Parks give stellar performances, as always, but are under-utilized in what should have been a bizarre psychological thriller. The big let down is the special effects and conceptual makeup. Unbelievable and over the top which detracts from any hope of instilling any fear or remorse for any character.I feel that with whatever budget (let's face it, When he has less of a budget, he seems to be able to do more) was allocated to Tusk, could have been utilized so much better.Hell, it would have been better to remake Clerks with Harley Quinn Smith and Lily-Rose Melody Depp. Or better yet, remake Human Centipede, no wait.....that's what Tusk is.",Tusk

200,paintbeforeassembly,Silly horror comedy -- all good fun.,7,31 January 2015,"Tusk certainly isn't the best horror movie out there, and it isn't the best comedy either, but I did find myself laughing a lot. In pure horror terms, it loses points for making its protagonist/victim a bit of an ass-hat -- on some level, he deserves a comeuppance, and while this is an extreme one, it's not like he's a fully-innocent victim of circumstance, and that dents the horror a little. But then, this isn't a full-blown horror, it's a horror comedy, and it's goofy and silly. This isn't a movie to stretch your brain. Even the horror is overblown, and something to be laughed at -- it's more horror-parody than anything. On the famous and extensive cameo appearance in the movie, some people found Johnny Depp's character stupid and hated it. I also found it stupid, but I laughed at it a hell of a lot, so maybe this movie's sense of humour just struck me the right way. In the end, humour is always a question of taste, and you know just how that is -- anyone who doesn't share your taste is an idiot. No room for differing views on the internet! Obey the herd!Ahem. Anyway, you'll probably know if you're going to like this movie in the first twenty minutes.

When the eventually get round to the cops' they put them in touch with some sort of French Canadian serial killer hunter (depp) who claims he's met and been hunting this guy for years, this is where it all becomes a bit too pantomime for me, Michael parks as the pantomime villain and the walrus as the pantomime horse' so I'm sorry this movies is straight to v.h.s.

This is a very strange movie.Wallace(Justin Long) and Terry (Haley Joel Osment,almost unrecognizable since The Sixth Sense) share a Podcast where they make fun of viral videos from around the world. One day Wallace sets off to find the owner of a particularly interesting one. It doesn't work out so he sits in a bar wondering whether to come home or find something else. He chooses the later after reading a letter in the cubicle.He drives a couple of hours where he meets Howard Howe (Michael Parks) a former Sailor and they share Howard's story. That night Wallace is drugged and so begins his slow descent into Hell, The worst I feel that has ever been bought to cinema.Kevin Smith the Director starts this as a comedy and even through the trauma of the third act this element still raises it's head but if only to confuse, making Wallace's story even more shocking. I have seen the everything from A Serbian Film to Martyrs to Human Centipede the awesome second one not the first but this movie stands shoulders above the rest which is strange to me being that it is a Justin Long/Kevin Smith vehicle which contains comedy. See this film, it will haunt you and I truly believe you will never look at Justin Long the same way again. A Solid 9 and a half and holding a 10 for the sequel.",Tusk
203,matt-levett,So awful its brilliant!!,6,4 December 2014,"I have to say, I love the human centipede and thought this may be in a similar vein. True to form it did not disappoint. The premise is of a jackass who is going to get it......well he did!! The beginning is lengthy and wordy, awfully acted and the pot of tea offered never seemed to end. But the second half of the film was just so funny, look in the background, so ludicrous and benign that I laughed out loud!! Do not watch if you want a horror.....if you want a stupid, but laugh out loud comedy with no brains needed....then watch!!hilarious!!Funny!!",Tusk
204,xundeadgirlx,First half works as a dark comedy - better than expected!,6,5 September 2018,"I wasn't sure what to rate this film. I'd like to rate it higher because the first half was just a great dark comedy thanks to Michael Parks' character, the madman who wants to turn his victim into a walrus. The character's mockery of his victim and the back and forth from comedy to suspense is just brilliantly delivered. Kevin Smith takes the standard horror cliche, ""Unsuspecting fool stumbles into a madman's mansion,"" and makes it feel fresh. You hate the main character, but find him humorous. There are moments where you feel sorry for him, but then the movie takes you back to comedy. You constantly say to yourself, ""this is ridiculous"" but I couldn't help watching until the end. I watched The Human Centipede a few years ago hoping for a monster movie, one that could satisfy my curiosity for body horror but also make me laugh to myself, ""this is ridiculous."" But as a 20-year-old woman, what started as shock-horror quickly turned into depressing, and I shut it off halfway. I didn't wanna watch people cry in a cage and swallow each other's feces, i wanted what movies like The Fly and The Thing gave us in the 80's-90's. I wanted to be fascinated and entertained! Not being familiar with Smith's work other than Clerks & Clerks II, I worried that this film would only serve to disturb and shock. I worried it would be perverted or gory for the sake of being gory. This film really didn't take anything too far, and at the same time they showed enough to satisfy this curiosity.The second half, though, really took a direction into comedy/drama. When Johnny Depp's character arrived, I recognized his quirks but didn't realize it was him at first. I felt confused by the obvious change in tone. Despite a few flaws though, the end of the film was wrapped up nicely - sort of a cliche drama, but there was definitely underlying humor in seeing the walrus in captivity(reminds me of the ending of Freaks...but with some added heart.) All-in-all, Tusk was better than I thought it would be. I don't think a movie with such an odd premise has a chance at being a 10/10 comedy or horror, but Kevin Smith somehow made it work in both genres for me.",Tusk
205,fwznqknk,This movie is the reason why I don't like Kevin Smith anymore,1,30 August 2021,"I use to love Kevin Smith. Then I watched this truly upsetting movie and now I despise him for ruining my life. It's not scary or entertaining it's just uncomfortable to watch. I kept watching thinking the end will make it feel campy or I'll not feel sick to my stomach... nope it just continuously got worse and never got better. To this day if anyone asks me for what my least favorite movie/most hated of all time is - it's Tusk - without a second thought - Tusk. Anyone who knows me well knows I hate this movie. I can't even listen to Fleetwood Mac's song ""Tusk"" because it makes me think of this movie. Thanks Kevin Smith.",Tusk

207,helenfrost38,Take my eyes. I don't want to watch any movies ever again.,1,3 March 2015,"* There is a spoiler about the end -if anyone wants to address it please feel free* So colorful was my cursing while watching this nonsense, that hubby came in from outside, wondering what on earth could prompt such a commentary. Fox News? That bloody Flo woman flogging insurance? When I pronounced the movie to be irredeemable poppycock he was shocked... ""But you love Kevin Smith! You even liked Red State!"" And then I saw it - that, right there, is the problem. If this had been merely a SyFy movie, with William Shatner and Tara Reid, it would be mocked, and rightly so. The fact that this came from someone capable of such awesomeness is what makes this soooo much worse. Personally I could see nothing of Kevin smith in this.. nothing. The script had none of his usual flair, flow and crackle. The ""big reveal"" was clumsy and laughable. As for the ""see them from space"" plot holes and inconsistencies? Randall would be beside himself. This movie would be in a box, under a blanket behind the shelf containing Navy Seals. Damn, I should have watched Navy Seals. Here is the weirdest part - the performances were pretty good. Justin pulled off smarmy-but-likable (mustache not withstanding - the most horrifying part of the movie for me) Johnny Depp was amusing enough, doing a fine impersonation of a drunk Alan Partridge. I even liked Haley Joel Whatsit. But those mattered not. I know all directors have lower points, and god knows I am no-one to criticize, but my reason for writing is this: I refuse to believe that everyone involved, at all the many points in the process, watched this and said ""Yup. This is fine"". Not good even, just fine. If I do a crap job at my work, you can bet someone will call me out on it. Does this make him a bad director? Of course not. He is a witty and talented chap indeed... which is the very reason this smarts so much. Here comes my problem, the end - *Spoiler* - after all this trauma, they ""rescue"" him and plonk him in a dodgy roadside zoo!!!! They know he isn't a real bloody walrus right? He was with that bloke for what... 5 mins? Not years! No reconstructive surgery? PTSD counseling? Not even Dr Phil??? Nothing???? the reason he's not speaking to you is because his tongue is torn out.... not cuz he is a walrus - don't throw the poor lad a fish, you patronizing tart! Perhaps ""Tusk 2 - The Revenge"" is justified just to address this. Or maybe not.",Tusk
208,unitythroughterror,"Good, but needless to say not for everyone.",9,19 September 2014,"While I have seen an abundance of films like these, gory horror and body horror isn't really my thing. I prefer paranormal based on a true story types, but this film - while I can't say I enjoyed it - was certainly impressive on an epic scale as a minimalist horror film. I definitely heard about Kevin Smith's Red State which caused quite the hurrah a couple years back. When I saw the trailer to this film, they slyly didn't show ANY of the transformed Justin Long - something in marketing that is pretty much unheard of these days. Not a single frame of what he becomes was in any of the marketing campaigns. That sparked my interest. What were they hiding? What did it look like? What had crazy cat Kevin Smith cooked up as the humanoid walrus hybrid? It also seemed like one of those talk of the town movies, a la The Human Centipede, where you just had to see it to stay in the social loop (in my case tortured artists and theatery people). Well, well, well. What an interesting viewing experience it has been. I can say - without giving ANYTHING away - the sight of one of the most bizarre duels in movie-making history is worth the wait. The images are shocking - and I remember people both laughing and gasping when the curtain is lifted and we see the film's ""walrus."" Michael Parks is a true sadist - charming, unreliable, hilarious, and sick. Justin Long's hatable nature as a self-involved, raunchy podcaster is still something we can kind of miss once the transformation begins. The film is an odd allegory for how, as human beings, we have lost our humanity. Oddly enough, without giving anything away, humanity is achieved like never before at the end - while not exactly in the way everyone was expecting. It's not too disturbing but then again I'm pretty desensitized so horror virgins beware. This could give you nightmares. Funny, disgusting, ridiculous, insane, intelligently inane, and absolutely first class independent film midnight movie making that was backed by a major studio. Just go see the thing. Of all the things Kevin Smith has done, it may just be his masterpiece.",Tusk
209,dmavroudis78,Not for anybody...,7,28 November 2020,"Yes, this movie is not for all audiences. And I give it a 7 surely for its originality. If you are a fan of new horror paths, give it a chance.",Tusk
210,nms1982,Justin Long is the walrus,8,14 June 2019,"I just watched this movie for the second time and, despite the shock value of the first viewing being gone, I still thoroughly appreciated it after another look. I would in fact say I like this and director Kevin Smith's previous film, ""Red State,"" more than any of his Jay and Silent Bob flicks or anything else by him. There's a bit more going on here than merely crazy old guy kidnaps crappy young guy and renders him a monstrosity for his own sick and/or odd reasons. Justin Long is perfectly cast as a narcissistic sleaze and Michael Parks--one of the best character actors money could buy, before his death a few years ago--is too as an isolated psychopath who is perhaps not so much out of his gourd as not a fan of the human race and nostalgic for a happier time; a time spent decades earlier, with a walrus friend.Part of why I'd wanted to take this film in once more is because it's somewhat haunting. It's a unique nightmare, of the sort that could conceivably transpire, that lodges itself in one's mind. A fellow who (some might say accurately) regards human beings as the Earth's only real beasts, a man who was as a kid horribly abused and went through life with no one, without love or support, turns into a serial killer--hunted by a lone Canadian detective. But his aim seems to be less to inflict suffering as to turn man to animal, or rather the animal that man is into something superior to man: a, to his thinking, higher animal. And to do this so that he might relive, again (though fraudulently) experience, the six months during which he (allegedly) enjoyed the companionship of the marine creature that once saved him physically and then emotionally--the only time he knew connection.The film--or Parks' ""Howard Howe""--suggests that the modern person has lost much of his or her humanity (or never had much to begin with). And Long's character particularly has. But by being forcibly transformed into a walrus-person perhaps, it's also suggested, Long's Wallace Bryton ironically regains some measure of the humanity lost in the quest for success, to the distractions of the 21st century world, an amoral society. To a culture as cheap as the plastic convenience store cup that keeps reappearing, even long after he has come to look forward to meals of whole fish eaten off the ground.",Tusk

In the end we're no better then the walrus,1,21 January 2020,"The GOOD: This movie has Johnny Depp, Haley Joel Osment, and Justin Long. Its also written and directed by Kevin Smith. He did a wonderful job of really telling a something new.The BAD: Thats all I got for ""the good"" really. The walrus make up is spotty, the way he moves is wierd, the noises he makes dont match what he looks like, obviously the surgery to create this monstrous creature makes no sense at all. But the biggest offense by a mile is that fact that this all happens in Canada! Like Harley from EMT said, ""red and white, but never blue.""
I'm really not sure what to think about this... I give Kevin Smith mad props for writing and directing a movie this bizarre. Its refreshing to see something truly original, and something that is absolutely a one off film. The creativity in this movie is something we probably wont see again for awhile, not that thats a bad thing. At the end of the day, this is a movie about a ""walrus"" and the psycho who created it. All the ""hidden meaning"" behind this story is over shadow by the visuals of the walrus.

217,huggiebearthedestroyer,Finally! A Movie about Walruses!,8,27 September 2014,"Well, After watching it, I'd say that this is a perfect mix of horror and comedy. I'm unsure if it's intentional or unintentional, but was entertaining none the less. The story follows a podcaster that ends up going to a creepy old dude's house for his podcast. Who apparently has a big obsession with Walruses since one saved him when he was younger. So he basically holds the podcaster hostage and ends up surgically turning him into a Walrus. Meanwhile his love interest (Who if I can recall is one of the only hot actresses I've seen in a while that can actually put emotion into her performance) and his friend set out to find him after he's been missing for several days and received a phone call of him pleading for help. They end up meeting an inspector that's been hunting the man that held the podcaster hostage and continue their search with him. Meanwhile the podcaster that's now transformed into a walrus fights his captor (Who is now wearing a walrus suit) and ends up killing him after going insane and going ""Full Walrus"". His two friends and the inspector end up finding him after the fight and take him to live what remains of his life in a wildlife sanctuary. There are some comedic moments but it's more of a drama/horror. But it's still none the less entertaining and kept me interested through out it's run time. It could have been a bit better, the Walrus costumes did look a bit ridiculous, but it did have some pretty good scenes that tugged at my heart a bit (Especially the end). 8/10",Tusk

The atmosphere in the room between Justin long and the old guy wasn't bad. Then you can get into the fact that his leg gets cut off. People like gore. Whatever.

219,Ma_Herbo,"A serial killer, a victim and a search party",4,14 July 2017,"The film is based on an idea from a Kevin Smith podcast (we hear it during the credits) which is meant as a joke. It is actually the final scene of this movie.There are actually 3 stories in that movie:1. The story of a serial killer. It's the best story of the three. You learn why he's doing what he's doing and you feel for the character and all he went through in his life. He feels all humans are monsters, including himself and wants to correct all that. Yes, he turns out to be weird and crazy to a shocking point. The character is along the line of Dr. Hannibal Lecter from ""The Silence of the Lamb"". Relating his story to actual events helps the viewer connecting with the character (The ""Duplessis Orphans"" are real, as described in the movie).2. The story of a victim. The movie begins with this story presenting us a person that most of us would consider a monster by the way he chose to live his life. Still, we feel for him and we don't think he deserves whatever happens to him as the plot unfolds. The story is well told by the use of flashback. In a certain way, we can see this character evolving (forcefully), realizing in the end he might be a better person as a ""friendly form of life"" and as a ""monster killer"" than as being the ""monster"" he used to be. Too bad the ending of this story (which is the ending of the movie and the original idea behind the movie) is presented in such a ridiculous way. What was meant to be funny, well, it just doesn't work with the rest of this story. It leaves you confused about a character that you began to feel something for. That last scene could've been told in a more serious and realistic manner to help the viewer connect even more with the main character.3. The search party story. The first half of the movie is only about stories 1 & 2 and the viewer is deeply involved in the plot. Then we began to see the story about the search party for the victim (the girlfriend, the best friend and a retired cop). We are in for ridiculous and unrealistic situations and characters without depth. Especially the retired cop which could be a character on ""Dumb and dumber"" as he is such a caricature. This story brings nothing to the movie and could be completely removed with no consequences. Most of it was meant to be funny, which wasn't reaching me at all. I guess it's the type of humour that can only be enjoyed while high.In retrospect, it's an horror movie in the sense that you will see disturbing images, but there are no scary scenes. If someone finds humour in this movie, I find it very thin, and other Kevin Smith's movies are much better examples for this purpose. I wish Kevin Smith would have shown more of the transformation process (physically and mentally) instead of the search party story. We would have connected even more with the main characters and feel their pain.The ending and the search party story really killed the movie, thus the low rating.",Tusk

Michael Parks' acting was one redeeming quality, although I don't feel the acting in this movie was the problem, other than Johnny Depp, which I believe was purposefully bad acting, a crutch that Depp leans on time and time and time again, as evidenced by the fact that he's produced almost nothing good since his mouth was sewn shut in Edward Scissorhands (and okay, I love Dark Shadows too).

240,Chryspie1102,Well......THAT went sideways,7,5 January 2015,"Whereas I felt that this movie was messed up, I really liked the fact that I was actually horrified by a movie that had little to no gore in it. I am a fan of horror movies but do not like slasher films. I really prefer the psychological fear and anticipation over the ""let's saw limbs off"" and/or ""let's attach peoples mouths to other peoples behinds and make a bug-ish thingy"". That's not horror.......That's just gross.I liked this movie but I can certainly see why others may not. But I also am very into Psychology and what makes people tick and why people do what they do. It wasn't the best made movie nor did it have the finest actor's, but it did leave me thinking ""well, that was just messed up"" and searching my Anatomy and Physiology books.I gave it a 7 only because it peaked my curiosity and didn't leave me feeling like that was the longest hour and a half in my life....Much like the new Disney musical Into The Woods left me feeling and THAT move was obviously well funded and well acted but it was a musical and it felt very very long to me. I also tend to like weird little independent films so if you're looking for intense horror.....This is probably not it but if you like movies where you find yourself thinking ""what in the world is this guy up to?"" and/or ""How exactly is this guy going to......"" then you might want to give it a go.",Tusk

It is sick and twisted. I feel sick to my stomach after watching this. I strongly recommend that you stay as far away from this movie as you possibly can. If I could have given it anything worse than a one I would have. The beginning was okay as in the previews, but the humor failed. His first encounter with the antagonist was a good attempt but everything fell apart from there. I don't want to give anything away about the ending so I wont give details.

242,colleenpryoritize,"I appreciate the audaciousness behind it, just wish the movie had been better...",6,7 December 2014,"Wow. I'm really torn on this one but, ultimately, can't really recommend it. I applaud the ambition and general don't-give-a-F--- attitude that went into this movie and, at the beginning, I was really routing for it to emerge as a weird cult classic. Unfortunately, as the movie unfolded, I found that I wasn't really emotionally connected or hooked into any of the characters on screen and lost interest by the end. I love what are often considered ""weird"" movies (David Lynch and early David Cronenberg spring to mind), but they only really work for me when all the bizarre WTF-edness is rooted in something that is human and relatable and ""Tusk"" never made that connection with me or really made me FEEL anything on a deeper emotional or psychological level. It seemed to have something to say about modern media in the internet age, but that felt pretty superficial and totally on-the-nose. You can feel that weird and surreal movies ""Eraserhead"" or ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, And Her Lover"" have something genuine and profoundly human that they are trying to express, even when you can't quite decipher exactly what the f--- it is. At the end of the day, I never felt like ""Tusk"" had something to say or a point that made all the weirdness work and come together in a way that somehow felt right.I appreciate how the movie tries to buck expectations and conventions, but unfortunately, this also really ends up working against it. The movie isn't funny enough to work as a comedy, it's not scary or suspenseful enough to work as a horror/thriller, and, like I said above, it lacks the emotional or psychological depth to stand out as a weird but brilliant cult classic. It really would have been amazing if the movie had managed to hit each and every one of those targets (and I give it credit for even trying), but it kind of ends up missing all of them instead.Still, I appreciate the effort and would rather watch an interesting and ambitious failure like this than a lot of the tepid and familiar mainstream movies that are out there these days.",Tusk

I think if you're wanting a serious horror movie you'll be highly disappointed, but if you're wanting something goofy with a horror theme this is it. Either way it leaves a impression on you love it or hate it. A strong reason why I enjoyed the movie it's not the same type of ""horror"" that gets put out each passing year.

Mallrats didn't speak to me in the same way Clerks did. I listened to the podcast that inspired the film when it dropped last year and was able to visualize every scene as Smith and his podcasting partner Scott Mosier described it. These scenes remained with me when I sat down to watch it. I decided to let the film germinate in my subconscious, so that I could be certain of my opinion after the fact. Did I enjoy it? Very much so. It's a strange blend of comedy and horror, which I know some people didn't like. The climactic scene was both horrifyingly disturbing and strangely funny. I'm actually on the verge of laughing just thinking about it. The performances stand out, especially Michael Parks and Johnny Depp. The scene in which both characters meet is hilarious and left me hungry for more.Some people didn't connect with the source material or the characters, which is understandable since it's such a strange movie. It's also worth noting that it performed poorly at the box office, for one reason or another. Still, I can't help but wonder if it'll simply fade away into obscurity or garner more attention over the years through VOD, blu ray and midnight screenings. After all, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which is still one of the weirdest films ever made, flopped during release only to rise from the ashes as a cult mega hit. Watch this space, I don't think this is the end for 'Tusk'.",Tusk

While a movie such as Videodrome isn't necessarily the most interesting idea, it runs with how strange it is and becomes charming because of it. But this.... is bland.And the walrus suit! Wow it's terrible looking. And it doesn't help that it's shown in complete light, broadcasting how bad it looks.And if your looking for just a gore fun fest, there's not even much gore.

252,jerhood,Walrus NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1,1 January 2015,"If there was an award for the worst conceived and more importantly manufactured movie of all time this would be at the utmost top of my list. I have seen other reviewers say that this one shows the depth of what happens when a pothead gets the ability to make his own movies, as an avid smoker of the greenery and a semi fan of Kevin Smith I take offense to this analogy. This is just a piece o' crap movie and weed shouldn't take the blame for it or the act of being a ""pothead"".It really amazed me more that he convinced any legitimate actor to take part in the steaming pile of horse's anal relief. Justin Long doesn't knock them out of the park every time he takes on a role but how on god's great earth did he ever get talked into this, and I won't even try to figure out how the talk went that convinced Johnny Depp to get involved ... Do actors ever watch the crap they produce before its released, I would be truly embarrassed if I were even an extra in this piece of monkey spunk.Lastly I have seen other reviews that compare this to The Human Centipede, I see how you can come to that comparison and I absolutely hated The Human Centipede, but its an Oscar winning movie in comparison to Tusk. As ridiculous as both concepts are for anything including a movie that's supposed to be somewhat entertaining, at least The Human Centipede tried to take itself somewhat seriously. Tusk try's to add levity to itself from time to time and fails at that as horribly as it does in turning a human into a walrus believably.I didn't toss in a lot of the spoilers and specifics I would like to because I hate reading reviews that pick apart the details of a movie I haven't seen, and there are PLENTY of other reviews here that already have done that. If you want some specifics read those, most of the ones that give it a 1 star rating are spot on. I am also not writing this in hopes that someone curious to watch it will be deterred from doing so, mainly because I watched this piece of monkey spunk so so should you if your curious. This is my personal F*CK YOU letter to Kevin Smith and anyone involved in this crap-fest of a movie. You could have fed a starving village in Africa with the money you wasted on something that should have never been produced. I truly hope this movie damages your career.Love, A former fan",Tusk
253,ezzekhiel,"If you watch this movie, you have to go full Walrus",7,22 October 2015,"I am not a Kevin Smith fanboy. I have seen Dogma and Clerks a long time ago, and I can barely remember them so Tusk being made by the same director didn't really matter.One thing you need to understand is that Tusk is NOT a horror movie. It borrows the setting of a horror thriller but it is at its core a comedy. Sometimes you want to mix genres, so you make a horror comedy in which you will import horror elements into the comedy genre (like Mel Brooks would do). Tusk is doing actual opposite of that, it's importing comedy elements like Justin Long and Johnny Depp's characters into a thriller/horror setting.I've seen a lot of reviews comparing it to The Human Centipede. Tusk has NOTHING to do with that movie. Yes the premise of turning a man into an animal is similar, but Tusk is way more metaphorical. Also, it has real actors, delivering a very good performance overall.If you wanted draw some kind of similarities with other movies, I would name Polanski's Dance of the Vampires or Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness. Most importantly, if you let yourself drawn into the movie without polluting your mind by trying to label Tusk, you will have a lot of fun.",Tusk
254,Sockfilms,The Tusk Identity Crisis,5,29 September 2014,"In some ways ""Tusk"" succeeds as a comedy. I found myself laughing at a lot of the films jokes and there seemed to be a LOT of intentional humor there. The problem was that as the movie progressed the line between what was intentionally funny and what was not got shady.Don't get me wrong, I firmly believe this movie had it's silver linings. This movie had two AWESOME performances in it from Michael Parks and Johnny Depp.Parks just seems to pour his heart and soul into his role as the eccentric, psychotic Howard Howe. His stories and monologues are spoken with absolute conviction and believability. He's interesting to boot. Heck, you even believe he would be the type a guy to deform a human being into the form of a walrus.And Johnny Depp (as he always does when Tim Burton isn't involved) knocks it out of the park with his performance. He is truly funny in my opinion and vanishes into his role as detective Guy Lapointe. The movie's weakness however is it's very premise: a man being surgically transformed into... a walrus.The movie kind of dropped off the rails for me, and I believe the rest of the theater whenever the big walrus reveal happened. Here it was, the big moment, the reveal the movie has been thrusting with full momentum towards since the first second AND.... laughter from all around me. I mean what else can I say? It looks as ridiculous as it sounds, and it became very distracting because every time I tried getting back into the illusion the walrus would pop back up, the people behind me would start laughing, and I'd be right out of the illusion again.The movie suffers from an identity crisis. It's marketed as a ""more cuddly ""Human Centipede"""", but at least ""Human Centipede"" knew what it was. A gross-out horror film. It is not by any means a good film, but it's easy to stay focused and not get distracted. ""Tusk"" is just as disfigured as it's Justin-Long-Walrus-Monster...Thing. It talks like a comedy, it walks like a comedy, but something about the tone is trying desperately to be a horror film. For this reason, I think the film would have benefited from going full balls-to-the-wall comedy.As I was saying to my fiancée last night, I am a Kevin Smith whore and I want to support everything the man does. I loved ""Red State"" and thought the film was a masterpiece. I mean that 100% and could argue for it all day. ""Tusk"", however, just kind of left me, I'll admit, a little confused about how to feel. I still love Kevin Smith and will continue to support what he puts out, but for now I have to say #WalrusNo.",Tusk
255,ericdrumz,An Entirely New Style of Horror,9,28 April 2015,"This post is mostly for myself as a point of reference for future use. So, just because it's long doesn't mean it's some sort of cry for attention disguised as a self-absorbed fishing expedition for likes, so there.You don't necessarily need to like Kevin Smith's work to appreciate the fact that (for the most part, anyway) each of his films are almost completely indistinguishable from one another. Unlike Michael Mann or JJ Abrams, whose styles are instantly identifiable (and who probably wouldn't deign to try something like this or ""Clerks"" anyway), Kevin brings a different look and feel to most everything he does.Which is probably part of the reason why I found ""Tusk"" so jarring and unnerving.Back in 1981, John Landis rightfully enjoyed a crapload of adulation for successfully combining horror and comedy in ""An American Werewolf in London,"" but while it was obviously violent and funny - and had moments of outright terror and shock - the story itself wasn't intended to maintain a constant state of tension, suspense or, more daringly, dread and despair.""Tusk"" tries this, though, and succeeds brilliantly. However, while it may lack as many outright laugh-out-loud moments as ""American Werewolf"" (""You gonna eat that toast?""). It manages to temper a very disturbing and almost unbearable sense of hopelessness and despair for the lead character with darkly funny moments that brought me a welcome break from what was going on in the antagonist's DIY indoor aquatic exhibit. If you consider yourself a fan of film, you more than likely will be able to suspend your disbelief long enough to allow you to let yourself get taken in by the story. I encourage you to do so, because ""Tusk"" did for me what every truly great horror movie does: a safe outlet to let myself feel disturbed on a visceral level.The plot is of course preposterous and absurd, but then so is a great deal of what comes out of Hollywood. Doesn't make it any less entertaining. ""Gravity,"" for instance, which can really only be seen in IMAX 3D to be appreciated, relied so much on technology that the actual storyline of the movie probably wasn't written until the night before principal photography began. That didn't alter the fact that I stood outside the theater for 20 minutes, crying like a baby because what I had just seen was nothing less than an artistic and technical achievement in film. It was something I hadn't seen before, and that's precisely mankind's chief bitch about Hollywood, so forgive the hell out of me for enjoying the moment. :-) There are a couple of plot holes, and while they were noticeable enough to make me think about them for a moment, they're nothing I didn't have a problem letting go of. Besides, the movie moves at a fairly brisk pace so I didn't really have time to bitch, and my own script still contains a couple of similar math problems I may have to just live with, so c'est la vie.The writing takes the realism that everybody seemed to have loved in ""Clerks"" and improves upon it exponentially. Personally, I always thought ""Clerks"" tried a bit too hard in that regard, but I liked what he was trying to do. Here, he's mastered it. Factor in more than a few moments of editing and directing genius in the form of flashbacks and scenes between the supporting actors back in civilization, and you have what I think is an entirely original piece of filmmaking. ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" was a movie; ""Tusk"" is a film, and a damn good horror film if you can handle it's disturbing nature.I went into this not knowing what to expect, other than having heard some of the buzz over how atypical it was for Kevin Smith. I didn't even know a single person in the cast (which tells you how off the radar this was for me), which made the characters and performances I saw on the screen all that more interesting and impressive. If you don't know anything about this film other than the fact that a man is turned into a walrus, do yourself a favor and keep it that way. You'll thank me later.And one last thing: The Big Reveal. Just...wow. The buildup to it is unsettling and morbidly fascinating enough, but the actual moment is the exact second at which that aching feeling of despair hit me like a shovel to the face, and stayed with me throughout the rest of the story.This isn't everyone's cup of tea by a long shot, but if you're one of those who've grown weary of torture porn, zombies and remakes of Japanese ghost stories, you could do a lot worse.Besides, it's free on Amazon Prime. :-)",Tusk

If you cringe easily but get get a thrill from that, this could be a decent watch. The visuals of the walrus suit are disturbing for a minute, and then comical the next.Personally, I saw this in theaters, and I loved it. I haven't ever seen a Kevin Smith film before this, and I knew very little about his style, but if his other movies are anything like this, I will enjoy them. I thought the cast was very fitting in their parts. Justin Long and Micheal Parks have a great on screen presence together. Haley Joel Osment is really fun to watch, and so is Genesis Rodriguez.To me, the best two performances come from Micheal Parks and Johnny Depp. People love to complain about Johnny Depp always playing a version of Jack Sparrow, and this was the departure people were hoping for, except they like to complain about everything, so they complained that he wasn't Jack Sparrow enough. Guy LaPointe was a funny character and his story kept me interested until I forgot about the walrus part completely.The movie was creepy and funny and I thought it was a fresh new idea.

Was this a comedy? I don't know? Was this written and made for middle school and possible cognitively impaired high school kids? Evidently that's Smith's fan base right now from what this film has to offer. If you're expecting Chasing Amy, Mall Rats, Jay/Silent Bob, this is not it. I'm guessing Smith was going for dark comedy/something different, etc? Different? For sure. Good?

Typical Manitoba, amiright?In terms of what it was aiming for, this movie is pretty pitch- perfect. It doesn't purport to be sympathetic, or realistic, or particularly horrifying, and it is none of those things. While there are certainly moments of legitimate disgust (I watched this movie having consumed nothing but coffee all day; needless to say it did not help my stomach settle all that much), the movie is primarily a totally surreal, intentionally schlocky romp into a quirky alternate reality, where Not-See Party (get it?) is a legitimate podcast name and Johnny Depp is a hammed-up (European) French person masquerading as a Quebecer with a few loose screws.This movie is most certainly not for everybody. It borders on torture porn, and I think fairly compared to the Human Centipede in a number of respects. However, the trailer is a fair reflection of the movie's atmosphere and plot. I found nothing in the movie particularly surprising, and it goes about how you would expect. It really does not take itself that seriously, and while it is certainly not a laugh-out-loud, ha-ha kind of funny, it's funny in a disbelieving, ""did they really just go there?"" kind of way. That is, it doesn't tell jokes; it revels in gory absurdity.If that is not your thing, then it's not your thing and you probably won't enjoy this movie.

I found it obvious, so I'm a bit shocked with the reviews indicating this wasn't a comedy or horror flick, which is accurate and I don't understand the expectation that it was supposed to be. The movie depicts society well. His original trip to Canada was for a nod to people living on the internet and often laughing at other's misfortunes. Karma caught him and he's now the butt of the joke. Then you have the story tellers between Howe and the detective, which is what the lead was supposed to do, bring back the story after the trip. It's certainly not for everyone, but it's being painted in the wrong shade.",Tusk

Therefore, I am going to simply copy + paste a review (a first in itself) of a this movie (while considering doing something more formal should I decide I care enough to later) that I posted on the FB page for it already. ""and here i thought Kevin might realize he SHOULDN""T be near-death level stoned while contemplating movie ideas after that horrible animated movie with mostly re-done material. pacing was painfully slow between the horror element being hinted at, and it being ""executed,"" and it wasn't even scary. the music was done fairly well, but that walrus suit? are you kidding me? you can even clearly see a part where Justin's head dips in and out of it, like it's nothing but a twisted, and poorly done fat-suit that COULD HAVE looked like the one Eddie had for the Nutty Professor movies. the guy (the movie's villain character who doesn't share a real name) is clearly out of whack, and maybe it's because i've seen a lot of movies, but how in the hell is the angle of torture and mutilation even viable at all after 7 SAW movies, and garbage like ""human centipede""? feel free to call me out for those who liked it, i just...i just hope no one that is determined to see it expects anything but a movie that MIGHT have been scary if it had been done MANY years ago. i'm almost mad at the person who told me to watch the horrendous thing, but it's not her fault it so largely sucked.""",Tusk

275,MasonMcNeal,I feel bad for hating this.,3,19 September 2014,"I followed Kevin Smith's work on Tusk very closely as I listen to his pod-cast. I love his stuff, sure the guy has bad movies but most directors that have been in the business as long as he has have made at least one less-than-stellar film. So naturally I was excited to see what Kevin Smith did with this material. When him and Scott came up with the concept, I remember thinking it had potential to be a great horror-comedy if handled right. Unfortunately, this film was not handled right. There were numerous times where the film could have used another pair of eyes. And good on Kev for making something really independent, but that turns out to be a really bad thing for this in that Kevin must have missed some of the more major flaws in the film. Some of the acting is unbearable. There's one scene when Guy LaPointe and Michael Parks character have an interchange in a flashback and it was one the most annoying things I've seen this year and it felt like it went on forever. It felt like another segment of Movie 43. Like it belonged in that movie. It took a great actor and a great performer and made them absolutely repugnant. I had to leave the theater halfway through the scene and return when I heard it was over. And I know you probably think that I'm just the one guy who didn't think it was funny, but we had more walk outs in that scene that anything else I sat through this year. The pacing of the film was strange. It went from being incredibly interesting in the first 30 mins to a complete dead stop at Genesis Rodriguez's monologue. Good on the director for telling us what the back story is instead of showing us. The monologue goes on for a good 3-5 minutes and it's unbearably slow. She's a great actor, we get it. But we didn't need that long of a break from the main story.This movie suffers from something that a lot of horror movies suffer from now and I don't think people realize it's happening. Justin Long's character was not a great guy. He was kind of a jerk. So when he inevitably gets put in a walrus suit, guess who cared... No one. We were all kinda like...well good. On top of all that, the walrus suit is one of the most laughably bad designs I've seen in awhile. Props to Kevin for taking the practical route with it but it looked like a cheap Don Post Halloween mask only all over Justin Long's body. There's a moment near the end where Michael Parks hits Justin Longs walrus face and one of the tusks moves across his face as if it was attached to the suit and not his face. This was the only time I laughed in the film. Not to mention my laugh was the only laugh in the whole theater for the whole movie. I felt compelled to ask other audience members what they thought and as expected, there were tons of Kevin Smith fans in the audience. They all used the word disappointed. We were all sad. It's not just that the movie does things poorly intentionally but that it seems to not notice how horribly it was put together. It needed another edit, some shots needed re-shot, and it needed another draft badly. I'm very disappointed and I feel bad for hating this film. I wanted so bad to love it. I feel bad for Kevin. Good for him making the movie he wanted to make, but unfortunately that movie was a 3/10.",Tusk

I payed good money to see it in the movie theater and I was happy it was a good mix of horror and comedy. Some people don't know good movies when they see it. Casting was perfect for this movie and the acting of each actor/actress where the best in any movie I saw so far that can't beat tusk in any way shape or form I would recommend watching and buying this movie for people who like all Kevin smith movies.

It has a nice blend of comedy and horror. It has a few parts that drag on a little...but not really any complaints. If you want to have a good time, GO SEE THIS! Justin Long plays the part great...Little hard to sympathize with his character, but like I said...Not an Oscar Winner. Michael Parks is FANTASTIC. Guy gives off a genuinely creepy vibe from start to finish. Kevin Smith I think knocked it out of the park with this one. More people should be talking about this!

The flier mentions how Howard wants to tell his many adventures which is what grabs Wallis's attention. Wallis is then kidnapped by Howard and has to escape for survival or suffer being sewn into a walrus suit.Director Kevin Smith is know for his weed smoking comedy movies and a hand of other movies. Kevin's comedy in Tusk is subtle and some of the jokes are inside joke from his SMODCAST podcast recorded show. The jokes are only funny on a certain perspective. To be fair it's goal is to creepy and if it's funny to you that include as a bonus. What the movie does well in is making the audience feel like the main character Wallis. Scenes have a feeling of being bazaar, creepy, and out of place. Unlike most modern horror movies Tusk isn't an extremely gross movie which is a good thing. Also the movie doesn't move around much at all and adds more drama to the film. The movie is weird and the concept is very different and I recommend that you check it out for only those two reasons.",Tusk

Trying to be a comedy/horror is exactly not what this turned out to be. More horrible than horror. It also makes Canadians appear to be complete morons (especially French Canadians). Even Depp couldn't save this poor excuse of a film.The only reason I gave two stars was the costume/makeup was along the same lines as The Human Centipede (which this seemed to be kinda ripped-off from) and the using of Fleetwood Mac's song Tusk as part of the soundtrack. Sure glad the producers no doubt had tried to obtain the rights of using the Beatles' I Am The Walrus but couldn't get that for this terrible excuse of poorly done entertainment. Too bad I can't get my money back or the time I wasted in viewing. Hell, if I even got back the ticket price compared to what Depp was paid for this I'd be truly happy. Kevin Smith shot his wad and it didn't work. Just goes to show somebody is willing to fund awful movies and think the public will cream their pants in thinking the same way they do. Pathetic.",Tusk

Would have been more effective as a scary movie if there was no humor, in my opinion. Overall though, still unsettling. The ending got me mad, because how could you leave someone like that?

Not only are these two spiders very distinct from one another, but neither occur in Manitoba (where most of the film is set).

It's almost as if they intentioned it to be this way. Maybe some effort to become a classic B-cult movie down the road, who knows. It was a depressing downer. I didn't like the movie, the acting, the subject matter, the story line and would not recommend it to anyone, even the most devout trashy B-horror loving gross factor, blood and guts fan.

It reminded me of the feeling I used to have when I had my first TV set 20 years ago, sitting up in my bedroom watching anything that was on till I couldn't stay awake any longer only to wake up and realize the TV was still on. I would consume whatever was on the TV, this was before I had my own DVD player etc, and every once in a while something would come on that completely grabbed my attention. Not because it was a masterpiece of film, but because it pushed all the right buttons that good cinema should. The grind house revival of Tarrantino/Rodriguez comes to mind, although of a different measure, I imagine they tried to recreate a similar sort of feeling from their youths. With his film Tusk, Kevin Smith has made good cinema. Watchable cinema, fun cinema that brought me back to that what the fxxk moment that would come along every so often when for example a Cronenberg film, or a crazy Kung fu movie or a stylistic Hong Kong gangster movie would come on my little TV 20 years ago.

A French- speaking, beret-wearing (did I mention inaccurate clichés?) ex-cop whose presentation in the film just weakens this already limp excuse for a movie.What's sadder than losing over an hour and a half of your life watching this movie is knowing that somewhere, deep inside, Kevin Smith still must have talent yet can't seem to channel it to make any movie that means something anymore.",Tusk
307,mjschwar-1,You Will Not Like This Movie,8,20 February 2015,"The very definition of ""not for everyone"", Tusk is an oddball, absurd, twisted midnight movie that plays more like a demented fever dream than a horror or comedy film. I'd never recommend it to anyone I intend to ever speak to again.Here are the reasons why you won't like it:1) It's unexpectedly surreal, with little interest in the laws of reality, or at least modern medicine and police work. And it's not directed in an obviously surreal, arty fashion like, say, a David Lynch picture, which makes it even harder to wrap your head around.2) It's got an odd tone. There's comedy, sure, but it's mostly a slower, more cringe- inducing variety than Kevin Smith is typically known for. There's suspense, and a bit of gross-out, but the film evokes more unease than outright scares, and the grotesqueries are more evocative of a nightmare after eating one too many sliders than, say, Saw. And it swings freely between the two with no warning at all.3) You haven't seen Tod Browning's ""Freaks"", a classic bit of cult cinema that Smith has made references to in other films. In fact, you probably don't even know it exists. (Cinephiles will notice rather direct references to many of Kev-O's other favorite movies as well, including Silence of the Lambs and Jaws.)4) You're Canadian, and your country and culture are No Laughing Matter.If for some reason none of the above applies to you, may I recommend ""Tusk""? It's oddball, gonzo, at times self indulgent and slow, but also occasionally very funny and strangely thought-provoking, provided you're willing to go along for the ride.

This is not an horror film, or comedy, i don't really know what genre it was, all i can say is it was disturbing and there are people that don't need to see this. I felt a mix of negative emotions when i saw the walrus transformation, some people said it was funny, but for me it was not. I want to forget it, i want to erase this moment from my life, the only reason why i watched this was because Johnny Depp was in it( i loved his performance), he was weird and great as always, but i don't want to feel perturbed by what some people call a masterpiece. I gave it a 5/10 because it was well made and there were great performances. I am now giving you an advice, don't watch it!!. It was like the human centipede(which i have't seen, neither want to). There are plenty of good films out there, you should try other movie more interesting and don't waste your time or money watching this film.(unless you want to feel bad and not sleep)",Tusk

Unless you're a huge Kevin Smith fan and absolutely must see everything he writes, stay away from Tusk. It isn't funny.I really got tired of Canadian stereotypes a long time ago. Canadians aren't porn star-mustache wearing, backwoods hillbillies. We don't say ""eh"" or ""aboot"" any more than all Americans say ""ya'll, or its plural ""all y'all"".If you don't know anything about Canada, don't write about it. And don't film a movie that supposedly takes place in Manitoba, in North Carolina. That's like filming a movie that takes place in Iowa, in California, with palm trees in the background. Iowa, by the way, is only an 8 hour drive from Winnipeg, and would have made a better backdrop.And I'm sorry, the premise is ridiculous. Human Centipede wasn't as bad as this. At least the centipede is not impossible. A walrus. Really? I wasn't sure if this were supposed to be funny, or some kind of ""horror"" film...because it is neither.",Tusk

But has a horrible basic narrative problem; Suspension of disbelief.From Wikipedia""The term suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe something surreal; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment.""On any regular movie, we suspend our disbelief to believe the surreal world that we see on the screen, from drama to fantasy, from comedy to thrillers, etc. But on a bad movie, is impossible to disconnect from reality. Which is what happens in this movie.This movie is fine and funny until we see that sad Walrus costume -Power Rangers had better costumes-, after you see that, you have no other choice to ask yourself, why I'm watching this?You could argue that the crappy costume was intentional -which I do believe-, but the tone change on the movie -from comedy to grotesque suspense- push you out from the dramatic universe of the film, shutting down your disbelief and had you thinking; ""That costume doesn't produce chills, neither is funny"" Which at the end of the day, achieving that mixture was the main -failed- goal of the director.",Tusk
315,marioman18,One of the weirdest movies you'll see all year.,8,24 September 2014,"When I first heard about this movie I was a little skeptical. I couldn't see how sewing a man into a walrus ""suit"" would make for a good movie. To my surprise the concept actually works in a sick and disgusting kind of way. The movie is sprinkled with Kevin Smiths humor in a lot of parts (especially with parts containing Johnny Depp), and it adds a nice relaxing moments from the sheer cringe worthy visuals. Michael Parks gives an outstanding performance, while Justin Long just screams and makes penis jokes for 60% of the movie. It's funny because when something horrible like this happens to a main character the audience is supposed to feel bad for the character and hope he makes it out of the situation alive. With this movie, Justin Long is such a massive d*ck head that I was actually excited to see him turn into a disgusting abomination. the movie is a fun weird ride that you will be talking about after you see it. If there's nothing you want to see and are looking for a weird an interesting movie experience, Tusk is the movie for you.

With a plot so ludicrous my head just refused to stop watching.

318,collinsmcrae,Nice job Kevin Smith,10,3 January 2015,"As a fan of Kevin Smith, the man, his Podcast work, and his movies, my opinion may be biased. I also got to listen in on Tusks development via Smodcast, from its weed induced inception up through to it's production and release, so again my opinion is biased. And though I still believe that I would have loved this film had I not been a fan of Smodcast, and had I not been listening in when Mr. tusk was birthed, I am grateful that I got to view the film from that perspective, and that I got to be one of the people for whom this film was made- #WalrusYes!Pros:1) The film was genuinely terrifying in places. Even with prior knowledge of what was going to happen, it still managed to shock and frighten me. 2) Michael Parks was incredible and absolutely terrifying. But he did have good help from these next two points.3) Howard Howell is a great character. Archetypal for sure, but still and expertly crafted character. 4) Thew writing was great, particularly Howard Howell's monologues. 5) Johnny Depp puts in his best work in years in this low budget Kevin Smith movie. Really impressive character work. 6) Kevin Smith is often dismissed as a less than artful filmmaker, but he has proved otherwise to me with his last two films. There is some really great artistry going on in this flick. The score, the sets, the look and feel, the artistic images (such as the last shot). The cons1) If you're not in to this screwy horror stuff, then I don't know why you would watch this movie and then review it, stating that this isn't your cup of tea. If you are one of those people, then stay away from this movie, and if you do watch it, note that nobody cares about your opinion on the matter. 2) Some of the jokes fell a bit flat for me, and the characters Podcast didn't seem very authentic to me. It came across more like morning zoo radio than a pod-cast. They were laughing much to hard at some things that really weren't that funny. 3) Wallaces pod-cast co-host, and girlfriend, were highly forgettable, underdeveloped side characters. But who cares. 4) The ending didn't seem like the best way to handle the situation.In conclusion, the movie is cool if you are.",Tusk

As Kevin Smith himself said, when he and his bro-dudes called something ""Totally eff'd up!"" that was the highest praise. I second that! Creepy and hilarious. I cringed at the same time I was laughing. OK, there were places where only cringes happened. I just couldn't stand the thought of Justin Long eating raw fish! It looked like he was really eating actual raw fish! Hilarious to you, perhaps, but my stomach disagrees! Urk! I have never seen a movie like this in my life. And I've been watching movies for around 55 years. No movie has ever reached this level of straight-out bizarre without using a huge dose of surrealism. Which this movie does not have. It's played as real life, which is what makes it so creepily eff'd up!",Tusk

I felt disgusted when I found out he was mutilating Wallace and changing him into a walrus. The movie is too graphic for a comedy. The parts where they showed us the severed leg, then the skin and the stitched up walrus were very annoying. A cheap funny movie and even though I realizing they were trying to prove a point, I didn't feel the idea of the difference between humans and animals worth making this movie. Trying to push comedy into a gore horror movie is generally a bad idea.",Tusk

322,Torontoronto,Walrushed,7,3 October 2014,"I was very excited to see this movie after hearing the premise. Man turned into a walrus. What's not to be intrigued about? I was also a bit upset that it wasn't released in Canada after being released in the US (especially for a film set in Canada). I caught a late screening of Tusk tonight at Yonge and Dundas (The only theater playing it in Toronto for my fellow Torontonians). After building up anticipation for this movie because of its limited release I can say that I was not really impressed. My first ""issue"" with the movie is that there really is very little character development. Each character has a monologue to ""explain"" their character. The screen time seems to be split evenly amongst all the characters. That being said I didn't ""feel"" anything while Wallace was undergoing his transformation. I saw a lot of people on here say that this film was disturbing and it stuck with them after. Apart from Wallace looking grotesque as a human-walrus I didn't really have much to say to my girlfriend when we walked out of the theater except ""that was kind of gross eh"". For those of you expecting gory scenes or excessive body horror Justin Long only has about 15 minutes of screen-time as a walrus.The story itself has good pacing and the dark humour was funny in the movie. You can tell it's a Kevin Smith film. A few of the flashback sequences seem to be out of place but they do add a bit of depth to the story.Johnny Depp was the saving grace in this film for me. He had an excellent portrayal of Guy Lapointe and I would actually like to see a lot more of this character. I found a particular flashback scene with Howard Howes very funny and his one-liners and jokes were great. Overall this movie felt a bit rushed and in the end was very forgettable. I feel like they could have done a lot more with this concept even if it is the same regurgitated kidnapping body mutilation plot we have seen before. Especially with the character of Guy Lapointe. Worth checking out if the synopsis intrigues you. If not you aren't missing a whole lot. 6/10",Tusk

324,jonathanbarnes01,#WalrusYes,10,19 September 2014,Tusk is classic Kevin Smith as always. Big Kev does an excellent job at keeping you on your toes and you never know whats going to be around the corner. Tusk has you questioning what is going to happen next just like in his previous horror movie Red State. Justin Long did an excellent job in this movie and kept it interesting. Kevins screen writing and directing shows you he is not afraid to go out of his comfort zone and deliver an off the wall movie and he does just that in Tusk. It's not for everyone but its a movie that you must understand Kevin Smith and his personality to truly enjoy Tusk. The movie grabs your attention at the beginning. The middle gives you a back ground and tells the plot. The end gives you a tear jerker and appreciate the brilliance of Kevin and his writing. Can not wait to see what movies he does next. #Walrusyes #Tusk #Idontwanttodieincanada,Tusk

The plot sounds nice, the acting looked good, and the reviews where... lets skip that part...The plot is there's two podcasters, one is afraid of flying SO, one of the two goes overseas, to interview weird people. SPOILER Beginning!!! He finds a video of a kid playing with a sword, and cuts his leg off. He goes over to the house in Canada, turns out the kid killed himself with it. SPOILER ENDS!!!!! He is still in canada, not knowing what to do so he goes to a pub, goes to the bathroom and sees a advertisement on the wall, basicaly saying ""I have lived a adventful life, i will share my home and stories for those who are willing. So the podcaster goes over there. SPOILER FOR THE REST OF THE REVIEW!!! The guy drugs the podcaster, cuts his leg off, then turns him into a ""walrus"" and names him ""Tusk"". The suit isn't disturbing, but the faint of heart might get scared. The permanent ""walrus suit"" has faces, noses, ears and others skin on it. The ending will make some cry *not due to scary scenes, but emotional loss and feeling sorry for the guy*.

Sure, it's not for everyone, but sometimes I just want to switched off and be entertained, this movie does that and then some. Michael Parks is just fabulous and Justin Long (who I have a huge crush on) is also excellent. However, Mr.Depp's cameo is solid gold it adds so much to the film that it just needed. This film isn't really trying to scare you, but it creates a good sense of dread and helplessness that horror films so desperately need.

329,martina4100,Weird but effective,6,2 January 2015,"Well, it is difficult to put in to words what effect this film has had on me. It is certainly not your average film; in fact, I have watched many movies in my time but never have I watched anything like 'Tusk'.The film follows Wallace Bryton played by Justin Long who is a pod-caster seeking a story for his online show. The synopsis on IMDb provides all the information required to provide an outline of the plot so no need to go in to any more detail other than to say it is literally based on a man who is turned in to a walrus. It sounds weird and it is. By far the strangest film I have ever seen and the most original which is what warrants my 6 rating.In my opinion, the acting is in the main very good and all actors fit well in their roles. Justin Long is particularly good. The remaining actors, Johnny Depp included, maintain the quirkiness of the movie. That said, some may see the acting as poor. However, in my opinion that is intentional to contribute towards the originality of the movie. That may sound strange but hopefully you will see where I'm coming from when you watch it. I have thought long and hard about whether there is any film to compare it to and really there isn't. I watched it a few months ago and some scenes still haunt me, not that they are terrifying, but they initiate thoughts that I'm sure any person would not contemplate which is an achievement in itself.A friend asked me whether it is worth watching and I couldn't decide whether to answer yes or no. Why? Well, there are lots of things to dislike in this film; the plot is strange; it is completely unfathomable and I can't say I particularly enjoyed watching it. Nonetheless, it is a film that will linger in my mind for years to come and for that reason it has to be seen.Genre: Weird horror. Not scary but sort of a delayed shock effect. Comedy is not laugh out loud but the humour is within the characters if that makes sense. I wouldn't call it a drama. Acting: Intentionally quirky but effective. Script: Weird. Enough said.",Tusk
330,catofnimes,You'll find yourself saying 'What am I watching' more than once,7,19 March 2015,"SPOILER: Well what can I say, Tusk is a film of it's own. The premise of the film is Justin Long being turned into a patch- work walrus. It is a hit or miss film, you either love it or hate it.Justin Longs acting in this film is great, but the film had a lot of jumping around and doesn't feel fluid with it's character arcs. It aims to be a dark comedy and I did find myself chuckling at some parts in the film, I equally found myself saying 'What am I watching' just as often. There isn't really much character development in the movie, but you do grow attached to Justin Longs character by the end of the film. The actual walrus when you see it is slightly disturbing.I genuinely felt slightly upset at the end of the film, but I felt as though the film could have been written better. If there was a more fluid feel to the scenes, and more development on the characters then this film would be getting better ratings. The overall story is original, the acting is great, but as a final product it feels very rushed and choppy. I enjoyed tusk and think that it is underrated and being played off as 'too weird'Yes, it's a weird film but it's trying to be different and is a nice change of pace from most horror films these days. If you want a film that will make you genuinely say 'WTF' at the end, tusk is for you. If you're going into this film expecting a good horror film, you're going to be disappointed.",Tusk
331,hannahharris555,Sick and Twisted.,1,1 June 2015,"I went and bought ""Tusk"" after watching a generally promising trailer of it on the internet. I enjoy both thriller and horror so I thought it would be good to watch. In my opinion it turned out to be a very bad idea. I started it feeling like the money I paid to watch ""Tusk"" was worth something. I ended the movie feeling horrified, nauseous and scarred for life. Most of the time horror-comedy is a good blend of genre, however the ""comedic relief"" they used was probably the main cause of my nausea. The main character Wallace Bryton (played by Justin Long) was in genuine danger. However it seemed as though the movie focused on his cheating girlfriend and best friend as they halfheartedly searched for him, only to lock him up like some kind of zoo animal and never look back. I was disappointed with how the film ended. Surely they could have done something, anything, in order to help Wallace reclaim what he could of his life after his traumatic ordeal.

I thought Depp played his role well, although a little annoying with the nuances of the character, and what I never clearly understood was if there was a serial killer in Canada, with the details Depp went on with, then why didn't the Manitoba Police know about these previous cases, or take the situation more seriously, with the recent coincidence of the call from Depp seriously?

Don't get me wrong, the movie delivered on its premise, but it also shocked me in the wrong way. I rarely get offended by a movie, but this one did manage to make me want to stop watching as soon as the character Guy Lapointe appeared at about 2/3 of the movie.Tu put it simply, this movie is simply bad. It's neither fun nor funny, scary, horrifying or sad. In fact, the only emotion one gets after watching this is the feeling of loss; time you've wasted and can never gain back.Kevin Smith takes a few jabs at Québec and Manitoba, mostly at the french-speaking province, but the Johnny Depp impersonation of a Quebecker is so far from the real thing that it's like watching a dog with a foam shark-fin attached on his back and calling it a great white shark.The scenario is bad enough, but the acting is simply horrible. Long should probably keep doing comedies or at least try. Osmont is as bad as ever since he's grown up and the main character, Howard Howe, is bland and unimaginative. This villain is nothing new in the ""let's try to be weird"" realm. Déjà-vu.The ending is ridiculous, the costume makes no sense and it would have been used as evidence in an investigation rather than being left for (at least) a year on Wallace after he decided (we assume) to remain a walrus.

It gets really dark in places and at some points you could be forgiven for believing that it was real life. The acting was up to the standard which you expect from a film which has a budget of this size. The main criticism I would have of the film though is the mediocre sex scene and I really think they should have had real sex in order to make this seem as real as the rest of the film. If I could add anything, it would be that the walrus had crazy walrus sex and that may involve being with a human. All in all though, a real blast for the whole family.",Tusk

It outbalanced any of the dark elements the film had. The jokes are just not funny, like something middle schoolers would laugh and joke about. Giving it 5 stars for the 2-3 scenes that were a little nasty. If you're into ""bad"" movies it's definitely a fun one to watch though.",Tusk
347,coldoatmeal,"Revolting, Tragic, Surreal, and Bloody Beautiful",9,19 October 2019,"To be put into short words, this movie was horrific...in all the best ways.The seemingly hollowed and cheesed characters, the abrupt thematic and emotional shifts, the uncannily philosophical lashes on occasion, and the genuinely feverish antics that overcast the entirety of the film. This movie with mess with your head, yet make you to enjoy every second of it.Kevin Smith is able to drag the viewer down into the twisted, satirical ride of faux horror-comedy, and estranged occult madness. He does this while simultaneously producing a work that can snag the mind of the viewer, and shove it into a boiling pot of surreal mental disturbance, only to take it back out and sugar coat it with beautiful humor, drama, and amounts of sarcastic tone.The acting held by Justin Long was nothing short of an impressive surprise, casting forth rich humanizing emotion past his previously crude and apathetic self, as the mind of Wallace can be seen to deteriorate piece by piece through his torment. These factors are only amplified with the addition of Michael Park's outstanding performances. Himself being able to show Howard's intentions devolve, and have his dark past unfolded before the viewer in a sick concoction of memoir and nightmare.Overall, this movie is surprising, to say the least. I can guarantee you it is not perfect (and can also safely say you will not like yourself for watching it either). Yet, those flaws are highly outweighed by the obscure genius that lies in the ribald depths of this film's loudmouthed, contorted plot. From the raw characters, the tongue-in-cheek humor, the sickening effects, and almost completely convincing lore, Tusk is a revolting mind-game of b-horror that can't wait to drag you in.",Tusk

349,lukasdahliin,No movie for the weak-hearted!,6,2 August 2021,"I remember watching this movie a few years ago and it's been in my mind ever since. It's about a podcaster who lives in LA going to Canada for an interview with an internetphenomenon who went viral for accidentally cutting off his leg. When he arrives he gets the news that the boy had killed himself. Him being bummed off about not getting a story he finds a note in the toilets of a bar written by an old man saying that he's lived a long life with great adventures and offers housing in exchange for simple tasks around the house. The podcaster then goes to his place and everything takes a REALLY dark turn. He gets drugged by the old man whilst listening to his stories and wakes up with only one leg. Eventually he gets the form of a walrus after being operated on by the old man. Waking up in a cold dark cellar with a pool of water surrounding him. All this whilst his girlfriend and co-podcaster are desperately looking for him. His two ""friends"" eventually meet a private detective played by Johnny Depp who is looking for this old man who has apparently tried to make humans into walruses several times. Unfortunately this movie doesn't have a happy ending where he is trapped in a zoo without being able to tell anyone he's actually human.Overall i found this movie quite entertaining yet extremely disturbing with several stomach turning scenes.

358,jonjx,Stoner comedy horror. Quit over-analyzing.,9,16 January 2015,"For anyone who complained about this movie, take a second to stop and think about the premise. Kevin Smith, notorious comedian stoner type, hosts a pod-cast in which he reads an ad for somebody seeking ""walrus fun"". He laughs about it on his show several times, ultimately forming the plot for a silly horror movie. He draws from the Human Centipede, but decides that he wants to make it absurd. And irreverent towards Canadians. And bring in the Apple-commercial guy. And Johnny Depp. And some great actor you will long remember but had to look up his name again (Michael Parks. Michael Parks was awesome.). Then, he drew you in with a truly light hearted, endearing relationship story line. Some a**hole humor. A strange set of circumstances. Then, something truly horrible. A blend of Misery-meets-a-freak-show. But, when you put it all in the blender and add a great big dose of sketchy walrus-island crap, somehow it comes out into something so outlandish and strange, it is amazingly funny and genius. Sure, it is gross. But that is kind of the point. Personally, I think Kevin Smith has made a horror film that achieves a new standard for gore with comedy. All the better that it wanders like a stoner's mind. It makes it that much more silly and over the top. Heck, get stoned and try it. It was just fine sober. The acting was, quite honestly, top shelf for this kind of sideshow. Great stuff. Don't let the other over-analyzers with a need for ""Rob Zombie or bust"" horror scare you away. If this is for you, you will love it. And Michael Parks is amazing. Especially in his bit out in a cabin in the woods!",Tusk

I won't even think of discussing any of the content of this film. Tusk is simple too horrible. I would never want to give any life to this abomination by talking about its content.

The whole time you are watching you don't know whether to be freaked out or laugh. If going to see a movie different from the normal mainstream movies we are all used to isn't enough to sell you on it then the performance put together by Michael Parks will. He hasn't don much in recent years except for work with Smith on Red State and Tusk, but he is a master at his craft.

I have never posted a review before, but I thought ""Tusk"" was worth it because of all the reviews I've seen that I think are way too harsh and negative. I'll be fair, I don't consider Kevin Smith is a genius and I don't think this movie is even close from a masterpiece but frankly I don't understand some comments on the film that seem so full of unreasonable despise. I can understand how some people might have been disappointed when they entered the movie hoping for an actual comedy, but if you can get past the fact that this film is not really a comedy I think some will find this is a really great horror movie. Overall, the acting is not amazing (except for the creepy Michael Parks and a sometimes disturbing Justin Long)but it does the trick and it's more than enough to give you the shivers sometimes. The writing is also pretty clumsy but that's OK because it's also enough to tell you what you need to know to enjoy the ride that is a disgusting, enervating and disturbing one, but also really funny. I won't talk about the story because the less you know the better. All I can say is that I really believe that at least anyone who likes horror movies (from the classics ""The Last House On The Left"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"", to the more contemporary ""Saw"" or even ""A Serbian Film"") will have to love this film for all it's gory moments, crazy storyline, disgusting makeups and all the things that make so many people love a cult horror movie.

His last 3 movies are mediocre at best and complete shite for two of them. I liked the indie geeky comedy vulgar feel of his early work, but after 2 decades, it's now safe to say, he's completely lost himself and should have stopped making movies like he said he would...I don't have a lot to say about this movie, I'm more disappointed about the evolution of his film career than anything else.

364,werecoolmodder,A Great COMEDY,6,19 September 2014,"Before anyone says this film was terrible, please understand that it is purely a comedy. The horror genre is the last of the three genres on the page.THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.TUSK is essentially a satire of tragic monster stories such as David Cronenberg's The Fly or Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Justin Long plays Wallace Bryton, a sleazy pod-cast host who benefits off of interviewing weirdos and mocking them. In retrospect, no one should ever deserve to be physically and mentally tortured into becoming a walrus, but this guy comes pretty close. He meets Howard Howe, played by Michael Parks, Howe is an interesting character who drugs him and imprisons Bryton in his home.For the first half of the film, it is almost a satire of Stephen King's Misery. Howe is very reminiscent of Annie Wilkes. He lies and lies, telling Bryton that he passed out because a brown recluse spider bit him. Occasionally, when Bryton cries out in pain or terror, Howe mocks him. He does this in the most bizarre manner that one can see his insanity but also finds humor in the situation.At no point in this film is everything taken completely seriously. There are occasional serious moments, but they deal with relationship and friendship issues. These are not the greatest issue in the whole scheme of the film. By the end, Wallace Bryton has become a human-walrus. There is a bizarre scene where Howe serenades Bryton while cuddling with him in the pool. Howe eventually dresses up in his own walrus costume, although this one is temporary. He tells Bryton that the only way he will be able to live is to defeat him in a walrus fight. Bryton's will to live is too strong and he kills Howe with his tusks. This destroys Bryton's psychosis and he becomes trapped in the state of mind that he is a walrus.Just writing this down sounds insane and there's nothing horrific about the film other than the fact that a man is being tortured by a psychopath. That entire situation of terror, however, is overshadowed by the fact that it's a WALRUS. In the end credits, the music fades out to play a portion of the pod-cast where Kevin Smith developed the idea for the film. He is laughing constantly throughout the entire thing. He knows how stupid it is and he wants to make a mockery of all the tragic monster stories.If you want to see a bizarre comedy that will make you feel as if you may have entered a new plane of existence or you have been drugged, see TUSK.",Tusk

366,rdwoolf,Did I need to be high first?,4,23 September 2014,"As a longtime Kevin Smith fan (movies, comics, TV, appearances and podcasts), I was expecting to really enjoy this film. Especially after seeing the fantastic trailer. It led me to believe Tusk was a psychological thriller. Which is exactly what it is for the first half of the film (once you get past the terrible ""Not-See Party"" puns that litter the entire film). But then Johnny Depp...uh...Guy LaPointe sidetracks the entire film with his distracting Inspector Clouseau wannabe character. I had to wonder, if this is Kevin Smith's tribute to Canada to show them how much he loves them, why did he not cast Canadian actors to play those parts? Instead I saw Americans doing Canadian accents very poorly. It was too distracting and put a slam to any horror vibe that had been built up to this point.I guess I would not have minded the horror/thriller film also being a comedy as that genre has been done well in the past (e.g., An American Werewolf in London). But I did not find any of the jokes to be funny. In fact, nobody in the theater I was in laughed even once. Does one have to be stoned to think this is funny? I suspect so. Which is too bad. I have never had this problem with a Kevin Smith film before.I really liked the premise of Tusk and wished it had stayed the psychological thriller that the trailer had promised. Like Red State, I think I could have loved Tusk if it had stayed true to the genre instead of getting sidetracked.I would like to see an alternate version when the film is released to Blu-Ray that cuts out the attempts at humor and 90% of the parts where they are looking for Wallace and instead just go directly to the final scenes at the house where the two main characters are sparring. And then I'd leave in the same ending, which was good. This version would be about 60-90 minutes long.Despite my overall disappointment in Tusk, I am happy that a strange and unique idea like this was able to be made. Especially since it got its start with a goofy advertisement. And I am still looking forward to seeing Yoga Hosers, Kevin Smith's next film, which is also set in Canada with the same actors. But I will probably wait for it to hit Netflix rather than see it in the theaters.",Tusk
367,AlexisKilgannon,I fell in love with going full Walrus.,10,30 September 2014,"Honestly, I went into this movie praying it wasn't going to disappoint me. I had read numerous reviews on how terrible it was and how the acting was less than appealing-but thank you Kevin Smith for not letting me down.This movie reminded me of my beloved B-Horror films, but with tremendously better acting. I cannot see how anyone can step into this film and take it one hundred percent seriously. I don't think it was ever meant to be taken seriously, which is the true beauty of this film.Michael Parks did one of the best renditions of a psychopath I have ever seen. He was creepily silly and the passion he expressed for his human-walrus was believable. That was where the true terror submerged in the film, for me at least.Johnny Depp isn't one of my all time favorite actors, but I have never seen him take an epic fail in a film. This film was no different, he nailed his part and really was almost unrecognizable due to how different his character was in previous films. I enjoyed his fun personality and need for truth.Justin Long surprised me and I cannot stress that enough. His blood, sweat, and tears shined bright in this movie.Overall, I found this movie to be quite scary- but scary in a whole new sense of the word. This is definitely what I would refer to as a dark comedy/B-horror film. If this film were to be looked at from a humorous and perspective, I think many more people would appreciate it for what it is. It's nothing short of a brilliant horror film with hidden pod cast gems.",Tusk

Tusk was born and finally we can see this amazing movie. It is made for Kevin Smith fans and honestly I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wasn't (although I still think I would). The whole movie keeps you entranced and wanting to know what happens next through its twisted atmosphere. You can really tell the love that smith had put into this film an it is so much fun to see the ideas himself and Scott Moiser can up with on the screen. You will be laughing the whole way through (you probably shouldn't but you will).

379,honey424,Worth watching,7,20 April 2015,"This was not as bad as people have said it was. It's an odd kind of movie and may not be everyone's cup of tea. From the trailer, you can pretty much guess what's going to happen. Wallace (Justin Long) character is a jerk. For a pod-cast, he and Haley Joel Osmond delight in humiliating others (in this case, one man in Canada). He goes to Canada to interview this man when it ""falls through"". After reading an interesting tale on the wall of a bathroom, he finds Mr. Howard Howe and things pretty much go south from there. To Mr. Howe's credit, he has had an incredible life with even more incredible stories.Truthfully, Wallace (Justin Long 's character) gets what he deserves. He's just a horrible person who takes delight in berating and embarrassing others. No human being should take delight in intentionally hurting others. The crux of this movie,, in my opinion, looks at the difference between humans and animals and the will to survive. Mr. Howe (Michael Parks) is an interesting character, having been brutalized in an orphanage between the ages of 10-15 and then the boating accident. It's possible he did not want another Mr. Tusk, but to make someone feel as bad as he does or share in his pain. However, Mr. Howe is inhuman and has completely lost touch with reality. Mr.Howe is no animal, but something far worse, as animals kill to protect themselves, there young, or to eat. Is it possible that Wallace needed to find his humanity this way (the last 5 minutes of the movie shows this) and did Mr. Howe, in sadistic way, need someone to shift his pain onto all the while losing his own humanity??? I know...kinda deep!!!The movie has its quirky parts (the walrus fight) and Johnny Depp is fabulous. Again, this movie is not for everyone. The last 5 minutes of the movie was deeper than I thought Kevin Smith could go...at least I took the meaning deeper. It's not a horrible film. It's odd and creepy, but it wasn't bad.",Tusk

But I have to admit, I was disappointed - it wasn't anywhere near as good as I'd hoped it would be.While the horror element was definitely there, I felt the humour didn't quite match up. Yes it was funny, but it could have been a lot funnier (though I might have felt this way because I was more annoyed than amused by a certain cop character...).It was also a little too long. There were some scenes that could have been trimmed down or cut altogether, and that lost it a star for me.I know a lot of people have said you either love or hate this film, but I'm sitting in the middle of the road, leaning towards ""love"" because there was so much of this that worked -- the acting, the script, the cinematography, the subtlety of some of the jokes.

383,bblasic,Horror meets Comedy in an amazing way,9,9 October 2014,"Wallace Brighton (Justin Long) is a character you love to hate and Howard Howe (Michael Parks) is fantastically terrifying and hilarious at the same time. This movie is full of horrifying and cringe-inducing visuals that will also leave you laughing. The film is a brilliant mash-up of horror and comedy that will only leave you wanting more (which is good, as Kevin Smith's ""Canada Trilogy"" is just getting started). All of the clever, subtle jokes and touches juxtaposed with the humor of the characters become exceptionally funny. Michael Parks gives a performance that is both hilarious and incredibly creepy and unsettling. Even though Justin Long's character deserves what's coming to him, you can't help but feel bad (and laugh) as he screams and cries like a walrus or is forced to eat a raw fish. This movie is a better horror film than most that have already or will be coming out during this years Halloween line up, and it was a lot funnier than most of this year comedies. All together, it was definitely one of the most fun movies I have seen this year.If you like horror, comedy, drama, weird and creepy imagery, and weird movies that leave you feeling odd, but satisfied, I highly recommend this movie.",Tusk

I trusted him but, boy, was I wrong to trust my friend on this one.While watching the movie I couldn't bare the lame jokes and the mix of horror and comedy which made movie awfully grotesque and disturbing to watch. This movie wasn't funny or scary it was plainly disgusting and sickening. Although, I feel that some people enjoyed this movie much more than I did, (from the observation of couple of laughs here and there) all of my friends were upset that we wasted our time watching this dreadful movie. Overall, I feel bad for even contributing to this movie the money I paid for the ticket. Worst movie I have seen in a long time.",Tusk

Honestly Johnny Depp was superb. Michael Parks was also excellent. I went into this movie thinking it was going to be terrible and I would turn it off 1/3 of the way through. NO. That didn't happen. If you like horror (house of a 1000 corpses, human centipede) & weird dark comedies.. well this film is for you. I mean the acting wasn't breathtaking, and the plot was ridiculous, but it came together magically. Great job. By the way I know this is Kevin Smith movie, and really I don't care for Kevin Smith too much (sorry just being honest), but he really outdid himself this time.

Not in my opinion anyway, and I know everyone is entitled to their own. Yes, there were several points in the movie that were quite disappointing (the end, for example), but also some that were incredibly interesting. Especially the scenes between Justin Long and Michael Parks. There were a few times when the tension was so thick I thought I was suffocating a little. In all honesty, I'm very intrigued (and terrified) by the whole plot of this movie. Serial killer? Awesome. Survival of the fittest? Why not. Cool, although slightly lacking, back story? Can't hurt.The whole premise of this film is very interesting and probably could have done better if it were in someone else's hands, but alas, that was not the case. I'm just glad a movie was made that wasn't your typical serial killer/kidnapped drama like I see in most movies and TV shows now a days.

The truth is the flick is both and Kevin Smith has done something I have never seen before.When quirky mean-spirited pod caster Wallace Brighton (Justin Long) journeys to Canada to interview weird and wacky people not all is as he expects as this movie proves that not all Canadians are nice.Howard Howe is hands down the best character I have watched in a while and its not surprising when he is played by Michael Parks. Howe is in love with his stories but after a while you begin to wonder if they are even real.Parks shifts from funny to terrifying to just plain weird will stay with you long after the film ends. He also happens to be immensely quotable in this flick ""are you really mourning your humanity,I don't understand! Who in the hell would want to be human"" or ""We must discover if man is truly a walrus at heart"" stayed with me long after the credits rolled.Look I can't really review this movie without giving to much away, its a flick about a guy who turns the apple guy into a walrus.

The film may have done poorly in the states, but I think it would have thrived here. Onto the point. This film is what it promises to be. One of the best produced B-grade horror movies I have ever seen. Although it doesn't ever really scare, it does get quite creepy, and on occasion it is pretty damn funny too. I don't know how you can give a bad review to this film. If you walk into the cinema understanding that the central premise of this film is about a man being hacked into a Walrus, you are either going to love it, or you were secretly hoping that it wasn't a film about a guy getting hacked into a Walrus.While this film may not have made its money in cinemas, it is going to be regarded as a cult classic if ever there was one.

However, after a certain point very early on, the movie stops being scary, and becomes extremely difficult to take seriously. It wasn't even so bad that it was funny, it was just absolutely terrible. This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, which is a hard thing for me to say, since I'm a fan of many of Kevin Smith's movies. Save yourself the trouble and watch a different movie.

Characters had depth, characters had emotions.Tusk didn't let us down with a few nutty characters but the premise was to stay focused on the plot and that he did.Tusk is different and its a great film, if you go into it hoping for another Clerks, you are going to be extremely disappointed.

That said, it was the best part about Mike Smith's attempt at horror. The laughs are non-existent until the mid-way point. Up until then, we have a none too vague attempt at ""Boxing Helena"" style catch and control. Michael Parks' turn as the quack with adolescent trauma issues manifesting in serial killer play maker is arguably the best performance in the picture. I found Guy LaPoint's turn as the reincarnation of Peter Falk circa Columbo to be too ham-fisted in attempting comedy. The problem I have, and maybe others will have with this film is this: If you want to be a horror movie then bring the originality of ideas with ingenious builds of suspense, or, If you want to be a comedy, then make the comedy clever and relative. This film was trying to be both (or maybe neither) which leaves it in a world equally as interesting. Next!",Tusk

I didn't laugh at this movie, I didn't cringe from being grossed out, I didn't shrink in fear. All I can say is that I watched it. It's almost as though I just had a great practical joke played on me, only I didn't get the punch line. It's like this was made because it could be made. That being said, it is more than I could do, but it saddens me to see any currency that Kevin Smith had was spent on this. It truly feels like it was made for Kevin Smith, his friends, and his die hard fans, which is great if you are in one of those categories. I thought I was indeed one of those fans, but I might have to rethink that. It's not that I hated it, or it was the worst thing I have ever seen. (Anyone who grew up on 80's TV has seen so much worse) I am not knocking you Kevin, I love ya. I saw all the other movies, DVDs, read your book Tough SH&T (which was very moving BTW) but I honestly feel like I missed something here. I was hoping for more of what you have put into those other ventures put into this one.

The very start of this film was, I thought, a gag but turns out to be real. Horrible special effects right off the bat. There are supposed to be subtle jokes about Canadians but I experienced none. The writing is awful and the directing goes far beyond even being called sub-par. What has happened to Kevin Smith? From a Jersey boy to this. It is sad, to say the very least.

Scary, sick, disturbing , funny, twists, and get this, actors that actually did there jobs! Justin Long shows fear, TRUE fear better than most A list actors are capable of. Not to mention the writing, the goal of a good horror is to transport the viewer into the movie and make them live what's happening knowing the decisions of the characters are the same ones we would make if we were in the same situations. And no cheats like most horror movies fall back on (eg every one that the character is running full tilt and must be in the clear only to run straight into the killer) This truly is a feast for the senses and long after it's over you'll be dwelling on what you just witnessed...

Johnny Depp makes sure to remind the viewers that he likes to be strange, the conversation between Depp's character and Parks seems like they are ad libbing and trying to one up each other with each line to see who could say the strangest thing.The movie is basically a joke on the viewer. One of those, you had to be there, types of things that was probably funny for a few minutes. I see that the whole movie took only 15 days. I am not surprised because I think if they had taken any longer they would have realized that maybe it wasn't such a good idea.I'm sure people who like the movie probably like it more because of reviews like this and how I just don't ""get it"". I get it, you took a funny ad, made fun of it, had some viewers say that it would be funny if it was a movie, then had fun making a horrible movie.

Knowing not many other people I know would be willing to see this movie I took it upon myself to go watch it alone and I was disappointed. The acting in the movie was very good and for the most part every cast member put on great performances.The beginning of the movie seem to be okay, but once it moves to Canada that is where it seems to go downhill (not immediately, but slowly). The back and forth of Wallace & Ally just didn't feel well written and The mixture of horror & comedy just seemed like it missed, with jokes coming at the wrong times and not hitting their marks. The scene with Ally talking to the camera was just way too predictable, but yet felt rushed filler. It didn't show much and didn't really go anywhere after that. If they didn't have the scene that explained them being together, it wouldn't have changed anything in the movie. Teddy is still Wallace's friend & partner, Ally is still his girlfriend so, they still probably went together to go find him. After they decided to go find Wallace, that is where it starts feeling very rushed, like they weren't really too sure where they could go with it and just needed the ending from their smodcast. I normally like Kevin Smith movies and always go into them with an open mind, but this one just felt like they had trouble stretching the concept into a full length feature movie without knowing which direction they wanted to go, while changing their minds halfway through filming. I will give this a 3 star rating though, because there are a few saving points, but not enough to keep the movie afloat. Once again the acting is pretty much great across the board, the soundtrack is decent, the angles of the film are nice, but sometimes predictable. The effects are a little cheesy, but work for the most part.",Tusk

It's not torture porn more is overly graphic but rather I found it to be a piece filled with irony and allegorical humor aimed at the overly egotistical audience that makes up America. If you can't see the genius in the irony in this film you need to watch it again and give Smith a break. It was a good movie, not a classic but I gave it an 8 to help balance out the IMDb score because it seems there's just a lot of crap talking haters on here. But really it was a solid 7.7.

This movie is obviously a pretty vane attempt on behalf of Kevin Smith to take the p*ss out of the movie going public. Storyline is lame at best, either trying hard to be like Human Centipede or making parody of it, i can't work out which.Of course with films by Smith you would expect a lot of witty banter amongst the characters and this has it in spades, that is if you like the low brow dick joke type humor. The bad Canadian jokes just made things worse, i should have known to turn it off at this point, but no i persevered. Justin Long is as you would expect, but only worse, its as if he turned the douche dial up to 500. The best thing about this steaming pile of turd is the character of Howard Howe. This actor performed admirably however probably shouldn't have signed up for this cr*p.So by now you probably already now that Long gets turned into a walrus. I knew that before i watched it and must have had a brain fart because i went ahead with it anyway. I regret it know but the only saving grace is that I turned it off as soon as Johnny Depp made an appearance, not because of him but because i couldn't take it anymore. I'm guessing that the last 40 minutes or so wasn't an improvement on what I have already seen. I don't know if this is supposed to have some kind of deep arty metaphorical undertone, maybe I'm missing something?

415,hollybishop09,I Wish I Could Unsee This Film...,1,29 January 2015,"There are few films that I dislike to such an extent where I would actually pay a considerable price for a crazy scientist to lobotomise the part of my brain which remembers it. Tusk is one.But in the interest of being 'fair' I'll begin with the positives. Sorry, positive. The acting, in majority, is OK. (Johnny Depp, I presume, can only have agreed to partake as a joke or because he actually doesn't care about his reputation anymore).Right, now the pleasantries are to one side I can continue. So think of Human Centipede. Gross right? Crass? Tusk is a whole new level of vile. Don't believe the tempting notion that this is based on a true story, supposedly Kevin Smith and his mate where discussing a Gumtree add which advertised free living if the lodger agreed to dress as a walrus...The thing that irritated me the most about this film, aside from the insanely non-funny comedic elements and special effects that look as though the production company allowed the intern free-rein of the art room, is the ending. I won't ruin it, anyone who sits through the entirety of the film without throwing up or crying or trying to scratch their eyes out will need to see it in order to confirm how ridiculous and awful it really is (honestly).All in all I'm not sure whether I really 'get' what this film is meant to represent. And by this I simply mean that maybe I'm not weird enough to appreciate it.",Tusk

I'm surprised by how little I really watched of this movie, yet still was able to fully understand what was going on just by glancing at the screen every once and a while. I regretfully have said I've seen this film and I leave this with readers:Only one thing worth seeing this movie for: -the wonderful Johnny Depp--however, he was only in 1/24th of the movie.

417,charlieelbaba,Best movie I've seen in a while,9,13 February 2015,"I won't lie, a large portion of people won't like this movie. It has a slow pace, weird dialogue and an unconventional plot. Aside from this, however, the humour is wicked and dark, for those who get it it will soon be one of your favourite movies. If you're the kind of person who loved the comedy/horror style of House of 1000 Corpses you could find yourself laughing out loud at the characters and situations in this film.I would recommend seeing it, but don't go in with expectations of classic horror plots or slapstick humour. The cast are excellent, the production value is top notch and the easter eggs in this movie are really great if you've been a tusk fan before production even started.",Tusk
418,sparrowfox,Awful. Avoid at all costs.,1,17 February 2015,"I love horror films. I even love bad horror films. This is so bad that I wish I had never seen it. Not only is the premise so terrible that I don't know how it ever got turned into a film, but the over the top, don't understand Canada because I didn't bother to look anything up, so I'll just make sh*t up stereotypes are so bad that the suspension of disbelief gets thrown out the window.I have been a fan of Kevin Smith's movies until this point, even though I think he's been going downhill since Clerks (which was awesome), but even his name/vision/idea can't save this piece of dung.It truly is just bad. Without wanting to post spoilers, I can't say much more, but just avoid this piece of crap at all costs. If you truly want to waste your time on a terrible movie, there are many better choices. Highlander 2 comes to mind. (That's right. I think this is worse than Highlander 2. Well, not really, but at least Highlander 2 is something you can scream at for being bad instead of this insipid, badly done, not-even-trying, put-something-out-because-I'm-Kevin-Smith, bullsh*t.)",Tusk
419,amanidarwich,Disappointed,3,15 April 2015,"I decided to watch this movie on a Monday night after watching well known reviewers review this film. They went on to say that this film was one of their all time favorites. Frankly i was disappointed in the horror aspect. It was disturbing at some points but after awhile the story line dragged on and the ending just didn't do it for me. The ""creature"" in this film was to quickly turned and i don't think there was enough suspense there. I do not recommend this for people who are looking for a scare but rather for people who find entertainment in the lack of a storyline and plot.",Tusk
420,drpretorios,An incredible mess,4,10 July 2015,"If you haven't seen Kevin Smith's Tusk yet, let me spare you two hours: don't. Although there is some good horror in here--the villain is one of the most demented ever. Although there's some good comedy in there--and it won't be unfamiliar to fans of Clerks and Smith's other work. It just never feels like a cohesive film. I'd go as far to say that Kevin Smith knows little about horror. A scary, horrifying film can be funny--but it ought to be funny in the right place at the right time. Why did no one look at this film and tell Kevin Smith, ""Look, pal, you've got some work to do""? Although some elements work well independently, there's disharmony when they're combined. It's as though Tusk was directed by two directors with clashing styles. Extreme horror is and Kevin Smith self-aware comedy undermine each other, which left me with the feeling that I was a victim of the world's most malicious practical joke.And that's not even the worst part of Tusk.There's a cameo from a well-known Hollywood start in the last quarter of the film, and I won't name him just in case you want to waste two hours of your life watching Tusk. Well, this well-known star contributes to completely ruining this film. The acting is so campy, so bad that I think Tor Johnson spun in his grave. But one has to put that on Kevin Smith as well. After all, a director's job is to DIRECT the actors, and I don't give care about the size of this particular actor's ego. Judging by this performance and his recent roles, he shouldn't have much of an ego left.Save your time. There's better stuff to watch.",Tusk

It starts of very ""normal"", but then it quickly takes a turn and becomes this awesome twisted movie that you wont soon forget. I have to say that this movie is not for everyone, but give it a chance if you like Saw or the Human centipede. The movie actually left such a big impression on me after watching it as a good night movie(which I don't recommend doing), that I could not fall a sleep right away and had to sign up an account here on IMDb just to give this review. Its a shame that so many people gave it a bad review in here, but don't let that scare you away, you might just be a freak like the rest of us weirdos who loves movies like this, and remember to come in here and leave another positive review if you like it.",Tusk
422,hunelove,Grotesquely beautiful and disturbing...,5,21 February 2016,"Kevin Smith has done it again. This time he's smack dab made me sick to my stomach. My daughters stopped the movie because of the disturbing and grotesque image that has since still remained in my minds eye. At the beginning, I felt slapping the character portrayed by Justin Long (Wallace) because of his obnoxious and crude behavior. As the movie went on, my view of him changed from angst, to pity and I ultimately found myself tearing up in the last segment. I won't give details, but let me say this, I will never satisfy my curiosity about a Kevin Smith movie again. And Kevin, if you have a point to make about society and all the chaos it represents, then go to politics. In this movie, I can tell you had the ""I don't give a f**k"" attitude. This movie is not for the faint of heart. It wasn't even funny. It is supposed to be a comedy/horror. Where the he** was the comedy?? Do yourself a favor, don't watch.

The main character was sort of interesting. Also, as a Canadian I thought it might be funny to watch.I won't add any spoilers.

I thought his Red state performance scarred me but this straight ruined me loll.I had seen all the online videos about the podcast and how everything came together as far as funding, cast, etc.My friends did not and said they still enjoyed it but they are very open minded and familiar with Kevin smiths previous works and outlook.I would say if you're open minded and enjoy different... don't watch the podcast video. If you are hesitant or have any doubts watch the podcast and it truly is amazing how this movie came to be and listening to artists create real time (even if they are stoned loll). Its very inspirational.Mild spoiler ... although its revealed in the first 30 minutes: If I could ask Kevin Smith any question about the movie it would be why he decided to make Justin Longs character unfaithful. Knowing what would eventually happen to him I found myself saying oh hes an a hole anyways so it made it hard to sympathize with him originally but then u see how bad it gets aha. either way I'm just curious the reason behind it I wasn't expecting it and thought it was interesting.Great movie.",Tusk

Remember Justin in Accepted?DONT MAKE IT CLICKABLE!I didn't know where this was going. I was sipping on beer when we clicked on it and as the turns came toward us we were disturbed, entertained and pretty shocked.It definitely had some sort of human centipede feel to it with the knock out juice and the wake up scene where the lead character realizes they are in deep doo doo.All the sudden Justin has his face cut off and stitched onto his back next to his ears and his femurs were turned to tusks and attached to his face. A quick chain drag to the walrus capable pool this guy has in his home, Justin's character realizes that he is not the first walrus conversion test this guy has done.After Justin's girlfriend realizes that she missed a phone call from a distressed boyfriend, she and Forest Gump's son head to Canada and meet up with a very out of place Johnny Depp who spells out everything they need to know.They rescue Justin's character who is now a walrus. This is immediately after a fight with the Brian Cranston looking lunatic who is also dressed as a walrus.After this, Justin's character is relocated to an animal sanctuary to live the rest of his days eating fish and dreaming about the good ole days of being human.

427,vsusanmoon,Gross but kinda a fascinating,6,11 February 2017,"This is a brutally gross film so I understand those that do not like it at all since it reminds them films like ""Human Centipede."" I have watched this film a few years back not really liking it and now feeling like it serves as one of those films you can't take too seriously but can't look away from because it too bizarre.Justin Long stars as Wallace, the main protagonist, along with Haley Joel Osmont as Teddy, two friends who run a podcast making fun of others for fun and money. Due to their many misadventures Wallace goes to Canada to find material for one of his bits for his podcast only to comes up empty handed. That is until Wallace reads Michael Parks's letter on a bathroom wall looking for a lodging partner which takes us into what becomes of Justin Long.Michael Parks does a good job playing the ""crazy old man with an obsession"", pretty much the only things that stands out in this film. Kevin Smith does a good job of taking a strange part of his life and making it rather sick. The movie reminds you of ""The Fly"" in that it transforms someone from one level of a human being to the extreme.It isn't horror movie I'd love for the ages but once in a while if you want to fill that nasty, putrid part of your life then I guess this is the movie for it.**SPOILER** ending leaves wondering how is Wallace still alive?!

It's incredibly creepy in parts though due to some unexpectedly great performances. Michael Parks character alone is worth seeing this movie. Most of the main characters in the movie get a chance to deliver a great piece of dialogue and drop some acting chops. There are a couple of scenes that I think could have been done better which dropped the overall rating. If the actors had been given another chance to get it, it would have been tough to give it less than a nine. The fight scene is hilariously epic.While this does have some elements of the Kevin Smith view askew era humour this is not your standard Smith movie.

And if they want to flash forward, why not him working at a exotic pet exhibit. He may not be able to walk or talk, but it could be a volunteer thing or he could be behind the scenes working...but to assume he is a walrus just because he physically was turned to one doesnt mean he should be left to live the life of one.

But all I'm going to say is the girlfriend choosing the protagonists lifestyle at the end of the film, do to his inability to speak, is a CRAZY ILLEGAL CHOICE. It says it takes place a year after the incident but regardless, the protagonists wounds are still bleeding. The latex is shown coming off in multiple scenes when wet, and for some reason Johnny depps character has no further role past a massive cliff hanger at the second to last scene! What was that about?

There is so many good stories and horror/gore flix, don't waste your time. The beginning is ever so slightly funny but mostly crude. I thought it might get better but it just got worse and the ending was boring, unsatisfying and awkward. But what can you expect from a gore movie?

The questions I had before seeing this movie are now dwarfed in comparison to the questions I have after. If there is not a documentary on the making of this film I would like to make one because the performance alone of Justin Long is Oscar worthy. I put myself in the same twisted situation and feel I could have not in real life acted better than him. He has now risen to the top 5 of acting of all time only as no one else could pull off this role I'm sure of that. Along with some incredible monologues and a Johnny depp performance that was necessary to my enjoyment of the movie but further enhanced it I have to give the film tusk a hands down 10.
