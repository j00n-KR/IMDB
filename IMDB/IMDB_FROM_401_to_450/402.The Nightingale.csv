0,Leofwine_draca,Good but flawed,6,30 April 2021,"Essentially an Australian rape revenge saga from the director of THE BABADOOK. I liked this one but didn't love it, finally just as many flaws as there are good things about it. It's very similar to another film about an Irishman hunting for British soldiers I saw a few years back; even a rip-off, perhaps, but I can't remember the title of that one. Thematically, the film is thoroughly interesting, the usual exploration of the evils of colonialism and the oppression of both women and Aboriginal peoples by the British. As a film, it doesn't work quite as well, mainly because there's no suspense generated so you don't really care about the main character's plight (it was the same with THE BABADOOK which was never as scary as it should have been). On the plus side it's very well shot with great photography, the unusual aspect ratio works too, and the performances are generally fine. But it's also overlong and would have been better with half an hour chopped out, I think.",The Nightingale
1,SnoopyStyle,brutal,8,1 November 2020,"It's 1825 present-day Tasmania. Clare is a young Irish convict forced to follow colonial British soldier Lieutenant Hawkins despite his brutality. She and her husband have a baby daughter. As convicts, they need to be released from service but Hawkins refuses to release the beauty. Hawkins has been stuck leading an outpost for the last three years and is desperate to get a promotion to Captain in a town a few days north. When he does not get the expected recommendation, the situation spirals into darkness.This is an absolutely brutal film. It's not for the faint of heart. There are some very compelling characters. The place and the time is all over this movie. It's brutality is unflinching. Aisling Franciosi is amazing. The ending goes one place too many but I'm willing to accept it despite being over two hours long. Clare falling down in the street is a great climatic ending. The movie only needs to quickly wrap it up after that. It's the perfect ending but it does one more thing. I understand the wish for that one more thing. The tone fits better without that one more thing.",The Nightingale
2,kosmasp,Not a sing a long,9,16 August 2020,"After Babadook, you'd be excused to expect another horror movie. But this filmmaker has other plans. And what intriguing and complicated plans they are. The story is really interesting and it does keep it real. With all the ugly faces it brings up. I am not sure about the evil character being ""humanized"", but I get what she is trying to say there too.There are so many things, details in this well researched and well crafted movie, that I don't think everything will be seen the first time around. What you do have to go through (and I don't think this will get better with repeat viewing) are some very nasty and vile scenes happening to some of the characters you should care for. So this is anything but an easy film to watch. It is harrowing and it is draining. But in a sense it may also be ""rewarding"", if you consider the things it touches and brings forth ... every nation, every land, every country has their own fair share of dark history they probably don't like to be reminded of.So tread lightly, be aware of the slow pace, but still brutal story(telling) ... and go on a dark journey ... Really dark!",The Nightingale
3,searchanddestroy-1,A true masterpiece.,10,12 March 2021,"When I saw this feature I thought about BRIMSTONE, made five years ago, also a western starring a strong female character seeking vengeance in a bloodthirsty odyssey, a rampage into hell. Yes, I could not prevent myself to compare both movies, a kind of dive into madness and brutality. And so powerfully acted. That's a million times better than all those action packed thrillers starring female fighters, sort of NIKITA rip offs, all lousier one than the other. No, don't miss this one. You would regret it. A real hit in the face, in the guts. In the soul.",The Nightingale

5,ferguson-6,Vengeance is thy name,8,2 August 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. With only her second feature film, Jennifer Kent (THE BABADOOK) has created a near cinematic masterpiece. The only thing holding it back is the historical subject matter and the no-holds-barred approach that will surely limit its audience. From an emotional aspect, the film is extraordinarily uncomfortable and disturbing to watch; however, from a filmmaking perspective, it's a thing of beauty. The two sides of my brain were at war the entire time.Set in 1825 Tasmania, the opening scenes are ominous and cloaked in dread - even though nothing has happened (yet). We just feel it in our bones ... things are about to go wrong. And oh my, do they ever go wrong. Now you are likely similar to me in that your knowledge of 1825 Tasmanian history is quite limited. This was the era of ""The Black War"". The British were in the midst of colonizing the country. Violence was prevalent towards women, native Aboriginals, and even the land and existing culture.Clare (Aisling Franciosi, ""The Fall"") is a young Irish woman, recently married with a newborn. She has served her 7 year sentence for theft (likely food for survival) and is now an improperly indentured servant to the ambitious and quietly despicable Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin, THE HUNGER GAMES). Clare is headstrong, but wise enough to understand her place. Her husband Aidan (Michael Sheasby, HACKSAW RIDGE) lacks the same judgement and his foolish attempts to deal directly with Hawkins results in the atrocity that leads to the core of the story.When her pleas for justice fall on the deaf ears of the British military, Clare's need for vengeance transforms her into a woman-obsessed. Due to the harsh elements of the Tasmanian forest, Clare reluctantly agrees to hire an equally reluctant Aboriginal tracker/guide. Billy (Baykali Ganambarr) takes the job, and the two have little respect for each other as the trek begins. As a female Irish convict, Clare was treated poorly by the British, yet she somehow views herself as superior to Billy. On the other hand, Billy lumps all white people into the category of those to hate and distrust. This pair make quite a statement on racism, classism and pre-judging others. Of course, as their journey continues, their similar backgrounds and commonalities are revealed, bringing these two broken people closer together and building mutual respect.This is a part of history that Australia understandably doesn't work to keep in the forefront. But the atrocities were very real and Ms. Kent's film never shies away from the gut-punch of a moment. And though it takes place during this dark period with numerous appalling characters, the core element to the Clare's story is determining the consequences and price of seeking vengeance. How does one hold on to compassion and humanity while trapped in an environment that is barely survivable? Does violence truly beget violence? Is there another way? One of the most striking elements of the story is the contrast of mindless slaughter against the intimacy of vengeance. The British soldiers seem to pay little mind to their victims, while Clare is an emotional wreck when violence is required. It's quite a thought-provoking debate.This is the first leading role for Aisling Franciosi and she is a marvel. Clare is quite a complex character and Ms. Franciosi is remarkable ... as is her singing voice. Also impressive is the performance of Baykali Ganambarr as Billy. Known as a stage performer, this is Mr. Ganambarr's first film role and he is terrific and believable as a young man looking to move on from a life that hasn't been kind or fair. Other key supporting roles include Damon Herriman (""Justified"") as Hawkins' right hand man, and Charlie Shotwell (CAPTAIN FANTASTIC) as young Eddie. All performances are strong, and filmmaker Kent was obviously attuned to presenting the authenticity of the period, even down to the spoken language. The costumes never look like something out of a Hollywood warehouse and cinematographer Radek Ladczuk captures the harshness of the land and brutality of the people. It's a gripping tale focused on the reaction to the deepest of personal loss. The reward is there for those brave enough to give it a watch.",The Nightingale
6,morrison-dylan-fan,The Nightingale Sings.,10,26 March 2021,"After finishing my viewings at the online 2021 WOW Film Festival with the magical Scales (2019-also reviewed) I started making plans for my 100th watched film in 2021. Having had the title on my watch list since seeing reviewer Ross Miller mention it on Twitter, I decided it was time to look up at the sky,for the nightingale.View on the film:Reuniting with The Babadook (2014-also reviewed) cinematographer Radek Ladczuk, writer/directing auteur Jennifer Kent's decision to shoot in the Academy ratio of 1.37 : 1, frames an incredibly claustrophobic,chilling atmosphere, via long tracking shots of Clare and Billy's walk to the mountain summit, and unflinching close-ups on Clare's tortured face, being framed in a closed-in style,subtly creating the impression of their being no corners the characters can take to escape this horror.Dressed with the regal appearance of a Costume Drama, Kent cracks any hint of the good-behavioral traditions of that genre, with a extremely bleak opening thirty minutes. Kent stylishly flies whip-pans over Clare's face, as a excellent sound design and unflinching wide-shots gaze at Clare's life being destroyed.Moving at a impressive pace, Kent builds the bond between Claire and Billy with stark push-ins on the pain and desire for revenge cast across their faces, which is unleashed by Kent in white-knuckle wide-shot tilts towards the Colonial force in the mountain,who left Clare for dead.Continuing an exploration of grief which had haunted The Babadook (2014), the screenplay by Kent brilliantly examines the PTSD psychological torment Clare suffers, with unsettling flinches of the abuse Clare has suffered and killings she has been forced to witness, merging without any warning into the continuing search for the murderers of her family.Following the Colonial force leaving a trail of death and torture, Kent makes the release of revenge one that is physical and psychological, as Clare faces down those who have attacked her with everything they've got,and states that she is no longer the nightingale that all the men in the force have caged with grief and abuse, while Billy soars in with revenge against those who for years have mercilessly killed the Tasmanian Aboriginal people for years.Delivering the coarsely chopped dialogue with a ferocious bite, Aisling Franciosi gives a magnificent turn as Clare, with Franciosi delicacy expressing the psychological horror Clare has suffered in her body language and facial expressions, with a blood-red raw scar for revenge just under the skin.Ordered by Clare at point-blank range to be her guide, Baykali Ganambarr gives a excellent debut performance as Billy, whose mistrust of Clare due to the abuse white people have inflicted on the Tasmanian Aboriginals, is gradually eased by Ganambarr into a rough-edge friendship,as they release the nightingale.",The Nightingale
7,deloudelouvain,Good movie but not for everybody due to the rape scenes and foul language.,7,21 October 2020,"What to write about The Nightingale? First of all it's a good movie. But it's certainly not for everyone, certainly not for a younger audience and/or people that are easily shocked. It's brutal, very brutal, with disgusting rape scenes (without being too explicit), a lot of racism (from the 'bad' people but also from the so-called 'good' people') and violence. The story is basically a revenge story, one were you hope justice will get served at one point. The acting was very good and that from the whole cast. The Nightingale is quite long but never boring and is certainly worth watching if you're not easily offended and have a strong stomach.",The Nightingale
8,lasttimeisaw,a revengeful force to be reckoned with,8,17 December 2019,"""But one must hand it to Kent for the undeniable brilliance on display, for starters, THE NIGHTINGALE is a magnificent typographical ode to the land of Tasmania, correlating its flora and fauna, in particular, a worm's eye view of the sky partially barred by the sylvan environs, with the protagonists' roller-coaster journey, to say nothing of its poetic coda, when the dust finally settles, Clare and a wounded Billy escape to the beach, bathed under the golden rays of sunshine and gradually become enthralled in front of a rising sun, if that doesn't take your breath away, you might be too hard-bitten for your own good.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",The Nightingale
9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The cruelty of colonialism.,8,21 August 2020,"A stark examination of colonialism in 1800s Australia, Jennifer Kent's 'The Nightingale (2018)' envisions a brutal, realistic world that never seems to relent. Constantly subverting expectation in the most natural of ways, the film is a revenge odyssey that challenges the very concept it initially relies on. Through her Journey, Clare comes to realise things about herself and her country that she never once considered before. It's during this process that a bond begins to form with Aboriginal tracker, Billy, and empathy starts to emerge in an otherwise uncaring world. There's an incredibly real feel to the film, down to its very texture. Its violence, which is often shocking in its frankness, is never glamorised or, even, made especially cinematic, instead remaining as blunt and uncomfortable as the very environment it takes place in. Though it's bleak, the story still retains a tint of hope; its focus is on preserving empathy. That's the closest thing to a theme the feature has. It isn't concerned with traditional narrative payoff or pacing, really. That's what makes it so effective, though. It's a story about people and the things that they go through. It's difficult to describe, but everyone feels layered and down-to-earth enough to almost transcend their fictional status. The picture stares you straight in the face and presents its horrors wholesale. Its exploration of racism and violence against women is still sadly still relevant today. It's a powerful, unconventional and often uncomfortable experience unlike almost any other. It's well worth a watch if you can stomach it. 8/10",The Nightingale
10,dromasca,the nightmare of the nightingale,8,27 September 2019,"I rarely have the opportunity to watch Australian films. Some of the actors and directors from the antipodes continent made brilliant careers in Hollywood, but Australian films rarely enjoy international distribution. Maybe unfairly, because the ones I managed to see were almost without exception interesting films, belonging to different genres, but each reflecting in its own way the landscape, the history, and the mentalities of this distant part of the world. To these has now been added Jennifer Kent's 'The Nightingale', a well-made film, but also one conceived to stir controversy and which has been able to provoke extreme discussions and reactions, and has left indifferent nobody anyplace it was screened.If we were to put the film in a particular category, it would be the one called 'Australian Westerns'. Australia's history of colonization has many points in common with the conquest of the American West, and its reflection in cinematography has also gone through stages similar to those of Western American films, from heroic stories and spectacular action films, to modern versions that try to be more faithful to historical truth. I do not know the political atmosphere and the history of Australian society well, but my impression is that the violent aspects of the colonization, the conflicts between the newcomers (part criminals deported by the English justice to the penitentiary colonies, another part their guardians) and the local Aboriginal population are still largely a skeleton waiting to be exposed out of the closet Australian history. Clare, the main heroine of the film, has to survive in a lawless world, where violence is the natural way of conflict resolution. It is also an extremely stratified world, in which Clare is a multiple victim - as an Irish woman belonging to the people recently defeated by the English, as a woman, as a convict and deportee. Paradoxically, there is one class below her in the hierarchy of this world - the Tasmanian aborigines, who are waging a hopeless war against the white colonists. A war that they will lose and their nation will be exterminated.Director Jennifer Kent wanted to highlight two important political messages, and she did not save the means and did not hesitate to shock her viewers to make those as clear as possible. One is a powerful feminist message, which makes the story of the film join the genre of films in which women who have gone through terrible traumas (rape, murder of the dearest family members) seek revenge. The other is the exposure of the atrocities up to the genocide committed by white settlers in the first century of the conquest of Australia. The latter message questions the legitimacy and morality of one of today's most peaceful and civilized democratic societies, at least as long as these nightmares of history are not known and assumed. But there is also a human message that becomes more and more clear when Clare finds solidarity and support precisely from Billy, the Aboriginal tracker. The interaction between them starts as a relationship of social and racial subordination to become a beautiful friendship story.Even if it does nothing to avoid shocking, the film never slips into commercial exhibitionism. Unlike Tarantino's films, for example, there is nothing aesthetic in the violence we see displayed on screen, which has the clear purpose of arousing rejection and repulsion. The story is captivating and very well filmed, with most of the scenes taking place in the Tasmanian jungle. The actors' interpretation is exceptional. Irish actress Aisling Franciosi realizes a beautiful and vulnerable Clare, finding in her desire for revenge the strength to survive the terrible events she goes through. Baykali Ganambarr manages to overcome the conceptual weaknesses of Billy's role and brings a memorable character to the screen. The main problem of the film is the excess of explicit rhetoric, to the detriment of authentic experiences. The separation between the good and the bad is far too Manichean, especially when it is done in most cases along nationality lines. 'The Nightingale' could have benefited from a more nuanced approach and a less explicit promotion of the film's messages. Even so, it's a movie that's hard to forget.",The Nightingale
11,westsideschl,History,6,22 February 2020,"For almost a hundred years from the late 1700s to late 1800s the British & Irish governments sent convicts, mostly petty crimes, to work with/for settlers in many parts of the world including Australia & Tasmania.I have several issues with this script of a street wise young Irish female sent to Tasmania and now a farmer's wife & mother of an infant.
First, was the almost exclusive portrayal of all Brits as being racist, rapists, hate mongers & murderers even when they are serving in the Brit military.
Second, was their universally abhorrent treatment of indigenous peoples - ""You, Boy"" was a common ingrained regard toward all Indigenous.
Third, was the formula ending that cheapened the historic message.
Fourth, our lead character, despite a history of toughness & despite her commitment to justice, has a ""didn't make sense breakdown"".",The Nightingale

13,Thanos_Alfie,Revenge...,7,2 November 2021,"""The Nightingale"" is a Drama - Thriller movie in which we watch a convict woman chasing a British officer in wilderness with the help of an Aboriginal tracker. They both have a lot of hatred for the British and they want to do something about it.I liked this movie because it had a nice, simple and interesting plot that consisted of plenty of suspense that combined very well with drama. The direction which was made by Jennifer Kent was very good and she presented very well her main character, her difficulties, her pain and her personality, something that we could easily relate to her. The interpretation of Aisling Franciosi who played as Clare was simply amazing and she made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Sam Claflin's who played as Hawkins, Baykali Ganambarr's who played as Billy and Damon Herriman's who played as Ruse. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Nightingale"" is a nice drama movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",The Nightingale
14,eddie_baggins,The Australian film of 2019,9,1 December 2019,"The term harrowing gets bandied about quite a bit in modern day climates, with films looking to become the next water cooler events as people discuss the horrors or look away moments that they've found in the latest buzzed about event, but the much talked about nature of Australian director Jennifer Kent's latest film (of which reportedly led to many a festival screening walk-out) following on from the world-wide success of The Babadook, The Nightingale is well-warranted.A film that features an abundance of heart-wrenching and genuinely hard to watch moments, seeped in an ominously depressive tone and state throughout its at times hard to bare 130 minute plus running time, Kent's Tasmanian set colonial tale of young Irish convict Clare traversing the rugged and body filled wilderness of the early 1800's with her Aboriginal guide Billy as she seeks vengeance against the British soldiers who robbed her of everything, is easily one of the years toughest watches, that also rewards those that stick by it with a story that will not soon be forgotten.One of the most fully-formed and important Australian films made in the last decade, one that refuses to shy away from our shameful past and treatment of the Indigenous people and those unfortunate convicts that were shipped to the then newly forming land, Nightingale is a female orientated revenge film unlike any other and one that further establishes Kent's regard as one of the country's leading directional voices, while unearthing two spectacular talents in the form of Aisling Franciosi as Clare and Baykali Ganambarr as Billy.Under the guiding hand of Kent, Franciosi and Ganambarr shine in what are unquestionably difficult roles, brilliantly inhabiting two lost souls that share a broken bond and quest and throughout the films gruelling progression, that ensures we see very little light or levity throughout, the two young actors are awards worthy in what is sure to be two career defining performances.Both characters are wonderfully written by Kent, who went to great lengths to ensure that Nightingale's history and even near-forgotten about languages were utilised correctly in her tale and by allowing audiences ample time with these creations, Nightingale's moments of grief, despair and humanity are made even more powerful thanks to our growing affiliation for Clare and Billy and their justifiable causes.Coinciding with these two standout performances and Kent's immaculate direction are two devilishly well-done supporting turns by the usually clean-cut Sam Claflin and Australia's favourite supporting actor Damon Herriman as British soldiers Hawkins and Ruse, who are beyond detestable as the two actors embody two irredeemably evil men in ways that make sure we as an audience can barely stand the sight of them as they look to escape the atrocities they have committed in the seemingly un-governed landscape of the early Australian land.Final Say -It can't be stated more clearly that The Nightingale is not for everyone, a film that many rightfully may not be able to endure but for those that stick by it right through to the heart-wrenching end, Kent's film becomes not only one of the most quintessential Australian films made, but one of the most deeply moving revenge tales of the modern era.4 ½ barrels of rum out of 5",The Nightingale

16,jtindahouse,One of the best revenge films ever made,9,19 November 2019,"In any revenge film the goal of the filmmaker is to make us side with the protagonist as much as possible. We have to not only be on their side, we have to care about their mission as much as they do. 'The Nightingale' is possibly the best film I've ever seen at achieving this. I have never needed a woman to get her revenge so badly. I was as invested in this film as if it were me this had happened to. This is a wonderful film.This is one of the heaviest and most brutal films I've ever watched. None of it feels gratuitous whatsoever though. The film feels real (for the time it was set in of course) and every detail seems necessary. That said, this film won't be for everyone. Not every person is wired to deal with extreme violence the likes of which this film possesses. Be warned this film hits its audience over the head, and then keeps bashing.Every part of this movie is handled with expert precision. The character interactions are memorising, the performances are flawless, the pacing is perfect. Maybe, just maybe, if I had to pick a fault I would've liked the last 5 minutes of the film to be done a little differently. But that is being extremely nit-picky.

18,Pairic,A Dark Australian Revenge Western.,9,5 December 2019,"The Nightingale: Set In Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) in 1825 during the Aboriginal War of Resistance to the White Settlers. This is a tale of revenge, of horror, of rape, of murder, a quest and of brutal retaliatory killings. This truly a journey to the heart of darkness bringing to mind Black 47, The Searchers and The Outlaw Josey Wales as the chase and tale unfolds over the changing terrain. A Dark Australian Revenge Western.Clare (Aisling Franciosi) and Aidan (Michael Sheasby) are Irish transportees, both work for brutal Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin), commander of the local garrison. Clare's ticket of leave is overdue but Hawkins refuses to sign her release. He abuses her, jealous that she has chosen Aidan rather than him. Hawkins is desperate for promotion but a visiting inspector is unimpressed by the indiscipline of the troops. When the inspector finds Hawkins brawling with Aidan he tells him he will not be recommending him for promotion to Captain. In a rage, Hawkins with two of his troops goes to Aidan and Clare's house, rapes her and kills Aidan and their baby, leaving Clare for dead. Hawkins and his cronies set off on a trek through the interior to personally appeal for promotion. Clare has survived and along with a young Aborigine tracker, Billy (Baykali Ganambarr), goes in pursuit of them.At first this isn't a union of equals, Clare carries many of the racist attitudes of other settlers even though she is herself a prisoner. Suspecting Billy of being a cannibal and that he may turn on her. Their shared experiences travelling through the dark bush, across rivers and over mountains gradually helps them to share a bond and eventually they are inseparable. Clare sings many songs in English and Irish including that of The Nightingae but when she and Billy are around a campfire she sings Oró Sé do Bheatha 'Bhaile in response to Billy's song and dance of the Blackbird. Billy reveals how he also has his own reasons to hate the English.They find Aborigines hanging from trees and farmhouses burning, sheep slaughtered,settlers killed in their homes. The land which the Aborigines cleared is being taken from them, planters are bringing in sheep to graze. Horror after horror ensues as both parties make their way through the bush. Even though Clare sings of The Nightingale when she meets up with one of the soldiers it is as if she is possessed by the Celtic of WarCrow Goddess, The Morrigan (Morrigú) , as she literally tears him to pieces. A truly savage story of misogyny, racism, colonialism and revenge. My one criticism would be of the lack of subtitles when Gaeilge and Aboriginal (sic) are spoken.

21,I_Ailurophile,"Very difficult, but very worthwhile",8,10 May 2021,"The violence in this period piece is extreme, immediate, and horrifying: a content warning is necessary for sexual assault, and infanticide. Every viewer should be greatly disturbed by the story being told, including terrible racism and classism, initially even from the protagonist. And that's only within the first half hour. Welcome to 'The nightingale.'The story of modern Tasmania - and Australia, and New Zealand - is no joy ride, but its history is more grotesque yet. The distinction between a convict and a free man - a soldier, or military officer, no less - can be as thin as nothing more than a uniform, and the only true justice a person might find could be what they take for themselves. All this is to say nothing of the great, unexplored interior, indifferent and unforgiving for those who aren't prepared. That's the setting for this tale. It's ugly through and through; harsh - but real, and told superbly.All credit due to writer-director Jennifer Kent for daring to make such a visceral movie, and to the cast for playing their parts so well; I can only imagine how difficult this was to bring to fruition. This especially goes for Irish actress Aisling Franciosi, starring as vengeful, driven, complicated protagonist Clare, and for Australian actor Baykali Ganambarr, seen here as Clare's spiteful but resourceful Aboriginal guide, Mangana. Their trek defines the majority of the movie, and they truly excel. It's impossible not to feel Clare's pain that Franciosi so capably portrays, or sympathize with the plight of Mangana and his people. It's harder to commend Sam Claflin for his performance as the deeply villainous Lieutenant Hawkins, yet the challenge of embodying such a fiendish character can't be overstated.I was concerned that the thrust of the narrative, the revenge plot, would be too familiar to be engaging, but I was thankfully mistaken: 'The nightingale' is duly thrilling, and altogether entrancing for the drama on display, and the skill of the cast and filmmakers. It's the violence I should have been worried about, as it makes this a very difficult watch; the prejudices, a close second. And even outside of Clare's blood-soaked goal, there's still more brutality throughout with the other dangers, human and otherwise, that the great wilderness holds within.While music is used only sparingly, in those instances where Jed Kurzel's score is brought to bear it punctuates particular scenes very effectively. As haunting as the film may be, the production is outstanding, with some shots genuinely beautiful, to say nothing of the surrounding scenery of untamed nature. And, once more: so very talented is the cast that they make use of the very setting, interacting with it, like it were a prop.I had mixed expectations, and they were well exceeded: 'The nightingale' is an arduous experience, and viewer discretion is advised. Yet that effort is rewarded by seeing the fine cast practice their craft, and the filmmakers demonstrate their ability. Highly recommended!",The Nightingale

Indeed, both stories could conceivably be happening at the same time. One cannot understate the importance of this movie in underlining the aboriginal story in the early 1800s. The story perfectly captures all the trauma, all the horror, of that time. It is the story that is powerful here, the bringing together of two downtrodden cultures up against the English, where we find such marvellous villains. All the events are very human and believable, shot against a rather magical towering wilderness. Highly recommended and essential viewing for Australians.",The Nightingale

Ms Franciosi's range of emotions was deserving of her Venice Festival award. Director Jennifer Kent must be applauded for choosing to write an original script and direct a film showing facts from the aboriginals' point of view. The film recalls Peter Weir's ""The Last Wave.""

27,krocheav,The Nightingale - Gives Us The Rough End Of The Song and Sideways,2,3 April 2020,"Another Aussie movie that signals the limited mindset of its writer/director/producer within the first 10mins - it doesn't get much uglier than this tosh. Some movie makers appear to simply want to lay claim to making a new 'gross' movie, to out-gross the one that went before, that's not much of a claim to fame. Jenifer Kent's prior claim to fame came in the form of the horror entry ""The Babadook ""14 The Nightingale is set in early Tasmanian colonial history but its head is deeply lost in cheap horror. While sadly there have always been atrocities involved in settling new lands (the world over) this work tends to come across as the anti-white PC brigade --pushing a cheap 'them and us' mentality-solely for the sake of spreading increased hatred.98% of all whites featured are deliberately shown to be as bad as bad can possibly get - so bad as to be simplistic caricatures, designed to manipulate the audience to want to see them killed in the most horrific manner possible, and of course, they are. The sensationalistic foul language is right out of today and equally overdone as the sordid voyeurism. For the industry to lord over writings such as this, is demeaning to the trade, and won't bring respect or many ticket sales from general audiences. The only following this picture is likely to garnish will be those who relish schlock horror and repugnant, vulgar brutality. When the bulk of performers are not over-acting it appears it might just work but this is very short-lived. The claustrophobic cinematography (shot to no advantage in small screen format!) seems to perhaps be attempting to hide the over cleared and developed landscape for its time.Those who 'think' about what 'entertainment' they are being fed, will see so many ridiculous plot failings and under-developed situations that it's difficult to see who this nasty mess could benefit, and doesn't ever warrant a second look. It's time to move on and help overcome this eternal nurturing of hatred or tell it with a little more balance and intelligent respect for the viewer.",The Nightingale
28,Foutainoflife,Is There A Greater Motivation Than Revenge?,7,20 November 2019,"Some would say no. Revenge is sweet. Others would say to wait for Karma to work her magic is better than imposing your own vengeance. In all honesty, that is simply sitting in shadows, waiting for your rival to get their dues so you can feel the warmth that comes from a grin as it emerges from the vengeance you have so longed for.No matter your stance, we all want vengeance.This film was an interesting look into revenge. There is no denying that you feel for the characters and want them to find their revenge. Following their journey is anger, wrath, insanity and sadness. These are all the emotions that dwell within someone who has been victimized. It is all beautifully displayed among a lush Tasmanian setting and the actors played their roles well.While it is a very sobering film, dark and purposeful, it does has a second unfolding story inside itself. It is a story of learning to trust and letting go of common ignorance. Realizing that even though we each face our heartaches one on one, it is a big world full of others facing their own heartache and in these people we can find commonality, understanding and comfort. This is, for me the most touching aspect of the film.I would recommend this film for people who are looking for a revengeful period piece. I enjoyed it. It was filmed beautifully. The costuming and makeup were simplistic but well suited. The darkness of some of the settings really helped in driving home the turmoil of the characters.I was pleased.",The Nightingale

This is no rape, revenge drama more an unlikely friendship being buillt in the darkest of times.Many films have used the Academey ratio to good effect in recent years, and this is another. Kent uses the tighter, square aspect ratio, often resting on Franciosi's face in close-up. The effect feels all the more oppressive, as if the sides of the screen itself are threatening to close in on her and swallow her up.It's an ugly film, in the very best sense of the word.

It may be, if the amount of extreme things that happen in the first 35 minutes are considered unnecessary and excessive, shocking more than artistic.Because I'm not a critic, I just don't know. But yes, it is hard to endure, even when the editing and cinematography didn't made anything explicit/graphic.Anyways, after that first act, the plot is nothing too inventive. A pretty standard revenge story, only in this case, filled with a compromise to ""realism"" or ""verisimilitude"" that makes it a better than average attempt. Even if you don't connect with the characters, you would feel something. The movie would make you feel for sure. Maybe a bit slow for some, it was working really well for me until the last act.My main problem was the resolution. The decisions made. The twists and characters reactions to these situations felt questionable, forced or coming from a more ""mundane"" type of movie.Or maybe is the other way around, and what it did was maintain the realism and I was hoping for a more satisfactory ending, considering my feelings more than the story itself.",The Nightingale
33,rockman182,The Nightingale (2019),7,3 August 2019,"The NightingaleI didn't care about The Babadook so much as a horror film, though I know others loved it. Still, I heard some things about Jennifer Kent's follow up and wanted to see it. It was mixed reviews but mostly positive and I even decided to pay out of pocket for this feature as no AMC theater was playing it to use A-list. I'm quite impressed. Its a long and harrowing journey but one filled with a lot of realization, reflection, and development. This is Kent's most realized work.The film takes place in Tasmania in 1825, where an Irish convict is raped while her husband and infant child are murdered by corrupt and sadistic British officers. She soon goes on a journey of vengeance to bring bloodshed to those responsible. She enlists the help of an Aboriginal man who knows how to track in the wilderness. Together, the pair go through a tale of survival in the hopes of revenge and bringing justice to the men who have left a day prior. The film stars Aisling Franciosi and Sam Claflin, and Baykali Ganambarr.The film is gonna split viewers due to its violent nature. There are a few scenes of rape in it and murder that will be uncomfortable for some viewers. Otherwise the film is quite an engorging watch. Franciosi is a terrific lead. Right after her rape, you see the strength in her character develop and the lengths she would go to bring justice. Her development is rapid but unwavering. The film comes from a different time and its interesting to see a film depicting these events.The film basically felt like a rape and revenge film but not a B movie type from decades ago. Its a fully realized, and quality piece of work with that overarching theme that we saw a lot of in exploitative films. Its a long venture and a slow burn but you will be glued to the screen to watch justice come to those who deserve it. Hopefully if for nothing else, this makes a name for Aislign Franciosi.7.5/10",The Nightingale

But I thought the writing was too simple and could have used more work. Excellent performances by the beautiful Aisling Franciosi. But terrible cinematography choices with the 1.37 : 1 frame. This film should have been shot at least in 1.85 : 1 or 16:9. The pictures look like they were straight out of the camera without post color grading. I really disliked looking at black bars on the left and right hand side of the screen.Talk of ""extreme violence"" is overblown in my opinion. None of the sexual scenes are anymore graphical that what is seen on TV. It is all implied. The worst kill scene was the revenge taken against the soldier in the wilderness, but I'll keep it vague to avoid spoilers. But that scene happens very quickly.Unfortunately I was expecting a beautiful film like an A24 Studio film, but this film isn't very memorable.

38,maccas-56367,Not an easy watch; but powerful and well crafted,8,18 February 2020,"The time I spent watching Clare (Aisling Franciosi) in ""The Nightingale"" is the closest I'll ever get to spending time with my Great-Great-Great Grandmother. Both Irish convicts shipped to Van Diemen's Land. The setting here of 1825, is a mere 15 years prior to my GGG Irish Granny's arrival in the same place. This added a personal element to my viewing and was responsible for me getting emotional during numerous scenes.I feel battered and bruised after watching this. ""The Nightingale"" features some of the darkest, most difficult-to-watch scenes I've encountered in film. No one is exempt from the brutality and darkness on display here. It is powerful on many levels, with a realism that both sickens in its displays of violence, an adds authenticity at the same time. Despite the savagery, I was engaged throughout its length and never found myself bored.This is probably the best that Tasmanian scenery has looked on film. Tasmania is one of the most prominent characters and the dramatic landscape adds to the atmosphere.As things progressed, the film explored the devastation of the Van Diemen's Land Black War. It broke my heart. It's this common enemy, which ultimately brings the characters of Clare and ""Billy"" Mangana (an excellent Baykali Ganambarr) closer. Aisling and Baykali had great onscreen chemistry and shared some powerful moments. Meanwhile, Sam Claflin will go down in history as one of the most hated villains I've encountered in cinema.It is a revenge tale at its heart, and I found myself emotionally invested in their plight. At one point, I startled my dog by yelling at the screen. Jennifer Kent has done exceptionally well here. It is levels above her previous ""The Babadook"". She has crafted a film I will never forget.Just as the film began, I looked out my window to the surrounding Tasmanian hills, and saw heavy rain and dark skies slowly rolling in.

39,ronakkotian,Reminds you how cruel the human race can be,8,7 August 2020,"This film was tough to sit through. I don't think I even want to give it another watch.The Nightingale follows Clare, an Irish convict, who hunts down a British officer after he commits a horrific act towards her family.Honestly, this film is a tough watch. If you are someone who's squeamish, DO NOT watch The Nightingale. This is a brutal and unsettling film that sticks with you after it's done. Jennifer Kent is very brave as there are some sequences in this film that few filmmakers will try to show. Some may say the film is unnecessarily violent which I completely disagree. The violence isn't merely there to just be violent. Each act of violence seems incredibly realistic and has purpose whether it's to develop characters or show the cruelty of the time it's set in. Kent explores many themes like colonialism, racism and misogyny and presents them in a way to make you think how evil humanity can be.The performances are absolutely brilliant. Aisling Franciosi is outstanding. She delivers a mesmerising performance that demands a lot out of her. In his first film role, Baykali Ganambarr is equally terrific and gives a powerful performance. Sam Claflin is also fantastic as the sadistic British officer. He is one of the most hateful characters I've ever seen and Claflin plays him to a tee.The film does have a few flaws. I do think it's a bit too long. A few minutes could have been taken out and there are some scenes of predictability but overall The Nightingale is a haunting experience. It's something I don't want to revisit any time soon but I do think Jennifer Kent has talent and I'll look forward to her future projects.",The Nightingale

No, don't do that.. then you know you've lost the story. It's like the writers had to fill the last 30 minutes with anything, so they start bringing in stupid moves by the characters to prolong the film.

It's a shame, it was close to being a great. Anyhoo, it's basically a revenge movie with a couple of scenes of some serious graphic violence! Phew! It was acted well by the most of the cast, although I did think the Aussie guy wasn't that great an actor to be honest. That didn't bother me as I was well into the plot... until it got stupid.

She did.""The Nightingale"" is a lot of things: a powerful, historically true and important drama, partially an uncompromising rape/revenge feature, a story of both unaldutared rage and the most humane compassion, a bleak horror-like movie that's tough to watch but ultimately rewards generously. Every level of filmmaking is full of effort and just quite admirable. Grantedly, ""The Nightingale"" is very much a slow-burn, but a great one at that - the somewhat familiar story unravels in creative and unexpected ways & the atmosphere plays a major part, plays it well. A major compliment from me goes to the cast - everyone, from the two main protagonists to villain to just extras, gave fine and authentic feeling performances, truly. Visually ""The Nightingale"" is impressively well done, it was easy to get used to the 4:3 aspect ratio if that's a concern for some, the cinematography is as unflinching as the story itself, camera language is on point & nature, a big part of movies scenery, looks beautiful and alive.I feel like I'm going to remember ""The Nightingale"" for a long time, it's the type of story, the type of cinematic expierence that lingers. Some people critisize the movies raw depiction of violence, but frankly, I feel like it was necessary for the director to make her point. The movie is from the viewpoint of the historically exploited & I believe it's a painfully accurate depiction, asks hard questions and reaches powerful conclusions. Despite the large amount of brutality it's a beautiful and, in my opinion, spiritually important movie with a message that could help us, the flawed humans.I am highly interested in whatever Jennifer Kent does next, among others things ""The Nightingale"" also shows she has the talent and the guts.

48,gavinp9,"Brutal, single-minded early Australian revenge story",7,28 August 2019,"'The Nightingale' is a revenge film set in early 19th century Tasmania from the director of 'The Babadook'. While not technically a horror film, there's certainly some horrific moments - rape, lynching and murder. Unfortunately, it's probably pretty realistic for Tasmania in the 1820s. Clare (Franciosi) is an Irish convict under the rule of the English Lieutenant Hawkins (Claflin) and married to newly-free Aidan (Sheasby). It's not really a spoiler to say that Hawkins and Ruse (Herriman) murder Aidan, leave Clare for dead and set off north to Launceston, setting in motion her trek for revenge.While Clare's totally unprepared for the Tasmanain wilderness, she manages to enlist Aboriginal tracker Billy/Black Bird (Ganambarr), who ends up being the star of the film. He brings compassion and justified anger, but also humour and warmth. It helps that his Black Bird can sing along with Clare's ""Nightingale"" song(s), some sung in Gaelic. It's nice to see them bond over both being subjugated by the English. Much like 2009's 'Van Diemen's Land' (which I probably slightly preferred over this), the Tasmanian bush is a key character, with so many stunning forest, beach, mountain and valley vistas. You should make sure you visit Tasmania if you've never been!The acting is great, with the villains callous, Clare obsessively determined and Billy trying to find his place in his disrupted world. It's probably 30min too long and has lots of slow moments that don't add too much, and lots of people will have an issue with some of the violence. The film really hits home what English colonisation did to Indigenous Australians and particularly it's compounded effect on Tasmania. There's a truly touching scene near the end with an old English man helping Billy and Clare - but it highlights the exception to the rule.",The Nightingale
49,ritera1,THAT scene should never have been made.,4,12 August 2019,"The first rape scene was unpleasant and elongated.The second long one where they killed the baby was probably the most disturbing and vile piece of film I've ever seen. I am very much a tree-huggin' liberal and free speech advocate. But I would happily support removing that scene by force, if necessary. Total and complete censorship.Did start off coherent; fully establishing the setting and the characters. Aisling Franciosi was sympathetic vs. Sam Claflin's nemesis who was likely one of the most vile bad guys in film history.The premise was quickly set-up and we were on the road.Baykali Ganambarr was consistently likeable as Franciosi's guide and their eventual rapport and teamwork was charming.But what I was expecting and what I got were very different and very disappointing in the end. I wanted pure murderous rage from her for the crimes of these three men and got it when she killed the younger soldier.Then when she had Claftin in her sights, she turned into a weak-kneed heroine. Extremely disappointing. Her confrontation on the street was another layer of disappointment and her railing against Claftin in the restaurant was too little, too late. Can kind of buy that he was so evil that she was afraid, but that's not what I wanted after all he'd done.Then the very cursory and weak ending with Ganambarr killing Claftin in his bed, never mind the silliness of the other soldier shooting him in the gut and then trying to go through those many steps to load a one-shot musket before being run through himself. Just use the damn gun as a stick and swing it at the guy.I do think that Jennifer Kent is a very good director who can create mood and interesting scenes, as evidenced from this and her previous Babadook. But directing her own scripts pushes both, and especially this, into self-indulgence.",The Nightingale
50,WalkdenEntertainment,A Different Kind Of Horror Film From Jennifer Kent...,9,17 January 2020,"The year is 1825. The Nightingale is a nickname given to a young Irish convict, a woman whose real name is Clare (Aisling Franciosi). Clare is called The Nightingale because of her stunning singing voice and she has a husband and a baby daughter. When her sentence is served, she asks for her release and freedom from a British officer. Clare's freedom is declined and she is forced to continue her slavery lifestyle after being told she will never have her freedom and being abused physically and sexually. One night Clare's husband gets drunk and demands her freedom from the officer with a horrific and traumatic outcome. Clare, now alone and wounded, seeks help within her town, but she is either declined support, or worse- people with authority simply don't believe she is telling the truth. Clare takes a horse, picks up a rifle and begins to seek bloody vengeance for what has been taken from her. She also hires an Aboriginal Tracker named Billy (Baykali Ganambarr) who will lead her through the bush and directly to the officer responsible.The Nightingale is directed by Jennifer Kent who previously gave movie lovers ""The Bababook"". But unlike her previous film, The Nightingale is a different type of horror. A word of warning for those who are considering watching this film- The Nightingale is an extremely horrific film. The level of trauma and violence (physical and sexual) is rather high. I honestly can't remember the last time I watched a film that made me tense up so much, even to the point that I found myself almost looking away or biting my fingernails off. The Nightingale is full of horrific moments but I understand that the director felt it was necessary to include all these moments to convey the whole story and emotion... I actually admire the strength she must have had to make this film possible.The performances in The Nightingale are incredible. I hate to imagine what the actors went through emotionally to complete this film. The British solider (played by Sam Claflin) who commits all the horrific acts on screen plays his role so well that I truly hated his character with a passion. Once I started I watching the film, I had to see it through as I hoped, along with Clare, that his character would suffer considerably.The film is interestingly filmed in an aspect ratio of 4:3. Given the film's time period, I found this aspect ratio to be a rather wise and bold choice which I feel pays off quite nicely.The visuals of this film I must also praise. Everything on screen looks very realistic. From location and costumes design, The Nightingale feels far from fake.The only minor issue for me was the runtime and the pacing in the third act. The third act's pacing felt as though it slowed down. Scattered throughout the film the leading character also suffers horrific dreams and these sequences feel somewhat repetitive.Overall, The Nightingale is not a film for the faint hearted and I say that because it's filled with horrific moments. But, if one is a lover of epic dramas, I'm pleased to say to there is an incredible story here and the director has managed to deliver an unforgettable film. With amazing performances, location, plot and costume designs, The Nightingale will stay with me for some time.9.0/10

51,dommercaldi,"Absolutely Brutal With Great Performances by Aisling Franciosi And Sam Claflin, But Weak Aborigine Performances And Racist Against White Men",5,31 July 2020,"Pros:
1. The aspect ratio of 1.37 : 1 helps to add tension and suspense by fomenting a claustrophobic feeling.
2. The dark lighting, as well as the grey, brown and black colour gradient, cements a bleak and oppressive atmosphere.
3. Both Sam Claflin (Hawkins) and Aisling Franciosi (Clare) deliver fantastic performances.
4. The set and costume design are amazing, with the set design particularly adding to the thriller atmosphere.
5. The rape and violence scenes are brutal and they only serve to enhance the horrors and unforgiving nature of the setting.
6. The camera-work, especially the first-person view, increases the terror by putting the viewer into the characters' position.
7. The dream sequences are terrifying and deliver chills to the viewer.
8. The death of Billy (Baykali Ganambarr) is beautifully tragic and deftly handled.Cons:
1. Baykali Ganambarr and Charlie Jampijinpa Brown (Uncle Charlie) give rather wooden performances.
2. The dialogue about European-on-Aborigine oppression too repetitive and forced, as well as it being one-sided and erroneous.
3. Pretty much every white male character is presented as racist, sexist, a rapist, or a psychopathic murderer. Even Clare and Billy at one point form an alliance based on being messed over by white men.
4. Clare takes no time to recover after being gang-raped and witnessing her husband and baby murdered. She immediately embarks on her revenge quest which is massively unrealistic.
5. There are a few examples of pointless and illogical conflict which is clearly just inserted for cheap emotional manipulation. For example, when the Aborigine prisoners are shot for talking.
6. The third act drags on, particularly when Clare runs away after being shot by Hawkins and engages in this nonsensical and forced self-analysis.",The Nightingale

55,Bertaut,"A superb, albeit harrowing drama about colonial violence, misogyny, and racism",8,15 December 2019,"Written and directed by Jennifer Kent, on the surface, The Nightingale is very much a genre picture - a rape/revenge drama set in a pseudo-western milieu. However, as it progresses, it gradually reveals itself as less concerned with hitting genre beats than engaging with issues such as racism, misogyny, the fine line between barbarism and civilisation, and the cathartic potential of revenge (or possible lack thereof). Much as Kent's debut, the exceptional The Babadook (2014), was a horror in name only, its genre serving as a means to a thematic end, so too with The Nightingale. Brutally violent (but never gratuitously so), extremely unpleasant, and downright nihilistic at times, it's not going to pack them in at the multiplex, but this is an important, relevant, and mature study of mans' innate capacity for cruelty.Van Diemen's Land, 1825. A British penal colony, the island is in the midst of the Black War, with the British army attempting to eradicate the indigenous Palawa population. In an isolated colony, Clare Carroll (a star-making turn from Aisling Franciosi) and her husband Aidan (Michael Sheasby) are Irish convicts with an infant daughter, indentured to garrison commander Lt. Hawkins (an odious Sam Claflin). Convicted of petty theft in Ireland over seven years prior, Clare has served her sentence and is waiting for Hawkins to sign her long overdue letter of recommendation, which would render her and Aidan free citizens. However, Hawkins, who calls her his Nightingale on account of her beautiful singing voice, responds by raping her, and not for the first time. The following night, Aidan drinks too much and gets into a brawl with Hawkins, the sadistic Sgt. Ruse (Damon Herriman), and the naïve Pvt. Jago (Harry Greenwood). Happening in front of a visiting superior officer who's evaluating Hawkins for promotion, the officer tells Hawkins he won't be recommending him. Infuriated, Hawkins orders Ruse and Jago to accompany him on foot through the treacherous bush to Launceston, where he intends to make an in-person appeal for promotion to army brass. However, before they leave, Hawkins and Ruse rape Clare and brutalise Aidan and the baby. And so, determined to exact revenge, she sets off in pursuit of the trio, hiring ""Billy"" Mangana (an exceptional debut from dancer Baykali Ganambarr), a Palawa tracker who hates whites as much as Clare hates Hawkins.Having spent over five years researching the frontier wars, Kent made The Nightingale in collaboration with Palawa elders, with the story of Clare and Billy serving as Australia-specific synecdoche for the general oppression and violence of British colonialism. Both Clare and Billy have been deeply wronged by colonialists - her as a convict and woman, him as a Palawa. However, one of Kent's masterstrokes is to complicate their dynamic, whereby neither is capable of seeing their similarity to the other. When Clare is first told she'll need a Palawa tracker, she responds, ""I'm not travelling with a black. I'll end up in someone's pot of dinner"". And in literally the next scene, when Clare tries to hire Billy, his response is, ""I'm not working for a bloody white woman."" It doesn't matter to him that Clare is in Van Diemen's Land against her will - she's part of the white race that has murdered his people and taken his land. At the same time, her view of him is based on the crudest of colonial stereotypes - that all Aborigines are cannibalistic savages. Indeed, she exerts her authority over him in a not entirely dissimilar manner to how Hawkins exerts his authority over her.However, it's not exactly a spoiler to say that much of the film concerns itself with the duo coming to understand the oppression experienced by the other. Indeed, in one of the strongest scenes in the film, their first real connection comes as they sit at an open fire, each cursing their oppressors in their respective native tongue, linguistically rebelling by rejecting the colonial signifiers and codes.Hawkins, for his part, is a representative of the worst aspects of British colonialism, not just the kind of jingoistic and xenophobic thinking that made such colonialism possible, but so too the misogyny, racism, and savagery that underpinned it. Crucially, however, he's utterly banal; believing himself destined for greatness, he's incapable of accepting that he's a poor officer, an amoral and mediocre man whose lofty ambitions infinitely outweigh his negligible potential. He's a symbol of the toxic masculinity that engendered colonialism, but so too is he a flesh-and-blood person; he's an irredeemable monster, of course, but he's never a pantomime villain.Kent uses these character to examine whether revenge can lead to peace of mind. Does revenge provide fleeting satisfaction, even though it's ultimately futile, or is it a necessary and important part of the healing process? Most troublingly of all, however, she asks, irrespective of one's awareness of the heavy psychological cost of violent revenge, are there acts which are so abhorrent, inhuman, and evil that revenge is the only possible response. And if so, how does one reconcile the futility of revenge with its necessity?From an aesthetic point of view, The Nightingale looks exceptional. Kent and cinematographer Radek Ladczuk shot the film in Academy ratio (1.37:1), with the claustrophobic nearly square frame trapping the characters within it. Especially important here are the BCUs of faces, which are the film's roadmap insofar as the violence is never abstract; violence happens to a person, not a depersonalised body, and it has real consequences.Speaking of which, much has been made of that violence. At both screenings at the Sydney Film Festival, multiple audience members walked out during the second rape, and North American distributors IFC included a trigger warning independent of the MPAA rating details. Personally, although I found the scenes disturbing, I didn't think they were as bad as has been made out, and if you've survived films such as The Last House on the Left (1972), Lilja 4-ever (2002), or Irréversible (2002), you'll be fine with The Nightingale. In any case, the violence (whether sexual or otherwise) is never gratuitous, exploitative, or immature - Kent is no Quentin Tarantino; violence in her work has stomach-churning consequences, and when she chooses to show such violence, there is always a point, it's never arbitrary, violence-for-violence's-sake, or worse, violence-for-titillation's-sake.In terms of problems, as the Sydney screenings attest, the brutality on display will simply be too much for some. This is a dark, brutal, and unrelenting film and it asks a lot of the audience. Additionally, at 136 minutes, I found the film just a tad too long, and it does lapse into repetition from time to time - if the middle act had been tightened up a bit, cutting maybe 10 or 15 minutes, it would have played better. The dénouement is also somewhat rote, which is disappointing given the strength of the filmmaking leading us to that point. I wouldn't necessarily say it doesn't work, but it's the only part of the where it feels like a genre piece.These issues aside, however, this is exceptionally strong filmmaking. With not a hint of sentimentality in its unflinching depiction of the horrors inherent in the subjugation of an entire people, The Nightingale confirms Kent as a major auteur with a distinctive voice and the courage to remain true to her subject-matter, however abhorrent such truth might be.",The Nightingale
56,daoldiges,This Nightingale is Still Searching,6,31 March 2021,Viewing The Nightingale I can see much of what I think the director was going for and sometimes she comes within range but other times completely misses. The story itself is compelling but the lead character's actions are so inconsistent that it can be challenging at times to root for her regardless of how badly we might want to. The villains are drawn a bit broadly and there little nuance regarding character development. The supporting characters and performances are mostly solid but they too are often times inconsistently drawn. There is also a lot of violence and it can at times be hard to watch. I think it could have benefited from some prudent editing down from 136 minutes as well. There is some good stuff here for sure but many may find it a challenge to see it through to the end.,The Nightingale
57,anthonyjlangford,Half baked history - Truth is Mystery,3,2 November 2019,"A group of 'progressives' were sitting around one day thinking, how can we make a film that shows white men to be as evil as possible? We'll whip up every scenario; rape, pillage, murder, sexism, racism, the works. Add a woman and some people of color, who are all blameless in every regard, and presto; Sermon on a Historical Pulpit.A couple of the group were concerned. 'Shouldn't we have a little variation on the theme?' 'No, I'm in charge,' said the Boss. 'I want it black and white. Literally. We can cherry pick from history. I don't care if the central aspect is fantasy. This is fiction. Besides, people don't read books anymore. They'll take it on board verbatim.'
Some of the group looked to each other with concern, but the Head 'progressive' had a lot of power, having made a successful film and having 'Gender' financial backing already in place (fact). Hell, most of them agreed anyway and those that didn't, stayed silent.And so here you have it. A disproportionate tale that overlooks some of the greatest atrocities of the time, that of the brutal treatment of convicts, especially the men. In this film, what little we see of male convicts (mere seconds) look in good condition and almost to be having a good time!
In the trivia section, there's the mention that female convicts had the hardest time in Tasmania. That's just an outright lie. (Look up Flash Mob). The male convicts had it far worse. Female convicts did not work in iron gangs, or were flogged, nor had to work the treadmill, nor were put to death. I'm sure many were harassed or raped but they had a far easier time on the whole, as far as treatment from the System goes.
If the director wanted to tell a realistic story about Aboriginal people, she should have done so, and kept her modern man-bashing out of it. She's also done Indigenous people a huge disservice here by equating white women with the fate of the Aborigines. You see it every time a woman appears onscreen. They're all victims. Once or three times is not enough. Kent has to slam the gavel a dozen times to make sure you get the point. She even uses the boy as a means to push her agenda that men are only violent because they've been indoctrinated as children. There are some who actually believe you can feminize men by 'getting to them' when they're young. It's another obvious point that she makes repeatedly. This film is pure political statement(s) over story and fact.It's a massive insult to the thousands of convicts who died as a result of overly harsh punishment, and being overworked and underfed. Women were not treated as harshly as this in every sector, convict and free woman alike. It's a lie. Many women prospered and became business and property owners. You won't find one woman in this film that isn't subjugated by a man in some way. Kent must really despise men.
It is true that the Irish were despised by the English, but if you were a convict, it didn't matter where you came from. Here's a real quote from the day;
""Besides English, Irish, Scotch, Frenchmen, Italian, and Germans, there were Chinamen from Hong Kong, Aborigines from New Holland, West Indian blacks, Greeks, Cafres and Malays. There were Soldiers for desertion, idiots, madman, boys of seventeen, and old men of eighty. All these were indiscriminately herded together.""
In what could have been a more interesting story, Nightingale becomes another P.C. victim-hood status vehicle of disproportionate extremes, thumbing its nose at history, all to appease the stereotypes and feed the racism and sexism of the modern era. All white men bad. Everyone else, victims.In another scene a native tribe, (as they were mostly called then), attack a group holding one of their own hostage. They hold the upper hand and then just stop, even as the few protagonists retreat, they do nothing. Why give up, especially considering what just took place? The tribe would have wiped out the whole group. The entire scene is set up so we can see another woman victimized. Again. There are so many fraudulent scenarios in this film. They all add up to one immense farce.
The young Ingenious man at the center talks as though from the modern day. Why go to so much trouble to have two Irish characters talk in Gaelic, only to create such pedestrian modern dialogue?How many acts of rape and violence and murder do we need to see? We become desensitized to it. After the horror of the first two situations, everything else become rather tame. We don't have enough invested in the characters to care. We know nothing about their backgrounds. Any of them. The young woman continually puts herself in danger. In fact, if not for the stupid actions of her husband, the entire horrific events that follow could have been avoided. The system was such at the time that no one but an absolute moron would challenge the military in such a way. They literally had a privileged position considering their ex-convict status. With their own house, employment and a child, they would not have initiated this ridiculous chain of events. Granted, she was being abused, but her husband was not aware of this. A lousy setup.
It's actually easy to pick this film apart because there are so many false notes in it. Characters act in ridiculous ways. They're on one trajectory and then another. The central character is like Sarah Connor, then becomes a sniveling mess then is reborn again, without providing any hint of explanation. These are thinly drawn characters. Constant horrific violence is a strong thing to witness but that doesn't equate to good writing. There has to be something planted earlier on to give us a sense of realism when a character acts in a particular way. Not here. Not with any character.
On a positive note, Aisling Franciosi, gives a great performance. She's the standout. Sam Claflin is good too but lacking in depth as a real person. Damon Herriman is completely wasted as a near one-dimensional caricature. The 4:3 framing doesn't really add a lot but it doesn't detract either. The faded colors are quite effective.The dream sequences are the strongest part of the film, which makes you wonder if the director shouldn't stick to material she's good at. Creating fantasy/horror. This film does feel like a fantasy but not in a good way.
Historians must be laughing over this film, while shaking their heads. Of course, they won't say anything because no one can criticize a woman in today's world without being branded sexist. Movies can barely show any woman or person of color acting in a negative light without the 'Brand.' So, it doesn't happen. Directors and writers want careers, not to be shunned. So we kept getting lumped with non-nuanced, cliched, thin dramas, overly praised by critics, brainwashing the ignorant and ostracizing the rest. The only sexism here is by the director herself, with her chalk and cheese, juvenile views of the past. There's no complexity of emotion. None that make sense anyway. Billy is sympathetic. Of course, you feel for him, but even he lacks real dimension by only showing him in a constant positive light. It's merely one silly scene of violence following another. It's like a hammer, so you won't notice the lack of narrative. Its I Spit on Your Grave dressed up a period art film. It's also one of those most sexist films I've ever seen.It begins to redeem itself a little towards the end when it finally picks up pace, but by then, it's too late. Yet not without a final sermon, as though we haven't heard it dozens of times already. Kent wants to 'cure' the masculine from men. She wants to 'kill them,' as Billy says, in regards to 'men like that.' Jennifer Kent clearly sees herself as a V.I.F. Very Important Filmmaker. She wants to be the new Jane Campion. Which she isn't. She may end up in Europe or America for her next project. There's probably a job waiting for her already on The Handmaid's Tale, but she sees bigger things for herself. She sees Oscar Glory.
A tad harsh but you have to expect some sort of reaction after being brow beaten for almost two and a half hours and it's about time people starting expressing how they actually feel rather than worrying about how they'll be judged. They may find themselves in the majority. We need to call out the double standards when we see it. Sexism is not okay. Rewriting history to suit your modern agenda is not okay.It's a shame because there are thousands of incredible stories from those times. Far more jaw dropping than this nonsense, about men and women alike, from all sorts of backgrounds. The worst thing is that many people will take this story as fact, and by judging by some of the other reviews, that's already happened. I suggest people read well-referenced books and discover some breathtaking stories of actual abuse, murder, torture, misfortune, luck, love and heroism in the real deeds of convicts and settlers and indigenous people alike. A good entry point is Great Convict Stories by Graham Seal or The Colony by Grace Karskens. Or even Yarri of Gundagai. Now there's a story. Or the gruesome tale of Alexander Pearce in the film, Van Dieman's Land. At least it's mostly true. Because real life is a multi-layered mosaic that's absurd, shocking, complex, incredible and beautiful. Not a bleak, agenda driven canvas consisting of one color.
Indigenous Australians, convicts and settlers alike, all deserved better than this. Their stories are still yet to be told.",The Nightingale

59,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Bleak and horrifying but worth the watch,9,4 October 2020,"This film is definitely bleak and upsetting but such a masterclass of film making. Despite it's horrific nature, it never feels like its purely just for shock value. It feels real, raw and emotional. This film could be classified as horror (though not in the traditional genre way - except for the nightmare scenes). This is definitely more of a revenge flick through and through. Though not in schlocky way where the lead heroine says some snappy line right before killing the bad guy, smirking in glee and walking away in slow motion as the place behind her bursts into flames. Again, it feels real. This is a woman who is truly broken. And while vengeful, is still reeling from PTSD, who can still feel loss and also still see the humanity in people. She isn't perfect, her plans aren't always well thought out. But you can put yourself in her shoes and feel her desperateness. And the film doesnt just show the horrors from her perspective but also from the black aboriginals perspective as well. In a lot of ways, its just as much as their story too. The film's ending is mostly satisfying, but still very sad.Both leads Aisling Franciosi and Baykali Ganambarr are terrific. Sam Claflin is also a terrific bad guy. Jennifer Kent's directing is wonderful too. After this and The Babadook it's sad that she hasn't gotten more work or recognition. I think the film is well paced, I was never bored. There are maybe a couple of things I would tweak with the end, but overall I thought it was well done.This film definitely for me falls in the rank of a Schindler's List or a Mysterious Skin, where its worth the watch but its not one you're going to want to re-watch.",The Nightingale

We don't need to see these brutal scenes just for sheer shock factor. They don't add to the scene or enhance it, it's just there to appease the depraved people who want to watch scenes like that unfold, which is not the target audience, and they are completely unessecary.Implying is just as powerful and just as impactful as showing the scene. These Hollywood directors and writers need to look back on their forefathers who made film into art and watch their films instead of ""looking toward the future"" and making new ""woke"" films where they show violent s*xual crimes being committed instead of show us by setting a scene up and letting us listen and see. We're not stupid, nor are we blind.We're not stupid and can tell what you're implying. Not all people are daft and can tell just be seeing what's going to happen.

61,Avwillfan89,A cruel punishment,8,24 November 2019,"Two hours is a hell of a long time to sit through what is essentially, quite possibly one of the most disturbing movies of all time.What sets this film apart from the disturbing movies labeled under ""horror"", is that the excessive violence (sexual, racial, gender-based, vengeful and genocidal) pretty much all throughout this film is based on real life - The Black War in 1820s Van Dieman's Land, now known as Tasmania.Clare and Billy, the two protagonists are hated minorities in this land (An Irish female convict and a black man) who seek vengeance for the terrible crimes committed against their families and themselves. The film begs the question - how does empathy survive in such a brutal world? How do you move on after you've lost so much? And finally, does vengeance bring satisfaction?The answers are No to the last two and Yes to the first one.I don't know if I can recommend this. It felt like the director was subjecting her audience to a horrific punishment with this. It essentially left me traumatised. Even in the moments when a character says a funny line, it's always followed with a horrific act of violence straight afterwards.Other than that, the acting, especially Aisling Franciosi and Baykali Ganambar, are extraordinary.

62,TuesdayThe17th,A dry but sometimes compelling indie revenge film,6,6 February 2020,"This is a good movie but it comes across amateurish and more often than not you can see the low budget in the image quality. ""The Babadook"" was similarly anticipated but when it came out and upon watching it I was a bit disappointed with the final result of the film. I did not like that it turned out to be all psychological and not the least bit demonic or supernatural. ""The Nightingale"" came with similar hype but this time the turn out, for me, was even worse then ""The Babadook"" first off the image quality of ""The Nightingale"" was good, not great. It definitely looked like an indie film. A lower budgeted one than others. The pace is good as there are continuous tense instances and encounters but there are also some boring and just hollow scenes. This movie is not directly based off a true story, yet it is a taken from the truths of history. The message is VERY powerful, however, the delivery is lacking. Though typical, I like that Jennifer Kent directed this story with a strong female lead and I liked that she gave Billy his own redemption in the end, allowing level ground for our two protagonists, but I can always tell when a horror or thriller film is directed by a woman. Solely centered around film and strictly based off of what i've seen, whether it be Natalia Leite's ""M.F.A"", Coralie Fargeat's ""Revenge"", or even the Soska sister's films, female directed horror/thriller movies always seem to be missing something that truly connects us to their films. I was very excited to see Jennifer Kent break that mold and truly impress me. I was a bit let down.. I will say that ""The Nightingale is very violent and unforgiving. It is not ultra-violent like some are saying but it is violent. There is one scene in particular in the beginning that, while not bloody, can be very very upsetting to some.
Especially women. I myself am a proud parent of 2. One is a beautiful 4 year old girl and the other one is in heaven after passing away just hours after being born... This movie deeply upset my wife.. To say the least.... Other than that scene there is another scene in the woods where Clare goes after the first of the group of men. The wounded young man. This scene IS ultra-violent but it is the MOST violent scene of the film so if you expect the rest of the violence to be on the same level, guess again, as the rest of the mayhem barely holds a candle to this scene. The movie felt uneven with its violence. One minute I was able to see the cheapness in the blows and blood and the next minute my jaw was on the floor from violence overload... Odd creative choices and off putting directing makes this movie a bit mundane but overall it is a good film but a below average period piece.",The Nightingale

64,isantistao,These Feminist Revenge Movies Go To Far,1,14 February 2021,"I love a good revenge story and am not usually bothered by hardcore violence in movies but these feminist revenge movies go to far trying to show the types of atrocities that can have happened to women in the past and creating gratuitous violent revenge stories surrounding them. If you feel you have to put that much rape and other disturbing acts of violence in a movie to drive your point home, it must not be a very strong point. And anyone who makes this kind of film, or can not only sit through it but can enjoy it, is a seriously disturbed person who needs some intensive therapy. Seriously I had to turn it off right before the third rape was about to happen. I just can't imagine the type of mind who would make such an abhorrent movie, or enjoy it. And again, this is coming from someone who loves revenge films and is not usually bothered by hardcore violence. But there is a serious line being crossed in this movie. And I can't imagine why they feel the need to put these things on film and expect other's to watch them. Anyone involved in such a film should really be asking themselves a lot of personal questions as to why they would do such a thing. And anyone getting enjoyment out of this is seriously mentally ill.",The Nightingale

68,Mike_T-Little_Mtn_Sound_Archive,Simply superb. Period.,10,23 November 2019,"As many of the other positive reviews note, this is a heavy film. I won't rehash the narrative, as others have provided synopsis', but a few comments about the film itself couldn't hurt.Frankly, not a single facet of this film could have been improved. The acting, directing, script, cinematography, editing, sound, post-production...you name it...they are all superb. The female lead, Aisling Franciosi, is absolutely incredible and puts forth an Oscar-worthy performance. The entirety of the more than 2 hours, nearly all of it with her, is spellbinding. The myriad of emotions demanded for this role were staggering, and she nailed every single one of them. I cannot recall a more convincing female lead in the recent past. Her co-protagonist, Baykali Ganambarr, is equally as impressive, though his character's emotional swayings are nowhere near as numerous. The role of bad guy, played by Sam Claflin, was superbly convincing, as he truly makes the viewer hate him. None of this would be possible without a script and screenplay which allowed the characters the ability to work so well within the confines of the ensemble. Truly remarkable for such a heavy film to be met with success by the entire ensemble. As an aside, I don't recall another movie with this amount of spoken Aboriginal dialog; it was extremely interesting to listen to.The cinematography was extraordinary. The film was shot on location in Tasmania, and very beautiful. The sheer length of the film, what it captures, and the story behind it all make the camera work and planning all the more impressive. Similarly, the sound is wonderfully expansive and clear, taking advantage of the natural surroundings as an aid in the storytelling. The editing and post-production work are also top notch. When films are seamless, without leaving an audience questioning ""who,"" ""what,"" ""when,"" or ""how,"" that's often an indication of good production, and The Nightengale is no exception.None of this would matter without the incredible directorial work of Jennifer Kent; only her second directing attempt, following her debut with The Babadook. Talk about shades of a different color! Her approach to color/light/sound & emotion, understanding how to use violence as a means to express emotion, the juxtaposition of good vs evil, and the rape of the natural world are all MASSIVE undertakings, yet she makes it look effortless by her storytelling sensibilities and the ability to capture revenge as an innate permutation of human existence. While The Babadook was an entertaining film, she has set the bar high for whatever her next film is.As others have mentioned, this is a violent film. I don't agree that it's as gratuitous as the films of Tarantino, or as gory, but there are some very intense scenes that weigh extremely heavily on the tone of the piece, and would be difficult for someone to watch who does not deal well with blood, violence, or some of the more culturally taboo issues of rape and killing of children. That said, and to restate...it is not gratuitous or exploitative in any way.All in all, this is just a superb film and a superb story. It is certainly not one that will appeal to everyone, but for those who can tolerate violence as a means of telling a story, and stomach seeing some of the historical atrocities that occurred in Australia during the early 19th century, not to mention just a good old fashioned revenge tale, this will definitely be one for the books.",The Nightingale
69,babyjaguar,THE NIGHTINGALE: A CLASSIC.. OF AUSTRALIAN BEGINNINGS?,9,20 August 2019,"This showstopper (brilliantly directed and written by Jennifer Kent) tells the early colonial beginnings of Australian race, gender and class divisions. It circles around an Irish family. Their ""happy"" beginnings, living in a life of labor exploitation by English soldiers. Their family ends up with strategic encounter with the soldiers, leaving Claire to seek revenge .Then Billy, an aboriginal is enlisted to become her scout in finding those who can inflicted tragedy into her family. Other commonalities ensued upon both of them to go into the wilderness.

70,Condemned-Soul,"Replete with period detail and ferocious imagery, 'The Nightingale' uses its harsh setting to deliver a brutal and powerful tale of revenge.",8,5 August 2020,"In 19th century Tasmania, Clare, a young Irish convict, seeks revenge upon a sadistic British soldier and his troops for a brutal attack on her and her family. Enlisting the help of an Aboriginal tracker, she pursues the soldiers through the rugged wilderness...Writer-director Jennifer Kent ensures 'The Nightingale' isn't an easy watch, but it's also a disciplined approach to the revenge formula. It's a meditation on the consequences of violence while also showing that the price of seeking such vengeance is expensive on the soul. This is encapsulated in Aisling Franciosi's gut-wrenching central performance.One of the film's best elements is the connection that develops between Clare and her tracker, Billy. Both have very different backgrounds, but each have suffered similar acts of cruelty from the same enemies. They are minorities in this land, whether it's their home or not. Their relationship grows gradually and organically, and it's pleasing to watch it become an unbreakable bond by the end.Adequate time is also spent with the villains, with Sam Claflin putting in a good, against-type performance as a Lieutenant, and the versatile Damon Herriman as his boorish second-in-command. Both are despicable men, and the more time you spend with them, the more you hope justice (punishment) catches up with them.Overall, 'The Nightingale' is a very well made revenge thriller that feels horrifyingly realistic and historically honest. It forces you to watch a lot of awful violence and digs its hooks in deep, dragging you along for a bleak ride; but the attention to its main characters and how violence has a long-lasting affect on them is the most important part of this bruising experience.8/10",The Nightingale

79,cappiethadog,Birds fly,10,11 September 2019,"What is ""The Babadook"" anyway; the titular monster from a children's pop-up book in Jennifer Kent's 2014 feature film debut? Some people theorize that it's the figment of a grieving mother's imagination. After all, only Amelia(Essie Davis) sees this black humanoid with a top hat. Samuel(Noah Wiseman), her son, verifies the babadook's existence, but we never see the creature from his point-of-view. Amelia's cracked psyche, which started cracking after the loss of her husband in a fatal car wreck, is clearly delineated by the filmmaker as being independent of the small family's supernatural household events. Something is wrong with Amelia before the babadook possesses her body. She's bipolar. The monster's occupation weaponizes her mental illness. She nearly chokes Samuel to death. The mother vomits black ink. That's not a bag of licorice she's regurgitating. The monster is loose. This ambiguity surrounding the babadook's legitimacy as a corporeal entity is settled, finally, when some unseen force pulls Samuel up the staircase, and then maneuvers him with a sharp right into his bedroom. Once inside, the boy is slammed repeatedly against the wall. Unless mother or son have telekinetic powers, the babadook, by all appearances, is real. Like an exorcism, Samuel had stroked his mother's cheek. The filmmaker wants us to think that it was a mother's love for her biological child out from her body. ""The Nightingale"" however, Jennifer Kent's second film, is a game-changer; it recontextualizes the canon of a national cinema. This Australian period piece about the colonizer and colonized begs us to answer the question: ""What if the babadook is mischaracterized as a monster?"" It begs another question: ""What if this black figure is human; the colonized incognito? Its unconditional evil; its malevolence, in actuality, could be righteously-motivated, a radical protestation from the hereafter. That was no auto-exorcism. Amelia doesn't love her son that much. Even Claire(Hayley McElhinney), her sister, senses it. The babadook abdicates the host body because Samuel is an innocent; a naively post-colonial boy. The babadook knows this woman's heart. It hears their conversations. When Samuel says: ""I love you, mom,"" she responds, ""Me, too,"" which bespeaks of a mutual, but disproportionate love. Inside her skin, the babadook exposes Amelia, getting the widow to confess that she loved her husband more. ""The Nightingale"", in essence, tells the same story, but genre-wise, Kent employs historical drama instead of horror as the storytelling vehicle for her institutionalized illiberality-charged dramaturgy. Jennifer Kent, a New Queensland native, unflinchingly, depicts in graphic detail the massacre of the indigenous people in Van Diemen's land, a blood-soaked history that often is glossed over or goes unmentioned in school textbooks. The filmmaker may remind some of the late author Iris Chang, whose masterwork ""*** **** ** *******"" recast the war hero as war criminal. The Chinese-American writer wasn't shy. Kent is cut from the same cloth. ""The Nightingale"" tells the story of genocide.Any film that delves into the colonizer/colonized binary can't be examined without making mention of Nicolas Roeg's ""Walkabout"", the 1971 film that introduced the outback to art house moviegoers. Seen in a vacuum, ""Walkabout"" remains enigmatic as ever. The girl(Jennifer Agutter), nameless, as are all the characters, reacts with an indifference that's confounding, like she was a cipher instead of flesh and blood, when a family picnic goes horribly awry. Her father(John Meillon) shoots himself point blank in the head, but not before undergoing a psychotic break, firing a pistol at his son(Luke Roeg), an act of attempted filicide that extends to his daughter, too. Arguably, the girl puts on a brave face for the boy, but even in private, she remains oddly detached from the tragedy of her father's suicide. Conversely, in ""The Nightingale, everybody has names. Claire Caroll(Aisling Francioli), an Irishwoman enslaved by the British army, grieves over her husband Aidan(Michael Sheasby) and infant daughter after Lieutenant Hawkins(Sam Claflin) and his military subordinates cold-bloodedly murders them in a home invasion. The lieutenant violates his indentured mistress in front of her husband, inciting Aidan to assail him. In a kangaroo court, the British army lieutenant can allege that he shot the victim in self-defense. While Sergeant Ruse(Damon Herriman) repeats his superior's deviant actions, the wee one's crying arrives at an abrupt stop when Private Jago(Harry Greenwood) bangs the baby against a wall. Before they leave, the private hits Claire's head with the butt of his gun. Left for dead, like The Bride(Uma Thurman) in Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill: Volume Two"", the battered but not defeated Irishwoman plots revenge against those who wronged her. Claire has just cause to settle the score, and yet, the filmmaker reapportions some of her agency with ""the other"". The woman on a horse is neither in Ireland nor England; the horsewoman with a vendetta is hunting human prey on a neutral site. Similarly, The Bride kills O-Ren Ishii(Lucy Liu) on foreign soil, in Okinawa, but America's enemy was Japan, not the sovereign island nation. Hattori Hanzo(Sonny Chiba), a master artisan of high-end samurai swords, unretires, working with fire and steel for the last time, so he can help Beatrix(a.k.a. The Bride) vicariously kill Bill(David Carradine), his former pupil, out of personal, not political reasons. Jennifer Kent reworks Tarantino's tale of y-chromosome revenge in ""The Nightingale"" as a feminist, and then, as a political activist, like a Rambo-ized John Sayles. Jago, Ruse, Hawkins: These would be the names on Claire's hit list, in order of importance. A woman's agency, taken for granted as a bedrock for comeuppance in any standard vigilante film, undergoes a triangulating usurpation, when Claire hires a black tracker, ""Billy""(Baykali Ganambarr), to help her navigate the fecund vegetation of the bush. What starts off as Claire's pilgrimage, a visceral articulation of the age-old schism between Britain and Ireland, when Jago, the baby-killer, becomes her first and last victim, gives way to Billy's fruitless crusade for sovereignty. When Malanga(a.k.a. Billy) discovers Uncle Charlie(Charlie Jampijinpa Brown), his mentor, left behind for vultures to pick at on a foggy mountaintop, he transforms into The Groom; his bloodlust encompasses then surpasses Claire's own pursuit of vigilante justice. The ramifications that derive from Lieutenant Hawkins' violent dispatch of the black man's mentor are more far-ranging than another theological clash between neighboring European island-nations. Claire finally sees the bigger picture; sees her nescience of the fact that she is part of the problem. ""The Nightingale"" is Blackbird's story.The autochthonous people are nowhere to be found in the opening minutes of ""Walkabout"". Over the soundtrack, however, their presence can be heard, as digeridoo-based music is used by the filmmaker as juxtaposition against Sydney's hoi polloi going about their own business on a typical day in the big city. In the Nicolas Roeg film, one can see the building blocks for ""The Babadook"". At an all-girls school, the females chant ""buh-buh-buh-buh,"" as part of their voice lesson, and the first two buhs, in isolation, arguably, forms the first half of the film's namesake: The babadook, an ancient spirit representative of the colonized as poltergeist that terrorizes Amelia and her young son. In ""The Nightingale"", books are hard to come by, and the literacy rate is low, but where there is a campfire, there are campfire stories. Sergeant Ruse points to their indigenous tracker and poisons Eddie(Charlie Shotwell), an impressionable orphan, with the fiction about Charlie being a cannibal. Jennifer Kent, by introducing aboriginals in ""The Nightingale"", forces us to reconsider ""The Babadook"" as the work of an auteur. The mother reads to her son a story about the ""big bad wolf"", a stand-in, perhaps, for the indigenous people that preceded the settlers. The wolf is black. Aborigines are ""black"". The babadook is back in black, showing up out of thin air on Samuel's bookshelf. Amelia, in the final showdown with the babadook, screams: ""This is my house! You're trespassing in my house!"" Reduced to a pile of clothes, the babadook reveals to Amelia its true face; all we see is the entity's white light shining back in her face. The babadook screams and takes shelter in the Vanek family basement. Amelia understands that she is the trespasser; the onus is on her to live alongside the babadook in peace and harmony. Jennifer Kent, with ""The Nightingale"", suggests the genre, the horror film, as a possible answer to the father's shocking decision to kill his family in the outback.""The Nightingale"" is a prequel of sorts. Van Diemen's Land is Malanga's home, not Claire's, and not Claire's enemies. The settlers are killing all the livestock, Malanga complains to the Irishwoman; killing his people, too, he adds. Similarly, in ""Walkabout"", settlers roar past the tracker in a jeep, hunting for trophies, not meat. Black Boy(David Gulpilil) remembers, belatedly, who The Girl's ancestors are. The girl returns home to the big city without him. Now married, she reminisces about the past; about her time in the outback with Black Boy, swimming nude in the oasis. Claire, on the other hand, in ""The Nightingale"", reaches the beach with Malanga and sings a Gaelic love song. She dreams bout the future, about her and the black boy, far, far away from the land down under.Amelia collects worms for the babadook to eat.She is his nightingale.",The Nightingale
80,RMurray847,"A tough film to watch, but worth the effort",7,17 May 2021,"Vengeance-based movies can provide some visceral fun. Seeing the ""bad guys"" get their due is such a trope that it's hard to imagine anything new being brought to the theme. Whether as gloriously over-the-top as JOHN WICK or as gory as the queasy-making REVENGE (the 2017 movie), these films usually begin with some horrific acts, followed by the surviving hero finding the inner strength to launch their quest for bloody vengeance. Then a series of satisfying killings of the now frightened bad guys, ending in some kind of redemption or resolution for the hero (who may or may not survive and may or may not realize that vengeance isn't always as sweet as hoped).THE NIGHTINGALE is a film that carefully follows these basic outlines. And yet it also takes us to some unexpected places. Set in Tasmania in the early 1800's, when Australia was still a prison colony, run by British troops, we meet the Irish Clare (Aisling Franciosi), who, even though a prisoner, is working hard to build a new life with her husband Aidan and their baby. She hopes to receive the long-promised freedom that Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin) dangles over her head. Not surprisingly, the nasty Hawkins enjoys lording it over the defiant Clare, who must constantly quell her fiery temper and innate dislike of the British in general and Hawkins and his little gang in specific. He mistreats her, but when he rapes her, things quickly spiral out of control and it all culminates in one of the most horrific scenes you're likely to see in a vengeance movie. (And this movie is a great example of how gore is a cheap substitute for true horror, that doesn't require us to see gory details but to see the faces of the survivors and to hear the sounds of brutality.)Hawkins and his men soon set out on a trip through the heavily forested inner island, to reach the coast and for Hawkins to claim a potential promotion to Captain. And unbeknownst to him, Clare is hot on his trail, bent on vengeance. (This is not much a spoiler; this all happens in the first 15 - 20 minutes.) Clare is led by native Billy (Baykali Ganambarr, who is terrific), and as much as the film is a vengeance movie, it is also an exploration of racism and friendship. The treatment of the native population is an under-current throughout THE NIGHTINGALE and gives the film extra resonance. Yes, Clare is on a very personal mission, but the abuses and horror she has endured is seen as just a tiny part of the desecration the country and its people endure. And in the end, the most satisfying story of this film is not the vengeance Clare embarks on but the developing relationship between her and Billy. They bond in ways unexpected, and the only glimmers of humor or light that this film has comes from their interactions. It's a gray movie, unrelenting in its grimness, yet brightened by this unlikely friendship.Aisling Franciosi, as Clare, is really a marvel. We've certainly seen characters with hatred burning in their eyes, bent on revenge...but the fire that compels her feels very specific and believable. Lest we ever forget what she has endured, we need only look at her face. It's almost like the hatred is really all that's keeping her sane or even alive. For a film like this to work, we really need our lead to be convincing. She knocks that out of the park.The film is not perfect. Sam Claflin's Hawkins does enough terrible things that we certainly hate him. But I found his performance to be somewhat cardboard. (And honestly, much of the work he's done fits that bill.) We don't really get a sense of what inner demons drives him to what he does, or even if he's so empty that he has no demons. And occasionally, the pacing of the film drags. It's a vengeance film, in the end, and it needs to move with some momentum. But the momentum flags at times near the end, and the climax, while surprising an admirable, isn't as pulse-pounding as it should be.THE NIGHTINGALE is a tough film to watch, but it is well-worth viewing. Grim and gritty, but shot through with moments of grace. It's a journey worth taking and enduring.",The Nightingale

This film was set up similarly to great films like I Spit On Your Grave or Last House on the Left, but the Nightingale was superior because was a step above and beyond. Instead of the girl just going off and killing the bad guys, in the Nightingale, she first had to find them. It was a road adventure movie in the wilderness as well as revenge. Great stuff. Along the way, the bad guys kept getting meaner and nastier and more violent, and that is great writing...it made us in the audience hate them more and more. It made us want to see Claire kill them all more and more. But we don't get that. Instead she chickens out, runs away, yells at the bad guy, then sings to him. I suppose this is to show that deep down, she didn't have it in her. But movies are not made for this. Movies are made for us the audience to enjoy.

83,SimonD1900,"Lighthearted, uplifting and heartwarming adventure period piece!",8,2 April 2020,"This is a movie that really portrays how friendly and kind we humans can be towards each other. Really inspiring stuff.Off course I express myself in extrem irony here. But in honesty, this is a grim story. But also beautiful and to me it was true. The movie might be a bit long and drag a bit in moments, some scenes perhaps unnecessary, but at the same time, there is always something happening and you get to know the characters. And they do evolve during the run time also. I think it's really worth seeing to the end, to really appreciate as its whole. And it is a grim, but also a fantastically crafted film.I would now want to adress some complaints I've read about this movie. One is, that it contains to much unnecessary and unrealistically violence. I would say that this is very much not the case at all. Yes, every event in this movie is made up and it follows a narrative that some times is made for the purpose to have a movie plot, it is after all a movie. And it does have a purpose to make commentary on society today, a society that has been built upon the evil nature of humans and great injustices, preferably done by men (I am a man myself and can see that without getting personally offended), which I think it did sublimely and effectively, it was on one hand obvious but not preachy. But besides that, violence of this kind, have been going on as far back as you can go in human history, on every continent, on a magnitude noone could ever grasp. So it's not unrealistic in that sense either.I also read something that someone thought the actress Aisling Franciosi did a bad job. What? She didn't show enough emotions or something like that, was the statement. Well, she actually showed amazing broad range of emotions. Just beacuse she didn't break down and cried after the bad stuff happened to her, doesn't have to be unrealistic emotion wise, the brain can actually completely shut off when things happens to you that are too traumatic to process, it's actually far from uncommon. Instead she is filled with resolve and anger, she wants to get stuff done, but she has absolutely no expirence in either tracking or combat, and I appreciate the realism of that, some revenge movies just makes the protagonist unstoppable. She potrayd all this very well. And it's also impressive how she held up during this movie, must been a strain of a performance to carry this emotional and physical movie, if Leonardo got an Oscar for Revenant, what is this then?Also have to give credit to Baykali Ganambarr, that takes on an emotional role and to me is a very likeable and kind of unique character in the movie. And everyone else in the cast, no one performed bad here and every character is intresting in some way. Perhaps that the main villan is a bit much ""villiany"" But still i think it works well for the movie and doesn't ruin it at all in any means.Over all, this was to me, a really really good movie. More then that even. I would even say it's a absolut fantastic movie. And it made me realize my emotional plumming system is still intact, which is a very good thing. I would recommend this movie to anyone, with only the warning that it is violent and with the notion that it is a bit long, so be prepared for that. Other then that, ""enjoy""?",The Nightingale

85,Amthermandes,"You go, girl",9,18 September 2021,"A gripping, violent tale of tragedy, loss, hardship, bonding, and vengeance, The Nightingale follows a woman who has been down the rough road her whole life, yearning to seek justice against the men who wronged her.The film is like if you crossed ""The Brave One"" with ""Van Diemen's Land,"" and added a twist of the non-comedic side of ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" (because there is absolutely NOTHING funny about this film). It's an engaging, robust story, not for the feint of heart. There are some heavy themes here, and one could argue that the lead character is following a dark, damning path that changes her from being a victim to an anti-hero, motivated by pure evil hatred. Despite that, it's easy to be sympathetic (or even empathetic for some viewers) towards her.I don't see it so much as a story of revenge, good vs. Evil, or even racism, as much as I see it as a story of learning to see life from the perspective of someone from a completely different culture or background. Empathy, is one of mankind's greatest virtues.It's a fantastic film. Who knows what the motivations were for writing, directing, and creating this movie, but it's a solid piece for anyone who is not afraid of depictions of how horrible people can be to each other.

89,pazu7,A unique combination of beauty and brutality.,7,26 February 2020,"(spoilers) I'll admit I almost stopped watching after the first rape. It was so blunt and matter-of-fact that I thought the filmmaker was just being gratuitous and that it could only go downhill from there. But I kept on and after a while realized that the film's brutality was just a way of setting the lay of the land. It was the directors way of wiping the sheen off the usual cinematic treatment of violence and abuse, where the camera pans away and allows the imagination to fill in the gaps. That's how I saw it, anyway. (Although I still think that when she smashes the soldiers face with a rock, it would have been better just to see the blood splashing onto her face than see his head being smashed. Her rage was the subject of that scene.) By the time I finished I felt the harsh depictions were essential, and had their own sort of beauty. Because this film is a weird blend of beauty and horror. It's also blatantly honest about colonialism, racism and the degradation of women. I didn't know that it was written and directed by the same woman who wrote and directed The Babadook, which is also a unique and difficult film, and a favorite of mine. The Nightingale isn't on my favorite's list YET... but it is unique and captivating in it's combination of beauty and raw brutality. And I will watch it again.",The Nightingale

91,Mike_O_Dwyer,Flawed Revenger,7,27 October 2019,"Set in the 19th Century The Nightingale takes place on the fringes of the Tasmanian wilderness, an alien land to the English white colonialists who think nothing of abusing their Irish prisoners and even less of the native aboriginals who are treated as less than human.Aisling Franciosi's character, Clare, a convict, is regularly sexually abused by her captors, led by Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin) and his subordinate, Sergeant Ruse (Damon Herriman). Hawkins promises Clare her freedom only to keep denying it, manipulating her to keeping her rapes secret from her husband and son. Hawkins is an abysmal human, and rightly passed over for promotion by his own superior, although with a vague promise that if he manages to make the trek north through the wilderness in a few days there may be a position available. In a fit of rage he, Ruse, and another accomplice, Private Jago, prepare to make their way north but stumble upon Clare, her husband, and baby as they're preparing to escape. Clare is raped by Hawkins and Ruse. Her husband is killed. Her baby is thrown against the wall and killed by Jago because he can't quieten it. Clare is left for dead.It's an intense first 30 minutes or so, told with a detached and neural point of view that doesn't need to sensationalise matters with gratuitous soft-core flesh. The sheer banality of common-place rape is expressed almost exclusively by the actors' faces, and it's all the more powerful for that. Franciosi's soul-destroying torment is palpable, and almost unbearable. Her anger and rage at what has befallen her and her family because of one man's weak character, his manipulative toxicity and cowardice poisoning everyone about him, drives her pursuit into the unknown.What follows after that much intensity is a vengeful walkabout through an alien landscape, accompanied by her own guide, Billy, a young black man (Baykali Ganambarr). Both of them come to understand the reasons why they each hate the English, but in their understanding they struggle to get beyond the racial divide. It's an uneasy alliance that Ganambarr and Franciosi work hard for, and how their relationship develops and overcomes adversity is what gives the film some much needed heart.Unfortunately, for all its brutality - massively overhyped - the pursuit itself struggles. The film itself becomes lost in the wilderness amongst a series of vignettes about various people who are encountered along the way. Momentum is lost when the focus shifts to Hawkins and Ruse, and I'm not sure what the purpose is in spending any more time with them than necessary, except to reinforce how awful they are - which seems redundant given their initial crimes.In the end, The Nightingale disappoints somewhat because you walk away feeling it really had something worth saying and then it fluffed its lines.",The Nightingale

100,gooseshaw,"Good movie, but it can be a tough watch.",7,6 April 2020,"The Nightingale is a frustratingly good revenge film set in a hell-hole where terrible people run rampant committing terrible crimes that tend not to see justice. I tend to like more romanticized historical films because the more real content, like this movie, tend to leave me feeling sick and depressed. I almost threw up during one particular scene which physically threw me back.The movie has fairly powerful parts to it, though I'm not so sure it's impact will be felt years down the road, which is a shame. It's well-acted and well-executed, but it just doesn't have enough for me personally.When I think of films that contain brutal and unwatchable subject matter, I think of a spectrum with Death Wish (1974) and Silence (2017) on either end. One essentially uses its graphic content as an excuse for violent, vengeful action, while the other, at least in my opinion, contains a more powerful story and message. This film is somewhere in the middle.I still recommend it of course, though I can absolutely say, I never want to see it again. I don't like movies like this.

102,PopCulturedwithMovieMike,Brutally Powerful,9,23 November 2020,"In 2014, Jennifer Kent made the transition from character TV actress to director of a feature-length film. That film was The Babadook, not only one of the best horror films of the decade but one of the very best films of the decade period. The film was showered with critical praise and landed Kent on the shortlist of ""it"" directors. Then nothing.Kent could have easily jumped at the first studio horror film or blockbuster that came her way. Instead, she decided to write and direct The Nightingale about a young Irish convict woman named Clare who is hell-bent on revenge for a terrible act of violence committed against her family.What follows is one of the most brutal and unflinching films I've ever seen. There were some reports that during its festival run, there were counselors present for audience members after they left the theater. If hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, then you don't even want to know what happens to a woman that is way more than scorned.What makes The Nightingale stand out from other revenge films is how we see how the main character's actions affect her. No matter how vengeful Clare is, it doesn't make her feel any better once she gets her revenge. I really appreciated the climax of the film because it didn't go where I thought it was going to go.The other major theme in The Nightingale is race. Throughout the film, we see how the British Troops treat the Aboriginal population. Those aspects of the film might feel heavy-handed, but I couldn't help but think that the way the aboriginals were treated was probably even more brutal than depicted in the film. Jennifer Kent is a really talented filmmaker and if it takes her 4 years to make her next film, I will be patient.",The Nightingale

The actress and actor who are on the trail of the disgusting perpetrators of a murder and rape are both excellent imho and inhabit their roles superbly.

Through a common enemy, Clare and Billy find themselves dependent on each other's strength to face the challenges in front of them. It's a raw film, and will certainly make you uncomfortable at times, but that's what helps make it effective, mostly.While often a very tense film, the third act does seem to linger on a bit and there are several major points where characters make decisions that don't fit their current state of mind. I appreciate the writer's attempt at some nuance but mostly this film portrays all the colonials as ""the devil"" with the exception of a few.Overall it started off well, but lost its muster by the end.

Though it's not all about the violence and vengeance, it has a lot of beauty in it as well, you just have to open yourself up to see both sides instead of focusing only on the strong intensity and the mindset of anger and where that anger leads.If you want to enjoy this movie best, then prepare for tensity and heavy emotions and unfriendly behaviour from human to human.

107,BestBenedikt,"Tough to watch, but very rewarding",8,23 December 2019,"THE NIGHTINGALE may be the most unsuitable film ever for Christmas season. But it for sure is one hell of a follow-up for Australian director Jennifer Kent, dealing with an Irish convict's thirst for revenge in the Tasmanian wilderness in 1825.What this film does so well is exploring the dynamic of preconceptions and power relations in a very restrained setting. Except for maybe the main antagonist no one in this film is pure evil. You get where every person is coming from and what specific social relations they are shaped by and just try to make the best out of it all. Even the female protagonist is no moralistic do-gooder as one could expect given the plot synopsis, since she also sets explicit boundaries against the Aborigines while simultaneously belonging to a marginalized social group herself.And yes, the film is very violent and a tough watch at times, but the violence always progresses naturally, adds to the general feel of authenticity and is never once exploitative and ostentatious. Moreover, every outburst of violence has an impact on the individuals involved - whether it deepens an escalating cycle of abuse or acts as a cathartic incident, maybe even questioning the concept of revenge as a whole.At times Kent's newest film surpasses her debut THE BABADOOK, having a stronger sense of urgency and defying genre conventions. And while it's definitely less accessible and maybe even deterrent to some people, those who make it through are rewarded with a genuinely touching ending at last.",The Nightingale

I just felt dirty; a world this savage just seems so unimaginable to me.This is kind of like I Spit On Your Grave, but hundreds of years ago.My only gripe is that it seems to run for a bit long.

On the lives and treatment of natives and convicts, On how little a life was worth, and people could be killed on a whim. And on the general appalling viciousness of the affair.True, there are a few fairly grueling depictions of violence, but thankfully, and in contrast to what we're used to see, they're never meant to sensationalize. But rather presented in a ""matter of factual"" manner. Like it might have happened in reality. Also, strong, committed and convincing performances from everyone involved.A film, I happened to find, that leaves an impression and lingers on. An unusually honest one, too, it seems to be.Edit:Upon second viewing, quite possibly the best film I've seen in quite a while. Both in terms of film and of story it sets out to tell.

So she hires an aboriginal native as a guide, and at gun point, they track down the soldiers.This is not a revenge film as the description may suggest. The movie begins as a conflict of person vs person. But as the story begins to unravel, the real conflict is bigger than any one person or one group. It's a story of frantic survival. It's an exploration of the uncanny darkside where the natives are left to survive in consequence of colonialism. There is a scene in the film where the Irish wife and the aborigine find a common bond in their hate for the British who killed both of their families. But still, to live in the social world, they both have to accept the hegemony set by the British Colonial. And vice versa as the natives way of life begin to mirror the role presented for them through hegemony.How do you describe a film like this? How do you describe ""slavery""?

They did terrible things and were horrible people, but the director felt the need to keep reminding viewers just how repulsive the men were.I understand it from a writer's perspective (I think): you need to keep the audience just as mad as the protagonist to root for the eventual catharsis of revenge. Over a two hour movie, it can become easy to almost forget why this big dramatic chase is happening to begin with because the visceral anger of the first unthinkable act has worn off. But too much of this reminding and the bad guys stop becoming real life pieces of caca, and more so characters in a morality play i.e. lust or anger personified.I really enjoyed the Babadook, two completely movies of course, but this one wasn't as good in my opinion.",The Nightingale

The scene about the native lady is also unlikely, the native klan doesnt even fight back, thats very bad writing. Sure the girl cant do it, but the natives would have been experienced killers. The guide was also handled like he was a child. The english should not have been given so much lucky breaks just too prove they are low life scum. Like all bad movies the victim has a speech to the perpetrator then they walk away living happily ever after. The native has to take care of it not the victimized girl who is always dissapointing.

114,george-841,"Good film, quite violent, overly long and somewhat improbable",8,11 August 2019,"I enjoyed this film but it's not perfect. I do think it's longer than it needs to be There is some serious violence although none of it is really extreme and, as my stranger/neighbor seated near me at the theatre said at the end, ""not like it's out of place.""There are some implausibilities. Like the heroine's horse. It's explained early on that even though she's still technically indentured her husband has completed his sentence and is working for himself and was able to buy her a horse, complete with saddle, saddlebags, holster for the rifle, etc. They make clear at one point that this is a very valuable asset since she offers to sell it for ""ten pounds"" and give the proceeds to the aboriginal if he helps her, emphasizing that with that much money, he wouldn't have to work again (I do believe she makes that statement.)(Also in the course of several days journeying we never see them feeding or watering said mount. Maybe all this occurred off-screen but since our heroes regularly discuss the need to find food for themselves, I'm not sure they had any for the horse, especially when at one point she loses the small bag that evidently did have some supplies.)In any case, it's clear that a personal mount is very valuable SINCE NOBODY ELSE SEEMS TO HAVE ONE, not even the lieutenant and his underlings when they undertake a hazardous journey in pursuit of his promotion. Not even the other ""chain gangs"" she runs into en route when she pursues them. It seems like the horse is a plot necessity so she can escape from the dangers she encounters en route, which she does more than once. This seems contrived to me. It's beyond me why British officers serving in the Tasmanian outback would not have access to horses. Other than that this would have undermined the story.I also don't understand why she is left alive after the soldiers kill her husband and baby. In fact, the ensign is ordered by the lieutenant to kill her yet he only hits her with the butt of his rifle, and she wakes up a day later to the nightmare her life has become. If these soldiers are ready to rape her in front of her husband, kill him and then kill her baby to stop it crying, it's clear they wouldn't have hesitated to kill her as well. In fact, that was the lieutenant's stated intention. Well, I do understand why she is left alive... the writer would not have had a story to tell, but it does seem improbable. And that troubles this viewer.The ending is enigmatic, and there's no way to avoid that since this wasn't going to end well for her, after being involved in the murders of two soldiers in their rooms and really having no way to escape justice. If the film ran a few more minutes, it would have to depict her being hanged.The only character who maybe survives to enjoy the remains of a happy life is maybe... her horse?The cinematography is excellent, the scenery beautiful and haunting in spots and the music and singing do contribute greatly to the story . A film well worth viewing, IF you can tolerate some rough rape scenes and some bloody shooting and stabbing. Watch the credits since they explain that apparently a Tasmanian language was created for the movie, based on a ""real"" language. Interesting..",The Nightingale
115,OlgaGorelik,Shocking violence. Heartbreaking aftermath. Beautiful love story. Powerful history lesson. All in one. Worth every tear.,10,10 August 2019,"I want to start by saying that I did not find The Nightingale excessively violent. And believe me, I hate movie violence. But I feel like I've seen trailers for action flicks that had more. Plenty of TV shows do as well. Maybe not rape, but still. Perhaps the reason it didn't feel excessive was because the movie doesn't dwell on it. It avoids gore, except in a few places where it really was necessary. Not only is there absolutely nothing gratuitous, each of those scenes has in it so much more than just ""oh, look, they kill"", ""oh, look, they rape."" For example, both women who are raped are mothers. Both are torn away from their very young children in the process. So, not only are they brutally violated, I was horrified thinking what must have been going through their minds knowing that the children are out there, helpless, crying, and they can't protect them.At the center of the story is an Irish convict named Clare (Aisling Franciosi) and an aboriginal man named Billy (Baykali Ganambarr) whom she convinces to guide her through the wilderness to the men lead by Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin) who ""took something from her"". But it is nowhere near a simple revenge story.The film offers a history lesson that might be more affecting than anything with names and dates. It's a sharp and clear look at what violence does to people, not just the victims, but the perpetrators too. It's easy to see what happened there earlier. White people take the land, the aboriginals fight them, soldiers brought in to fight them, the aboriginals fight back, and it spiraled on and on turning the whole place into the land of ""bad spirits"" that we find in the film. We see people that are dead, even if their bodies are still alive. The white woman holding a baby while looking at her burning house. An older aboriginal tracker forced to witness horrific violence against one of his own and then keep guiding the very perpetrators. A convict who saw two others killed right in front of him - tellingly one by an aboriginal and another by an officer.The soldiers, who are there not exactly on their own free will, are taught to dehumanize the locals as well as the convicts they are guarding. We can see the beginnings of the process in the young officer and in the convict boy Hawkins takes a brief interest in. We can see how it's kill or be killed, quite possibly by one of your own. But by dehumanizing the others they are dehumanizing themselves eventually becoming like Hawkins and his hapless sidekick Ruse (Damon Herriman). The film doesn't let anyone off the hook. There's a heartbreaking scene that reminds us that even settlers who are nice and kind and, what we would now call, woke are still living on the stolen land.Clare is an orphan who found herself having to steal to survive which landed her in that hell hole of a place as a young girl. Now 21 she finally has things starting to look up for her. A husband, a little hut, a beautiful baby girl. Life. Hope. But her long earned freedom is in the hands of Hawkins who is mildly infatuated with her and wants to keep her for himself. When her husband's ill conceived attempt to break her free brings on a horrible tragedy, she too is pulled into the vortex of violence. And Billy, who is trying to keep his head down and avoid trouble in spite of having suffered enormously from the colonizers, is pulled in along with her. But it is their relationship that holds them and the film together. Watching it move slowly from an understandable distrust to a deep bond melts your heart. To me it's really a love story.I found the film pulling me in like few have ever done. It was as if I was there, feeling what the characters were feeling as much as it can be possible sitting in my comfortable 21st century chair. I wasn't just grieving for them, I was grieving with them, a few times finding myself breaking down literally seconds before one of them did. This has never happened to me before. I think it's because everything flows so organically. Every mood change, every action, dream, nightmare is right in its place and palpably real. No small feat for something that is also rich with allegory. And the acting is fantastic across the board. Franciosi's performance is raw and alive, like a pulsating vein as she goes through a myriad of subtle changes of emotions. Layers of emotions. Clare never loses her vulnerability, no matter how much rage she is in or how much confidence she is trying to project. That's what makes her so compelling. Ganambarr is a revelation as Billy. He moves seamlessly, with barely a change of tone between being an occasional comic relief, talking about his culture with quiet, yet forceful passion, and revealing just how much he's been hurt, and he is perfect every step of the way. You can see the pain buried inside him slowly seeping out as the movie progresses. And Hawkins could have been a run of the mill villain, but Claflin fleshes him out as someone who commits violence not out of strength, but out of weakness. He is unable to control anything, from soldiers under his command to his own career. Impotent both figuratively and literally, he kills and rapes as a means of control. He doesn't enjoy sex or anything else for that matter. A miserable creature, even more disgusting than he is scary - perfectly befitting someone in the last stages of inner decay.The film loses its momentum for a bit towards the end, but just barely.

The Nightgale tells the story of Irish convict, Clare Carroll who after being raped and witness to the death of her husband and child goes on a path of revenge to kill the ones responsible. It's a film that has been seen before, but what makes it unique is the time period and the voice. The Nightingale is the story of a woman in 19th Century Australia going through such inhuman trauma brought about by our villains. The movie keeps itself rooted in the history of the time and it makes for a very impressive, if not sometimes hard to watch film.At the forefront of this film is Aisling Franciosi who gives one of the best performances I have seen from an actress this year. The amount of trauma and abuse this character goes through on her journey and how it transforms her is perfectly brought out by Franciosi's captivating performance. She owns the film, but she is not alone, our supporting cast in particular, Sam Claflin, the antogonist of the film is fantastic and pure evil and Claflin takes a very different turn by playing a character so despicable. Nor can Baykali Ganambarr be forgotten who plays the role of Billy in the film, an Aborginal tracker who helps Clare in her journey.The Characters, writing, directing and acting are all fantastic in this film, but the detail put into this film is still mesmerizing. Upon reading up about this film the language used throughout is a form of Palawa kani which is becoming extinct and is now immortalized in this film forever. The cinematography in this film is also gorgeous giving it a round yet beautiful quality to it that showcases the chaotic nature of the film.The movie is also not afraid to shy way from violence and it seems this film has sparked controversy over its depictions of rape and violence which is exactly what Director Jennifer Kent was going for. I applaud her for taking on such material and portraying it in an unflattering but still tasteful manner that does not shy away from brutality. It may be hard to watch, it may not be for everyone, but it is still important in this tale, reminding me of films such as I Spit On Your Grace which have not been as tasteful with their depictions.Overall, The Nightingale is a powerful film, it may be hard to watch for some, but it's final moments make the film worth it in the end. Supported by fantastic character work from actors to writer to director. The Nightingale shows a clear vision and a violent recreation of A history of violence toward women to life. My only complaints lie in the length and pace of the film, but what I've already said in the review makes up for it all in the end.",The Nightingale
120,kgrv2000,Great piece of work!,8,8 October 2020,"This is an outstanding piece of work. Knocked two stars off because of Clare's inexplicable change of heart when finally faced with the man who killed her husband, after showing intense rage at the man who killed her baby, why did she chicken out? Only to sing to him in the end? Flawed character development there. But anyways, everything else is superb: the cinematography, the acting, the directing. Definitely worth my time!",The Nightingale
121,Francois84,"English evil, Aborigine saintly, Irish somewhere inbetween.",6,19 February 2021,"It's a reasonably entertaining film. But this isn't history. This is a prejudiced, ignorant, and warped portrayal of the past. And unfortunately many people lap up this propaganda as if it is factual. One reviewer on here states that, ""Not much is known of these happenings"", and goes on to say with a non-sequitor of the century by claiming, ""...but this was a stark reality of those days back then..."". Erm, if we don't know what happened, how can you know that these things were a stark reality, implying that was widespread and commonplace? Unfortunately people believe what they want to believe, and most people love a revenge tale, because we can sympathise with the desire to even a score, or seek justice, had we ourselves been wronged. But this film is not an accurate portrayal of British colonialism. It is actually beyond a caricature of the past and only serves to reinforce our modern day misunderstanding and ignorance of it. It's a rewriting of history, and many know what Orwell said of rewriting the past in his book '1984', it serves a modern agenda. However, despite the nonsense of the story and characters, and the needlessly gratuitous violence, the film still has its merits. The acting is certainly decent enough, the film is nicely shot, though the choice of framing it in 4:3 really doesn't bring any benefits. And some of the singing and poetic parts of the film are quite nice. It's certainly watchable provided you acknowledge that this isn't any way representative of British colonial history. Empires around the world have risen and fallen. The USA still has a contiguous land empire is all but name. But of all those that came and went, and still exist, the British actually ruled far more benevolently than any other before or since. No, I'm not advocating conquests and colonialism. I believe countries should have the right to independence and self-determination. But this is a fact. The British Empire was the most far reaching and benign of all the Empires in history. Yet, you wouldn't know that with films like this which seek to rewrite history. Watch it but with a pinch of salt.",The Nightingale

The violence is neither exploitative or gratuitous (there is no nudity and little gore), it's an accurate depiction of the time this film portrays... including murder, racism, bigotry, hatred and sexual violence towards women.
It's brutal for sure and is a hard watch (as it should be) but it's also a story of righteous revenge and the glimmers of hope in seemingly hopeless situations.

126,roguegrafix,Started well but then WTF!,2,25 October 2019,"As the title says, it started well and then it went downhill seriously.Firstly, I see the producers have taken over the Trivia section with their own blowing of trumpets.The film starts well but then degenerates. Partly, this is due to the setting. Three days walk from Launceston and you are talking 45-60 miles. The scenery could be Mole Creek or perhaps Ben Lomond way but the majority of the film is shot in the highlands or the southwest. So totally unrealistic from any Taswegian's point of view.Then there's the female lead. Bold at first but after gruesomely killing the killer of her child, she reverts to a sniveling child upon meeting her rapist. Just went back into cliches and stereotypes but note you feminists, it was the male who did the ultimate killings, proving that the girl really was a child and not worth denoting an entire film to.The blackfella again reverts into the stereotypes of the ""noble savage"" and carries it off badly.The final scene takes place on a beach with a raging surf. The only place close to Launceston like that is Low Head -- another 2-3 days travel by horse. So again totally unrealistic.It seems to me that after the first 45-minutes, the producers wanted to take the tale from serious vengeance to a woke perspective. It should have been a chase film like Apocalypto or a film of vengeance . But it sadly delivers none of the sort-- something of a mix-mash of whatever. View it at your own discretion.",The Nightingale

128,afrocut,Divided thoughts,5,15 August 2021,"One thing you never want to feel in a movie is its run time and with Jennifer Kent's ""The Nightingale"" you feel every moment of its 2 hours and 16 minutes. So much time is wasted on hammering in white men are awful that most of its emotion starts to drain with each excruciating cartoon villain move. The opening 15 minutes are so harsh and worthy of revenge that each new thing is unnecessary. The director/writer almost obsesses with the knowledge that these men are bad and so we follow them unnecessarily as they murder, rape, enslave and even child murder multiple times. This will push you out of the movie and only hold you watching for the much needed revenge. Unfortunately that revenge never comes satisfyingly. All of this is so disappointing, especially since there are so many interesting themes and plots. There's a taste of psychological damage and fear of abusers that could have been better explored. The theme of women having a strong voice against their oppressors, is there, but some how undermined by the excessive plots. The abuse and enslavement of people in Tasmania during Australian colonization is its strongest story thread. Seeing two people who have been taught to hate each other grow caring and dependent on each other is such an interesting and beautiful story to show. Baykali Ganambarr, in particular, is outstanding in his role as a wary guide helping a white woman hell bent on revenge. It's his character who starts to stand out as he cares and learns about his traveling partner and starts to share in her need for justice. The main character, unfortunately, shifts in tone multiple times, makes so many bad decisions and becomes quite groan inducing to follow that you wish the roles of lead had been reversed. This ends up doing something I don't even think the director/ writer realized they were doing with the ending, but it leans toward its own kind of racism and sexism ending that will leave you annoyed. Some times telling such a potent story the writer or storyteller can come off as feeling one sided to their own agenda. This is definitely the problem here and while it's an interesting and important story, it's also heavily lacking.",The Nightingale

130,vandykeu,"A hard, but very strong watch",10,2 January 2020,"Upfront, this movie will be a hard watch for everyone, and probably an impossible watch for some. It contains several rape scenes, one of which is punctuated by even greater violence.The movie is amazing because it does not pull any punches, and for how it portrays these acts of violence, and their aftermath. Everything is seen/told from the victims' perspectives. The villains are clear, their motivations complex, and in some ways they may even be identifiable to the darker parts of our souls, but they are not glorified in the least.The key to the story is that everything portrayed almost certainly happened. Tasmania (formerly Van Diemen's land) was ethnically cleansed to the extent that some claim Aboriginal People never existed there at all. That this was done at the same time as Irish (and other) prisoners lived there under a brutal authoritarian control, and even the relatively well-off found themselves in extremely difficult circimstances means that pretty much everyone was violent to everyone else. The recent history of Australia as a whole is a bad, bad time.This movie's achievement is to show that brutality, without washing a milligram of it. It is superb in every phase, but it will be hard to watch.",The Nightingale

It's like a poor man's Bone Tomahawk but not nearly as good.Same director as The Babadook so I guess that explains all the yelling (hated that kid in Babadook).

So it shows the total lack of respect and humanity for both convicts AND the Aboriginals.It is not for the faint of heart, it almost starts with a rape of Clare, the main character. There are 2 more rape scenes in the movie and I couldn't bear to go through more of these, so I clicked past them.Then there's a quite violent scene where Clare does something that is very understandable but the way it is shot... Again, not for the faint of heart (I looked away).They also show certain things done to Aboriginals that make you cringe. And yes, this is accurate, unfortunately, but also quite in your face.I have lived with these beautiful people for half a year, and this resonance with them never fades, and it pains me to see this.But it's white man's history...Nevertheless, the movie is absolutely great, the cast, the story, the acting. Very well done.In a way it's a must see, simply because it's that danged good, but also to have a reminder of our history, what they always say: Lest we forget.And many won't even know about Australia's history.Watch the movie, it's worth it!",The Nightingale

While this was certainly true of 18th century Tasmania and the British penal set up, the film could have done a lot more with the subject matter and dare I say seen things from a higher vantage point. Another issue was the casting of Sam Claflin - a very limited, monotonous actor who really can't do much more than act like a ""good ol boy"" at a private boarding school. A stronger lead would have done wonders and given a better dynamic to the cruelty of a ""lost man"". A perfect recipe for the feminist manifesto that wants to be seen as courageous, yet lack the courage to look at the nuances of depravity. I still rate it a 7 for pandering to it's very specific audience, but it still comes off as a B grade movie due to the laziness of the female director in exploring colonial rule.",The Nightingale

The cinematography on display is absolutely gorgeous and it is worth watching the film just for that. The performances also stick out a ton in a movie filled with really great thing. Aisling Franciosi gives the best performance of the year and Sam Claflin and Baykali Ganambarr give spectacular performances as well. The only problem I saw was that the pacing kind of dragged a little in the second act. But that is a very minescule complaint as this movie is an emotional powerhouse and a very strong sophomore feature for Jennifer Kent.

This is what it was like, and this is how the world continues to operate in some parts of the world. I applaud the film makers for their attempt to maintain authenticy. This is no schlocky I spit on your grave film, it's vicious, visceral and horribly rewarding. The protagonist is a walking flame of righteous anger and hate. Her guide is there to temper that and to offer retribution and spiritual peace, making him a guide in every sense.

The love, the joy, the kinship, the compassion and the bond of people.

After awhile one becomes desensitised to it.That said, there is plenty that's worthwhile, notably the setting and performances which are excellent all round, particularly those of Sam Claflin as the reprehensible Lieutenant , Damon Herriman as the Sergeant and Aisling Franciosci as Clare.The real stand-out, though, is Baykali Ganambarr as Billy. What a phenomenal talent! He's never anything less than completely convincing. So much so that the film really should have been called Blackbird, in my opinion.The film's location is the island of Tasmania and it's a beautiful setting. The historical period reveals a highly disturbing and not often seen aspect of Australia's colonial past.All in all it could have been a lot better, but it drags on for too long and the film-makers allow it to lose pace and urgency.

157,ssnake_z,"Misery, misery, misery.",9,8 September 2019,"THE NIGHTINGALE
RATING: 4.5/5The Nightingale is a movie i heard about because someone saw it at a film festival and said they were carded to see the film. Apparently, since movies aren't rated at festivals, being carded for this one movie was out of the ordinary. After watching it, i can definitely see how this would trigger people and make them uncomfortable.Heres a heads up on the main triggers, minor SPOILERS ahead. The movie starts off with a rape about 5 to 10 minutes into it. While you're watching, you think this is the inciting incident, and that it's there for nothing more than shock value. Then, about 20 to 30 minutes in, you get another rape scene, along with some other heinous actions, that officially kick off this revenge journey. Then, about halfway through the film, another rape happens, and you realize this is just the world these characters inhabit. The villains deserve a lot of credit for really selling how terrible and scummy these English soldiers really are. By the end, i couldn't wait for the bad guys to get theirs. However, by the way the movie plays out, and the world the characters inhabit, you start getting this feeling that justice may not exist in this reality and the bad guys might get away with everything they've done. It's a feeling i don't get in many movies or TV shows these days. Beware, there's also racism in this film but it's just very matter of fact as opposed to, in your face trying to preach to you about racism. It's insinuated that the Irish are also second class citizens but it's hard to tell because many are ex-convicts, which also makes them less than human, but still above the Blacks, of course.The Nightingale is a long movie, 2hrs 16 min. A lot does happen in it though. Parallel to the main character's story of revenge, you also have her guide, a Black, aboriginal, man named Billy, who has been taught the ways of the English, but is still considered sub human. Oh, did i mention the protagonist is an Irish, ex-con, who is also considered sub human. They both start off with this hate and distrust of one another, purely based off the race and stereotypes that I'd assume existed in that time period. Seeing their relationship grow from a necessary business transaction to a shared pain and deep understanding of everything the English has taken from them both, it works really well here. If I had to say anything bad about the film, it's the nightmares the main character has. One may have been fine, but she has about three, I believe, and they just really overstay their welcome. The film is so straightforward and serious that the dream sequences just feel out of place and un-needed. I think the movie would have been leaner and meaner without them.The film takes place in 1825, so they're all playing by a way different set of rules than we do today. There's a lot of unfairness and cruelty if you're not a white man, but if you're not the right kind of white man, that comes with its own set of issues too. If you don't have the right profession, that can also count against you. There's just a lot of pain and suffering to go around in this film, so you need to be ready for it. With all that being said, there's a shared beauty in these two different cultures reaching this mutual level of understanding over each other's plight. The revenge which they seek takes their relationship into a special place not known by many in their time period. The last shot of the film is even imbued with a painterly quality, as their journey finally comes to its conclusion. It shows how far apart they both are culturally, but yet are still able to share in this one quiet moment of beauty together. This is definitely a recommend from me, but like i said before, be prepared for what you're getting into.",The Nightingale

There, that's better. Now, let's see...white men all bad, women and aboriginals all good. Think that about sums it up. Seriously though, this long trek through the bush wouldn't have been half so long if the director hadn't been pushing a barrow load of feminism and indigenous rights grievances. There's the kernel of a good story here, with interesting characters, but really, the white males here only needed to twirl their mustaches to resemble Snidley Whiplash, and frankly, their just comeuppance was a huge letdown, especially as that seemed to be the main and only point of the film. Weirdly, the only sympathetic white male character, a young guy who only acts under orders, suffers the most brutal punishment, having his face demolished by our heroine in a scene Tarantino would have envied; the real villain suffers nothing worse than an apparently painless spear in the chest.

It definitely held my attention. However, the plot is a very basic revenge tale with the fashionable but unsubtle message that white men (or perhaps in this case only specifically the English) are morally bankrupt, women are martyrs and blacks are noble. Accordingly, the villains are two-dimensional sociopaths who won't blink before violating anyone in a vulnerable position. When the inevitable revenge is finally consummated, it is as coarse and unoriginal as you could ask for, smiting the white devil in the very throes of his depravity.

Sadly, I ended very disappointed.The touching and rough nature of the matter and story leads most of the reviews to praise this movie without limits. But the reality is that ""The Nightingale"" is just a revenge film that fails to deliver a convincing story about the horrors of colonial times, as it falls into a heavily bias and almost caricatured good boys vs bad boys story.This film is also technically bad. Bad editing and weird direction.
The plot is simple, and it leans in a generic fictional colonial story. Once you see the first minutes, you already know what to expect. And yes, it has not twist, no addition to the story, no substance. This along with a very low pace, makes the film feel dragged out and overly long, even if it doesn't last that long.Villains are almost like Disney villains which at least for me doesn't feel quite believable. And I had the feeling that political correctness is definitely present in this movie. The movie let you know with total clarity who are the bad guys and who are the good ones, there's almost no grey, not middle ground.I wanted to like it.

When they finally reach the really bad man, she stands up and takes aim, and decides NOT to shoot, for no explicable reason whatsoever. He sees her, she runs, they all eventually meet up in a town and she decides to just walk up to him in a pub, say things to him, sing a song, and walk out...Finally, after more than 2 hours of this torture, the black man puts on his war paint and kills the bad men; that was probably the only 30 seconds in this entire fire-bound movie that were somewhat enjoyable.Also the movie is just completely brutal and torturous to watch throughout, let alone this horrible stringing along.

185,harrisonwelshsfs,"Brutal, Thoughtful, Authentic",9,16 March 2020,"From strength to strength, from horror to drama. Following her breakout feature film 'The Babadook' (2014) Jennifer Kent delivers another excellently crafted film with a lot to say. Unflinchingly brutal, 'The Nightingale' gives a shockingly realistic depiction of a horrific period in Australia's history, grounded by a personal story of tragedy and revenge. Set in 1825, Clare an Irish convict chases a British officer through the Tasmanian bushland, bent on revenge for a terrible act of violence against her family. She enlists the help of an Aboriginal tracker named ""Billy"" who is also marked by trauma from his violence filled past.Few films explore Australia's colonial history, fewer present it with this level of uncomfortable authenticity, and fewer still do so with such powerful and thoughtful execution. The sorrowful tone is supported by a sparse soundscape dotted with melancholic music, allowing for moments of quiet reflection and grieving between scenes of high tension and violence. The camera work and colour grade are stark, immersing the audience into this bleak world that we are so rarely shown on screen. The 4:3 aspect ratio has been chosen for deliberate effect, adding to the period aesthetic of the film while making the frame feel constricted, mimicking the way cycles of violence trap people. The narrow frame also helps to draw the audiences' focus in on the characters, highlighting the personal human story.What could have been a depressing grind is kept constantly engaging while losing none of the intended impact because of the very tight script that wastes no time, moving the story along with good pace. The film is brutal but is presented with maturity as evident in the conclusion which in a way robs the viewer of a desired catharsis, suggesting that while retribution is deserved a violent reaction will not provide satisfying resolution. It is this emotional punch that stays with the viewer long after the credits have finished. Kent has drawn out authentic performances from the terrific cast, Sam Claflin is truly evil as officer Hawkins, Bayakali Ganambarr conveys great emotional depth and Aisling Franciasi gives a powerful rage filled lead performance.A brilliantly made film with impressive performances, skilful writing and deep emotional intelligence, 'The Nightingale' is a poignant story on its own and given the light it sheds on a tragic history which is all too often swept under the rug it should be considered essential viewing.",The Nightingale

It does depict some horrific things done by humans to other humans, and a few people walked out of the screening in the first 10 minutes because by far the worst scenes are at the start.But I recommend sticking with it as it's really about showing glimpses of humanity underneath murderous hatred in an extremely hostile environment. It is not simply a gleeful revenge thriller, despite the often cartoonish evil of the British soldiers and the Tarantino-esque levels of violence. When the revenge does come, it feels like a drop in the ocean of cruelty that surrounds it - by which I mean the everyday treatment of the aboriginal people by the white settlers and of women as property. The larger themes come through with crushing strength.There isn't much in the way of humour or lightness here, but it manages to be a compelling and rewarding experience even if it feels a bit exhausting.

The movie is good and the quality is high. I am not seeking to write a full review of the movie, when so many others have done so quite well.What was noteworthy to me, above all else, is how this movie intersects classism and racism. I felt so bad for Clare each time she was raped. I felt even worse when her family was murdered.But I must admit I felt guilty bout that sympathy as I watched her treat her aboriginal tour guide like less than dirt. I mean, she had more anger towards her ""black"" than she did towards the men that raped her repeatedly and killed her entire family.The relationship improves some. Quite a bit, indeed. But this is indicative of the story of racism all of the world. If you are black, you are considered automatically less than everyone else. Even non-black people that are similar socioeconomically subscribe to beliefs that perpetuate inferior treatment.The acting was great though. Everyone really made you hate them. Someone else can cover the colonization aspects of the film.

Amazing that the director managed to find, and get such a good performance out of relatively unknown actors. I was especially stuned with the portrayal of Billy, who i find to be one of the most likable characters ever put on the screen. Was shocked to see that this is the actor's only credit on IMDB.I wasn't completely satisfied by the last act of the movie, and felt like it was draged out a bit here.

A 136-minute runtime is not an issue on its own, but it must be earned. This film took too many detours, and chose to stoke the fire by rehashing the same horrors. Let's just say that there is MORE than one assault in this movie. Strangely, the film also has some odd editing choices, not including dream sequences that derail the momentum.Personally, I don't like what they did with the main character. Yes, they gave her layers by not making her a perfect superwoman, but they also made her inactive at crucial moments. The audience buys into her plans of action, and we want to see them through; she doesn't. The final portion of the film is less satisfying than we would want, based on how crazed she is for revenge.It's not boring, but it gets repetitive.

You go on a long treacherous quest to find these men who did this and when you finally catch up to him you wimp out??!!
Ok, I get it, this man put fear in you, controlled you, took everything away from you, so fear can consume you. But when you meet him again all you can do is muster up the rage and courage to hurt his feelings???!!!
The ending ruined this movie that started off with such promise. So of course our heroine, that we have been following this whole time had her revenge but by the hand of her companion.
Seriously?!?! This could have been a solid 10 but let's make the heroine weak and frail at the end and have the man take the spot light. We should have been following him the whole movie!!

209,foxypoo,I watched this instead of 2001. What a mistake.,4,6 February 2021,"Let's talk about what I liked first: the visual aspect of the film was nearly perfect despite a few shots out of focus. Billy is a really interesting character, and I enjoyed him in the film. Sam Claffin absolutely destroyed it. He was definitely the best part of them movie, and completely ate up every second on screen. I would say that Billy's final revenge scene was also pretty decent and moderately satisfying. However, that's about the only things I enjoyed.To start off, this could be the slowest movie I've ever seen. This easily could've been an 1:30 minutes long. But instead, the decided to stretch out the runtime almost an hour longer. And that's very transparent to me because of a confrontation scene with Hawkins and Clare, where I'm guessing the writers didn't know what to do, so they just had Clare run away? Without even shooting the freaking gun in her hand? They could've at least had her shoot her gun and miss, that would make way more sense. The main actress, Aisling Franciosi, did a really not so great job. Not only that, but her character is pretty uninspired. Every time she was on screen I couldn't help but roll my eyes. There are multiple moments where Clare bursts out in song, and I felt pain all over my body. I feel like there were multiple opportunities to do something creative, but it didn't take any of them.If you liked this film, then good for you.

217,kietkyho,WHAT THE **** HAPPENED HERE...?,4,31 August 2019,"The Nightingale was not a good film. I wanted to like this film... I really did... female Australian director, previously made the Babadook, has a lot of indigenous actors... there's a lot of promise for a great film, and for the first 15 to 20 minutes, I was fairly on board... then the movie just turns to absolute crap... oh yeah spoilers ahead, cause I can't really get into why this film is bad without spoiling parts of it.First off, the sound design is awful. Every time a character talks loudly or yells, you can literally hear their audio clipping... Yes the film was mostly shot outdoors and there's no musical score, so doing sound design with these constraints in mind is very bold... but it was pulled off really badly...The directing of the action scenes was really bad too... a lot of generic quick cuts so none of the blows feel like blows at all...The editing was absolutely atrocious and was probably the big thing that ruined this film for me... there are so many potentially powerful scenes in the movie that just get COMPLETELY RUINED by the constant cutting to different angles and perspectives.. and the editing is also responsible for a lot of unanswered plot points / plot holes too... like was this cut trying to imply passage of time? Or did you forget that our actors were being chased just a moment ago, but now thanks to this edit, they're fine..? There are so many scenes that are left completely unanswered and just get ruined with these sudden cuts.The acting was all over the shop, Aisling Franciosi and Sam Claflin were great, Baykali Ganambarr was good... until he had to cry... then it was hilariously bad... a lot of acting from a lot of the minor characters was AWFUL... there's a scene where these characters are being attacked by these aborigines, so one of the white dudes shoots and kills this indigenous girl they've been keeping hostage... and the response, by the indigenous actor, to the girl being killed was HILARIOUS.... such an under acted response to seeing someone literally die in front of you... nice... also what was the deal with Matthew Sunderland's character (the guy who walks the horse)... he literally didn't utter a single line of dialogue or emote in anyway, he just tags along with Sam Clafin's group of soldiers, walks a horse and is never heard of again...Also, the horse. There are parts of this film where the characters are clearly walking on a 4WD path, and also parts where the terrain CLEARLY cannot be traversed by a horse... and conveniently in those scenes... the horse is absent, then one magical cut later and the horse is back with them.... There's also a really unintentionally funny scene, where our Aisling and Baykali's character are being chased by these people, and they somehow manage to lose them in the shrubbery... even though there's a great big horse you're trying to hide....Also Aisling character is an inconsistent idiot. She's a character, whom you as an audience, is trying really hard to root for, but then she does things that go completely against her character and how she was established, as well as doing some incredibly stupid things as well. Her dream sequences were a complete and utter waste of time and added nothing to the story. The decision to present this film in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio also seemed to add nothing to the film.The fact that this film has a ""controversy"" section on its wiki page is absolutely laughable. Yes, the first 20 minutes of the film is a bit confronting, but honestly the rest of the film is just.... boring. If you want a film that will make you feel absolutely sick to your stomach in an artistic, beautiful yet messed up way, go watch Irreversible.Seriously... what the **** happened here.... I'm giving this a 4/10... but it's honestly closer to a 3....",The Nightingale

Few things are so effective in unifying different people than common hatred.Beyond that, the movie looks gorgeous. Natural, but at the same time different, largely because of the unique aspect ratio.The story is brutal, but in a disturbingly matter of fact way. Sometimes the antagonists straddle the line between comically evil and believable, but then again so I imagine many real people did in 19th century Australia.I loved that they included some of the aboriginal spiritualism and ritualism in there.

The protagonists are not just cliches... the noble savage, the wronged woman and the evil and powerful man... they also show serious inconsistencies. The soldier initially comes across as sensitive, responsible and caring before descending into violence, self interest and unnecessary cruelty. The woman fluctuates between bereft widow (who has seriously ridiculous nightmares that don't advance the story) to manic murderer to frightened woman. And the aboriginal tracker sounds more like a 21st century land rights activist than a 19th century man traumatised by the recent loss of his family, his land and his culture.

253,jjordmaniakk,"After The Babadook, this is surprising, and amazing!!",10,26 October 2018,"A step up in scope for Kent after The Babadook, The Nightingale is a brutal, bloody and honest look into the life of woman and Aboriginal People during a period in Australia's history that many seem to forget, all while telling an amazing story.Based somewhere around the 1830's, Clare is an Irish convict living in Tasmania (Van Diemen's Land as it was known), now able to live a life out of physical chains, though this alleged freedom was made possible by a leftenant with ulterior motives. Her character begins as an innocent woman, but once this man causes tragedy to strike in an ruthless way, her attitude changes. Upset and enraged, she becomes hell bent on chasing the officer responsible. However, he has already left the village, using an Aboriginal tracker to lead his group north towards a promised promotion.Clare also decides to enlist the help of a tracker, only after others in the community find it apparent that no words can stop her from leaving. An unfortunate but necessary and true trope of films of this nature, the tracker, Billy, is of course an Aboriginal person. The two begin to follow the movements of the officer's group. Their journey is long and fraught with as much emotional torture as there is physical.The two at first share a very unstable bond, a partnership of sorts that forms the centrepiece of the film; both how their relationship changes over time but also how Billy and Clare change and become new people. Clare is haunted by nightmares during the trek, a reflection of what has happened to her before she left, the reason for her trip of vengeance, and ultimately what she plans to do herself.The promise of another Schilling at the end of the journey begins to leave Billy's mind as he starts to care about Clare's well being. What started as an extremely hostile mutual agreement morphs as the characters learn more about each other. All this and more demonstrate how two people from different worlds can understand each other as best they can. Their shared hatred towards the English doesn't hurt in this regard, one thing that they have in common as these 'settlers' wreaked havoc in both their lives.Despite the ruthless violence and images that are peppered throughout, with some scenes hard to watch, this is ultimately about grasping onto hope when the way forward seems impassable. To continue pushing forward despite the odds. The final act drives this idea further and ends on a note that at first seems underwhelming, until the meaning behind it becomes apparent. It then takes on much more power.A trained singer, all the traditional Irish songs sung by Aisling Franciosis as Clare were recorded live. Her singing adds more to a role take that takes her through what feels like the extremity of every human emotion possible. With her face featuring in many close ups, she couldn't have been more believable. A perfect choice - Kent's determination to use an Irish actress in this independent Australian film was certainly worth the effort.In his first acting role (though a performer of Aboriginal dance), Baykali Ganambarr won the 'Marcello Mastroianni' Award for Best Young Actor award at Venice, and for good reason. His portrayal of Billy goes hand in hand with Aisling's performance. The chemistry that rises and dips as they journey forward is a testament to Baykali and Aisling's skills. Baykali is seemingly a born actor, though in a Q&A after the film, he was extremely modest and when that exact question was put to him, he didn't know what to say, other that that he hope to act again. This is a man who, if he decides to, could be the next David Gulpilil, who was the first major Aboriginal actor to feature in major Australian films.An incredibly moving film that could be labelled as an epic adventure, Jennifer Kent has created a near flawless film that emotionally hits hard.",The Nightingale

The movie can't figure out what it wants to be. It starts out as a good horror movie, with a strong, narrow scope, and then randomly morphs into a wide-arcing commentary about oppression. It branches out in so many directions and then loses all tension, playing it safe towards a timid and unsatisfying ending.
Instead of trying so hard to express complex sentimentality and forcing a moral lesson down your throat, it should have stayed true to the structure of a good horror film. I was hoping for a buildup towards a suspenseful climax where she battles the antagonist in a grand finale, perhaps with both of them getting KO'd. Instead the movie completely changes the subject halfway through the plot.The ending is especially nonsensical and unrelated to the rest of the movie. It doesn't offer any kind of satisfying conclusion. Is this about revenge, or about prejudice? It could have been a well-crafted thriller set in a grisly and realistic Australian backdrop. Instead it goes off the rails and turns into what, a study of native rituals and commentary on multiculturalism? Is this about a traumatized girl who becomes a vicious killing machine, or is it about Aborigine spirituality? It sacrifices what could have been a very tight plot structure to make an unrelated statement about social justice.",The Nightingale

258,mcguiretyler,"An Important, Brave, Honest, and Difficult Film...",9,2 September 2019,"The new film by Jennifer Kent is an unfiltered look at 1825 Tasmania through the eyes of an Irish convict named Claire. A horrific act of violence happens against Claire and her family which prompts her on a journey to find the perpetrator. Along the way she slowly befriends an aboriginal tracker that helps her on her journey.This is not an easy film to watch. It contains horrific acts of violence that are terrible to watch that are consistent throughout the entire film. However, these horrific acts are necessary to show because they depict the truth in what happened in 1825 Tasmania. Jennifer Kent is very careful as to not glorify violence in any way and depicts more of the emotional impact rather than the violence itself. Many filmmakers would shy away from from depicting these events and just leaving hints as to what is happening but writer/director Jennifer Kent is brutally honest and true to the subject matter.The lead role played by Aisling Franciosi, who plays Claire, is a truly Academy award winning performance and makes you feel like you are witnessing a real person. Along side Aisling Franciosi, is Baykali Ganambarr in his feature debut who is nonetheless astounding who plays the aboriginal tracker. The antagonist, Hawkins, who is played by Sam Claflin, is a brave and daring performance. Claflin often has to do things that many actors would never do. If nothing else, watch this movie for it's terrific performances around the board with not one weak link.This film is beautifully shot in the backwoods of Tasmania with fantastic night scenes and an overall dreary and washed out tones. This perfectly matches the depressing nature of the script and also does so with the beautiful and haunting score. The production design is also commendable leaving you immersed in the environment. Stylistically, the film does exactly what it needs. It's not leaving you in awe of the visuals but is is using the visuals to accentuate the emotions of the characters.At 2 hours and 16 minutes, this is very hard to sit through because it is consistently brutal and emotionally draining throughout the runtime. I would not recommend this film to those who are very sensitive but if you can stomach this one, give it a watch. Jennifer Kent has proven herself to be a talent to see. It is important to shine a light on our past so we do not forget the atrocities that humanity has committed so we cannot repeat them. This film does not let you forget the horrific events that took place in Australia and Tasmania but it shows them to you in a way that does not let you forget. This is an important film to see and if you get the chance, go see this one in theaters.",The Nightingale

Not to worry, the nightmare is over for viewers at the end of the movie, but not for those victims of history that suffered the horrific deeds of the British crown and it's atrocities all in the name of colonialism.The storytelling and acting are powerful, and emotional, depicting the genocide of the aboriginals and the misdeeds of British soldiers perpetrated on the Irish, and how one such Irish woman and aboriginal who've lost literally everything near and dear to them in the world, take revenge.It's a haunting movie, one that you will not soon forget, and one that a lot of parallels can be drawn in the world today.",The Nightingale

It's hard to imagine such ubiquitous antisocialism/psychopathy, but then again, like I said...there was Nazism. I found, as I often do, the revenge was not enough. I wanted these men to suffer more. The one element I did enjoy was the main character's anger. Her anger was her strength. All in all, worth watching but if you have a soul it will hurt to watch.",The Nightingale

264,stephyr-88256,"Unfortunate Writing/Directing, could be a 10/10",1,12 June 2019,"Rough movies don't stop me from watching, from horror films to war stories. History is filled with tales of blood and violence. And the consequence is that we cannot tell history without including the atrocities of the events, and it is important to do so without censoring it.The first act can mostly be skipped and caught up with a sentence or so. It feels like an extended cut but... it's the actual movie. Some segment of it are lengthy for no reason and do not provide or showcase any new information or element. I don't believe it is an attempt at spectacle, but it definitely tries to be compelling directing in a way it is failing at, Kent either did not know how to express what she wanted to tell or her attention was on trying to reinvent the wheel instead of just building a wheel that works for a starter. It is best in her position to leave these types of storytelling-using-the-lenses to people like Denis Villeneuve. Kent just misses the mark on that aspect, but it's important to note that she clearly tries very hard.The second act is where we start to have actual meat to the story, but everything set up by the first act is non engaging, non compelling. She seem to try to make us root for character/s because of their suffering. But struggles and suffering in storytelling are not the same thing, struggles are obstacles, suffering is the result of something. Suffering doesn't make us root for somebody, it makes us feel bad maybe, but pain doesn't generate an underdog to root for at all. And without spoiling, the focus is mostly on pain. Now, pain can work. For example, it works perfectly in the setting of John Wick. The reason it works is not because of the pain as a component, but because of who experiences the pain and the output the character uses for the pain. Which in John Wick's case, was violence. Pain can be a very useful storytelling element, but when pain is just pain and its presence is just because its part of the story, it makes very little sense to spend time on it, which we do for the first act. The set up is not bad, but it fails to capture our interest.Now since this is a no-spoiler review, I will be more brief on the third act, but it lacks the payoff it seems to try to build up to. It feels less like the end of a movie and more like the rain outside stopped falling. It's just what it is, which only reinforce the sentiment that there is just no focus on the story. It feels so secondary, and you can tell Kent tries to make us care, but its just too little too late by the third act.Unfortunately for this movie, the attention was always devoted to that violence instead of the telling the story through it the way so many incredible masterpiece did. Kent claims at this point in time that it isn't a movie about violence, but I disagree, violence is the only active engine under the hood of this story, there is very little else at play. Everything outside of that violence is unfocused and does not receive the attention it deserves. The story itself seemed very secondary, I would say that the best way to express it is that it is a movie you can watch and follow without sound. You can mute The Nightingale and still follow the overall story. While there is a story and an interesting one, it constantly feels secondary. It is like the love story in a superhero movie, it's there, but it's not what the movie is about. Which is strange, because you can clearly see that this movie wants us to care about that story. It feels like Kent had to make tough calls and ended up putting a lot of time in portions of the movie the entire theater would have fast-forwarded through if they could.One could say a movie does not always have to be about its story. Sicario is not devoted to its story entirely, it is devoted to an experience, it does it perfectly. It is gruesome, but not gratuitous; Brutal, but not exploitative. It is an unfair story in an unfair world and it works. Sadly, when it comes to The Nightingale, the story itself is all there is to it and giving it the backseat makes the movie quite bland.Display of violence and abuse can be impactful and be a component of a compelling story, but it can't be the engine behind the rest of your movie. You need something more to make us care about what happens. Feeling bad for characters isn't enough. Even a movie like Saw had a mystery and puzzles to solve behind it. It feels like the directing focus is always on what they want us to see, not on what matters.It feels like the movie constantly tries to justify itself and constantly try to support actions and decisions before executing. I don't know if Jennifer Kent lacked faith in her decisions, but it ruined the film for me. All she seemed to truly want to nail down is that these events were hell, they were horrifying and bad. I am left wanting more of the story itself, not all the content she wrapped around it.BUT there is a compelling story there, good actors, good scenery, good soundtrack. Sound effects are also something I noticed, lots of attention to detail. The story, if properly written and the movie properly directed, could have been a truly incredible movie about these tragic events. But as strange as it sounds, the movie is not about the topic of the movie. And I know it sounds wild, but it is true and its for the most part why my rating is that low.Some of you will say 1/10 is brutal. But as an avid viewer of movies, all I can say is that even the Emoji movie was focused on its story. It was a bad one, but it was focused on it. I know lots of people will ""not find this review helpful"", since for some people, the visual is enough. I can clearly see what this movie could be, but it's not what it tries to be. And it feels like the prize it won is mostly due to some of its provocative nature instead of the overall movie. Some movie maker make a career out of provocative content, personally a movie needs to be good and compelling, it needs to have something going for itself.",The Nightingale

What's worse is that the violent scenes well acted, directed and thus very hard to watch (I'm still having nightmares). If you've watched 12 yrs a slave or hotel Rwanda I can tell you that this movie depicts far more brutality and injustice than those, but as opposed to them, it offers very little comfort or solace to the viewer at the end. This is partly because other than the violent scenes, those scenes depicting the friendship ensuing between the 2 main protagonists are trite, superficial, unconvincing and thus fail to provide much relief to, and leave any impression on, the viewer. Also, unlike Solomon in 12 yrs a slave, the main protagonists aren't freed at the end, far from it-one is left to literally die alone at the end. The fate of the other is implied and in my opinion is even worse. One of them says in the movie something along the line of 'life is suffering' which seems to capture the main message throughout the movie.

There are some extremely violent films that I love. The problem is this movie is much too long and many of the scenes feel like they could have been cut. At times the film feels choppy and the plot seems to change direction for odd reasons or for reasons poorly portrayed by the characters. Some of the characters are hard to believe, especially Sam Claflins... he does a great job with the material he is given but his character is a bit over the top and seems like a cartoon villain.I'm also also all for the messages of how horrible the native Australians were treated, as well as feminist messages, but I feel like the director overdid it and dragged it out. Sometimes a movie gets these types messages across through the nature of the story but in this case it just feels forced fed and it doesn't really work.Overall, this movie has some well shot scenes, and some great acting by the main character.

294,inbox-83587,Calls into question the purpose of art,3,25 February 2020,"With ""The Nightingale,"" Kent actually calls into question the purpose, value, and limits of art.To me, the purpose of story as art, even very dark stories, is to enable the audience to experience something in a way that can be very affecting, thought-provoking, even disturbing, so that we can come away with new thinking (even if dark) and, ideally, having learned something.In ""The Nightingale,"" Kent goes too far. At the very bottom of this review (under ""Trigger Warning"") I describe in one sentence the early scenes that prompt this review. (I did not mark this review as having spoilers because the scenes are all from the beginning part of the movie.)These brutally violent early scenes (within first half-hour) are excessively extended, far beyond the need of making their hideous point. I believe Kent actually wanted the audience to be traumatized -- not disturbed, not deeply emotional and empathetic to the victim, but actually traumatized themselves.I've watched a LOT of violent movies in my life. A LOT. Some of my favorite all-time films contain devastating and intense violence. I'm not just talking about fun-time violence like Indiana Jones, slasher movies, or Kill Bill, but also the kinds of deeply-impactful violence that make you think about it for days, even decades. I have a full appreciation for the role of disturbing an audience in the service of a narrative.Kent, in ""The Nightingale,"" intentionally blows out the limits of how brutal, unrelenting, and deeply gut-churning film can be. And there's some aspect of truth in the defense of this film you'll read that ""it's not exploitative."" That is, it's an artistically made movie, much beyond some cheap 1970s grindhouse movie or more recent garbage like The Human Centipede, whose primary value is shock, disgust, and/or titillation.However, even with its artistic qualities and pretensions, ""The Nightingale"" ultimately goes into its own kind of exploitation -- exploitation of the audience.Kent said in interviews about the rape scenes that she wanted to show that rape is not about sex, it's about violence. Okay, thanks, that's news to no one in real life, but I understand she's reacting to other depictions of rape in film. But given her point: if Kent had presented scenes of someone being stabbed or bat-beaten with the same extended treatment she gave to these rape scenes, she would have been strongly criticized (like Quentin Tarantino) for going to an egregious and gratuitous level of viciousness. But interestingly, perhaps since it's rape (and later in the film, copious racist violence), and certainly because of Kent's obvious talent and artistry, many have given her a much higher level of respect and acceptance. Many people defend the film's scenes as brutal, yes, but somehow ""necessary.""Nah. She goes WAY beyond necessary. In art, in story, violence can be very pervasive, very intense, and very impactful, but by what philosophy should it actually attempt to traumatize to the audience?I am reminded of the controversy over Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" which A.O. Scott wrote, ""so relentlessly focused on the savagery of Jesus' final hours that this film seems to arise less from love than from wrath, and to succeed more in assaulting the spirit than in uplifting it.""Same here. What I can still tell you about ""The Nightingale"" is that NO POSSIBLE ENDING could redeem the level of artistic savagery in the first act.Isn't the purpose of art to make a point about life so that people can get the idea (even a disturbing idea) without actually going through (in this case) the trauma that the characters do? Kent clearly *wants* to transcend this line between being an empathic audience and being co-victim.I would ask Jennifer Kent, if her character was a real woman who had suffered these monstrosities, would that woman want other people to suffer those crimes as deeply and traumatically as she had? Because clearly, this was Kent's artistic intent. Similarly, with Gibson's film, would Jesus want people to suffer his torture and crucifixion themselves?I would argue these victims would hate the idea of other people suffering what they had. *Know about* their suffering? Sure. Understand it? Yes. Empathize with the victims, be enraged, want justice? All yes. But Kent's film specifically wants the audience to BE the victim, not just care about the victim.""The Nightingale"" is actually traumatizing. And people, seriously, I have a high tolerance. Consider that many film-festival audience members, who would also have a deep acceptance of the art form, walked out of this one.In my opinion, Kent's film is a knowing and intentional test of the limits of art, and ultimately, it degenerates into an insult of art. I know that's a huge claim, and I mean it.You can say (and Kent probably thinks), well, even traumatizing the audience is art too, and I can see that point. But by that logic, actual rape and murder are also art.You may be motivated to want to try watching this movie now, and I won't criticize you for that. But be warned here, because the movie's self-description that I went on, and its very questionable R rating, will not warn you sufficiently what you're getting into.(Don't get me started on how movies with a certain level nudity and consensual sex gets you an NC-17 rating, but this hellish experience of ultra-violence gets an R. That's something that's deeply wrong with the American psyche.)***TRIGGER WARNING***The only thing below here is a one-sentence description of the scenes that prompted this review.(Sexual assault, murder, violence against infants)Within the first 30 minutes of this movie, the protagonist is repeatedly raped, including a scene in which she is gang raped in front of her family while her husband and infant child are murdered.",The Nightingale

296,phillmwrth,Truly bold and necessary story,10,27 August 2020,"The film is set in a beautiful landscape that takes full advantage in every scene that sets this relentlessly unnerving and necessary film. Every character is used in a range of raw depths, from which the story builds. This humanistic style of development with honest violence makes this film an experience.Ultimately, the film is very organic. The score is what would be heard in the scenes and the cinematography uses natural elements in lighting and set. The acting is immersive and dynamic, convincing of human experience.Watch it!
Further thoughts:As an Australian, I can confirm that the atrocities depicted in the film were common and are actively supressed in schools, while the villains contained in the film are not too dissimilar from the people we are demanded to praise.
The stories of colonisation and convict lives seemed almost forgotten. It was only within my 20s I learnt of the Palawa people genocide in Tasmania (I'm fairly well educated, and I've spent a lot of time actively studying Aboriginal culture). I've had close family friends that were Stolen by the Government at birth for their Aboriginality, though I often found myself in trouble at school for stating that the stolen generation continued in this century.
I think Kent had grown to be frustrated at the deficits of education and contemporary culture, refusing to dilute the reality; because it needed to be done.What is now accepted to be the longest continuous culture, was actively set to be destroyed by colonists. Australian people continue to do this by silencing the events that traumatised Aboriginal culture, while contiuing to depict Aboriginal people as lesser people. This is often done in overt racist remarks or covert ""caring western saviours"", while stories are silenced in shame.
Stories are not just what kept Aboriginal culture thriving, though it's something that all cultures use to bind together and tear others apart. By denying reality the stories we identify with we are denying ourselves a chance to grow, and killing a culture which is trying to heal from it's impact.I'd love to be able to thank Jenifer Kent for this movie, as I feel it has given hope for a better future.",The Nightingale

She is just so small, a very small minded character that didn't do much except whinning and threatening the things that she doesn't have the gut to do. Pathetic!",The Nightingale

304,claybraes,Utterly brutal,9,27 February 2021,"A fine reflection of the bloody English and how they operated all over the world. Wiping out all good things.
I thought all of the acting was brilliant. The cinematography, the sets, the scenery the very fine acting. How powerless have women always been against mongrels.
Revenge was hers and Billy's.
Brilliant",The Nightingale

306,docosaurus,"Disappointing, strange creative choices",3,10 September 2019,"Jennifer Kent's sophomore effort, The Nightingale, is beset with some interesting but ultimately flawed creative choices.
The 1.37:1 ratio aspect choice is puzzling and defeats any effort to capture the truely spectacular wilderness in any cinematic sense. An opportunity lost to really describe what should've been another essential character in the movie. Instead there is very little in the way of establishing any sense of geography or location. The closed off framing creates a claustrophobic vibe that even applies to the exteriors.
The villains are drawn so broadly as to almost descend into caricature with repeated maniacal giggling and shouting that dilutes any real menace. In fact our heroine seems to have no overt concerns as to any potential danger from said villains eg previous rape/assault attempts or threats to revoke her free woman status. So when the attack comes it feels contrived with no foreboding or dread preceding it.
In fact the emphasis on showing the multiple rape scenes just dulls any significant impact the act should rightly impart on the audience.
If anything this feels like an ambitious debut from a talented independent artist with a limited budget and even more limited creative toolbox.
The 136 minute running time isn't justified, in fact what The Nightingale needs most is to be reduced by 30 minutes. It's languid and suffers for it.
Conversely The Babadook still impresses with its tension, taught story-telling, beautifully realised characters and excellent film craft.
Sadly The Nightingale could learn a few lessons from it.",The Nightingale

308,jpspam69,Superb Film. But disturbing.,10,14 August 2020,"A very disturbing historical type film.
Well worth a watch.
You can't help feel sorry for the criminals sent to Australia and the Aboriginals used and abused by us.
And towards the end, you can understand the unspoken connection between the two.
Fairly graphic on subjects we try to ignore exist.
Even brought a tear to my eye.",The Nightingale
309,paul-856-971721,Gripping and outstanding for so many reasons,10,10 January 2020,"Best movie 2018. A Death Wish for the Colonial era with an involuntary aboriginal hero as well;. I loved Bababook for its storytelling, acting and technical achievements. but Nightingale hits you on a much deeper, visceral level. The 1970's pacing gives this film room to breathe, the casual cruelty and misogyny makes it gripping, and the outstanding performances of the cast make it real. Wow.",The Nightingale

312,garydhubb,Neither compelling or urgent.,3,22 February 2020,This film you will loath to leave it after 20 mins. Not for its story or acting or for the authentic appearance the film exhibits. You will be annoyed for the brutality and the unnecessary long rape scenes (plural) in the first 15 minutes. No one should think these terrible things never happened in history but all should believe a filmmaker could show restraint before alienating an audience. This is neither compelling or urgent as some might claim but overly abusive and inexcusable.,The Nightingale

314,jaredtraviswhite,Best acting Iv'e seen all year!,8,10 November 2019,"Great acting from all 3 of the leads in this movie. Especially Aisling Franciosi, she really knocked it out the park! Jennifer Kent is also a very strong writer. The cinematography really starting to find itself in the last 45 minutes of the movie. The movie was super heavy and some of the violence was a bit over the top, that's why my rating went from a nine down to an eight. To bad it doesn't have enough movie behind it to make an Oscar push, because if should get some acting nominations.",The Nightingale

317,rsmoller_rene,"Warning: Walked away feeling victimized, utterly hopeless, and full of despair.",10,4 August 2019,"The director said she wanted to evoke empathy for the viewers of this film, however as an empathetic viewer, watching this movie felt like someone throwing salt into an open wound,. I walked away feeling victimized, utterly hopeless, and full of despair. It damages the psyche, and is almost to much to bear in these violent times of today...I wish I never saw this film!!!
This film is brutal and relentless with it's violence. I question the directors true motive in telling the story of Australia's Tasmanian Aboriginal people in this manner. The story of Australia's Tasmanian Aboriginal people is powerful and brutal, but the true art of film making, is to tell a powerful story that takes the viewers to the edge of the brutality, evokes deep empathy within the viewers for the Tasmanian Aboriginal people, but not brutalize the viewer to the point of no return!
I gave the film 4 stars because of the powerful acting performances, the beautiful cinematography, and the effort and dedication of all involved. However, I f you need to keep a psychiatrist on set for the actors and crew while filming(as they did) perhaps you should realize that your vision as a director, has gone astray and crossed over to realm of a snuff film!
Warning: Walked away feeling victimized, utterly hopeless, and full of despair!",The Nightingale
318,davidwoodson-16935,Dismal vivid violence,1,10 November 2021,"The violence is so graphic and extends way beyond what's needed to make a statement, to the point that it seems to revel in the violence or tries to inflict some measure of the pain experienced by the protagonists in the viewing audience. The graphic intensity and length in which the violence was depicted overshadows the plot and the acting. If this was the intention it was successful.Rapes lasting many many minutes in detail. Violent death of a baby along with sexual violence. This violence overshadows a very weak unremarkable story.If an unremarkable plot was to underscore how life was traumatic and hopeless in early days of the British Invasion and occupation of Australia it succeeds. However violence makes for a boring and predictable story become nauseatingly long and painful.I felt that I was not only visually violated but that I had wasted the time it took to watch the movie.The violence depicted here can be related to so many current evolving conflicts. In this the movie succeeded.If u feel like u want to be emotionally violated see this movie, which is as dark as they come.",The Nightingale

320,hsfour,Would recommend this movie,9,24 August 2019,"I went to see it bc it was a provocative subject, had mixed reviews about violence and whether indigenous ppl were represented, too. I dropped my drink on the floor bc of distraction (shock) during the scene with the baby. Later, I heard a purse type bag drop and even later a set of keys. Well, that was my audience's experience. The brutality was ugly and in your face, a complete descent into dehumanization. This was a movie about colonization and all of its victims and by that I mean even all of the ppl cogs in service to the powers that be. No scene demonstrated that better than the ""polite"" supper scene hosted by diners trying be civilized in a crazy situation. It was about one woman's struggle and a growing awareness of shared suffering. It was a good movie to think about what progress means today and how we can do it better, consider consequences better, be better people about it.",The Nightingale
321,nicholsonjillian,NOT a revenge story!,6,11 October 2020,"I didnt hate this movie or regret watching, but know what you are in for. The first 30 to 45 mins is almost unbearable. I endured the first half thinking our protagonist was going to make it worth while as I saw this described as a revenge tale. However...that never happened. The trauma in the first few scenes never seems to serve a purpose. A plotline that never reaches fruition and the ending leaves you in the dark. At best this is a film on the mistreatment of women during the time. However it was well filmed and raw.",The Nightingale
322,lucygracetrotman,Deeply moving revenge story in colonial Tasmania,10,9 September 2018,"Jennifer Kent has crafted an incredible, important, moving piece of cinema that portrays humanity at its darkest, bravest and most beautiful of moments.With truly fantastic (Venice film festival award winning) turns from the cast, this story of love, greed, abuse of power, revenge and resistance in the face of evil, will surely touch every viewer.
 
The most striking things for me were the way in which the horrific behaviour by British colonial soldiers in this film is just a drop in the ocean compared to the crimes of British empire as a whole, yet this small cluster of soldiers had such a colossal impact of one woman's life, it gives a face to the suffering and atrocities committed. And secondly, the film highlights the gentle beauty and perseverance of aboriginal tradition and spirituality in the face of adversity. Every school child in the UK and Australasia should see this film as a matter of necessity in understanding our past.",The Nightingale
323,margiebell-31969,"Atrocious, to say the least",1,13 September 2018,"This is a plotless, exploitational film that uses violence not as a mean to tell a bigger story. Here, violence is the goal, the artifice to shock and persuade at the same time. I am appalled by the good reviews. As for the prizes, she has been awarded in Venice due to (or thanks to?) the scandal revolving around the journalist who yelled sexist atrocities at her. An atrocious film of gratuitous violence that has been awarded due to an atrocious act of sexism. That's not cinema. That's just....an atrocity.",The Nightingale

Amazing acting, I cried numerous times at the raw, unforgiving scenes which personally I thought made the movie more substantial and were necessary.The ruthless treatment of aboriginals hurt my heart, Billy was an amazing character for what I believe is the actor's debut movie.The connection between Clare and Billy was genuinely felt by the end of the film.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie although hard to watch at times, and I wont stop thinking about it for a long time. Really made me feel.",The Nightingale
