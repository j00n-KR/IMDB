0,MartinHafer,An exercise in weirdness,7,31 July 2012,"""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a film I recommend but I must point out that it's not everyone's sort of movie. Wes Anderson has written and directed a film that is filled with EXTREMELY strange characters that are very bizarre--not not in a John Waters way--more in a way that just left me a bit confused. I assume this was his intention but no matter how strange it gets, there is a certain likable aspect of the film...though exactly what this is, I am sure I can clearly say. I think it has a lot to do with the folks being completely different--and after reviewing more than 12000 films, it's nice to see something different.Gene Hackman plays the title character--a ne'er do well named Royal Tenenbaum. He's abandoned his family and inexplicably has returned after two decade's absence and wants readmission to the family. The plot, whether intended or not, is a remake of the old Warner Brothers film ""Daughters Courageous""--though aside from the general plot, the films are not at all alike due to the quirkiness of ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". This is one you just need to see to believe--and the story never is believable but it's also never dull.By the way, in addition to the family members played by Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson, other major actors in the film include Danny Glover, Owen Wilson and Bill Murray. This is yet another oddball performance/characterization from Bill Murray--who has made a long string of odd ones over the last decade or so, such as ""Lost in Translation"", ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" and ""Broken Flowers"". They don't always work but you have to respect his willingness to try something different.Oh, by the way, although they said it in the film, traumatic events do NOT turn a person's hair white. That's a myth.",The Royal Tenenbaums
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Wonderful script, wonderful cast, wonderful everything",10,13 July 2011,"I do love this sort of film, and The Royal Tenembaums is for me a masterpiece and one of the best of its genre. Not only is it filmed absolutely beautifully with striking photography and scenery, but it has very well-defined characters, adroit direction and an engaging story.It was the script and acting though that elevated The Royal Tenenbaums. It has been a long time where I have heard a script this good, with a ideal balance of comedy and drama. When it comes to the acting, Gene Hackman and Anjelica Huston, who I both love, are brilliant, and Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Stiller perhaps give the best work they have done.In conclusion, just a wonderful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Royal Tenenbaums
2,bkoganbing,Those quirky Tenenbaums,7,8 March 2018,"The Royal Tenenbaums received Oscar recognition in one category, that for
Director Wes Anderson's original screenplay. It didn't win, but no one can
ever say this wasn't original.Title character Gene Hackman is the estranged patriarch of the Tenenbaum clan and his baptismal name is Royal. He was a lawyer along the lines of 
Clarence Darrow back in the day, but has fallen on hard times. Back in his
prime he walked out on wife Angelica Huston and the children who grew 
up to be Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Now with no place to go he decides to resume the role of dad.Problem is that Huston has decided after all these she wants a husband and
man she picked out is Danny Glover. As he's already lied his way into the
house with a false terminal cancer story, Hackman will have to work triple
overtime to accomplish his goal.If you like quirky characters than The Royal Tenenbaums will fill your bill. I
can bet that players were clamoring for these roles because there's nothing
ordinary in what we see of the people in this film. Any actor would love to
be in this because the writer gives them so much to work with and your imagination can sore.If you like unorothodox than The Royal Tenenbaums is your film. And whatever you think the ending will be I guarantee you will be wrong.",The Royal Tenenbaums
3,SnoopyStyle,love the style but not the family,6,1 December 2015,"Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) left his family. Etheline (Anjelica Huston) raised their three children as oddball geniuses. Twenty two years later, their early successes are now old memories. Chas (Ben Stiller) is a death-obsessed widowed father to Ari and Uzi. Richie (Luke Wilson) is a former tennis champ in love with his adopted sister Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow). Their neighbor childhood friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) is now a successful writer and professor. Margot is married to neurologist Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray). Etheline is asked by her friend Henry Sherman (Danny Glover) to get marry. Royal is broke. After finding out about the proposal, he tries to inject himself into the family by telling them that he's dying.Director Wes Anderson starts his journey to discover his unique style. I love the visual concept of what he's doing. I don't particularly like the characters or their story. I don't find it funny but I do like the unique style. This is a wacky dysfunctional family that doesn't make me laugh.",The Royal Tenenbaums
4,Hitchcoc,I'll Always Watch Hackman,8,2 September 2010,"I agree with Roger Ebert. This film, which I avoided because the title threw me off, is about love and estrangement, yet it has a great comic element. Ultimately, it's about a family that peaked too soon, sending everyone into cosmic neuroses. The father, Gene Hackman, returns to this dysfunctional mess. He is a total ass and yet he has a soul. Everyone else is coping with his or her shortcomings. The dynamics that ensue are wonderfully exaggerated. Some of the actors are in the early stages of their careers and seem so young. I especially liked seeing Ben Stiller in what is a serious role. He is a widower with an obsession with protecting his children. They all wear matching warmup suits throughout the film. They do fire drills. You get the point. Eventually, it is Hackman who steps back, takes a look at himself, and does the best he can to try to make their lives better. Unfortunately, this is a mixed accomplishment. I found the movie incredibly quirky and amusing. The Coens would have made it darker, but it does quite nicely.",The Royal Tenenbaums
5,classicsoncall,"""Oh, that's right. We've got another body buried here, haven't we?""",9,29 December 2018,"This is the type of film that really appeals to me. It has characters that are flawed but human, and a story that moves along with it's absurdities using deadpan humor supplied by a talented cast. Just to give you a flavor of how offbeat the story is, every time one of the players calls for a taxi, it's a gypsy cab that shows up, prominently identified as being one of those unlicensed for-hire vehicles operating illegally in the neighborhood in which the Tenenbaums live. The title is a bit of a misnomer if you were expecting a film about a royal family, it's only the patriarch who's first name happens to be Royal. In that role is Gene Hackman, a scalawag and deadbeat who abandoned his family twenty years prior, and now, on sort of a mission to reconcile, attempts a comeback with a wife and three adult children who aren't particularly fond of the idea. Each of the characters in this story has a particular quirk or two, burdened to some degree by their relationship to each other and especially to Royal Tenenbaum. They've all moved on to the best extent possible, but when Royal returns to the family homestead, all of their lives become an exercise in sheer frustration and unlimited patience. Yet with a phony story about having just six weeks left to live due to stomach cancer, Royal Tenenbaum accomplishes the near impossible, bringing together a family deep in the throes of alienation and self doubt, and uniting them in a way that defies probability. Granted, the film will not appeal to all viewers, but if one's sensibilities are piqued by the off-beat and sometimes ridiculous, this movie may push all the right buttons for it's whimsical take on life and the absurdities that often intrude on daily existence.",The Royal Tenenbaums
6,lee_eisenberg,family life,10,18 July 2005,"Obviously, weird/dysfunctional/neurotic families always make for interesting movies, but ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" may have brought the genre to its zenith. Gene Hackman plays Royal Tenenbaum, the estranged patriarch. Mother Etheline (Anjelica Huston) continued raising sons Chas (Ben Stiller) and Richie (Luke Wilson) and daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) on her own. Now, Chas has two sons, whom he is raising to be as neurotic as he is, Margot has hooked up with the pompous Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), and Richie is a tennis player who deliberately lost a game (I got the feeling that he was obsessed with his sister). Meanwhile, Etheline has hooked up with the cultured Henry Sherman (Danny Glover). And there's something up with friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson).In the midst of this all, Royal finds a way to get the whole family back together: by telling everyone that he has an illness. Getting back together, the entire family is forced to reevaluate their relationships with each other and how they've been living and...look, I can't do justice to the movie by trying to describe it. It's a masterpiece. You have to see it.",The Royal Tenenbaums
7,jboothmillard,The Royal Tenanbaums,8,19 September 2005,"I remember seeing this and enjoying bits and pieces, I knew I had to see it again to see why critics give it five out of five stars. Basically rude, lying and unaffectionate Royal Tenembaum (Golden Globe winning Gene Hackman) has not seen his family in seven years ago, after wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) chucked him out to raise the kids herself, and he lies saying that he is dying of cancer to see them. So he is reunited and making amends with everyone, his wife, and the kids: daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and sons Chas (Ben Stiller) and Richie (Luke Wilson). Of course everyone was going to find out eventually, but everything is settled in the end, and by the end of the film, when Royal has genuinely passed away, everyone is remorseful. Narrated by Alec Baldwin, and also starring Owen Wilson (also writing with director and producer Wes Anderson) as Eli Cash, Bill Murray as Raleigh St. Clair, Danny Glover as Henry Sherman and Seymour Cassel as Dusty. All performances are fantastic, especially from Hackman, with a marvellous script this is a terrific comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. Gwyneth Paltrow was number 89, and Gene Hackman number 42 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Hackman was also number 31 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 34 on Film 4's 50 Films You Must See Before You Die. Very good!",The Royal Tenenbaums
8,ccthemovieman-1,'Quirky' Seems To Be The Most Popular Word To Describe This,8,24 May 2006,"This was a quirky film that surprised me, in that I liked it....at least twice. By the third viewing, I had enough but I got my money's worth out of it. That's what I would recommend with this movie: rent it before considering buying it. It's very different, and you might love but also might hate it.What it is, simply, is a portrait of a very dysfunctional family and the father trying to re-connect with his kids after a long absence. Gene Hackman is the father, Angelica Huston the mother and the wacko kids - and other assorted strange characters - are played by Ben Stiller, Owen and Luke Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Bill Murray and Danny Glover. This is mostly dry, dark humor with some funny lines delivered in deadpan style. Nobody is particularly likable but - with the possible exception of Paltrow's character - are not really unlikeable either. They are just strange.I enjoyed viewing the house with all its colors. For those who appreciate low-key absurd humor nd some pleasing visuals, you should like this film and I certainly recommend giving it a look.",The Royal Tenenbaums
9,moonspinner55,The price one pays for early genius...,8,10 March 2013,"Wes Anderson's ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", which he directed and co-wrote with actor Owen Wilson (who co-stars as neighbor Eli Cash), is dryly disengaged for a blithely serio-comic effect. It has a graceful style and a dark, sneaky undermining--and it juggles both light and heavy tones with great care--though it seems somewhat reminiscent of John Irving's ""The Hotel New Hampshire"" and, while ""Tenenbaums"" clearly makes for a better movie, there's an ugliness inherent in the film's conception that is never resolved. Designed like an epic novel, we are introduced to the three brilliant children (two brothers and their adopted sister) of a New York City lawyer and his archaeologist wife; she's the Rock of Gibraltar type (natch) who ends up raising the youngsters alone after Dad walks out, but she eventually questions her mothering methods once the kids grow into deeply troubled adults. Anderson has admitted many inspirations in his gestation of this unique family (namely J.D. Salinger and his Glass stories), and this possibly accounts for the film's compressed feel. Gene Hackman's patriarch is really the only character we get to know well. There are moments of straight-faced, absurdist humor in this family portrait (seriously-derived pathos, as well), and the eclectic soundtrack and lovely score are always around to keep the pacing fluid, yet Anderson intentionally holds the principals in check. They're a stultified group, in a creative rut and untouchable (as if under glass). Emotions never boil over in the Tenenbaum household (except for one funny instance where Hackman tells Anjelica Huston a lie about his health), and this unwavering approach may keep audiences from investing their heart in the people and the proceedings. It's an extremely well-produced film, nevertheless, with wonderful individual scenes and performances, but at times these attributes exist in a vacuum. ***1/2 from ****",The Royal Tenenbaums
10,dbdumonteil,break up the family...,6,21 December 2003,"Since the critical and commercial success of ""Rushmore"" (1998), Wes Anderson became a promising and talented director. He's even nicknamed ""Hollywood's new prodigy"". So three years after ""Rushmore"", he released a new movie: ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001).This movie's got a whacky script (the Tenenbaums are all gifted) full of zany ideas and powerful cues: ""he's not your father"" says Gene Hackman to Gwyneth Paltrow about Danny Glover, ""Neither you"" she replies. But this on the level of the directing that Anderson's talent shines: it turns out to be inventive, clever and we can notice that he favors two devices: static shots and tracking shots. Moreover, it's obvious that Anderson put a lot of effort into the esthetic side of the movie: bright colors have been used on the sceneries and they're enhanced by a luminous photography. With all these advantages, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a movie full of light and life.But in parallel, I thought that the performances were of varying quality: if Gene Hackman and Ben Stiller dominate the cast, on the other hand, Anjelica Huston and especially Gwyneth Paltrow make the movie a bit dull. Besides, her wild look annoyed me during nearly all the movie. I preferred her in ""the talented Mr Ripley"" (1999). Moreover, given that she's a playwright, could she be Max Fischer's distant cousin? (Max Fischer was the hero of ""Rushmore"" and in his spare time, he wrote plays too).Then, I think I didn't understand one sequence: this is the last one when all the members of the Tenenbaum family are gathered to attend Hackman's funeral. What do they feel? Happiness? Sadness? Indifference? Wes Anderson doesn't really reveal us the members' feelings about this dramatic event.Although, I don't really regard Wes Anderson as a genius,I'm obliged to recognize that he's got talent to produce movies which can be both funny and wit. So, once again: ""the royal Tenenbaums"", a good movie? Definitely. A masterpiece? No.",The Royal Tenenbaums
11,blanche-2,Wes Anderson shows us a real world with wackos in it,8,20 February 2016,"I saw this film years ago, and I guess I've evolved. I didn't remember any of the disturbing animal things in this movie; nowadays I wouldn't have watched it.I do like Wes Anderson, though, and I do remember liking The Royal Tenenbaums, that bunch of crazies, headed up by Royal (Gene Hackman). He and his estranged wife Etheline (Angelica Huston) have three exceptionally gifted children: Charles (Ben Stiller) is a financial genius, their adopted daughter (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a popular playwright, and their son Richie (Luke Wilson) is a national tennis winter. Royal moved out very early in the kids' lives.Now he needs back in. He's been thrown out of his hotel because he can't pay. He tells Etheline that he has stomach cancer and only a few weeks to live, and he wants to be with his family.The family by now, in adulthood, is a big mess. Charles is now a widower and overprotective of his two boys, Ari and Uzi. They wear matching warm-up suits and he rehearses them in fire drills. Margot is unhappily married to a psychiatrist (Bill Murray) and spends most of her time in the bathroom chain smoking. Richie quit tennis when he suffered a meltdown during a critical match. He has been living on a cruise ship for the past year. Also, Etheline wants the divorce that's been denied her for 22 years as her accountant (Danny Glover) has proposed.The kids all come home to be with their father, happy to be away from their problems. Margot is having an affair with their neighbor Eli (Owen Wilson) who is a western novelist into drugs.A hospital worker owes Royal a favor so he moves in with a lot of borrowed medical equipment. He and his grandsons get along the best; Charles has a lot of issues with his father. Richie is in love with his adopted sister. Her husband suspects she's unfaithful, which she is. He hires a private investigator.Royal is found out and tossed out of the house. He becomes an elevator operator at the hotel that evicted him and moves into the Y.Royal is dismissive and rude, but he loves his family and eventually tries to do right by them as he's the only one who can.There's an underlying sweetness to this film, and it is filled with great music, funny dialogue, and sad, lost characters. It's emotional, striking to look at, and has a lot of subtle touches. The end is satisfying and not pat. The big thing about the comedy for me is that it's not directed to the lowest common denominator.A black comedy that's not for everyone. I think Wes Anderson fans will appreciate it.",The Royal Tenenbaums
12,Quinoa1984,"One of the best comedies of the year, quirky and definitely inventive",10,29 December 2001,"Wes Anderson's third film The Royal Tenenbaums is the best film from him I've seen (though I haven't seen Bottle Rocket, it's an improvement over Rushmore for me).  He and his co-writer/actor Owen Wilson have created a fictional group of characters that are and aren't like people you would usually know, in other words, it's realistic with both comedy and tragedy.Gene Hackman plays Royal Tenenbaum dead-pan as a sneaky, mostly low-down nasty yet also with a bit on conscience side he decides after not seeing his family for a number of years to come back to them with a scheme of having stomach cancer.  His family includes his not exactly ex-wife (Angelica Houston) who is considering marrying her accountant (Danny Glover), his two sons played by Ben Stiller with accurate bitterness and the other played by Luke Wilson with accurate sorrow and inner-pain, and also his adopted daughter played by Gwyneth Paltrow who is secretly the apple of Wilson's eye.  Other stars include Owen Wilson as a western writer who is into a lot of drugs and Bill Murray as Paltrow's empty husband.All of these characters come together (more or less) to create an engaging and really amusing dramedy, full of (possibly too full of) creative ideas for each character, in particular for Royal which gives Hackman a chance to give one of his best recent performances.  This added with some interesting cinematography and writing (sometimes it's like watching a book on tape) plus the best soundtrack of the year make this a good watch any time. Soundtrack by the way includes The Ramones, The Clash, Paul Simon, The Rolling Stones, Elliot Smith and a cover of the Beatles. A-",The Royal Tenenbaums

This family of eccentrics prove to be a motley brood. Whimsical, incestuous and drug induced antics evoke just part of the substance of this intellectual comedy.

14,Theo Robertson,How Not To Write An Interesting Script,3,24 February 2004,"I can`t believe so many people have written so many positive comments on THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS , personally I absolutely hated this movie due to the simple reason it has a ridiculous script structure . If you`ve never seen the movie let me point out that the audience are subjected a very lengthy pre title sequence featuring character exposistion with a voice over that goes on and on . The opening credits come and go and then we`re subjected to more voice over . I can`t give a clear answer as to how long this narration lasts for but it seemed to go on for several life times . I`ve nothing against narration or voice over , indeed two of my all time favourite movies FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and APOCALYPSE NOW feature this technique which leads me to believe that it`s handeled wrongly . Another fault of Owen Wilson`s script is the characters who are members of a very very rich family full of extremely gifted children . Is it just me or are poor little rich kids the least involving subject for a film ? No doubt fans of THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS will counter act my criticisms by pointing out that the script was Oscar nominated . My reply to them would be so what ? The script was written by actor Owen Wilson and the academy voters are over represented by actors . Actor Colin Welland won a screenplay Oscar as did Emma Thompson and let us not forget Ben Affleck won an Oscar for writing GOOD WILL HUNTING . Likewise look at all the actors who have won Oscars for directing . If an actor writes down a shopping list and films their visit to the local supermarket they`d be in line for best screenplay and director . Come to think of it I`ve had more fun going to the shops than I had watching THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS",The Royal Tenenbaums
15,jotix100,The Royal Mess,5,9 January 2002,"I had all the best intentions of enjoying this film, as I have always admired the talent of Wes Anderson. That said, I can only state that as black comedies go, this isn't even beige. Did anyone tell Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson their screenplay was just plain boring? Mr. Anderson perhaps had something else in mind when he thought about this project. The idea of a dysfunctional family sounds great, but in the treatment of the material on screen, it doesn't materialize. It's about one of the dullest films of the year, in spite of the overblown praise from all critics toward this movie, which does not come up to Mr. Anderson's previous directing efforts.It's a shame because of all the talent amassed in this picture. The best thing in it is Gene Hackman. He is an actor that's always interesting to watch. His Royal Tenenbaum is not a fully formed character, but I would pay to see Mr. Hackman read from the Yellow Pages any time rather than to see him in a misguided attempt at comedy.Gwyneth Paltrow character is bo-ring. And so are the brothers Wilson, and Ben Stiller. Angelica Houston is very dignified in her role, but you don't believe for a nanosecond that after what she went through with Royal, she would walk to the altar ever again. Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman, who were so incredible in Rushmore don't have anything to do here. The narrative device is sophomoric at best. So the best advice to all the fans is to wait until it comes out in DVD. Who knows, it might even play better....",The Royal Tenenbaums
16,LeonLouisRicci,The Best Movie Ever Made Featuring Dalmation Mice,9,24 July 2014,"The Director Wes Anderson Catapulted to Overwhelming Financial Success with this His Third Film.

18,Boba_Fett1138,Not nearly as fun as I had hoped it would be. Still an enjoyable movie to watch.,7,8 November 2006,"No I'm definitely not a Wes Anderson fan (even though I certainly get and understand his style) and I'll probably never become one. You'll either just hate his movies or just totally love it.I saw ""Rushmore"" and though I enjoyed it, I certainly did not loved it. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" seemed like a more enjoyable and completely humor filled movie, so I decided to give it a chance. Just like ""Rushmore"" I enjoyed watching the movie but I wasn't always exactly fully amused and the movie did not always entertain- or was fun enough.The movie is filled with some eccentric, quirky over-the-top characters, set in a normal world. The characters are weird but they're certainly not funny. Not any of them is ever given something interesting or fun to do in this movie, which seems to be a waste, considering when looking at the cast of the movie. Ben Stiller is holding back and Bill Murray is given too little screen time to become an interesting or hilarious character. Guess that the movie also has way too many characters in it, which does begin to work distracting from each other after a while.The comedy and humor of Wes Anderson movies is always in its little and subtle things. Each sequences is carefully crafted and fully thought out. Every time you watch this movie you'll discover new fun small things set in the background or a small piece of dialog or character behavior. So I definitely understand and appreciate Anderson's style but yet I just don't enjoy it as much. Just not my type of movie and style of film-making.The entire movie is made in intro-style. So scene's rapidly follow each other and everything is build up and break down again in basically 5 minutes time. To me this is a very tiresome way of film-making that doesn't work amusing enough for me. It's good at first but it's starting to get old already after a while.Saving grace for me was Gene Hackman. He certainly added some style and power to the movie as the rude and not so subtle father of the family. In my opinion he also was the true main fun thing about the movie. Even more fun and hilarious than Bill Murray in the movie. I think that says something about the entire amusement level of the movie as a whole.In all honesty the movie did entertain me and this was mostly because of the little subtle things in the movie. As a whole, so with the characters, style and story included, the movie just didn't strike me as an perfectly amusing one. But most likely the Anderson fans shall not complain.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Royal Tenenbaums
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Surprisingly good,8,21 February 2005,"Having seen Wes Anderson's first film, Bottle Rocket, and being thoroughly disappointed with it I didn't have that high expectations for this film. It surprised me with how entertaining it was, not to mention how sharp and clever most of the humor was. The cast contains considerable talent and it shows. The acting is superb and the timing is never off. The writing is very good, and there is hardly one joke or gag in the whole film that falls flat. What really makes this film work that despite the extremes, despite the unlikely nature of many situations and characters, it seems somehow believable and it rarely steps out of line or tries to be funny by being downright offensive. It reminded me of old episodes of The Simpsons; a wacky yet(albeit only slightly) credible view at family life. The characters are far-fetched and somewhat unusual but we still relate to them and feel with them. The plot is pretty good and the pacing of it is very good. Despite the laid-back feel of the movie, you're rarely bored. The humor is very good, it makes you laugh without stooping to the level of crude gags or gross-out comedy, and whilst being almost entirely unoffensive. Just about anyone should be able to enjoy this, unless you have something against one or more of the actors, or don't like the style of humor. I advise you to check out the memorable quotes if you are unsure whether or not you'll like the movie. I recommend this to any fan of any of the actors involved and/or fans of Ben Stiller/Wilson brothers' humor. 8/10",The Royal Tenenbaums
20,evanston_dad,Warm-Hearted Peek Into Human Imperfections,8,26 July 2010,"A quirky film about family dysfunction in that distinctly quirky style that only Wes Anderson can pull off.Gene Hackman and Anjelica Huston play the parents of a collection of child prodigies, all estranged from one another and all reunited for a common cause. The fun, as with most Anderson movies, is in watching the talented cast of actors create eccentric, troubled characters that the actors and the script clearly adore. The film pokes fun of its characters, but it laughs with them instead of at them, which is a crucial difference that makes Anderson's movies glow with humanity and warmth and separates them from mean-spirited movies about human oddities churned out by filmmakers like the Coen Brothers.Nothing will ever make me forget the hilarious image of Ben Stiller and his sons in matching track suits practicing fire drills.Grade: A",The Royal Tenenbaums
21,ferguson-6,You want interesting?,9,30 December 2001,"Greetings again from the darkness.  After 12 months of mostly boring, formulaic movies, I am thrilled to recommend ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". Writer/Director Wes Anderson (""Rushmore"", ""Bottle Rocket"") may have joined the ranks of the Farrelly Brothers for creating interesting and unique stories and characters.  I do hope the story lines tighten up a bit in the future, but the thrill of watching interesting (often bizarre) characters overcomes any story telling short comings.  Take heed that the Pacing in this movie is unlike any other.  Sometimes it appears that an entire scene is based on a shrug or a single word.  Anderson seems to have a hand-picked group of cronies that stick close together.  Throw in veterans like Hackman, Angleica Huston and Danny Glover and you can't help but realize this is cool.  Yes the narrator is Alec Baldwin and if you don't realize this until the credits, then you need to see more movies.  I couldn't help but marvel at Gwyneth Paltrow's character and her eternal state of melancholy.  She is proving to be the real deal and not some princess like Julia Roberts. Excellent turns by Ben Stiller and Bill Murray, along with the Owens brothers make the ensemble cast a thing of offbeat beauty.  Whether this is a very dramatic movie with some hilarious moments or a an offbeat comedy with a dramatic foundation, I cannot say.  But it is VERY interesting and entertaining filmmaking ... and I have been starving for this all year.  By the way, does anyone know who Brian Tenenbaum is?  He is credited as playing a paramedic.  Is this a childhood friend of Andersons?  Just curious!",The Royal Tenenbaums
22,safenoe,"I loved Rushmore, but...",6,25 October 2021,"I had huge hopes for Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums for sure. But somehow the movie lacked a storyline spine, and it was kind of like watching one vignette after another here and there. Anyway, maybe a reboot can redeem things.",The Royal Tenenbaums
23,zetes,An embarrassment for everyone involved,7,30 March 2002,"Ugh! The Royal Tenenbaums can be blamed on one of two reasons. You know, I think Rushmore is a fine film, but it was far overpraised. Because of its outrageous success, Wes Anderson was probably so sure of himself that he didn't even bother to do any rewrites on his new film, of which it needs at least a dozen and a half. It's either that or that Anderson and Owen Wilson lost all their writing abilities before they went on to pen this screenplay. The Royal Tenenbaums feels like writing that was crapped out when its authors had severe writers' block. Or, a third alternative, Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson may just have been coked out of their gourds when they were writing this.I don't know how anybody could find this film clever at all. It's quirkiness for quirkiness' sake, and nothing more. The scenes arise and end randomly, nothing at all connects. The characters are all caricatures, dressing in the same outfits as if they were in a cartoon (which was meant, but God knows why). There are a few laughs, but 90% of the jokes fall flat. All of the actors are flat and emotionless, except for Ben Stiller, who overplays his role. I imagine that everyone wanted to work with the writer/director of Rushmore, but I can't believe anyone would have signed on if they had read the script.The Royal Tenenbaums is one of the worst films of 2001, and has possibly the sloppiest script ever written. An Oscar nominated script, I must add. I think the cinema has gotten stronger in the last few years, after a slump in the late 80s through the mid-90s, but this film demonstrates what is worst about the cinema right now, especially independent cinema. 3/10.",The Royal Tenenbaums
24,Sylviastel,"Funny, tragic, sad, and yet very watchable!",9,10 February 2006,"How many fans out there can say they have a more dysfunctonal family than Royal Tenenbaum? You can raise your hands. Every family even the the geniuses are dysfunctional. I was impressed with the writing although I thought it was set in another decade. The car and wardrobe seem to indicate an earlier time period. I thought this was a New York City story but I think it happens in the Bronx. Maybe it is set there but it's not the Bronx that we as fans imagined it to be. The Bronx representation of this film is one where even elite intellectuals like the Tenenbuams can live and have pride in. Even though, the film never says New York City at all which is a great puzzler to me. I thought Gene Hackman gave an Oscar nominated worthy performance as the father of this dysfunctional family. Angelica Huston who I usually see as strong was shown as vulnerable in this role and yet strong as well as Etheline. I liked Ben Stiller who shows that yes he can act besides do comedy. I was surprised by Gwyneth Paltrow's performance as the depressing, private, closet smoker Margot. I don't understand why she is adopted by this family in the first place. They have two sons. Ben's character is afraid after his wife's death in a plane crash. Owen Wilson's character is the brother, a tennis player burnout. I don't know if Dudley is his son or that would make sense. I did like Danny Glover as the man who loved Etheline. It's nice to see interracial romances portrayed as normal as you can get with this film. By the end, you become sad for these characters.",The Royal Tenenbaums

I hate to watch a film that shows disfunctionalism;  even the well too do families have their problems.  What has happened to Bill Murray?  He was not his usual character in this film; no humor what so ever.  I expected more out of Owen Wilson and Ben stiller.  It was disappointing.  However, Gene Hackman can play any role he puts his mind too.  He was probably the best  out of the other actors. Rent it if you have no other choices.4/10",The Royal Tenenbaums
26,SimonJack,The most dysfunctional family ever,7,7 January 2017,"I first saw ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" when it came out in the theater. It has some very funny parts, and I laughed at those. After a while though, I noticed that very few other people were laughing. I've seen the film twice since then, and while I know some of the funny scenes to watch for, with each viewing it has seemed less funny. Which leads me to conclude that the comedy of this movie is good the first time around, but it's not something that can continue to tickle one's funny bone. Or, it may be dated – funny in a culture around the turn of the 21st century, but not so much so a few years alter. After that first time, I wondered about the diverse reactions. Maybe some viewers didn't get the comedy. Some probably did, but it wasn't funny enough to make them laugh. But, there likely were others for whom some of the film got too close to home, too close for comfort. For them it wasn't funny at all. In my second and third viewings of the film, I became more aware of that. There surely are people who have had some of these experiences in their families. To them, it may not funny to watch something like they've experienced on film. Some people still may suffer or have bad memories. An adopted child whose father would embarrass her by always noting the she wasn't his ""real"" daughter. A self-centered, selfish father (or mother) who seldom paid attention to a son or daughter. An absent parent for much of one's life. Drug use in the family, other dysfunctional relationships. That gets to the point that the humor in this film is not the type that everyone can laugh about. It can be crass or hurtful to some. People who have grown up in highly dysfunctional families may smart at some things in this movie. The movie is about a terribly dysfunctional family. So, those who haven't seen this movie yet and may be considering it – be forewarned. For others though, there are some very funny scenes and a few instances of hilarious dialog. The cast all are quite good. Gene Hackman does a great job as the manipulative, selfish lout, Royal Tenenbaum. Anjelica Huston was exemplary as the almost dour separated Etheline Tenenbaum. The rest of the cast of mostly dysfunctional geniuses are all very good. People who are prone to despair or depression should not watch this movie. But adults with a keen sense for wit and far out humor should enjoy this movie – but probably only one time around.",The Royal Tenenbaums

28,StevePulaski,A place where absurdist humor that works and eccentricities scream,9,13 June 2012,"Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums is a beautifully crafted work of offbeat art, delightfully presented with a touch of elegance and humanity. I'm currently in the process of exploring Anderson's entire filmography and have finally found the film that sided with me competently. After Bottle Rocket, I was underwhelmed, yet optimistic at the man's future efforts. After Rushmore, I began to question if this man was the kind of director I wanted to continue to pursue. After The Royal Tenenbaums, I knew I saw something majestic.The film is more than a character study, but a character experiment, erected on the idea of creating the most eclectic characters humanly possible and seeing if the audience can resonate or respond to them in a reasonable fashion. We are greeted with the Tenenbaum family, lead by the father, Royal Tenenbaum (Hackman), a rich yet somewhat off putting soul, who is married to Etheline (Houston). Royal and Etheline give birth to two exceptionally skilled children and adopted one of the same breed. Chas, who is professionally skilled in financing, and Richie, a tennis prodigy are the biological kids, while Margot, the adopted daughter, was a published playwright at the tender age of eleven.The Tenenbaum children should've endured very meaningful and successful lives, but instead, endured three disheartening years of betrayal, failure, and tragedy. Chas (Stiller) sued his father twice for stealing bonds from his safety deposit box and lost his wife in a plane crash, Margot (Paltrow), overtime, became a closed book, smoking, marrying Bill Murray's character Raleigh, who is much, much older than her, and looking miserable throughout her lifetime, and Richie (Luke Wilson) suffered a panic attack on the tennis court during a game, cementing him into a block of uncertainty.Royal has been separated from Etheline for a long time but never divorced. Etheline is currently smitten by her comforting and unanimously caring accountant, Henry (Danny Glover) and is the first to hear the news that Royal is dying from the man himself. He claims that have a mere six weeks to live, and wants to ""make nice"" with the family he has become so disconnected with. Richie's good friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) also comes into play, joining the reunion, but he doesn't truly get his time of day until well into the second act.Knowing about the plot when going into the picture, I had one looming question; why didn't Wes Anderson choose to make the film about the kids in their heyday, rather than them when they're directionless, depressed, morose, melancholy, and vague? I conclude that it is much more interesting to learn about people who are floundering rather than thriving. While the ensemble cast works on so many levels, going back to Gene Hackman, one can not deny that he does a brilliant job at creating a character so insensitive and oafish, that he is able to carry a good weight of the film solely on his subtle gestures and expressions.Being that this is a Wes Anderson film, one must keep a close eye out for those serene nuances likely to be brought to the foreground with repeated viewings. One can tell that Wes, himself, loves primary colors and ones that will ignite the screen with flavor. Stiller and his kids (Grant Rosenmeyer and Jonah Meyerson, respectively) with their gleaming red track suits, Margot with her noticeably different way of dressing (take note to the heavy black eyeliner making her eyes protrude out to the viewer), Owen Wilson's fancy cowboy attire, and Richie excessive use of psychedelic nic-nacs. Because Anderson is so concerned with detailing characters, he makes sure none look to ordinary and none look the same. Providing them with their own little story to tell is nothing short of brilliance on his part as well (credit should too be given to Owen Wilson, who assisted in penning the film).The film is laid out like a book, with chapter titles punctuating the film every so often with a sentence and a half accessible to the viewer, reading like an actual book. If one were to quickly skim the words of the page, they will take note that the details are wonderfully replicated on screen, once again, putting emphasis on Anderson's ability to greatly detail a picture.The Royal Tenenbaums is, without a shadow of a doubt, Wes Anderson's first recognizable masterpiece. Finally he has figured out a way to blend his trademark warmness (heavily examined in Bottle Rocket), offbeat, uncomfortable quirkiness (as shown in Rushmore), and his methodical pacing efficiently and beautifully into a film full of absurdist humor that works and eccentricities that scream. The film is rarely cutesy, always upbeat and fun to look at, precious in fields that floundered in the past, and polished to great detail. What an eccentric gem of a story, conceived brilliantly through the mind of a vivid creator.NOTE: When watching the picture and paying close attention to the particular shot framing, it seemed the film was very concerned with the idea of formatting and camera tactics. Perhaps it's just me, but it's extremely rare that I see a film so concerned with the elegance of framing and technique that, after a while, it becomes so welcoming and unique that sitting down to watch another film or Television program makes you question if something is wrong.Starring: Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Grant Rosenmeyer, Jonah Meyerson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Danny Glover, and Bill Murray.

So I figured I'd give it a shot.I really did enjoy this movie. For some reason I really got into the humor, which is kind of weird, but I loved how quirky it was. Gene Hackman without a doubt steals this movie with his incredible performance as Royal, who fakes his fatal illness just so he can get back into his family. Actually to be honest, all the actors pretty much had flawless performances.I can see where people wouldn't like this movie, but I think it is one of those love/hate movies that you just have to give a chance.

However, it's peculiar nature is just enough off center to make any emotional buy-in impossible and just enough near center to make more than an occasional tongue in cheek unlikely. ""TRT"" is fodder for film buffs, dilettantes, and critics and will likely receive a lukewarm reception from the public at large. Just more proof that creative is not necessarily good.

31,MovieAddict2016,"Wacky, whimsical and a bit alienating.",7,21 August 2005,"""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a well-made movie with a very strong cast, but I personally found it a bit alienating. I prefer Wes Anderson's ""Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" -- they're both equally pretentious, however ""Life Aquatic"" was funnier to me and also more appealing because its themes were better developed than ""Tenenbaums,"" which deals with so many characters that it can become a bit muddled at times.I like both films, though. This one's advantage is that it came first and therefore the whimsical, wacky nature of the story was more original (""Rushmore"" was weird too, but in a more traditional sense).""Royal Tenenbaums"" stars Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum, an ex-millionaire who has been exiled by his family and lives alone in a fancy apartment downtown - until he loses all his cash and is kicked out onto the streets.Faced with nothing, he tells his family he is dying of stomach cancer in the hopes that they will accept him back into their lives.The family - Anjelica Huston, Luke Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Stiller - don't care one way or another, except for Stiller, a braniac whiz-kid who has grown up into a neurotic man. His wife has just died and he's alone with his two kids, wanting nothing to do with the father he never had as a child.There are other wacky characters - Bill Murray as Paltrow's shrink husband, Danny Glover as an associate of Huston's (and a potential love interest), and Owen Wilson playing Luke Wilson's best friend.The movie is good and I admire how its fairy-tale/children's book-structure is so well captured - even with the turning pages that appear on screen to introduce new ""chapters"" of the story.But overall I was left feeling a little underwhelmed when it was over, thinking I preferred ""Life Aquatic"" a bit more because I just found it more easily accessible in terms of humor and narrative.""Royal Tenenbaums"" is pretentious and showy, but if you like unique films, you'll find something worthwhile here.",The Royal Tenenbaums

It's the first film with that modern retro vibe going for it and it really has an effect on this film as a whole. At it's core despite the odd relationships and characters, it's a endearing movie. About catching up with the past and chasing what is important. The cast of this movie just really work together so darn congruently despite the characters being so dysfunctional with one another.

34,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Family tree.,7,18 February 2021,"Mixing dry, often surprisingly dark humour with offbeat but genuine family drama, 'The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)' can certainly be considered 'quirky' (as with all Wes Anderson's films). Exactly how is almost difficult to describe, but you'll know exactly what I mean if you've seen any of the director's other work. The film itself starts off slow with an extended introduction that relies heavy on prose-like narration. Here, the visuals are purely supplementary and, though the contents of the narration are relatively interesting, this preamble goes on for far too long. Thankfully, though, the plot eventually proceeds with a 'normal' narration ratio. Its varied cast of colourful characters (both figuratively and literally) interact with one another in entertaining ways, with the whole thing feeling anchored by Hackman's down-to-earth portrayal of a man who only recently started to care about... well, anything. There are several chuckle-worthy moments and much of the drama rings true. There are some slightly misjudged moments, though. These include a surprisingly graphic and (perhaps more obviously) downbeat suicide attempt and a pretty-iffy-if-you-think-about-it romance between a man and his adopted siblings. Still, the film is generally enjoyable and it comes together in a slight yet significant way. It's a good effort from Anderson. 7/10",The Royal Tenenbaums
35,gbill-74877,Has its moments,7,2 October 2020,"This film kind of put itself in a hole with me during its extended introduction to all of these wealthy people/child prodigies. For one thing it seems awfully contrived, and for another, it was hard to connect and feel invested with the characters because of how their stories are told, despite all of the quirky touches Wes Anderson mixes in. At its heart, which I think is the relationship between an absentee father (Gene Hackman) and his oldest son (Ben Stiller), the film has some genuinely touching moments. The film seems to ask, what are the limits to forgiveness and redemption in this world, when someone has been such an asshole (and to his own children)? There it shines, as we see the damage done to Stiller's character despite his tough exterior, as well as vulnerability and pain. It's remarkable, no matter how successful one becomes in life, childhood trauma is always there, and may float into one's consciousness unprovoked like a demon. I wish the film had focused on this, because the various other subplots did much less for me, including the semi-incestuous love between siblings (one is adopted) and the drug using family friend. These aspects feel pretty packaged, with emotional songs cued up at all of the right moments. It's a star studded cast, but I think they acted below their talents, maybe because of the script or direction, with Gwyneth Paltrow in particular showing little range. I still liked watching the film for its central theme and for its little bits of humor - I don't think I can ever dislike a Wes Anderson movie - but this one falls a little short of one I can truly love.",The Royal Tenenbaums

37,johnnyboyz,Independent film fan's heaven; but it also uses good characterisation and narrative to keep everyone else entertained.,7,1 January 2008,"""A true friend stabs you in the front."" Oscar Wilde.It seems people like to label this film 'quirky'; a word that doesn't complement a film and one that doesn't quite criticise it either. In this sense, quirky might be a good adjective to use to describe The Royal Tenenbaums but it's so much more than just that. The film was the third from Wes Anderson; a man who is perhaps rather quickly embedding himself somewhat as an auteur when it comes to film-making  his most recent effort The Darjeeling Limited was also of the 'quirky' and off the wall style. But The Royal Tenenbaums is more than a film merely advertising a director/writer as the next Kevin Smith; it is a journey down an independent route that although isn't great; is certainly enjoyable and showcases what Anderson likes doing the most: playing with conventions most of us will have become accustomed to.Like every film, The Royal Tenenbaums uses its opening twenty-five minutes to set the scene but what a scene to set. I feel most people will either switch off before the opening half an hour; failing to keep their interest levels above a set standard whereas others will let the film roll on, the majority of which will afterwards claim it 'genius'. I appreciate what Anderson is doing here, as I could with The Darjeeling Limited but this is not a great film despite making us think and forcing us to observe everything on screen. The film makes, in my opinion, an early mistake by flashing over past major events in a way that will make us feel sorry for certain characters once the present tense takes over. Another film that made this error was recent Spanish effort 'Volver' which wanted us to feel an emotion within the first thirty minutes or so as characters suffer epiphanies over events that took place before the film's time. The Royal Tenenbaums does this when the narrator exclaims 'everyone was in the same house for the first time in 19 years.' Now, I suppose that's supposed to be a really big deal and it's supposed to make us 'feel' something; because I certainly would if it happened to me in real life, however; when it's just happened to a bunch of film characters I know nothing about then there is no reaction.This is, however; pretty much the only major problem I had with the film. Like Volver, I will remark here that this would've worked brilliantly had we had a film pre-showing these events hence The Royal Tenenbaums would've acted as a fantastic sequel as we would've now known everyone. But the film remains an entertaining and mildly amusing romp that announces itself as independent and never turns back in embarrassment. Anderson spreads his characters around this small filmic space and spends enough time showing us and building up an audience-character relation with each of them; royally shedding any protagonist or antagonist tag a character may inherit. It's worth saying here that the narrator is not in the film; in fact any of the film's character could have easily doubled up as the narrator thus ruining the idea of whose point of view this is told from: everything is being said as it happened, by someone neutral. The film is actually told aurally with apparent pages from a book popping up now and again as the film enters a new 'chapter'. This does not drag the film toward any fairytale tag (since often when a narrator tells a story they aren't involved in, it's a fairytale) but complements the film's breakaway approach.Instead, Anderson takes time to develop his characters in a very meaningful and enlightening way. Richie Tenenbaum (L. Wilson) is a disgraced ex-tennis player who obviously fell out of love with the game (yet still wears the tennis gear rather casually); Chas (Stiller) is an overprotective parent to his two sons; Margot (Paltrow) is the secretly disgraced daughter whose reckless life is kept secret and Royal (Hackman) and Etheline (Huston) are the parents whom couldn't quite work it out. Anderson has put a great deal of thought into these characters and not only shows us who's what but subtly tells us through body language and clothing what they're really like. Chaz is always wearing red and thus seems angry most of the time while Richie wears yellow and seems more at ease with everyone since yellow is a very calm colour. Likewise, getting back the apparent tennis equipment 'goof'; Richie only really removes it when he cuts his beard and his hair in an event that will no doubt count as a spoiler. After this very disturbing and well shot scene, the tennis equipment disappears as he has confronted his demons and is now, I suppose, liberated from his giving up of the game.Anderson sets up his compositions well: Margot is always in the background, hovering; perhaps detached from everyone else when the entire family is in shot. We discover what we need to know about Etheline's relationship; Royal's condition and Margot's past as well as everything else at preciously the right time in the final third whereas we remain interested up until this point due to good characterisation and that feeling of 'Who the hell are these people, exactly?' Make no mistake, Anderson has made a good film here with enough going on to warrant a watch and with enough brains to keep you perhaps noticing something new each time. Not many films these days can stand up and be able to say that.",The Royal Tenenbaums
38,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Dys""funny""ctional family is quintessential Anderson",8,7 March 2008,"Family dysfunction is at the core of Wes Anderson's films more often than not, and those dynamics are particularly forward-facing in ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" which in some ways is a fantasy of the troubled young adult: imagining an absent parent attempting to do right by his children before it's too late.The film centers on a family of child prodigies whose patriarch, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) wounds them in different ways literal and emotional as children that have caused them all to fall well short of their potential. When Royal tells them he has a terminal illness, it reunites the family and gives him an opportunity to make amends.Hackman is simply perfect as Royal, a parent with the best of intentions with no awareness as to how his thoughtless words and actions have affected his children. Danny Glover's character Henry Sherman, the family accountant who deeply loves the mother, Etheline (Angelica Huston) puts it perfectly when he says to Royal ""I don't think you're an asshole, but your kind of a son of a bitch."" Of all the children: Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwenyth Paltrow) and Richie (Luke Wilson), Paltrow shines the most. Playing against type, she makes Margo cold, distant and secretive, but there's a longing in her performance, and she draws us into that hidden, unexpressed longing. Her character arc lacks a little, but Anderson's work is about portraits, and hers is the most interesting.Anderson co-writes with Owen Wilson, who also has a supporting role as a childhood friend of the family with his own issues, and the two expertly showcase their tightly and thoughtfully conceived characters. The film's narrator-driven structure dresses the scenes up just as well as his meticulous sets. The narration and what's shown on screen complement each other to form a compelling presentation.Anderon's trademark composition and visual palette abounds in ""Tenenbaums,"" allowing us to take in all the characters and scenery. Even when a character is in the background of a scene, you're still learning about him or her. The vintage '70s look of ""Tenenbaums"" despite the present-day setting gives the film its unique visual flair, while also communicating the ways that its characters — specifically the Tenenbaum children — are stuck in that time period, or at least unable to shed it from their lives and emerge as their own adults.The themes of family and connection make ""Tenenbaums"" one of Anderson's best. The way the family members are drawn to one another while voluntarily repelling one another captures a great deal of truth about families and the love-hate relationships that form in them. As the film progresses, it is amusing to see Royal turn from the character that is to blame to the only character who seems to have things figured out. Anderson shows that sometimes it takes a lot to get people to see what matters most, or to communicate what they need or want to people they acre about — especially if that thing is love. But he affirms that people can indeed find it and in turn make their lives better. With all this and plenty of Anderson's quirky, deadpan humor, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is quite likely the most quintessential example of his style and auteur approach.~Steven CThanks for reading!

40,Vartiainen,Anderson is a tad overrated,4,8 July 2015,"Prior to watching The Grand Budapest Hotel, I couldn't stand Wes Anderson's films. And this film is an excellent example as to why. To keep the story short, Anderson seems to think that merely being weird makes him comedic and merely throwing a dark curveball at the plot makes him tragic. And, admittedly, according to most people, it seems to work. He's a well-regarded director, so it's most likely that I'm just one of those people that don't get it. And I did get it with The Grand Budapest Hotel, where everything I had hated about Anderson somehow just seemed to work.But not here! The Royal Tenenbaums is simply tedious. It has style, I'll give it that. It has plenty of style, from the set designs to the clothing to the dialogues. Everything has a healthy splash of ""just a bit too much"" thrown in, making it an interesting film to follow, especially visually. But the story... gods, the story.So we have this man, the eponymous Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), who used to live the high life with his family, The Tenenbaums. And what a family. I can't decide if they're satirically bohemian and odd or whether they're what Anderson thinks what a normal urban family is all about. Probably the former, but with this man, could be either one.Anyway, Royal has since estranged himself from the family, but now his wife (Anjelica Huston) wants a divorce in order to remarry. And once again Royal's rapscallion side rears its head as he tries to throw wrenches at her plan. Plus we have all the kids to make it even weirder. We have a highly neurotic Wall Street shark (Ben Stiller) who dresses himself and his kids solely in neon red jumpsuits. We have a tennis prodigy (Luke Wilson), who drinks nothing but bloody marys with pepper. And finally we have Gwyneth Paltrow, who's married to Bill Murray.Hijinks! I can see what draws people to this movie. It is very unique in style, the plot is very unpredictable and you're constantly being intrigued. For me it was a tedious experience because I couldn't regard the characters as people to be taken seriously and thus the drama side of the plot fell flat for me. And I don't like weird for the sake of being weird kind of humour, so that didn't work either. But, you should be able to garner whether this is your kind of film from this, so go ahead and decide for yourself.",The Royal Tenenbaums
41,bsmith5552,A Real Disappointment!,4,9 December 2002,"With such an impressive cast, you would think that ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" would have been a whole lot better. I can see from the voting history, that the majority of IMDb users liked it. I'm afraid that I cannot agree. What with such names in the cast as Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke and Owen Wilson, Bill Murray and Danny Glover, I guess I expected a lot more. Billed as a comedy, I don't think I laughed once. Hackman is Royal Tenenbaum the head of the family who left 22 years earlier to follow his own selfish interests. Now broke he feigns a fatal illness to work his way back into the good graces of his family. Huston (I haven't slept with a man in 18 years) looks bored in her limited role as Ethel, the mother.
 The three Tenenbaum children, after showing flashes of brilliance in their youth, have now descended into the dark side of life. Stiller plays Chas who once showed promise as a financier but has now degenerated into a paranoid widower with two look a like, dress a like boys. Paltrow (complete with Tammy Faye eye makeup) plays Margot who was once a promising playwright and now locks herself in the bathroom and looks stoned all the time. Her husband Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray) is I think, a shrink who always seems to be analyzing his stepson (Stephen Lea Sheppard). The third sibling is Ritchie (Luke Wilson) a failed tennis pro who harbors a secret desire for a forbidden fruit. Also in the mix is next door neighbor Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) who winds up being a spaced out druggie and Danny Glover who sleep walks through his role as Henry Sherman, Ethel's suitor. Eventually all come home to roost and through Hackman's efforts the ""children"" regain their confidence and everybody lives happily ever after. The only performance in the film that I liked was that of Hackman as the didn't give a damn father who upon going broke, suddenly realizes that he has to regain his family before he dies. The other principals seem to be in another world. Ben Stiller IS NOT funny; Bill Murray (with a fright beard)IS NOT funny; Gwyneth Paltrow looks half asleep; the Wilson brothers are in other worlds (I suppose Owen has to take some of the blame because he co-wrote the script); and Danny Glover is totally wasted. For what its worth, the film is narrated in sleepy manner by Alec Baldwin. If this was a comedy, I must have slept through the funny parts. A real disappointment.",The Royal Tenenbaums
42,elshikh4,Pedant and dry (I began to think that it's a corollary with Wes Anderson's films !),6,28 September 2010,"The first segment wasn't clear enough. The case of that family as very disconnected wasn't portrayed well. I didn't feel at all the sufferance of these characters apart, and since being kids. The matter of being geniuses was lost; other than assuring the expatriation of the characters, it added nothing, being not utilized at all. Sometimes the dialogue has so little to showcase. The tricks (the matter of separate chapters, the way all the actors talk to the camera's eye, the unbroken singing soundtrack,.. etc) didn't serve much in my opinion. It made the movie just atmospheric, and when it comes to that soundtrack, annoying is the right word!The characters look so strange and odd. Yes, we all are like that without love. But sometimes they looked too odd as no humans, moving woodenly like puppets, and talking intermittently like robots! (Owen Wilson)'s character was surely the worst. I didn't understand that guy at all. So he became great writer out of his love pain, then he became hopelessly drug addicted when he understood that his girl was in love with her brother?!! (Ben Stiller) hates his father so much, so why exactly is that? Stealing his money once? Or hitting his fingers at another? The reconciliation between them both at the end was a farce. Or how (Stiller) discovers his fears after his wife's death too late as well. Look at the way (Royal Tenenbaum) divorces his wife so simple, with not much to explain why (personally I though it's another scheme of his). And it was so far-fetched that someone smokes for years and years and nobody, including her husband, didn't ever notice. I know (Wes Anderson) is telling us how far we became towards each other, but he just assumes too much, with great confidence, that that would work. I don't know why this movie tries to say simple things with this amount of pedantry? Like the long one-shot sequence after the car crash, it has a lot of effort to it, yet with so little drama or comedy.Most of the cast immersed in roles that were written to look like a caricature, however no real fun did generate. As a drama, it isn't so great as well. You read that (Danny Glover)'s looks was modeled after the UN Secretary General (Kofi Annan)'s.. SO WHAT??!! So much to the sophisticated details either (the spots on the dalmatian mice, the hawk, the amputated finger, the monster-masked men paintings, the brown color for all the clothes..). As you see, there is great attention to many picky external details, but with no such attention to the essential, more sincere to the drama, ones.It is a movie about not living love, or losing it, through a tale of some always absent father who tries so late to connect his true disintegrated family while discovering that the thing they all miss, and suffer because of missing it, is love. However, that tale, while being eccentrically funny at times, didn't have much soul, and seemed so dry at times.I loved some points here and there, such as the way nearly all the characters live in no real home (ship, bathroom, elevator, tent, or a house always burning); simply there is no belonging since there is no home of love, or home with love. And so, selecting the name (Tenenbaums) would be understood for sounding so close to (tinted bums). The new job of (Gene Hackman)'s character; aside from being a funny sudden transformation for him, it says metaphorically how his character tries to connect people to their rest or stability, while he himself has none. It has another merit; (Alec Baldwin) as the narrator. Unexpectedly the movie unearths the wise and heartwarming tone in his voice and uses it perfectly. (Hackman)'s performance ruled as the only human character there.After watching (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou - 2004), then (The Royal Tenenbaums) for (Anderson), I began to believe that this guy loves to change the form, ornament it, showing different characters in different taste, however with no nifty outcome yet. The problem with him obviously is that he thinks that style is an enough narration, and the form can be satisfying core.After its end, I wasn't impressed or that satisfied. Not due to the not-so-happy ending; on the contrary, that was interesting point itself, but for having plenty of good stars with promising tale in so tinted work yet all immersed in coldness. Remember the shot in which we watch (Gwyneth Paltrow)'s character smoking alone in the street at night after her new play's end; that was too frosted to provocative extent, not all the Beetles' music in the world can do anything to this!",The Royal Tenenbaums

Director Wes Anderson's pic about a dysfunctional family who reunites does have its functional dark comical moments.

45,runamokprods,Another wonderfully original film by Wes Anderson,9,19 September 2016,"Wes Anderson's idiosyncratic films create very individual reactions. I've had more than a few good-natured arguments about which are his best films. So the opinions below should be taken with that grain of salt.For me, while this is not quite as brilliant and original as Anderson's classic 'Rushmore', it's a terrific movie, full of wonderful performances, great cinematic flourishes, Anderson's trademark terrific use of songs as score, and lots of very funny and occasionally deeply touching moments. He continues to create deeply dysfunctional, wildly screwed characters you still care for. What 'Rushmore' did for adolescence, this does for family, wealth, and the confusing weirdness of young adulthood.It just didn't stay with me quite the same way 'Rushmore' did, and some of the Anderson techniques that were shockingly new and refreshing the first time, feel more familiar here. But this his is one of the very brightest, most original voices on the US film scene of his generation -- a film-maker who creates oddball worlds and characters that somehow you can still always relate to. This is a film well worth seeing out, and seeing more than once.",The Royal Tenenbaums

The worst part of this film is that not only adults but even kids are shown as dumb.This is perhaps something that might not go well with young audiences.As a final word it can be said that ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is neither a comedy nor a drama.It is a different film for which even the laughs come with great difficulties.",The Royal Tenenbaums
47,drqshadow-reviews,"Heavy and Bittersweet, Unexpectedly Funny, Supremely Powerful - Wes Anderson's Best",10,31 July 2015,"For my money, Wes Anderson just doesn't get any better than this. The Royal Tenenbaums is where he strikes that perfect blend of heartstring and humor, spontaneous weirdness and obsessive attention to detail. The family itself has enough history to carry an entire franchise, but the film doesn't bother to wallow in it for long; there's just too much going on in the foreground to spend more than a few savory moments on back story. Loaded with talent, it pulls everything from its cast. Whether it's Gene Hackman as the conniving, two-faced patriarch with a sudden need for intimacy, Anjelica Huston as his long-sacrificing ex-wife, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow as their never-had-a-childhood offspring, or the vast array of eccentric, colorful supporting characters, it's tough not to appreciate each as a leading-caliber performance. The Royals' tale is vivid and real, emotive and wounded but also spirited and playful. It resonates in a modern setting, especially, when so many of our friends' and family members' tightest circles are similarly dysfunctional. Layered and complex without feeling superficial or overstretched, it's a whole bundle of emotions, flavors, sights and senses smashed into a single, rich, evergreen portrait. I feel this one in my heart's private pantry and my stomach's deepest pit. Wonderful.",The Royal Tenenbaums
48,CubsandCulture,Shows the strengths and weaknesses of Anderson,7,28 February 2019,"As a collection of archetypes cum caricatures cum damaged has beens this story of a family that finds happiness despite never living up to their potentials certainly stands apart. It is engagingly odd, touchingly funny and offers a fresh spin of the father trying to make amends plot. Hackman, especially, stands out as good humored jerk who is too sunny to be thoughtful. There are some delightfully clever bits and the film certainly is consistent in its stylistic excesses. But, it is clearly the work of a new-ish director in the excesses create an oddly paced film. Worse the darkest moments of the story are treated too flippantly. The tonalities of the film clash too much.Anderson, throughout his career, too often goes for lazy atmosphere and captures the storybook tone he wants in the bluntest ways. Repeatedly, he simply places incongruous elements in his mise-en-scene to create the oddness in tone desired. If the story needs to have a father and son have a big fight why just stage in a game closet of course! You need an exposition scene to carry a joke? Make sure to stage the scene in a one and balance a hot dog vendor in the background with a dog in the foreground. This works, on the whole, but once you notice the trick it can be grating. Worse sometimes it is just distracting. There is critical a scene in Eil's apartment that I *still* don't hear a single word of dialog during because of the weird paintings demand attention.If you want to see what Anderson is about this is the film to watch first.",The Royal Tenenbaums
49,jimbo-53-186511,"Wes Anderson fans will probably lap this up, but like a lot of his films this is something of an acquired taste",4,15 April 2020,"Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) is head of the Tenenbaum family, but through a series of misdemeanours he becomes astrayed from his family. Years later (after being forced to leave the hotel he had been living in) he decides to return back to the family home to try and make amends, but it seems not everyone is pleased to see him and Royal is also less than happy when he hears that the family accountant Henry Sherman (Danny Glover) has asked his wife to marry him...Despite watching a number of Wes Anderson films (and not particularly liking any of them) I still find myself watching his films when I get the opportunity. I think the reason is that he is certainly an interesting filmmaker and I'm hoping (rather optimistically) that one day I will find one of his films will 'click' with me. Sadly, it looks like that day hasn't arrived yet (if indeed it ever will).Once again Anderson has assigned a talented cast and indeed The Royal Tenenbaums is a very well-made film, but unfortunately it has no real narrative structure (which seems rather ironic when everything is presented in 'chapters'). Everything feels rather loose and structurally incoherent. The characters are indeed 'quirky', but as with pretty much every Wes Anderson film that's all they really are. On a surface level, a lot of the characters are of some interest (particularly given how well they are set up at the start), but Anderson just can't get seem to get beyond the quirks which leaves a lot of them feeling one dimensional. Perhaps the best character is Royal Tenenbaum himself purely because he is the most straight-forward and I always felt that him and Pogoda had the makings of a brilliant double act (perhaps in another director's hands they would have been). Luke Wilson's character comes on a lot in the second half, but he perhaps bloomed a little too late. Gwyenth Paltrow's character is also of some interest, but again Anderson's development of her is superficial meaning I couldn't give a damn about her. Anderson also wastes other talent such as Huston, Glover and Murray by giving them very little to do or work with. Ben Stiller was more annoying than funny and the other Wilson brother just seemed to be playing Owen Wilson again.The finale is a bit messy, but I could see some heart trying to pulsate through the chaos so this has been reflected in my overall rating of the film. Like I say if you're a fan of Wes Anderson's previous efforts I suspect you'll love this as it is effectively more of the same. As for me, having seen a number of Anderson's films I'm starting to believe that myself and Wes are on completely different wavelengths.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Add to that list of seriously flawed cinematic fathers one Royal Tenenbaum, the mostly-absent head of the hyper-talented, hyper-depressed Tenenbaum clan of Manhattan, N.Y.Gene Hackman delivers one of his most amazing performances as the largely amoral but entirely sympathetic Royal, who decides to reintroduce himself to his somewhat shattered clan when his estranged wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) is courted by her accountant. He shamelessly lies that he's dying. Complicating things are the three Tenenbaum children, finance wizard Chas (Ben Stiller), playwright Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and ex-tennis star Richie (Luke Wilson).""Everyone's against me,"" Royal whines at one point.""It's your fault, man,"" responds faithful friend Pagoda (Kumar Pallana).""Yeah, I know, but dammit, I want this family to love me! How much money have you got?""Royal is basically a user, and no good at dishing out compliments to his emotionally starved children, either, like when Margot, then nine, writes her first play and asks Pops what he thinks. ""This is a bunch of little kids dressed up in animal costumes,"" he snorts.It's possible Royal's tough love drives his children to early success, but it also takes a toll, a toll the film explores in depth. Like the tagline for the film goes: Family isn't a word, it's a sentence. Fortunately, director Wes Anderson is interested at least as much in the comedy potential of Royal and his clan as he is in the more dramatic implications. Like jaysilentbob says in his review here, ""Each joke ends in tragedy, and each tragedy ends in a joke.""I think that distances more people than it should. ""Tenenbaums"" is a film that exists in a kind of hermetic cultural isolation, with its Salingeresque characters and busy background scenery. But it's no arch New Yorker cartoon shot in life. Instead, it winks at its own upscale transatlantic pretensions. Margot's plays carry titles like ""Erotic Transference"" and ""Nakedness Tonight"". A pal of the family named Eli Cash (co-writer Owen Wilson) sends his literary clippings to Mrs. Tenenbaum and smugly tries to insert words like ""presupposes"" into his conversation.Not everything in this film clicks. Bill Murray feels lost as Margot's long-suffering husband, and there are various nods in the direction of spotted mice and a wooden ring finger that lead nowhere. But if Anderson overstuffs his movie with such details, he also finds rich payoffs, like when the often superfluous Chas shares a tender moment with his father near the film's end.Most of the film works best in setting up Hackman for another killer line or facial reaction. Like when Richie says ""You don't look so sick, Dad,"" and he replies with a pleased ""Thank you.""But for all of Hackman's brilliance and well-honed instincts, the Royal role wouldn't be so satisfying if the film he cements didn't make some solid points about family, adult disappointment, and ultimately human redemption. You laugh, and if you're like me as much on reviewings as the first time, but wind up feeling something deeper, a lot deeper, at the overall experience, the kind of feeling that reminds you how beautifully ephemeral and transcendent a really good film can be at the same time.",The Royal Tenenbaums
52,TOMNEL,Beauty and humor from simplicity.,10,24 March 2008,"The Royal Tenenbaums is a hard film to put into a genre. It has no jokes, or funny lines, and the plot is more tragic than anything else. Yet, it works as a comedy, and a drama. Everything about this is very simple. The characters don't have many responses to what's going on, and when they do, they only have short lines, not letting us into the characters at all. Yet, by the end of the film, the characters are lodged in our brain, and we know all facets of them. It's the beautifully simplistic writing and direction that make this small film a masterpiece. Who knew so much could come from the word ""OK"".Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) hasn't been much of a parent to his now grown kids, but when he tells them he has cancer, they come to see him. Some are more enthused than others to do this. His son Chas (Ben Stiller) hates his father, and keeps his kids away from their grandfather. His secretive step-daughter Margot (Gwenyth Paltrow) still won't let him in. His son Richie (Luke Wilson) feels like a failure, after quitting tennis because of a bad game. His ex-wife Etheline (Angelica Houston) has just found new love right when her husband came back into her life. Sounds very simple, and it is, but beneath the simplicity, and coldness of the characters is a sweet longing, that make these some of the best characters ever written. The acting is superb too, lead by Gene Hackman as the father who doesn't know what to do, but he knows he wants the family back together.

A lot of the directing style in Rushmore and earlier in Bottle Rockets can be seen in The Royal Tenenbaums. Still, early in the film, we notice a technique in Hollywood film that many viewers have never seen since it was last used in many of the 30's Musicals like Gold Diggers of 1933 and Footlight Parade.

She doesn't love him anymore. One son, Chas, has lost his wife and is raising his two sons alone. The other son, Richie, has stopped his professional tennis career and is now on a cruise ship for a long time. Luke has a best friend, Eli, and he says to him in a letter that he is in love with Margot.Then Royal comes back, saying he is very sick and will die in six weeks.

He wants to band with the other members as well. The only one who still seems to like Royal is Richie.The story may sound a little complicated, but it absolutely is not. The thing you learn during the movie, is that none of the characters is really happy. They will be, we guess. Another thing we see is that the family members all have their strange things. Being in love with your adopted sister is one. Being loved in return makes it even stranger. They all have something, not only Richie and Margot. Because they have strange things some sad things happen. A lot of funny things happen as well. The movie is a comedy in its own way.The writing is clever, direction good. What I think is taking the movie to a higher lever is the acting. Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum is truly great. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow (Margot) and Luke Wilson (Richie) especially in their scenes together.

58,Spleen,"Everything that was good in ""Rushmore"", transformed into something truly wonderful",10,30 March 2002,"It was a weird year at the Oscars.  They managed, to a greater degree than usual, to nominate the right films, but for the wrong awards.  It's easy to look through the list of nominees and find five films more deserving of winning Best Picture than the five official candidates - even if you leave the foreign-language films out of consideration.  ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (deservedly nominated for its screenplay, otherwise neglected) is one of them.  It also boasts subtler and finer art direction than the half-thought-through nominees for that award, and incomparably better cinematography (real widescreen! real Technicolor! - but that's only part of it: we see the characters related meaningfully to their world in every warm, gorgeous shot) than the five lacklustre nominees for THAT award, although to be fair, ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" was less lacklustre than the rest.  But I won't go on.An ""ensemble"" film of the kind that's becoming all too popular these days, this one doesn't turn into a crossword puzzle: we know at the start how the characters relate to one another (there IS a surprising revelation, sort of, but it isn't there just to startle us; rather, it helps us make sense of what we already know), so we're free to sit back and enjoy the show - those of us who have normal pulses will have already fallen in love with most of the characters during the prologue, anyway.  Part of the reason for this is their real and partly unpredictable intelligence.  We can't distance ourself from the action (i.e., insulate ourselves from caring) with the smug thought that we're so much smarter than the bozos we're watching.The spoken third-person narration is tactfully handled, there when we need it, absent for long stretches when we don't.  (I'll chant it again and again until I'm hoarse: in films, third-person narration, good; first-person, bad.)  The colours are lovely.  Simply speaking, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is pleasure.  It's pleasant to look at, to listen to, to inhabit the world of. It neither insults our intelligence nor (except just once, in a scene which can be justified) present us with something gruesome that we'd rather not see.  No wonder modern audiences didn't know what to make of it.P.S.  One or two people have claimed that what we're seeing is a play which Margot wrote about her family.  Luckily this theory is rubbish.  It's a nice touch that we see sentences (and illustrations) from her later book, but these occur as ""chapter"" headings, not stage directions.  My guess is that that book is an honest, private document, not intended for public viewing - and in the world of the fiction, which we do not inhabit, the book WAS private, unseen by ANY outside eyes.  And the footage that makes up the meat and bulk of the film has nothing to do with the book (except inasmuch as the book is probably, with one or two trivial exceptions, accurate).  What we see is what happens.  Don't worry: this is a real film, not some flippant exercise in narrative confusion.P.P.S.:  I don't mean to imply that the actual Best Picture candidates were entirely worthless.  ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Gosford Park"" and ""In the Bedroom"", little though there may be to say about any of them, no doubt deserved notice for their acting.  ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" had decent make-up.  ""Moulin Rouge"" had fine costumes, and it was nice to see Catherine Martin accepting an award, looking ten times sexier than any of the actresses she or anyone else had been payed to clothe.  A weird night indeed.",The Royal Tenenbaums

60,framptonhollis,hilarity w/heart,9,28 May 2018,"In many ways, 'The Royal Tenenbaums' could be considered the ""ultimate"" Wes Anderson film. It gleefully employs all of Anderson's principal cinematic traits and contains levels of quirk so high it isn't even worth describing. It is also a masterpiece.
 Every shot is beautiful and precise, as is oft the case w/Wes Anderson, but here the style is containing of more vigor and heaviness than is even to be expected. 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is essentially the archetypical Wes Anderson film and, since Wes Anderson is one of my very favourite filmmakers of all time, that just ranks it among what I believe to be the greatest films of all time. It tackles dark topics in a manner that is at once lightly and blackly comical while also be genuinely and successfully dramatic throughout as well. Punchlines don't get in the way of the drama, and yet they are still oft inserted into more dramatic scenes. Everything is timed w/perfection, creating an atmosphere that is theatrical, dramatic, and fantastical, and yet all of the emotions are incredibly raw and real. It's a beautiful film w/near perfect writing, cinematography, performances, etc.",The Royal Tenenbaums
61,Sandcooler,All-star cast holds it together,7,1 July 2009,"I'm just not really that into this movie. The plot about a dysfunctional family joining together and having quarrels has been done a thousand times before, and I've seen it done better. In my opinion the writing isn't as good as so many people have claimed. There are several interesting characters involved, but not a lot is done with them, and I also overdosed on narration. There's really a lot of narration in this movie, I wonder if some of these back stories couldn't just be worked into the dialogues. The ending is also really abrupt, though it's not without its charms. The saving grace of this movie is the incredible cast, that gives the movie its well-needed depth. All of these people are excellent drama actors, and they really bring the script to new heights, they turn their characters into people. I kept watching almost solely for the brilliant performances (especially by Gene Hackman and Gwyneth Paltrow), because for the most part this movie seems a bit overrated to me.",The Royal Tenenbaums

I can see where he has a different outlook after experiencing military school.  He delivers so many good lines in this movie about a family such as nobody has ever seen. Luke is also good.  Luke wears a headband in almost every scene.  It is so dark and funny that it gives dark humor movies such as The Cable Guy (also with Owen) a run for it's money.  Gene Hackman (a Santa Fe resident) does a great performance.  He is so easy to love and hate at the SAME TIME.  If you want to see a strange movie that ventures into territory that NO OTHER MOVIE EVER HAS, then SEE THIS!  The photography is great also.  There is some serious sexiness through out this movie when it comes to all the characters interacting with Miss Paltrow.  I give this a HUGE HIGH FIVE!!",The Royal Tenenbaums

It's not that they're particularly bad; it's just that they aren't especially good. They are thoroughly average, nothing more or less.This movie sports an excellent ensemble cast but I couldn't help but wish that they populated a more interesting story. I didn't connect with any of the characters so it was difficult to care what was in store for them. It's not necessarily a bad story; it's just missing something to truly engage the audience.I have to admit that, as a director, Anderson is talented. The movie definitely has a style all it's own. Also, the soundtrack reveals an enthusiast's ear. Unfortunately, the film ends up as little more than a mediocre story wrapped up in an appealing package.If you liked ""Rushmore"" here's another movie in the same style.

64,wisewebwoman,Over the top comedy with warmth and renewal at its core,8,5 January 2002,"This movie was a wonderful experience on so many levels.  all the characters fascinate, I loved the almost fairy tale quality to it, the redemption of the characters, the mending of broken relationships.  Gene Hackman steals every scene he is in, his performance is flawless. the movie has the feel of the comedies from way back, all the minor players are hysterically funny, Pagoda, the short, fat Indian almost wordless houseman, stands on his head for no reason and always wears pink pants and spies on the family and reports in monosyllables to  Royal, the long gone father. The convoluted plot details and personal history of each family member add to the fleshing out of the characters.  Anjelica Huston, in one of her best ever roles, shows how gracefully and wonderfully she has aged and relishing the part, brings a wonderful wit to her complicated character, it is amazing what she can do with a smile. 8 out of 10 for this great film, one of a kind.",The Royal Tenenbaums
65,Howlin Wolf,Anderson devotees will cherish this one no matter what I say...,3,13 November 2006,"... so if you're a confirmed fan, ""Tenenbaums"" bears the hallmarks of a familiar style. Myself, I don't find it too accessible because his characters all decidedly inhabit their own particular universe. I found ""Rushmore"" and ""The Life Aquatic"" to be at the very least 'watchable' (I rate both 6/10... ) but I think the problem I had with TRT is that the two other films I mentioned had 'oddball' characters where you wouldn't expect to find them; a dysfunctional family unit is bound to have its unique members, because that's WHY they're dysfunctional! Family conflict isn't exactly a fresh theme, it's been done many times, so in the end it just felt like an excuse for the Wilsons to gather together their actor mates and get purposefully 'wacky'...Why not try crafting some characters I can actually relate to, for a change? Anderson's films always seem far too willing to metaphorically pat themselves on the back at the earliest opportunity...",The Royal Tenenbaums
66,Sirus_the_Virus,"I'll admit that I loved it, but I didn't like some of the characters.",10,4 February 2010,"I thought that Wes Anderson;s dramady is an excellent film. That I can't deny. But some of the characters in the film annoyed me a little. Perhaps probably cause I loved Gene Hackman;s character the most, and everyone treats him unfairly.Royal Tennenbaum(played by Gene Hackman) is made out to be an unlikable father. But he is actually one of the best things about the film. Wes Anderson, being the genius he is, uses what he usually uses. He usually makes a comedy, adds a little drama to it, and then adds weird. But here, Anderson uses all of those things, but doubles them.The Tennenbaums(played by Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Gweneth Paltrow) all grew up with unfortunate lives. The parents were divorced. They never really got to know the father really well. The daughter was adopted. Just unfortunate things. Well, the adoption not so much.Years later, they have obviously all gone their separate ways. The father(Gene Hackamn) is living in a hotel. The mother(Anjelica Huston) is a scientist or something like that who is asked for marriage one day by her partner(played by Danny Glover).Chas(played by Ben Stiller), one of the sons, has two children. He was once married but she died in a plane crash. So he is extra careful. The other brother, Ritchie(played by Luke Wilson) has moved on from his tennis days. He is in love with the adopted daughter Margot(played by Gweneth Paltrow)Margot is now married to an older author(played by Bill Murray)and is having an affair with Ritchie's old friend Eli(played by Owen Wilson). She ran off when she was fourteen and didn't do much with her life afterwards.They are all brought together when Royal, the father, tells his ex-wife that he's dying. So everyone moves into the Tennenbaum house again. But not everyone is happy with the father even when he's dying.The film is at times very funny. but I got very creeped out in the last part of the film. Some of the characters I didn't like. such as Luke Wilson's(cause he was very weird)and Ben Stiller's character too. I think the thing that really made the film for me was Gene Hackman. He did the best job. He was very funny. Wes Anderson has done some great films. I think this is definitely one of them. This has got to be seen.The Royal Tennenbaums: A",The Royal Tenenbaums
67,bobsgrock,Quirky and highly original.,8,23 July 2008,"Wes Anderson has been the face of a new brand of comedy ever since he burst onto the scene in 1996 with Bottle Rocket. He further established himself with the 1998 hit Rushmore. The Royal Tenenbaums is considered by many to be his finest work and it is kind of hard to dispute that. This is a rich, complex movie dealing with multiple characters that all suffer from serious trouble in one way or another. Gene Hackman plays the father of a family that was once quite prominent in the world of geniuses. The oldest son Chas was a successful real estate dealer, daughter Margot became a famous playwright in the ninth grade, and youngest son Richie went on to become a great tennis player. Still, all their talent couldn't keep their father from leaving them, and now he returns to see them because he tells them he is dying.This movie works, but not as easily as some other comedies. Being a Wes Anderson movie, the humor here is very dry and there are multiple scenes when you will ask yourself if you should be sad, angry, or laugh at the characters. The look of the movie is remarkable and it perfectly matches the feeling of each character. The acting is tremendous, especially by Hackman, as well as Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, and Angelica Huston. The whole movie is filled with weird and quirk situations, yet it all makes sense somehow. The story gives us these people and their problems and we watch as they try to piece their life back together after being apart for so long. If you are a fan of Wes Anderson, you owe it to yourself to see this. If you aren't, it still is worth seeing, but give it some time. Watching it a second time really helped me understand the characters and the story better. It may do the same for you.",The Royal Tenenbaums

70,mattymatt4ever,A royal disaster,3,9 July 2002,"After watching ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" I've had it with Wes Anderson!  And Owen Wilson's better off staying in front of the camera, because he's no use as a screenwriter.  What is it about Wes Anderson's movies that critics and film buffs everywhere swoon over?  There must be hypnotic rays emanating from the movie screen, because this guy seems to have as much talent as a modern artist who paints a canvas green and titles it ""Grass.""  This movie is such a pretentious bore, so drab and lifeless. Even the all-star cast, full of great talents, can't bring life to this corpse of a film.As far as I know, this is supposed to be a comedy.  Comedy requires a setup and a punchline.  This movie has no punchlines!  We simply experience one quirky situation after another, and we're supposed to laugh at the mere fact that it's quirky!  This is so weird!  Ha ha freakin' ha!  If this is the pinnacle of high-brow comedy, then bring on the gross-out flicks!  The DVD should've came with a laugh track, so I would know which scenes I'm supposed to laugh at.  I've seen a lot of lame comedies, but at least with most of the lame comedies I see, I know when I'm ""supposed"" to laugh.  I mean, I can use any scene from this movie as an example.  One was the scene where Luke Wilson is on the tennis court, playing a terrible game.  What was the joke? He's losing!  That's the joke!  And then he takes off his shoes and socks on the court, as if that's supposed to add some humor.  How 'bout he flings his tennis racket into the crowd?  How 'bout he curses out his opponent like John McEnroe?  There were some great comic opportunities in that scene, but apparently Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson don't know the first thing about writing comedy.  Come on, when a person like me--an amateur screenwriter--is sitting in the audience thinking about 1,001 ways each scene could've been funnier, that's not a very good sign!  Not a good sign at all!The film's only 90 minutes, but it moves at the pace of a dying snail, so it gets more and more tedious by the minute.  You know a director is conceited when he/she shoots a scene that has practically nothing to do with moving the film along, but simply shows off his ability as an ""artiste.""  Why do we have to watch a 2-minute scene that lingers on a close-up of Luke Wilson as he shaves his head and face?  The cast (amazingly) doesn't seem bored with the script and gives in spirited performances, especially Gene Hackman who really goes with the flow, but Anderson may as well have casted a bunch of apes, because there's no reason to waste the talent of A-class actors for this piece of garbage.If I had a choice between watching ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""Corky Romano,"" I wouldn't know which movie to choose.  But there is one thing I have to say--at least the makers of ""Corky Romano"" didn't intend to make a masterpiece.  Anderson assumes he's making a new addition to ""The Godfather Saga"" and obviously the critics fell for his pretentious direction.  Is this a human comedy or a farce?  The characters are too wacky for it to be a human comedy and they're too dull for it to be farcical.  Sure, the film's original.  But the originality goes nowhere.  Originality alone doesn't cut it.For all those who found this movie hilarious, I want you to come to my house and watch it with me, so I'll observe which moments actually make you laugh and which moments I'm supposed to laugh at.  'Cause through my eyes this is just another lame comedy.  So it has intelligence.  So does a PBS documentary on uranium.  But who the hell would wanna watch it?  No matter what way you look at it, a comedy that's not funny is not a good comedy. This is not only a lousy comedy, but a lousy film altogether--in any genre.My score:  3 (out of 10)",The Royal Tenenbaums
71,jhclues,"The ""Royal"" Treatment, Tenenbaum Style",10,10 January 2002,"Take a look at just about any family from any era and you'll probably discover a certain degree of internal conflict present.  This is nothing new.  But recently-- comparatively-- someone chanced upon the term `dysfunctional,' put it in a sentence with, and preceding `family,' and now, though we have neither more insight nor knowledge about any of it, we can at least define what we already knew that we didn't know.  The estrangements that occur within a given family unit and the causes thereof remain a mystery, and in the final analysis, a family is a family is a family, and in `The Royal Tenenbaums,' director Wes Anderson presents one of `those' families for your consideration, contemplation, cogitation and review.  And it's quite a group; a family you're not likely to forget any time soon.	In the decade before they separated, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Etheline (Anjelica Huston) had three children (one of whom-- their daughter-- was adopted).  Etheline was left on her own to raise them, and very early on each child exhibited some unique talent bordering on genius. Chas (Ben Stiller) became a financial whiz and was running a successful business out of his bedroom when he was still a kid; Margot Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a successful playwright by her early teens; and Richie (Luke Wilson) was a professional tennis champion by the age of seventeen.  But as our story begins, Royal, due to certain circumstances (and for reasons of his own) feels the need to reconnect with his family, and even though he hasn't spoken to Etheline in over seven years, she is still technically his wife-- they never divorced.  So, at this late date he contrives a way to gain the attention-- if not the affection-- of his wife and children, once again.  And suffice to say, soon one and all (including the audience) are given the `Royal' treatment, Tenenbaum style, courtesy of Wes Anderson and a terrific cast.	With `Bottle Rocket' in 1996, then `Rushmore' in 1998, Anderson began developing his own unique style of crafting and presenting a film that he fine-tunes to  perfection with `Tenenbaums.'  It's a style that comes from realizing a personal vision and knowing how to implement it, knowing how to convey that unique perspective on life to the audience.  Anderson uses a very straightforward and honest approach to tell his story; there is no charade, pretense or manipulation involved.  He lets you know who his characters are and what they are about, good or bad, and in a totally non judgmental way.  Royal Tenenbaum, for example; he presents him as he is-- what you see is what you get-- right or wrong, this is who he is, and he leaves it up to the viewer to assess his conduct.  And though he may not give you all of the pieces of the puzzle that is any particular character, he gives you enough to make up your mind.  Most importantly, he gives you real people to consider; people with all the flaws and foibles that you and I or anyone we know are invested with in one way or another. 
	Beginning with the extremely well-written screenplay, by Anderson and Owen Wilson (the two also collaborated on `Bottle Rocket' and `Rushmore'), the movie is intelligent and insightful, and a challenge for the discerning viewer.  This is not a film to be taken lightly or at face value; there is a lot to take in, visually as well as cerebrally, but for those who make the least bit of effort, the rewards are substantial.  There are moments of hilarity, but also of reflection, because the comedy and drama plays out measure for measure as it does in real life.  And that's what makes this movie (and all of Anderson's work) so interesting and engaging-- the very real and unpredictability of it all that is so true-to-life.  The story is nothing less than a concise take on the Human Comedy, with characters that are rich and believable (for all, or maybe because of, their quirkiness), and presented in signature style by Anderson-- which is quite a feat considering this is only his third film.  Many directors build a career without ever attaining that personal `signature' that defines their work as uniquely their own, as Anderson already has.  	Leading this outstanding ensemble cast, Gene Hackman is delightfully and endearingly unlikable as Royal, the father everyone hopes they never had. He's about as delicate and subtle as a trash compactor, but in an amusing sort of way.  The guy you can tolerate, even enjoy, as long as you know he's leaving at the end of the day.  And Hackman plays him to perfection, which makes all that goes on around him fall into place, as well.  Stiller gives an effective, understated performance as Chas, a single father of two, coping with problems of his own and obsessed with safety, while Paltrow is deliciously morose and introspective as Margot Helen. 
	Luke Wilson, meanwhile, gives an affecting performance as Richie by managing to really get into his character's skin.  You sense that there's a lot going on behind his eyes, which, in fact, is one of the strengths of this film-- the fact that you can feel these people actually `thinking.' Richie, Margot and Chas share that common thread-- that silent introspection that is so subtly effective, and Anderson wisely gives each of them these quiet, pensive moments-- without cluttering them up with unnecessary dialogue-- that tell you so much about who they really are underneath.  And it proves that even in film, a picture can be worth a thousand words. 
	Rounding out the cast-- and all with noteworthy performances-- are Bill Murray (Raleigh), Owen Wilson (Eli), Danny Glover (Henry), Seymour Cassel (Dusty) and Kumar Pallana (Pagoda).  Quirky, eccentric, funny and alive, `The Royal Tenenbaums' will make you think and laugh at the same time, which isn't such a bad deal; it is, in fact, the magic of the movies.  10/10.",The Royal Tenenbaums
72,rupie,doesn't fulfill its potential,5,2 August 2002,"[possible spoiler] This flick seems to inspire extreme opinions from folks. Let me come down somewhere in the middle: despite an opening that promises some great comic potential, and some truly zany - and subtle - comic touches, this flick never achieves liftoff. The precious convention of ""bookishness"" - presenting the story, chapter by chapter, as a novel - gets annoying after a while, and the film bogs down as it devolves from its comic plane to some attempts at genuine emotion. In other words, it's another in that plethora of movies we've seen lately that can't make up its mind what it wants to be. I groaned when I figured out that Royal - the venal, selfish, completely unscrupulous reprobate - was going to turn out to be the agent of the family's reunion, and that this dark comedy of zany, flawed personalities was going to be ruined by a saccharine happy ending.

He's a good writer and storyteller, and I can't find anything wrong with his direction. His movies are professionally made, A-list quality, top Hollywood product. Why then, don't I enjoy them as much as the for-pay film critics or IMDb commenters? I must be missing something.A complaint that I can (barely) articulate is that the movies have a slightly sour tone. Some of the most inventive characters populate his work, but I never quite connect with them. (I felt the same about the characters in ""Rushmore""). A 'poor little rich kid' characterization acts as a barrier to my empathizing with Anderson's protagonists. I actually want them to fail, not persevere. I guess I should to discuss this issue with my analyst. That said, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a very good movie; it certainly makes for an entertaining weekend rental. I agree with the Academy though, it's not Oscar-caliber. If Mr. Anderson had written the screenplay, and then let Robert Altman direct it, then maybe it'd gotten nominations.

No idea how this complete and utter fraud continues to get away with such bile.",The Royal Tenenbaums
77,FilmOtaku,It's more than quirky!,9,4 October 2004,"With 'The Royal Tenenbaums', Wes Anderson turns his lens to the American family, warts and all. The Tenenbaums are a dysfunctional family  the parents have been separated for decades, and Royal (Gene Hackman) is a disbarred attorney who has long since moved out of the family's enormous house (in an unnamed city of course). The children, all geniuses and overachievers in their own way, are then raised by Etheline (Angelica Houston), an archeologist. Chas (Ben Stiller) is a financial wizard, Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), is adopted and was a published playwright at 11, and Richie (Luke Wilson) is a tennis prodigy. We are provided the family history at the start of the film, then are introduced to the family 22 years later. Chas is still a financial wizard, but, having lost his wife in a plane accident is now the paranoid father of two small sons. Margot is married to Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray, who is basically Anderson's muse), is depressed and hasn't written in years, and Richie, after having a nervous breakdown on the tennis court a couple of years earlier is traveling the world by boat. Still hanging around is Eli (Owen Wilson) a long-time family friend from across the street who is now a literature professor and successful novelist. Etheline is being wooed by her accountant, Henry (Danny Glover) and when Royal gets wind of this, he embarks on a bid to win his family back after not speaking with them for years.Wes Anderson has an unusual style of film-making that has been static throughout his career. Highly theatrical, almost in the style of a play, he presents the story of the Tenenbaums to us as if it were taken directly from a book, so much so that if you were to read the few sentences that are visible in the book that accompanies the beginning of each 'chapter', you would see that the written narrative follows the action to the letter. Anderson favors primary colors, and characters that are identifiable by very distinct appearances. Chas and his sons have their red track suits they always wear, Margot wears the clip in her hair, Izod dresses from the 80's and dark eyeliner surrounding her eyes, Richie wears the sweatband around his head, Eli is in cowboy gear and Raleigh looks like a Freud knockoff. One of the results is that there are varying degrees of recognition for the actor in 'real life'. When seeing Raleigh, it's easy to forget that it is Bill Murray, and Margot for that matter is so different from how we are used to seeing Paltrow. Certainly, this is Anderson's intent. Anderson also favors point of view shots, characters looking directly at or addressing the camera, and is also one of the few modern masters in the use of music. The soundtrack to 'The Royal Tenenbaums' features some classic songs (Ruby Tuesday, Hey Jude) but also has some obscure tracks that are bizarre and fit into the scene beautifully.'The Royal Tenenbaums' has a phenomenal cast, and all of the actors are excellent in the film. I get the strong impression that, since Anderson isn't a mainstream film director, A-list actors sign up to work for him because of his alternative vision and his obvious talent. When I watched this film recently, I asked the two friends I saw it with what they thought, and they both said 'It was quirky'. Since they are both film lovers, I was a little disappointed in this narrow (and obvious) assessment of the film at first. Upon further reflection, however, I realized that they both come from households that have parents who are still together. Coming from a 'broken home' I can relate to the high dysfunction of the Tenenbaums as an adult and embrace the story beyond the presentation, despite its highly stylized format. 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is a brilliant film that is both emotional and eye-catching, and truly cements Wes Anderson as an exciting and talented filmmaker. 9/10--Shelly",The Royal Tenenbaums

80,Pedro_H,Off-beat comedy that probably takes its eccentricity too far,7,15 January 2004,"The Tenenbaum family has produced prodigies in various fields, but the father is down on his luck and claims that he is dying of stomach cancer.This New York story rather reminds me of Woody Allen with the farce button nudged up a bit higher. I can live with strange (and this is very strange), but this takes on life-and-death subjects and the obscure with the same focus  and attention leaving me a little disoriented.You can see how the producers probably had a ball bringing this concept in to being, but slowed down when they had to take it somewhere and then were wading in treacle trying to bring it to a climax. There is a famous screen writing book that advises that you need to take all your characters and throw them together in a garage (Reservoir Dogs anyone?), but the joke - here - is that even when you throw your (fictional) characters together that doesn't mean they have to interact. Not in a verbal sense anyway. There are lots of good bits here and lots of people trying to entertain, but you can't mix and match comedy and tragedy without being a master of your craft and director Anderson isn't quite there yet. Indeed he should be grateful for the talented cast who pull together and work hard to keep the whole thing from falling apart at the seams. Very watchable though and I hope he can move on and make an even better film or should I say, a better more even film.",The Royal Tenenbaums
81,Movie-12,"Easy to enjoy, but Anderson tackles too much material. **1/2 (out of four)",6,28 January 2002,"THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS / (2001) **1/2 (out of four)It's easy to enjoy a movie when we love all the actors involved, and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" places charismatic, top-notch performers in even the smallest of roles. Perhaps this explains the film's overwhelming positive consensus-it's not so much of a good movie as it is a well-cast movie.
In a role he was born to play, a very funny Gene Hackman stars as Royal Tenenbaum. He's the aging separated husband of Etheline (an eccentrically elegant Anjelica Huston) and the father of three previously successful children (Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Gwyneth Paltrow).Unfortunately, the kid's have lived dysfunctional lives since their parents separated 22 years ago. Now, Royal understands his mistake and wants his family back. But Etheline, currently in a relationship with her business manager (Danny Glover), wants no part of her ex-love. Royal concocts an excuse: he's dying and seeks redemption.Like all Anderson's films, this is a vivid character study. It includes some harshly funny, but also touches the grim realities of life. The story, by Anderson and Owen Wilson (who also acts in the film), gives the Tenenbaums plenty of dimension and heart. But there are so many characters to keep track of here, we are pulled in far too many directions.
Few of these characters have much to do on screen. Gwyneth Paltrow, Owen Wilson, Billy Murray, Danny Glover, Luke Wilson, Seymour Cassel, and Ben Stiller all fight for our attention, while the relationship between Etheline and Royal takes center stage. We care about the later characters, so much that the others feel like intrusive. They certainly contribute to the unique style of the movie. But they quickly outstay their welcome, eventually becoming an intrusion.  Speaking of relationships, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" complicates itself with far too many. The various connections don't become overwhelming because Anderson knows who is who and who is with who and why, and he keeps the dialogue very casual. The film never loses it's sense of humor. Thus, as confusing as it is, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is always an easy movie to watch.
Some of these relationships have great truth, but they are mixed within the jumble. Anderson tackles way too much material in a single filmand his talents with style and characters cancel each other out. We're left with a movie that juggles so many characters and so many emotions, that we don't know what to think.   ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is the third feature film by Wes Anderson, following ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore."" I haven't liked any of his movies, but I admire his inspiration and acknowledge his talents. He's a fine filmmaker with refreshing style and a passionate vision, yet his work has yet to make a connection. I eagerly await the moment he learns to blend good filmmaking with good storytelling.",The Royal Tenenbaums
82,bigverybadtom,Godawful,1,19 April 2011,"I saw it in the theater years ago with my mother, and we expected it to be a comedy. Well, I didn't laugh or even smile once. Neither did my mother. And though the theater was full, I never heard one audience member laugh throughout the entire movie. Nor did we find anything else to like about it, other than it finally ended. Everyone in the theater walked out in silence.What was wrong with the movie? Basically, there was nothing right with the movie. The characters were repulsive, the direction was erratic, the storyline moved ever-so-slowly, and the performers behaved as if they were all on tranquilizers. Presumably the people who found laughs in it considered things like incest and dogs being crushed to death in car accidents hilarious.I am at a loss as to what the movie's apologists saw in it. If there was some sort of deep meaning in it that I missed, no matter. Nothing could possibly compel me to ever watch this wretched train wreck again.",The Royal Tenenbaums
83,FlickJunkie-2,A weak screenplay propped up by luminaries,6,20 July 2002,"I finished this film scratching my head over the raves I've been hearing about it.  The cast is terrific, but the material is quite mediocre as was the box office.  I can only assume that Wes Anderson's dark, straight faced comedy must really have found a niche that is starved for this style of humor.This is a film that pretends to take itself very seriously while delivering one absurd situation after another.  There is something cleverly ironic about that, but mostly the film is too serious to be funny and too weird to be melodramatic.  It really fails to identify itself.  It might be viewed as a lampoon of wealth, power and wunderkinds, but it lacks the satirical punch to succeed in that vein.The acting is delightful given the material with which they had to work. The ensemble is brimming with notables, all of whom are at the top of their game.  Gene Hackman is a good choice for Royal.  Hackman is an accomplished dramatic and comedic actor and he was the best of the cast members at walking the line between earnestness and the inanity required by the script. Anjelica Huston seems almost like she can't believe she is saying some of the lines she is given, delivering half of them fighting to hold back a grin a mile wide.  Ben Stiller does a nice job of portraying the neurotic widower and father hater, obsessed with the safety of his kids.  Luke Wilson comes closest to delivering a believable character, playing the highly eccentric former tennis star that had a nervous collapse over the love of his adopted sister.   Luke's brother Owen Wilson is far less funny in this film than in others I've seen, but in his defense, he didn't have a lot with which to work.  Gwyneth Paltrow abandons her normally sweet demeanor and does a nice rendition of the psychologically troubled Margot, complete with despondent personality, blank stare and a variety of nervous habits.  Bill Murray and Danny Glover round out the cast in minor roles that amount to little more than cameos.This is one of those films that you either love it or you can't connect.  I couldn't find enough meat to classify it as much better than fair.  I rated it 6/10.  Add a couple of points if you like ironic deadpan humor.",The Royal Tenenbaums
84,Bolesroor,Second Time Beautiful,8,5 November 2008,"I did not like ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" the first time I saw it. It was subdued... so subdued you could call it muted, or even boring. There were no whip-crack punchlines... there were no outrageous revelations or shocking plot twists. The first time I saw the film all I could see was what was missing. It was like browsing through the pages of a novel before I learned to read.After falling in love with ""The Darjeeling Limited,"" another of Wes Anderson's films, I decided to give ""Royal"" a second viewing, and it was an entirely different movie. ""Darjeeling"" familiarized me with Anderson's cinematic language and style, and now that I knew what to expect I saw everything in ""Royal"" I missed the first time... it was a rich, emotionally satisfying experience... and a much better movie.Gene Hackman is Royal Tenenbaum, the no-good father who all but abandoned his highly-intelligent, highly-sensitive children and wife. He comes back into their disastrous, fractured lives in an attempt to repair some of the damage. Hackman's performance is the heart of the picture, as he walks the fine line between being lovable and rotten with the grace that has become his trademark. I can't say enough great things about Gene Hackman... you know an actor is magic when everyone in the world is in complete agreement about his abilities. He's crisp and dense in dramas and painfully funny in comedies... in this movie he demonstrates just how artfully he can navigate between the two styles and how many subtle levels he's found in between. There's only one word for brilliant.The tragic childhoods of the three Tenenbaum children is told with a sincerity and commitment to detail that can only be known by someone who has experienced such pain themselves. Maybe this is Wes Anderson's genius... this and the fact that he seems to refuse to pass judgment on any of these troubled, sometimes bizarre characters. It would be so easy to portray the Tenenbaum children as spoiled brats who never got over Daddy leaving, but never once did I feel anything but genuine concern for their traumatic upbringing... in spite of the fact that the ""children"" are now in their mid-thirties Anderson is able to present them as the x-rays of the broken little boy or lost little girl inside. They aren't people so much as raw wounds unable to heal... and so the movie is really a character study as we watch Royal try to atone for his past.The movie is not perfect... one of the plot-lines deals with Richie Tenenbaum's tortured romantic love for his adopted sister Margot, a cinematic storyline that is all but impossible to resolve. The agreement they make in order to move on with their lives still feels like a cop-out to me. Owen Wilson's character is not fully developed... he may be a case of one kook too many... and Anjelica Huston's Etheline doesn't seem to have a flaw.But this is nitpicking... ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is ultimately a great movie because it delivers genuine sadness and actual joy without resorting to a single studio cliché. I was forced to acknowledge the imperfection of the characters in the movie, the imperfection of human beings, while still being moved to tears by the realization of what had been accomplished. I don't get emotional at many movies- check my other reviews- but there is truth here, and beauty, and there's no avoiding it.I'm pretty sure that's why I started going to movies in the first place.GRADE: A-",The Royal Tenenbaums
85,moviesleuth2,"After nearly a decade, I'm still fuming over this awful piece of crap",1,8 October 2009,"Why? Why would anyone watch this movie? Why would anyone WANT to?This movie is the most infuriating and insulting piece of crap that I have ever seen. Anyone who finds this movie funny means that I do not want to know them. This is a ""dark comedy,"" something that while I admit is not my forte, I can enjoy (I liked ""Very Bad Things""). And while I will be the first one to agree that ANYTHING can be funny given the right treatment, the way Wes Anderson presents this material makes his ""comedy"" not only unfunny, but cruel. So cruel, that it freely crosses the border into downright sadistic.The movie is about the Tenenbaum family: Royal (Gene Hackman), Etheline (Anjelica Huston), Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke Wilson). After Royal leaves, Etheline makes her children into prodigies of various sorts (Chas is an economist, Margot is a playwright, and Richie is a tennis pro--all before they hit puberty). Then Royal re-enters their lives, claiming that he has terminal cancer.The problem isn't with the story, or the acting. It's how Anderson treats his characters. All of them are deeply troubled characters, and are in dire need of psychiatric help. But Anderson has his actors play mentally ill individuals realistically, and it's pretty clear that he expects us to laugh. But how can we? In order to laugh at these characters, we have to be people who are so sociopathic that we would be convulsed with laughter on a tour of a real mental hospital.All the cast members are gifted actors in their own right (save for the Wilson brothers, especially Luke, who always seems to think of himself as Marlon Brando but doesn't realize that he has zero talent). Why would the appear here? Two reasons: they were offered giant paychecks, or they were so desperate to be able to play a character instead of mailing in a routine performance for the big studios that they were willing to appear in this godforsaken piece of crap. My guess is number two, since major studios would never spend money on something original. Then again, a number of the actors (Angelica Huston, the Wilson Brothers) have returned to act with Anderson again, so maybe I'm underestimating Anderson's appeal (the fact that he is allowed to keep making movies means SOMEBODY has to be watching them).I've been told that I ""don't get"" Anderson's films. If that's the case, I hope I never do. I'll admit that this is a well-made movie. But in his review of ""Very Bad Things"" (a dark comedy that I liked and he didn't), Roger Ebert said ""This isn't a bad movie, just a reprehensible one."" I could say the same thing about ""The Royal Tenenbaums. But I wouldn't want to. It would make it seem like there's a silver lining to this movie (trust me, there isn't).For the love of all things holy, AVOID THIS MOVIE!",The Royal Tenenbaums

The story to the movie is of course about the Tenenbaum family who are all basically a family of geniuses.

The Royal Tenenbaums is of course a comedy, but it sure does have it's drama in it and even though I wouldn't say it was the most brilliant movie around as it's not really 'my type of movie,' it is recommended for those who want to see a different comedy as it will and does have it fans.",The Royal Tenenbaums

In fact, it's The Royal Tenenbaums, Wes Anderson's newest comedy. Back in their hey-day, which we don't know when it was, all three of the Tenenbaum children were geniuses, each in their own individual way. Chas was a Wall Street investor, Margot was a playwright, and Richie was a tennis pro.Gene Hackman is Royal Tenenbaum, the father of the child prodigies. He spilt with his wife Etheline ten years after getting married, but still siring the three children. He lives in a hotel, which he doesn't pay for, and he isn't exactly an honest man. Royal never spent any time with his family, and they all hate him.Anjelica Huston is Etheline Tenenbaum. She was a typical mother of a successful trio of geniuses. She always put them first. Since breaking up with Royal, but never divorcing, she has had many suitors, but has never considered marriage until Henry Sherman asks her.Ben Stiller is Chas Tenenbaum. His wife Rachael died in a plane crash a year ago, making Chas increasingly paranoid and safety-oriented. He has two boys, Ari (Grant Rosenmeyer) and Uzi (Jonah Meyerson), who do what their father tells them to do, even though they don't enjoy it. Chas also has a dog, Buckley. He decided to move back to his childhood house after deciding that his isn't safe anymore.Gwyneth Paltrow is Margot Tenenbaum. Whenever Royal introduced her, he said, `And this is my adopted daughter Margot Tenenbaum.' She's been smoking ever since she was twelve, although nobody knows about it. She is constantly depressed and lives in a marriage, unhappily, with Raleigh St. Clair, which caused Richie to give up tennis. She also has stop writing plays.Luke Wilson is Richie Tenenbaum. He quit playing tennis two or so years before he had to stop. He has been living the last few years on the sea, and states to his friend Eli Cash that he has fallen in love with Margot. Richie blew up at a tennis match after seeing her with her new husband.Owen Wilson is Eli Cash. He has always wanted to be a Tenenbaum, since he lived across the street from them. He is now a promising writer who also happens to be in love with Margot and is a drug addict.Danny Glover is Henry Sherman. He is one of Etheline's coworkers, and has hidden feelings for her. Once, he proposes to her, but she is still legally married to Royal. He has a bumbling sort of attitude. Henry helps Etheline run a bridge class every week.Bill Murray is Raleigh St. Clair. Raleigh is a famous scientist who is studying a boy who has amnesia, dyslexia, and color blindness. He is completely in love with Margot, but her feelings towards him are indifferent.Surely these colorful characters can't be connected. Of course they can, and don't call me Shirley. Anderson can create a wonderful world that is not unlike New York. However, something I adore about this is that we do not know which time period it takes place in. Also, their clothing stays the same for almost the entire movie.Royal claims that he has stomach cancer, which causes this family to reunite for the first time in 17 years. Of course, things don't work out the way he planned. If you're not a fan of `quirky', such as Ghost World, this probably isn't your cup of tea. If you like offbeat stuff, this is your best bet.The Royal Tenenbaums had humorous moments, poignant moments, sad moments, and awkward moments. This combination isn't easy to make, but Anderson makes it work. I laughed, I cried, and I had an Amsterdam good time. The music was upbeat at times, but also mellow and sad when the time called for it. It just worked in a great way.

The film is definitely comedic, but it's sort of quirky and fun rather than laugh-out-loud comedy. It comes across as understated and serious, sort of like how in ""Being John Malkovich"" the characters all did funny things but the actors played it serious.Now let's speak frankly here. I'm an action movie guy. I like it when a film is fast-paced, and I don't like dramas -- too melodramatic. When I go see a comedy, I want there to be some dang comedy in it! What turns me off most is to see an arty flick that is inaccessible to normal guys like me who won't appreciate the costuming and music score if the story is awful.However, I did like the ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". The film is very original, with great acting, directing, and writing. There were lots of clever and inventive plot twists, and while it is was a touch too slow-paced for me, I do recommend it.Who should see this film:-- drama / arty types of all sorts (but don't take your kids) but don't expect a lot of romance-- comedy lovers who don't expect Animal House and can deal with a heavy shot in the arm of ""serious film-making"".-- action fans who hate dramas but will grit their teeth and go because their SO wants to see it.

All three of his children were young geniuses of one kind or another  Gwyneth Paltrow was an award winning playwright, Ben Stiller a hugely successful property tycoon, and Luke Wilson a championship tennis player  but by the time they reach adulthood all traces of their talents seem lost. When the family finds itself unexpectedly reunited in the childhood home one winter, old animosities and loyalties flare up once again.Told almost as a modern fairy tale or fable the film opens with the camera close up on a book of the same name, and throughout it is broken down into chapters, with a narrator reading aloud the first line before we see it come to pass onscreen. This sense of knowing unreality also pervades the films look and the actors performances, presenting us with an almost mythical New York, complete with battered taxi cabs and a self contained visual style very consciously not of todays real world. Gene Hackman shines as the unwittingly unpleasant Royal, and all three of his onscreen kids give fine performances, particularly Stiller as a tracksuit wearing father himself, with similarly dressed kids Hackman is determined to show how not to behave! ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" might not deliver the cheap laughs you might expect (particularly if you come along expecting to see Stiller in ""Something About Mary"" and ""Meet The Parents"" mode), but its Oscar nominated script, charismatic look and fine performances ensure this is an intelligent, engaging comedy that derives its laughs from characters rather than set pieces.",The Royal Tenenbaums

This flick was terribly disappointing. It was obviously playing for laughs but had spotty and inconsistent humor; e.g., Danny Glover's pratfall vs. attempts at more cerebral laughs. Ben Stiller's character was so wildly out of place -imagine placing Zoolander in ""ARTHUR"". Glyneth Paltrow's character was not funny at all and functioned as the stereo-typical straight man. Its not hard to make me laugh but I must see humor in its context. I'm guessing this filmmaker wanted to make a film that was poignant, drawing laughter from tears, relationships, etc (Check out ONCE AROUND).

95,NoArrow,Fascinating; Wes Anderson is one of the most interesting filmmakers working today!,10,27 April 2004,"""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is about a hugely disfunctional family of geniuses and former child prodigies that are reunited after Royal (Gene Hackman), the family patriarch, claims he'll be dead in six weeks.  The other members include mother Ethlene (Angelica Huston), oldest son Chas (Ben Stiller), adopted daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) and younger, tennis pro Richie (Luke Wilson).  But they're not the only ones thrown into the mix, we also have Ethlene's fiancee Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), Margot's husband Raleigh St. Claire (Bill Murray), family friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson - who also co-wrote the movie), Royal's friend Dusty (Seymour Cassel) and butler Pagoda (Kumar Palaan).In Anderson and Wilson's previous film, 1998 masterwork ""Rushmore"", they had three leads and about five secondary characters who are still quite important.  In this they have six leads and about a dozen secondary characters.  So it's clear that this is their ""big"" film, and it is, it's an epic of family films.I'll start with the acting.  There is not a single actor that doesn't become their character.  Hackman is perfect as the sleazy Royal, Huston is sweet and charming as Ethlene, Paltrow is completely unrecognizable as Margot, Wilson is funny and tragic as Richie, and Stiller gives what is his best performance yet as Chas.  The others - Glover, Murray, Wilson - are all pieces in the masterful puzzle that is ""The Royal Tenenbaums"".Then there is Anderson and Wilson, who - as writers - become characters themselves, with every line that drips off the screen you can just picture them huddled around a computer, typewriter, what have you for hours upon hours perfecting their screenplay.  Something notable is Alec Baldwin's narration, his abnormally quiet and teacher-like voice lends even more to this already wonderful film.

96,Mort-31,Just go and watch it and fall into raptures,10,7 May 2002,"Wes Anderson's `The Royal Tenenbaums' is not a family film but a film about family. And as such it differs widely from the majority of films of that genre, where families of some kind are brought together in the end, in spite of a couple of difficulties. This is not a classic feel-good movie, nevertheless it made me feel good. It's not too serious but it's not a parody either. For me, this makes it the most beautiful movie on the issue of family life ever made.Although all the members of the Tenenbaum family are really weird and lead unusual lives (geniuses all of them), their relationship to each other is more authentic and more convincing than, for instance, Robin Williams's to his children in `Mrs. Doubtfire'.And, the biggest and most wonderful plus of this movie isn't mainly due to director and scriptwriters: the cast. If the `Tenenbaums' had been presented in Cannes, I'm sure they would have won the ensemble prize. One of them is better than the other. Not only have I been confirmed in my worship of Ben Stiller and Bill Murray, I've also discovered Anjelica Huston's versatility, Gene Hackman's humour, Danny Glover's age and how it becomes him, Gwyneth Paltrow's, well, talent to evoke pitiness, and finally, the magnificent Wilson brothers themselves.Right, talking about the beauty of this movie doesn't make much sense.

100,jackasstrange,Wes Anderson at his best,8,22 February 2014,"Coming from someone that doesn't like that much Anderson's style. In fact, he has style, and a very peculiar one, which is the main reason I'm attracted to his films in the first place. His films are visually different. I would call Anderson a 70s fetishist, considering all the influences and the references he uses in his films of that specific decade.However, story-wise his films are more focused in tell a story than having a good character development. That is something that I immensely dislike, since a story in my opinion starts from the character. Anderson often throws characters with mediocre development in his scripts and often they fail to having me caring about them.Royal Tenembaums maybe very well an exception to the rule. The development may not be the best but if you are patient, after the 20 minutes or so the story starts to involve you and you'll see yourself liking the 'Royal'. Is weird, but it worked. Don't ask me how. I think the film finally started only after the 20 minutes, what is a possible explanation why it grew on me.Anyway, this film is Anderson as always. A disturbed family and an apparently dark and sad story told in a funny and laid- back way. Obviously it has obviously comic moments, but I'm not sure if comedy would be the most prevalent genre if wasn't by Anderson's direction. The result, of course, was above average.Overall, 8.5/10",The Royal Tenenbaums
101,x_manicure_x,Offbeat family comedy,6,14 August 2021,"""The Royal Tenenbaums"" blends Wes Anderson's colorful visual style and quirky characters with an old-school bittersweet family drama that explores the past glories, regrets, and depression of a dysfunctional privileged family. The pacing is a little off, and there are a few dull moments along the way, but the overall result is surprisingly tasteful and well-balanced. Anderson's trademark style is rather restrained here, and I honestly prefer when he takes things to the extremes. However, I liked how he made it look like we are reading some kind of vintage book, and how the sets are carefully designed to tell us more about each character through colors and objects. Not his best, but a fun film nevertheless.",The Royal Tenenbaums
102,bix171,"Great Acting, A Fine Screenplay",9,18 August 2002,"The screenplay by director Wes Anderson and actor Owen Wilson is confident, full-bodied and sharply observant but it's the exquisite deadpan acting that stands out in Anderson's story of a dysfunctional family struggling to reconcile a decades-long separation. There isn't one false note struck by the performers (a massively impressive cast, including Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Wilson and his brother Luke, Danny Glover and Bill Murray with a smaller role by Cassavetes regular Seymour Cassel) even though Anderson offers them only a limited range of emotion to work within; instead he allows them to be identified by their peculiar obsessions (Paltrow's omnipresent cigarette, Luke Wilson's sunglasses, which he puts on and takes off at significant moments, and Stiller's red workout suit) and brief biographical synopses. Where Anderson and Wilson fail is in their sympathies: while allowing plenty of compassion for all their characters, they concentrate heavily on justifying Hackman's determination to ingratiate himself back as the patriarch. Though he's portrayed as a cad, selfish father and a bigot, he's easily forgiven by the writers for some fairly unforgivable stuff and the primary conceit--that he's the only one who really knows how to live--is unacceptable given the effect his behavior has had, casting his family adrift over the years. Points, however, should be given for the intelligent comments on how dysfunction qualifies you for the world at large (the three children each channel their frustrations into business, the arts and sports); it's a fresh viewpoint, one of many the film offers. It's hard to tell how the film will change upon repeated viewings (indeed, it seems both better and worse the second time around) but, flawed as it is, it does warrant them.",The Royal Tenenbaums
103,Dockelektro,Contemporary Art,8,3 April 2002,"If we talk about pictures, this is the most original movie I have seen in a few years. A warning for starters: DO NOT watch it in a pan scan video release. Why? Just see the whole movie and the way it is shot to understand. All the shots in this movie are expertly crafted and measured, combining sets, objects and characters to achieve shots that look like contemporary art. This is a typical director's movie. An average script is rocketed sky high by great character definitions, great set designs and pictorial sense of the movie that is rare to find in today's cinema. Unfortunately, by the end, it loses some of the steam that makes us enjoy it at the beginning. A great movie, however, adding originality to what could be a trivial treatment.",The Royal Tenenbaums

105,mnpollio,"A soulless, dismal wreck",1,29 December 2006,"Were Wes Anderson and the Wilson brothers forever banned from conceiving another ""comedy"", it could not happen soon enough. Patriarch Royal Tenenbaum is a selfish, egotistical character. He has been estranged from his wife and children for years and upon learning that he will be kicked out of his luxurious digs, he decides to fake a fatal disease in an effort to move back into the family home and cause assorted consternation to his family. The comedy is supposed to come from the clash between Royal's brutishness and the myriad of dysfunctions of his offspring. We are supposed to be falsely wooed into believing the film is quirky and intelligent because we are told that the three Tenenbaum children were child geniuses who peaked too early and then withered under Royal's influence. One must credit Gene Hackman for throwing himself into the central role, but despite all of his best efforts Royal is still a one-dimensional, loathsome bastard. The film proceeds at a deadly pace as though it were too-cool-for-the-room by giving its characters ludicrous illogical flourishes that have little tie to the flimsy plot. There are maybe two minor titters in the set-up, but then nary a laugh for the remainder of the interminable running time. Talented actors are either wasted or fasten in on one character trait and allow that to contribute their performance. Gwyneth Paltrow, with Goth raccoon make-up tattooed to her face, is utterly joyless as the Tenenbaums miserable adopted daughter, and she is equaled by the colorless performance contributed by Luke Wilson as a failed tennis pro brother who pines for her. Anjelica Huston, one of our best over-50 actresses, is reduced to the thankless task of clucking disapprovingly and ineffectually from the sidelines at Hackman's behavior. But she has it made compared to Ben Stiller, Bill Murray and Danny Glover, who literally are given nothing to work with. The less said about Owen Wilson, the better. He has written himself an obnoxious role as a nut-job intrusive family friend, whose ties to the central characters and events are tenuous at best, but he keeps showing up for extended periods of time  like a drunken party guest that one cannot get rid of. Midway through this lighthearted comedy, there is a disgustingly bloody failed suicide sequence that seems to come out of no where. And just in case one still doubts its off-beat pedigree, Anderson periodically trots out stale montages of past events set to hip 60s era music or interjects coy narration from Alec Baldwin sounding like he is aping Sir Anthony Hopkins in The Grinch Who Stole Christmas. Yet all of the quirky flourishes in the world cannot disguise that the film is a tedious, unfunny dismal wreck populated by characters that could empty most rooms in seconds flat.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Since then, each of the three Tenebaum children had become grown adults and leading separate lives. Same goes for Mrs Tenebaum.

107,ExpendableMan,The most depressing comedy ever made,1,10 August 2007,"I still remember the first time I saw The Royal Tenenbaums. Principally, it was the box art that drew me in - Ben Stiller dressed in a red tracksuit with two sons wearing the same clothing? Gene Hackman raising an alcoholic drink with a cheeky smile plastered across his face? Bill Murray? Both the Wilson brothers at the same time? Surely, this would be one of the funniest films of all time, with a cast like that, how could it fail? Well I have to hand it to the art designers and the hype machine because they fooled me completely, as The Royal Tenenbaums turned out to be one of those comedies that is ""off-beat,"" ""dark"" and ""intelligent,"" but forgets to be ""funny."" Still, I'm a bit of a glutton for punishment some times so I sat through the entire film and was rewarded for my perseverance with over two hours of utter tedium. Worse, it is so depressing that by the time the credits started rolling, I'd found myself suffering crippling emotional pains from a vast range of personal demons that up until that moment, I wasn't aware I had.The story consists of Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), patriarch of his clan trying to re-unite the family after years of mistrust and in-fighting. He brings them all together by feigning illness and sets about trying to rekindle family loyalty, while the rest of them try to overcome their particular neuroses. Consequently, pretty much the whole film consists of uninteresting, self-obsessed New Yorkers moping around feeling sorry for themselves. Nigh on every character has but a single facial expression for the entire duration and can you guess what that expression is? It's despair. Agonising, gut-wrenching despair.In short, this is just about the most over-hyped, self-indulgent piece of hipster rubbish I've ever seen. Hackman possesses his usual charisma but even he is not enough to save this train wreck of a comedy. The first time I saw it I thought it was more depressing than being stuck in a room with a recently-dumped teenage Goth reading poetry aloud. This week I stuck it on again just to see if I was mistaken in that judgement but nope, I was right. If anything it's got more grim with age.

I begrudge even wasting usage of my computer on this  film it was so cringe makingly woeful. Dysfunctional families can be quite interesting in films or TV. Unfortunately these were dysfunctional but also dislikable in the highest possible manner & consequently at no point will ever give a monkeys toss what happens to any of the characters. Nor do I believe the man in charge of writing the alleged jokes (& I use the term 'jokes' in the loosest possible sense) should ever receive a fee for this tripe. Shame, as all the actors are good.

111,theinaniloquent,"""Family isn't a word, it's a sentence""",8,18 May 2012,"Before anything else, I'd like to tell you all that this is my first Wes Anderson film. I've heard lots about him, but never got around to his films. With the release of Moonrise Kingdom coming closer and closer, I've decided to hand-pick one of his ""classics"" and click play. Let's just say I've came out happy..My favorite thing is Anderson's style. You can obviously tell his style in films, because their quirkiness is off-the-wall hilarious. He obviously has the sense of very subtle humor at times, but turns right back around and gives us a very dry sense of humor. I loved it, because it enhanced the film greater narratively and artistically.I found the acting great. There's lots of well-known names in this gem, but none of them play their usual roles. Anderson made them play good to their part, and good to their material. I especially loved Bill Murray, who plays the not-so sarcastic one in this movie, which is different because in all his others, he played one. He had short-screen time, but the scenes he was in, keep all eyes on him.The film had it's faults. Not sure if they were done purposely but they set off the mood (pun intended.) The film suffers from strange tonal shifts, that kind of give off the wrong impression. My brother watched the first twenty minutes, fell asleep, then woke up in the last twenty minutes. He thought he was watching an entire different movie! The first half is built of it's main source: quirkiness. But then the second half turns right around and turns melodramatic. Some scenes dragged out, the style seemed to fend out some great scenes, and blah, blah, blah. It still was a great film, which I greatly enjoyed.For my first Wes Anderson film, I can tell what this man is doing and accomplishing. He feeds the film his style and projects it so it makes you feel an array of emotions. For my first Wes Anderson film, I liked it. It suffered from strange tonal shifts, but all else was great. It was quirky, witty, and had a subtle amount of poignancy.",The Royal Tenenbaums
112,stills-6,Painful waste of potential,5,20 June 2004,"This movie has all the ingredients for a great movie, but whoever put them together was on crack. What a terrible waste of a great cast and a great idea. It's disturbing that such high-flying potential could result in poor dialogue, a John-Irving-in-Hell type plot, a lack of chemistry between actors, and horrific attempts at comedy.The best scene in the movie is the one where Royal tells his wife of his condition. It looks unscripted and absolutely, painfully real. I was with this movie for the emotionless, deadpan acting and the throwback style. I thought Gene Hackman did an excellent job given what he had to work with. But Ben Stiller was not good, and neither was Owen Wilson, whose affability and comedic charm is completely missing. Also missing was some semblance of humanity in everyone but Hackman's character. A real disappointment.",The Royal Tenenbaums
113,ldavis-2,at least it was different...,3,27 July 2003,"if more than a bit taken with itself. Anderson was uncertain about what he wanted to do, inconsistent with his characters and story lines, and how the scenes are strung together. Having established Royal as a wild, Carpe Diem kind of guy, he acts like a grown-up at the wedding. Wouldn't he have pulled another crazy stunt, like, let's say, stolen Eli's roadster, then crashed it into the house? Talk about inconsistent, what was the point of Eli doing that? Maybe Anderson was trying to avoid being predictable, yet I WANTED Royal to do something nutty in one, last desperate attempt to win back his family instead of meekly conceding defeat. Why was he invited to the wedding as if nothing had happened? Royal and Etheline had separated, yet there is no mention of a divorce. Here, Anderson missed a golden opportunity: Royal digging in his heels, refusing to give Etheline a divorce, refusing to recognize Henry as his replacement, forcing her to try to get an annulment, which can take years (I was confused as to why a priest was to preform the ceremony since he cannot marry someone who's divorced.)It was also inconsistent with Royal's attempts to reconcile with his children. Maybe Anderson wants to comment on the peculiarities of family dynamics, yet Royal hardly gives Richie the time of day, and acknowledges Margot only long enough to lecture her on the dangers of two-timing one's spouse.Henry is the Ultimate Uncle Tom, complete with bow tie. Anderson would be accused of racism were it not for the dignity and simmering rage Glover gives Henry, a rage that nearly busts loose in his ""jive"" exchange with Royal. But after Henry exposes Royal's scam, he shrinks back into the shadows like, well, an Uncle Tom.We're expected to embrace these characters, yet Anderson's style is distant and off-putting. Apart from Hackman, the actors seem trapped by his rigid framing, color scheme, and enforced deadpan. Richie pining for Margot, only to so mortified by her, thanks to a detective's report, that he shaves his hair and takes a razor to himself, tells us that, for Anderson, the human need for intimacy is a messy - even fatal - proposition. Better to keep Life - and Love - at a distance like Henry, then jump into the fray like Royal.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Call me ridiculous if you must for making this correction, but here it is: this film does not take place in New York. Although clearly filmed in New York, this film takes place in a fictional city. Why do I say this? No recognizable landmarks from New York, or any other city for that matter, are depicted. No street names or place names used exist in New York. The colors on the buses are not correct. One other commenter's statement that he had never seen New York look like this was correct for a specific reason: Wes Anderson tried to make the fictional city in the film look reminiscent of New York, but not the same as New York. Because it's not New York. In fact, I don't think the city in the film is ever called by name. (One could, almost as equally justifiably, say the film takes place in Chicago or Philadelphia.)

The film is burdened down with, among other things, too many loose plot ends, characters who simply enter and leave (prolonged ""extras"" roles, perhaps?), plot motivations that really come to nothing, a script that seems to go on and on and on, and a tedium level that made me think this film was a royal bore, as well.There are a few pleasant moments, however to call this a comedy, is a bit of a stretch (and more than a little misleading). The coarse amount of self-indulgence displayed by almost every character, echoed dsyfunction, not humor. A movie should have more to offer, than a ""nifty"" (expect more sales) soundtrack.Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, et al, make some attempts, yet can't overcome the turgid, poorly written script. Half the supporting cast looked as if they were sleepwalking.

116,Old Joe,Family isn't a wordIt is a sentence. This is a brilliant film!,10,13 July 2003,"Here is one of the more unique movies I have seen in recent times, the 2002 comedy', The Royal Tenenbaums. I have highlighted the word comedy', because after watching this film, I was not laughing at it so much, but rather in awe of how good a drama it really is. With an all star cast and highly intelligent script, here is a movie that I am still unsure what to call or think about. The Royal Tenenbaums is the richly tragicomic story of one unique family's sudden, unexpected reunion. Royal Tenenbaum and his wife Etheline had three children - Chas, Ritchie and Margot, and then they separated. Years later, feigning terminal illness, the reprehensible Royal Tenenbaum returns to his wife's house where the Tenenbaum kids are also back under the same roof. So join the clan in the Royal Tenenbaums, where there is a crazy quilt of past and present family relationships, conflicts and misadventures.What an extraordinary movie the Royal Tenenbaums' really is. In my experience of watching movies, which has not been that long, I have not seen a movie quite like this one. The story to it is very original. Written by director Wes Anderson and star Owen Wilson, it is very much a look into what means to be in a dysfunctional family, illness (looking extremely well into the mental illnesses of split personality and depression) and of course cancer. All the members of the Tenenbaum family are in some way sick, and it is through the story you get that feeling.Also, the ideas of infidelity, failed marriage and incest, which all could be considered distressing, are so interesting to watch being played out in the movie that you have to be intrigued by them. Only the Tenenbaums could have all of these problems to contend with. What was also great about the story was the style that it was delivered in. With a terrific voiceover placed in the story, seen chapter by chapter on the screen, it was a very refreshing way to see a movie being played out.  That being said, this movie had a star studded line up. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) was a very enjoyable role to see on the screen. Hackman's performance reminds me very much of his character in the 1999 hit Heartbreakers'. I am sure that many fathers would look at this man and say, `I am never going to be that sort of father!' Royal's wife, Etheline (Anjelica Huston) is also a queer woman, and has a man who is very much in love with her, the Tenenbaum's accountant, Henry Sherman (played well by Danny Glover).  Yet if the parents are strange in this film, then it has certainly rubbed of on their children. Chas (Ben Stiller) started buying real estate in his early teens and had a preternatural understanding of international finance. He is a safety freak and is struggling to get over the loss of his dear wife, Rachel. Richie (Luke Wilson) was a top junior championship tennis player. Then one day he lost his game for some reason, but we do not know exactly why. Then there is Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), a playwright, who received a $50,000 grant in the ninth grade. Margot has been a rebellious girl for a lot of her life, which is understandable, considering what she has been through. My feeling about Margot is that she is one of the more intriguing characters of the entire movie. The two standout actors have to be Stiller and Paltrow. I have seen plenty of them before, but not quite like this, which is credit to their acting ability and the people behind the scenes, who made them like they were.Yet there are still more performers that need to be highlighted from the RTs. Ike Cash (Owen Wilson) is an extraordinary individual, especially towards the end of the film. Margot is also married' to Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), who is another character that you do not expect, but actually get. For me, Murray was amazingly withheld, not normally associated with his style of acting, something else that I liked from the movie. Then you have to love the voiceover style of Alec Baldwin. He has an incredibly deep voice for the narration purposes, and if we do not hear him again in this role, it will be a real shame.      There are some really memorable scenes in this film. It is a fine introduction, which sets the movie up beautifully. Then all of the scheming ways of Royal's are most entertaining, especially the one that shows him on his sick bed, as he is asked by his son Chas to get out'. He is a very fraudulent, but funny man as well. Yet there are some quite serious moments in the movie also. Richie shows us that his state of mind is not quite right, with what he does to cure the problem quite disturbing. Then with Margot, you have to love her stubborn attitude and carefree nature towards life. The end of the film was wonderful, and it might leave you asking, is everything as it seems?' I have seen plenty of movies that are little bit different, with such titles as Pulp Fiction', Memento' and 2001s Mulholland Drive' coming to mind. They all did things different to your normal mainstream movie, but the Royal Tenenbaums' is different once again. I applaud everyone involved in this movie, the actors, the director, the producers, all the people behind the scenes, for giving me another avenue of the movie world to explore and learn from. I will be interested to see the next movie that is like this, as I am sure it will be a long time to come. This movie was rated as a comedy', but it was so much more. I highly recommend a night's viewing of the Royal Tenenbaums', a movie that you can call whatever you want!CMRS gives The Royal Tenenbaums': 5 (Brilliant Film)",The Royal Tenenbaums
117,MarcoParzivalRocha,The best Royal family,8,9 April 2021,"A dysfunctional family meets in the same house for different reasons. Wes Anderson is perhaps the most imaginative director of the last few decades, with his unmistakable style.The Royal Tenenbaums is truly revolutionary because of the way it addresses complex issues like depression and grief, and we are often left wondering what's the right emotion to feel, so to speak, to a particular scene or interaction between the characters.The narrative follows a course very similar to a theater play, like in many others Anderson's films, where the entire structure is built in such a way that everything we see and hear makes sense, and, above all, it's relevant to the story.Anderson has the Midas touch when it comes to the cast of all his films, whether the ""old guard"" or newcomers, for the way he manages to create balance and bring spontaneity and ease to the all crew.Visually it's not one of my favorites, but it's impossible to say that The Royal Tenenbaums isn't a work of art.",The Royal Tenenbaums
118,Brogan,Wes Anderson's masterpiece!,10,23 December 2001,"I highly enjoyed Wes Anderson's two previous films, BOTTLE ROCKET and RUSHMORE.  They were films that were entertaining and intelligent, but both films had their lulls.  Before I watched Anderson's latest film, ROYAL TENENBAUMS I was expecting it to be great, but not excellent.  After watching it, I am pleased to say that ROAYL TENENBAUMS is Anderson's flawless classic. ROYAL TENENBAUMS is about the tale of a disfunctional family who live in Manhatthan.  Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) is a liquidator and husband of archaeologist Etheline Tenenbaum (Anjelica Huston).  Together they have three children: Chas (Ben Stiller) a millionare investor who is fitness crazed, Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) the ""adoptive daughter"" is what Royal calls her is a successful playwright who won a Pulitzer Prize, and Richie (Luke Wilson) a successful tennis pro who had a breakdown during one of his matches and is traveling the world by ship. Royal was never the perfect father to the kids, he shot Chas in the hand with a BB gun, and critized Margot's play, but it was Richie that Royal favored and gave the most attention to.  But Royal abandoned Richie leaving Richie to become a burn out.  Royal finds out that he's being evicted out of the hotel room that he's been staying at for years.  Royal also finds out that he is dying and has cancer, so he would like to spend the last couple of weeks with his family.  It just that since Royal has last talked or spent time with his family things have changed.  Etheline is thinking about a marriage proposal offered to her by her friend Henry Sherman (Danny Glover).  Chas is a widower and has two boys, Margot is married to a much older man, Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray) a human study author, and Richie has become depressed and is traveling the world only communicating through telegrams.  When the five Tenebaums are under the same roof again for the first time in seventeen years, it becomes a hysterical and memorable adventure for both the Tenenbaums and the viewer. ROAYL TENENBAUMS is a movie that I have been waiting for all year, a intelligent movie that is entertaining at the same time.  The humor in this film written by director Anderson, and co-star Owen Wilson (who plays Tenenbaum friend and western writer Eli Cash) tell TENENBAUMS much more different than BOTTLE ROCKET and RUSHMORE.  It's not as vicious as BOTTLE or as cynical as RUSHMORE, TENENBAUMS is instead more heart-felt and tender. It has many sympathetic and sensitive moments, but that doesn't keep it from not being funny.  In fact there are several hilarious scenes in this film. And unlike most comedies where there are those scenes where the audience goes hysterical with laughter, TENENBAUMS is different the comedy keeps hitting you like a racquet ball hitting a wall. When Anderson wrote TENENBAUMS, he had Gene Hackman and Anjelica Huston in mind for Royal and Etheline Tenenbaum.  And what stroke of luck did Anderson and the audience get to have,  both actors agree to do the roles after reading the screenplay.  Huston gives her best acting performance that I have seen from her since PRITZI'S HONOR, as the caring for her children and confused at her husband Etheline Tenenbaum.  Stiller, Paltrow, both Luke and Owen Wilson, Glover, and Murray all give wonderful and memorable performances as the family and friends of the Tenenbaum family.  Stiller is funny as the arrogant child, Platrow is also great as the cynical, and Luke Wilson is good as well as the quiet and calm depressive.  And there is more great support from Anderson alumni's Seymour Cassel and Kumar Pellana. Even Alec Baldwin does a great job narrating the story of the Tenenbaum family to the viewer. But if anybody comes out ahead, it's Gene Hackman.  Hackman is one of the greatest actors of all time.  I have enjoyed his work for all of my life.  From when I first saw him as Lex Luthor in SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE back when I was two, to the vicious Little Bill Dagget in UNFORGIVEN, and from watching him as Popeye Doyle in FRENCH CONNECTION.  Hackman well deserved Oscars for both UNFORGIVEN and FRENCH CONNECTION, but for TENENBAUMS, he MUST get an Oscar.  He gives one of the best performances that I have seen from anybody in years.  And for HACKMAN, it's his best performance since UNFORGIVEN.  Hackman carried the picture from start to finish with his humor and emotions.  Royal Tenenbaum is the most enjoyable father figure role that I have seen in any form of medium since Homer J. Simpson, and that is the highest compliment that I can think of.  If Gene Hackman or any of his family/friends are reading this, I would like to thank Mr. Hackman very much for giving a wonderful, excellent, and enjoyable performance. And Anderson does his best work that he has ever done.  It's not as orignal as BOTTLE ROCKET or RUSHMORE, but he makes it more fun!  Anderson uses a lot of his trademarks in TENENBAUMS (characters who smoke, odd paintings, Luke and Owen Wilson, excellent soundtrack, Kumar Pellana, and the wonderful and unique shots with subtext on the screen).  Unlike BOTTLE and RUSHMORE, I can watch TENENBAUMS over and over again and still laugh my rear end off the first time I saw it compared to the seventh or eighth time (and since working at a movie theater showing it, I have been watching scenes from TENENBAUMS over and over again and still get a major kick out of it). ROYAL TENENBAUMS isn't a comedy for everybody, for those who like the cliche type comedies like MISS CONGENALITY, WHAT WOMEN WANT or RUNAWAY BRIDE won't like it.  Those who prefer stupid and sophmoric humor like CORKY ROMANO, HOW HIGH, and TOMCATS won't like.  No, this is for the intellects, those who laugh at life and the way people live, my kind of humor.  We don't laugh at the people, we just laugh at the way they are and live.

Silly me, I thought it HAD to be seen because it was so good but this list must have been put together by someone who had been traumatized by the movie industry and wants to get revenge.Gene Hackman plays a good part and I'm sure if there was someone decent for him to play off he might have saved this wretched piece of dross.If it wasn't for TV and the video industry this would have ended up in the dumpster behind most of the movie theatres it showed in.Luckily for us Gene Hackman has made some great movies since then, how Anjelica Huston, Bill Murray and Gwyneth Paltrow survived I don't know.Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller are just terrible, almost unwatchable. And this is with a motherlode of potential comic material that others have mined for gold. Just about every dysfunctional family sitcom on TV has done a better job than this criece of pap.Only Gene Hackman's scene in Mississippi Burning, where he grabs the brute by the testicles, has saved him from being written off in my mindRewind, erase or delete , don't use up precious storage space.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Was this due to me seeing Rushmore and Bottle Rocket for the first time just before this? I think so because Rushmore especially has the heart to go with the oddball humour and carefully crafted characters whereas i found this to be full of largely unlikable characters playing out an unengaging plot with only a few chuckles here and there jarring with the attempt to garner some sort of genuine emotion.
The narration and episodic nature of the story too took me out of it and being able to fully connect with the multitude of characters.Bill Murray crouching at the window to talk to Margot though.",The Royal Tenenbaums
121,faraaj-1,Pretentious,6,25 November 2006,"John Fod had already directed 75 movies (mostly silent) before his first well-known film Arrowsmith (1931). Robert Altman had been making films and working on television for two decades before MASH made him famous. Times have changed and the pressure to prove and sustain a successful image is far greater now. Imagine the pressure on a reasonably talented actor like Matthew McConaughey when a good performance in A Time to Kill suddenly has the whole world calling him the next Paul Newman. It must be terrible having to face and live up to those high expectations. The mental pressure must be a killer. Wes Anderson is one of the young wave of directors who was labeled a quirky genius after only two films in three years - Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. I've seen and liked Rushmore and its certainly possible that its director could become an Altman caliber director one day, a decade or two from now.The Royal Tenenbaums with its all star cast is Wes Anderson's third feature and its obvious he tries hard to sustain his image as maverick genius. The fact that he got a dream cast, at least three of them refusing to work in the more lucrative Ocean's Eleven, shows that many in Hollywood accept his image as valid. Royal Tenenbaums is certainly quirky and unusual, but is it good? Well, Gene Hackman is always a great actor to watch but Tenenbaums is not a complete film. The overall acting is quite poor. Anderson is no Altman when it comes to handling an ensemble cast, at least not yet! The storybook style is very pretentious as is the photography and set design. Actually, the set design was quite inventive and that may be a talent Anderson can explore further. The music selection made no sense either.Personally I think Royal Tenenbaums was a waste of time. Anderson needs far more experience and a few hard knocks. He may come out the better for it. But instantly hailing everything he does as a classic is not helping.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Royal is a self-centered, shameless SOB. His whole life has been devoted to his own personal desire for comfort. However, as Royal grows older, he realizes that he has missed out on the most important thing in life, family. In his case, his family is a creative assortment of professional tennis players, aspiring playwrights and genius entrepreneurs. Wes Anderson has made what I think is the finest film of the last decade. His imaginative script elicits incredible performances from Hackman, Stillar, the Wilson brothers, etc. The wonderful music enhances unforgettable scenes that stay with you forever. Who would have thought that someone could make me become a fan of the music of Nico and Elliot Smith. I don't know of another director that involves so much detail into a story. There is so much thought and imagination behind everything. This is not so much a movie, but rather a work of art. I laughed during this film and I cried. The one thing that I wished was that it could continue for hours more. I really think in Wes Anderson, America has found its next Orson Welles and with the Tenenbaums, the Citizen Kane of our time. Perfect film.",The Royal Tenenbaums
123,hunter-friesen,Wes Anderson delivers a good comedy/drama for everyone to relate with,7,23 February 2018,"Wes Anderson hasn't made a bad film, with most being either really good or just okay. In between the high of The Grand Budapest Hotel and the meh of Moonrise Kingdom sits his third feature, The Royal Tenenbaums, a good film that pushed Anderson further into stardom. Boasting a brilliant cast and a capable director, Tenenbaums is a quirky comedy that delivers a touching story about our relationship with our families and how they shape who we are as a person. At the heart of our story is Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman). Royal left his family years ago, mostly because nobody liked him, and has been avoiding them by living in a hotel. While he was away, his wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) raised their three prodigal children Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke Wilson), who all became highly successful in their respective fields. One day Royal returns to the family home in an effort to reconnect with his kids, who are now adults. None of the children want to have anything to do with him. This forces Royal to win back their trust and try to piece back together a special family that has been separated for a very long time.Wes Anderson again makes an improvement on his previous film, Rushmore. He adds more comedy, but also more sentimentality to the story to make you deeply care about the quirky characters. He is also able to incorporate some of his trademark storytelling techniques such as narration (well done by Alec Baldwin), offbeat banter, and a peculiar fascination with violence. This is a family film for adults, perfectly meant to be watched by parents with their adult children. It's relatable, to a point, as each character can represent a real member of a family. I'm not saying this is a perfect film, or even Anderson's best work (Grand Budapest still takes that honor). The film starts at its highest point, slowly deteriorating as we reach the end. But even at its worst, the film is still good. Anderson, both writer, and director, focuses on too many different side stories and characters. It becomes almost like a merry go round as each character gets their time to shine for a few minutes and then goes back into hiding for a while until they pop out again. It's still well done but could have been better if there had been more focus.The cinematography, like all Anderson films, is done with order and precision. Most shots are done symmetrically, with the characters in the middle of the frame. This style works wonders in a character study such as this as our eyes are fixed on to the characters as the world revolves around them. The production and set design are also well done. The Tenenbaum house is made to look almost plain from the outside, but on the inside, it is a wondrous place of knowledge and peculiarity that comes from the people inhabiting it. Each character's room takes after them, which reveals personal information to us without having to add to the runtime. All of this makes Anderson one of the modern masters at following the simple rule of show don't tell.Coming out on top are the actors, who each do well in their roles. Gene Hackman is the best as Royal. He makes his character so interesting that we begin to root for him, even though his character has been a jerk for almost thirty years. In one of his final roles, this film is a testament to Hackman's power to make us sympathize with bad men, all while doing so with a smile. The three children all do a good job, especially Paltrow. They're all weird people, but we can still relate to them. They play off each other well and each scene where they are all present is engrossing to watch. Finally, Anjelica Huston comes out of nowhere and delivers one of her best performances in a long time. She goes toe to toe with Hackman in many scenes, using her single mother experience to come out on top most of the time. Everything she does is deeply touching and everything she says is captivating, which is what makes her one of the best motherly characters in recent memory. The Royal Tenenbaums is a delightful film from a delightful director who almost seems to get better as time goes on. While not great, the film does well when it matters. It could be considered weird or off-putting to some, but for most this will be a fun time of reflecting on what makes a family special to the people that are a part of it.",The Royal Tenenbaums
124,TuckMN,A comedy where the audience doesn't laugh.,8,18 January 2002,"Theoretically this film is a comedy.  But there are few laugh-out-loud scenes or jokes -- instead I heard scattered laughter at various times from different parts of the theater.  I laughed when no one else did and other people laughed when I did not.At first I thought it was filmed with no broad strokes but on second thought I wondered if it was all so broad that I wasn't aware of it.  Kind of like not being able to see the forest for the trees.The `screenplay as novel' approach is interesting, and to a certain extent, works as a story. But I am not sure why this film is on so many `Top Ten' lists.The film is almost impossible to explain.  There is pathos, fear, humour, paranoia, greed and a great cast; but I wasn't always sure that the actors knew why they were there.  The sound track was perfect -- as is every sound track that Mark Mothersbaugh produces. The film was well edited and directed and every cast member was great but something overall was missing -- which is not to say that I did not like it -- because I did.  I am just not sure why.Gene Hackman, as Royal Tenenbaum, turns in a stellar performance: this role may well win him a Golden Globe. Probably because his acting is greater than the script or direction.Alex Baldwin adds much to the story as the unseen narrator. He has a soothing, calming voice in a film that is full of unreason.There are metaphorical attempts at thematic imagery....  The rooms within rooms as exemplified by the tent in the ballroom and the closet of games -- but they don't really lead anywhere unless you are willing to search for some kind of meaning that is deeper than what superficially appears.This is also a film about healing -- the people are broken -- but some manage to find it within themselves to fix that part that is broken.I have to say that this is most definitely a film that must be judged on its own merits -- every audience member must see it and decide for their own self.  You may end up in my position: I liked it but I am not sure why.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Danny Glover, Seymour Cassel, Kumar Pallana, and Alec Baldwin all perform very well.The pacing is a little slow in the middle but overall, it is consistently fast.

It's honest more than pretentious, lifelike more than theatrical. The characters and their lives might be weird, but I feel it's a reflection of the weirdness of reality.The film details the attempts of old family patriarch Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) to get closer to his children and repair the dysfunctional family. The story deals with themes of distrust, accepting responsibility, coping with grief, fitting in, and even incest. The subject matter is rather heavy but the film isn't dark at all, rather it showcases the power of optimism. It is always possible to make amends.Luke Wilson makes the best performance here, outshining better-known stars with his quiet charisma and touching depression. Ben Stiller is surprisingly good, too.",The Royal Tenenbaums
128,Bravesfan17,A great mix of comedy and drama,9,21 May 2010,"Writer-director Wes Anderson knows how to amazingly mix the comedy and drama and have it work. But it isn't a laugh out loud kind of comedy. Anderson's work is funny, but it is much more smarter than most comedies and fits in the realm of smart comedies like the works of Woody Allen and Alexander Payne.Gene Hackman shows that can do some comedy as Royal, a man who finds out he is dying but doesn't know how to tell his family. Hackman plays each scene really well in making us feel for Royal Tenenbaum. I don't think any other actor can play this role like Hackman does.His children are played wonderfully by Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Rounding out the rest of the supporting cast are Bill Murray, Anjelica Huston, and Danny Glover.This movie is well worth a watch if you are a fan of Wes Anderson or want to see some serious performances from Ben Stiller or the Wilson brothers.",The Royal Tenenbaums
129,llihilloh,An interesting movie that I'd definitely watch again.,7,22 July 2002,"I like this movie.  The cast is excellent, the script is really good and the directing was great.  ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a nice film that involves a big, terrific cast. Gene Hackman is real enjoyable as Royal.  Anjelica Huston was pretty good as Etheline even though I would have liked to have seen more of her character. Ben Stiller was hilarious as usual.  He was toned down a couple of notches for this film, but still funny.  Gwyneth Paltrow fit the role or Margot well.  I wouldn't necessarily say that she was anything great, but just good.  Again, I would have liked to have seen a little more of Luke Wilson's character, but I'm glad of how much I saw because a little more may have been too much.  Two thumbs up for Owen Wilson not only for his performance, but also for his work behind the cameras.  Bill Murray and Danny Glover were alright, nothing great and surely not as good as the rest of the cast.  I also really liked seeing Grant Rosenmeyer and Jonah Meyerson (Ari and Uzi). 
The first time I watched ""Royal"", I thought that it was very good but not exactly great.  The second time I watched it, it had hit great.  I don't know if I would rank it as (currently) #185 of greatest movies of all time, but it is one of the better ones out there.  The different stories and backgrounds behind each Tenenbaum are clever and exciting.  The characters are well developed and actually seem real.  Isn't that strange? 
Not that this really had a huge impact on the film, but I did like the music that was used.  It fit in so well to the story and really added that little magic ingredient.  I didn't think that I would compare this film to ""American Beauty"" because that was terrible and ""Royal"" is so terrific, but I am going to say something real quick.  The two are much alike in the same dysfunctional family plot, but ""Beauty"" was over-hyped and recognized so much that it turned out to be just talk.  ""Royal"" on the other hand, has a lot of good things about it and I can't say that I've heard that much critical acclaim. Well, that just figures.So, final outcome of this film is that the script is very powerful and amusing and the cast comes together so well to work as if they were a real family.  Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, nice work and I hope to see you two again soon.  I definitely recommend this film for just about anybody.",The Royal Tenenbaums

It also has the common villainess, Anjelica Huston. You'd think with this kind of ammo, it would be one hell of a film, right? Well, I'm not going to say it was necessarily bad. It's just the story didn't seem to have any real direction or zest enough to enthrall. Owen Wilson (also the writer for this piece) got a little too carried away and perhaps lost.""The Royal Tenebaums"" is a story about a dysfunctional family abandoned by their father. The father, years later, wants to try to make amends for what he'd done by reacquainting himself with his wife and children. This, of course, starts out miserably as the family has only hatred for their father.The children are a bit eccentric and their intelligence creates them as some sort of oddity. Ben Stiller plays Chas Tenebaum, a widowed genius who feels nothing but contempt for his dad. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Margot Tenebaum, a bizarre avante-garde playwright whose emptiness applies to her father as well. Luke Wilson plays Richie Tenebaum, a tennis pro who seems permanently stoned. Anjelica Huston plays Etheline Tenebaum and Gene Hackman plays her estranged husband, Royal Tenebaum. As the name suggests, the film is really about him. However, it also shows Royal through his children, their reactions, and own bizarre lives.But other than showing the inner workings of a disgruntled family and giving the convincing father-redemption bit, I was unsure why this movie was made. It throws you off a bit in the beginning and then ends with an emptiness of its own. The bizarre antics make it somewhat entertaining with fleeting bits of humor. But these are knocked off kilter by some of the shocking and almost morbid parts (e.g.: Richie Tenebaum's attempted suicide). I think Owen was trying to make the film as convincing as he could (tweaking things a bit here and there) and thought in the process that it would be a hit. The story is simple enough, about a father wanting to set things right towards his later years. Add a little bit comedy from ""Meet the Parents"" and a little far-fetchetyness (not a word but should be) and you get this film. I was semi-entertained, but ultimately, I felt abandoned. 4/10",The Royal Tenenbaums

132,crculver,A story of family betrayal and neuroses from childhood distinguished by staggeringly detailed set designs,8,28 June 2015,"After gaining attention with his quirky early films BOTTLE ROCKET and RUSHMORE, writer and director Wes Anderson was able to bring together a wide Hollywood cast for his ambitious 2001 effort THE ROYAL TENNEBAUMS. As the movie opens, we are shown the rise of the three children of the Tannebaum family, prodigies who excel in business, sports and literature respectively. The upbringing of these little geniuses is left to their mother Etheline (Angelica Huston) after their father Royal (Gene Hackman) leaves the family. We flashforward to the present day, where the family has fallen from glory. Chas Tennenbaum (Ben Stiller) is too crushed by the death of his wife to focus on business, Margot (Gwenyth Paltrow) hasn't written a play in years and sulks most of the day in the bathtub, and Richie (Luke Wilson) retired from tennis after mysteriously blowing his last game. It is at this time that their father returns, and the reconciliation between the family members is the story of the film.Wes Anderson retains his quirky sense of humour here. Though ostensibly set in the present day, the lives of the characters occasionally seem bound in traditions of a century ago, as when Royal has an Indian servant, and one of Etheline's suitors is a polar explorer, and this gives a certain charm to the picture. Another amusing Anderson touch is the sheer detail of the sets, with background items like newspaper clippings, portraits and bookshelf contents providing a feeling that these characters are fully formed and have a past. That immense detail in the design, too much for the eye to fully take in at once, gives THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS considerable rewatch value.Supporting roles are quite memorable. Bill Murray, who plays Margot's husband, was to go on to play this type of jaded, unhappy middle-aged man in several films until it just stopped being fun anymore, but this early go at it is quite entertaining (and watch him quietly explode into barely-contained rage at one point in the film). Owen Wilson's character Eli Cash is hilarious, an author of Western novels who gets so caught up in the mythology of the Old West that he starts taking mescaline and descends into drug addiction. In some respects, Cash is somewhat similar to Wilson's character Hansel in ZOOLANDER of the same year.In his next couple of films, Anderson would continue with many of the same themes and aesthetic found here, which was disappointing and felt like he was only repeating a formula to diminishing results. However, this first film in that vein remains impressive years after its release.",The Royal Tenenbaums

I was especially pleased by this colorful and obviously nostalgic vibe of the film which manifests itself in the set (house interior) design of the Tennenbaums. The wallpapers, the tent within a room, the childish curtains, like basically - everything, stuffed with details, hints and highly visually expressive imagery... the inserts of printmatter as well! So, the art department of this film was my focus in this watch and I am in love.

135,FeverDog,Recollections from December 2001,9,11 October 2003,"There's not a whole lot to say about THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS itself that hasn't already been posted here, but one thing that hasn't been mentioned much is its wonky production design. Little details, from the chapter breaks to the closet full of retro board games, were delightful. I also liked how although it's set in the present, nothing in the movie specifically shows it. The odd wardrobes, rusty gypsy cabs, non-brand cigarettes and untrendy hairstyles created its own little world. And I appreciated that the only product placement was integral to the plot (Tic-Tacs); I get so tired of constant brand names in movies distracting me from what's happening in the scene. And those Dalmatian mice were priceless.Lemme include personal recollections. First, I couldn't believe how uncrowded the theatre was; I was disappointed that the audience for a Friday night showing was so sparse. But then again, the movie had been playing awhile maybe it's not the hottest show in town.  However, my local theatre is in Queens, whose residents aren't made up of the type who'd appreciate this brand of quirky humor.Although it was a small crowd, it was a lively one. Everyone was having a ball (and I heard only one cell phone - it's a sad time when that's a compliment), and a rousing applause was led by yours truly when the closing credits rolled - until the stupid ushers turned on the flood lights before the song credits appeared and I had to hiss at them to turn them off until the movie was completely over.I may have slightly annoyed my boyfriend by quietly singing along to all the wonderful tunes by Elliot Smith, Nick Drake, Lou Reed and others; did Wes Anderson raid my CD collection when I wasn't looking? He and Cameron Crowe better ask next time. So, on the walk home after the movie my boyfriend mentioned that he's seen only a portion of RUSHMORE and that he didn't think much of it. At this point I naturally bitchslapped him twice and pledged to force him  to sit down with me and give it another chance. Surely anyone who enjoyed THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS will equally adore a comedy similar in so many ways, no?Ok, enough rambling. 9/10",The Royal Tenenbaums
136,Kirasjeri,"Good, but OVERRATED film about a bunch of misfits",5,10 March 2002,"For me, one of the more overrated films of the year, although that does not mean it wasn't good. It was. I just object to the glowing praise some have heaped on this off-beat, eccentric, rather black comedy.True, Gene Hackman did a remarkably fine job. He usually does. But his role does not, in its length, rise to the level of a Best Actor nomination, and he didn't receive one. He, as Royal Tenenbaum, is the miscreant paterfamilias of his dysfunctional family; some of his relations have not seen him for many years - and they were quite pleased to have separated themselves from his despised presence.Royal, down and out, attempts via another ruse to ingratiate himself back into the good graces of the family - a scheme that eventually also fails. But, eventually, he reaches some resolution with his oddball relations, before his final demise.A ""comedy""?? I found some scenes cute and clever, and several I even smiled at. But neither I, nor anyone in the theater, laughed out loud. Generally, the ensemble cast that comprised his family were too freakish, self-indulgent, and unpleasant to be amusing.

140,mlevans,A most intriguing work,10,17 August 2002,"A most interesting, entertaining and perplexing dark comedy, The Royal Tennenbaums takes at least two viewings to get a grasp on. Director Wes Anderson-one of Hollywood's brightest young talents-has more going on than one can possibly digest in one setting.SPOILERS AHEADThe engaging little comedy focuses around a dysfunctional and estranged family somewhere in an older urban neighborhood. Royal Tennenbaum (Gene Hackman) has been a poor excuse for a husband and father, showing a remarkable lack of sensitivity to members of his family. Now, in his old age, he finds himself broke and out on the street-as well as missing his family, perhaps.Royal concocts a plan. He convinces his estranged wife Etheline (Anjelica Houston) that he is dying of cancer and has only six weeks to live. His one wish, he tells her, is to be reunited with his family.Meanwhile, the Tennenbaum children, unraveling for years, after meteoric success as adolescents, are also returning home. While Richie, a former pro tennis champion, returns home upon word of his father's imminent death, his siblings turn to their childhood home in desperation. The oldest son, Chas (Ben Stiller) was a financial genius in grade school and made a small fortune before adolescence by breeding `dalmation mice.' He was a millionaire before adulthood and later twice sued his father and had him disbarred and jailed. In the past year, though, his wife was killed in a plane crash and he has become fanatically protective of his two young sons Ari and Uzi (Grant Rosemeyer and Jonah Meyerson). He moves in, uninvited, with his mother. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) is an even more fascinating case. A child playwrite, she received a $50,000 grant in ninth grade and enjoyed a run of early successes.  Since marrying stodgy psychologist Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), though, her life has been in collapse. She, too, flees to the protection of  her mother's house. Richie finally has to admit that he has been in love with Margot as long as he can remember and that it was her marriage which led to the humiliating end of his tennis career.Royal has an additional incentive in getting back into the family home and the family mindset. Etheline, who kicked Royal out after 10 years of marriage and wrote a best-seller called `Raising a Family of Geniuses,' went on to be an archaeologist (as Anderson's mother was). She is now considering a proposal by longtime friend and accountant Henry Sherman (Danny Glover).With the help of longtime family servant Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), Royal engineers his return to the family home and begins working to regain the love and trust of his family. Since his sensitivity does not seem to have improved much over the years, this proves to be difficult. In the end, though, Anderson and Owen Wilson (with whom he wrote the script, and who also plays the neighbor, Eli Cash) bring home a satisfying and not overly-sentimental ending.Anderson, as he showed in Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, is not afraid to try some unusual techniques, such as rapid cutting, strange camera angles and a sophisticated use of light and shadow. Yet, trying to put a finger on just what Anderson is saying, can be difficult.The film gets much of its comic clockwork timing from the dysfunctional and disjointed family members and the way they interact (or fail to do so) with each other and the world. Paltrow, as Margot, is the most obvious example. Stunted by the stigma Royal put on her as a child for being adopted (`.and THIS is my ADOPTED daughter, Margot,' she still sees Royal introducing her as a child.), she has never developed full-fledged emotional outlets. While I am guessing some reviewers may pan her for a two-dimensional, bland performance, I am certain she gave Anderson exactly what they were both looking for. She stares vacantly, through eyes heavily outlined in black. Frequently Anderson uses lighting to give her solid black holes for eye sockets-as if reinforcing that her childhood has left her a one- or two-dimensional cartoon character with dots for eyes, like Little Orphan Annie. Alienated from her father and alienated from her loving but stodgy husband, she apparently has turned to passionate flings and smoking as escapes. Yet, Anderson's interesting camera work seems to tell us that this, too, leaves her alienated. In one of his more striking shots, Margot and Eli (with whom she has been having a secret affair) meet downtown. They stand far enough apart so that each is barely in the outer edge of the frame, with the towering, impersonal skyscrapers of the hostile city separating them and dominating the shot.There IS a cartoonish feel to the characters on one level. Like in a cartoon, violence is used casually (although not often) and without permanent consequences. Richie attempts suicide, hacking both wrists hideously, but slips out of the hospital and clandestinely returns home in less than a day. When an enraged Chas chases Eli after his car wreck prior to Etheline's marriage, the priest is knocked down the stairs, breaking an ankle. `That's not SERIOUS, is it?' asks Raleigh, who then asks if there is a priest `on call.'The emotional quagmires of the characters are addressed, to some degree, with resolutions that are acceptable and perhaps even satisfying. Yet Anderson and Wilson resist the temptation to get sentimental-and has the sense not to let the mutual infatuation of Richie and Margot reach consummation.Space is not sufficient here to go into a full analysis of Anderson's technique and possible  intentions. Suffice to say, the film operates on several levels and is entertaining now matter which level one views it. (By the way, rewind and make sure you get to read Royal's tombstone inscription at the end!) The cast is outstanding, and Anderson's knack for using obscure 1960s rock, coupled with his emerging talent for film editing and storytelling, make The Royal Tennenbaums one of the more original and intriguing comedies of the new millennium.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Of course, we might not, but it might be worth a try.That said, though, I DO have to agree wholeheartedly with one remark ""AJ"" made. He PERFECTLY summed it up by calling it ""Introversion at its finest."" I couldn't agree more. But, hey, we all DO have our own tastes. I have many VERY savvy movie friends who INSIST that Goodfellows is one of the best movies ever made.

142,K-Slicer,Family dysfunction at its most quirky,10,25 August 2002,"This is possibly the real best film of 2001.  I hate it when certain works by awesome directors are put into limited release.  Wes Anderson hits an out of the park home run with this movie.  Again, he takes a plot concept that has been made into umpteen zillion other films and he breathes new life into it.  This time he tackles family dysfunction.  His subjects are a detached, disenchanted family where the three kids are prodigies.  ""The Royal Tenanbaums"" contains intelligent writing, very offbeat and quirky characters and an even more bizarre story line.  The camera work, costuming, settings, and makeup also made this movie a pleasure to watch.  The casting was also perfect for this film.  The best performance in the film went to Luke Wilson for his role as a tormented tennis star in love with his adopted sister played by Gwyneth Paltrow.  Gene Hackman had his best performance since ""Unforgiven"" as the wormy patriarch of the shattered Tenanbaums.  Wes Anderson and Luke Wilson score another direct hit with their collective creative efforts.  IMHO, this is their best film and one of the best comedies to have come out in recent memory.  I give it a 10 out of 10.",The Royal Tenenbaums
143,drpakmanrains,Typical Anderson Deadpan Light Comedy,4,19 December 2012,"First let me say that I like realism in most of my films, be they comedy, straight drama, thrillers, or horror films. I especially dislike when a director calls attention to himself so that you are immediately aware of the style involved and can identify who he is. This is the problem I have with Wes Anderson. This was the third of his films I have seen, after Rushmore and Moonrise Kingdom, and I don't like any of them. Yes, the sets are detailed and beautiful, the colors are bright, and the plots are complex. But in all his films, everyone is almost always deadpan, the comedy is light and occasionally amusing, and everyone seems depressed and rather one dimensional. This film reminded me more of an extended version of an old Carol Burnett skit where she and the cast satirized a soap opera. The cast is first rate, but only Gene Hackman displays a wide range of emotions and seems real. I admit I did laugh a few times, and was sufficiently interested in the story to see how it turned out, and that's why I gave it a generous 4. I realize that most people and critics absolutely love Wes Anderson's style and films, and if you do, my review will not impress you. I also dislike Tarantino films for the most part. So if you hate quirky like I do, you probably won't like this film or any other Wes Anderson Film either. Since there are hundreds of reviews already, I won't review the story itself. One thing I noticed was that almost no one smiled once in the entire hour and 45 minutes. Totally joyless.",The Royal Tenenbaums

For me, it is second to ""The Life Aquatic"" but by a very small amount. This was the first Wes Anderson film that I had ever seen and I really thought it was incredible. I love the dull, quiet humor that is throughout this film. It just makes so much sense to me. I like the way that film reads almost like a novel. The characters are really great too. They are all unique and are all very interesting. The story told in this film is a good one as well. It is simple; not much happens, yet a lot is going on throughout the film. The way that the camera moves along with the traditional Anderson direction and use of music is top notch.There isn't much more I can say.

While we (and many others) were clearly enjoying ourselves, some of the audience seemed completely baffled by the whole thing.

147,Doublej20005,Another Fantastic Wes Anderson Film,9,5 January 2021,"This isn't the best Wes Anderson film I've seen - The Grand Budapest Hotel takes that crown easily - but this might just be the most Wes Anderson film I've seen. All of his stylistic choices are on full show, from his use of symmetry to his stark and odd use of colour, to the typical elements of his scripts such as a large cast of characters and his mix of humour and drama. However, I'd say that it is the characters that make this film as fantastic as it is. With such a wide range of characters, it's easy to make some of them kind of boring and forgettable. But here, all of them have specific quirks and logical motivations. I think Royal is probably my favourite, and him trying to reconcile with his family is really heartwarming. But I also really liked Chas and his struggle to get over his wife's death. These seem like depressing topics, but thankfully Wes manages to mix in some genuinely funny comedy, and the tone never felt jolty for me at all. The performances are great, particularly from Gene Hackman, and the ending just wrapped everything up phenomenally well. Owen Wilson is kinda not very good here though. I don't normally mind him, but he is really annoying here. Thankfully he has the least screentime out of the characters, so I could mostly ignore that. Overall, this is just excellent, and I definitely need to finish Anderson's filmography at some point.",The Royal Tenenbaums
148,Mr. Pulse,I don't know...,8,29 December 2001,"Rushmore was staged like one of its protagonist's plays.  The Royal Tenenbaums, from the same director and writers, is instead a novel, complete with chapters and a narrator (Alec Baldwin).  Even more than Rushmore, a quirky film to be sure, I'm not quite clear of my feelings about the movie. It has some very big laughs, but I don't think it's much of a comedy.  It's more like a very serious movie with some funny moments in it. 
Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) is the despicable patriarch of a bizarre family of genius, who live in a gorgeous house in a version of New York, with old taxis and phones, that only exists in this movie.  He is kicked out of the house when his three children are still young, and they have to cope with growing up without a father, and with their status as revered prodigies.  Twenty odd years later all the kids are screwed up, and they all move back into the old house with their mother (Anjelica Huston).  Royal tries to worm his way back into their lives with unusual results.Rushmore's hero, Max Fisher, was a brilliant playright who didn't fit with society.  The Royal Tenenbaums is like watching a movie with five or six Max Fishers.  Chas (Ben Stiller), is an accounting wiz, Richie (Luke Wilson) is a former tennis great, and Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) is another brilliant playright.  But they are all messed up; Chas is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, Richie had a shadowy one a few years back, and Margot is eternally sullen.  Add to this scene after scene of failure, terrible parenting, possible incest, suicide attempts, drug use, and death of both man and animal, and you don't really get the typical mixture for comedy. 
But the movie has genuine moments of comedy.  Owen Wilson's performance as a friend of the Tenenbaums is constantly bizarre and often very funny.  Royal is a terrible father, yet he is so good-humored and ready with a smile thanks to a great performance by Hackman, that you can help chuckle along with him at all his bad deeds.  And the biggest and best gag is at Richie's crucial tennis match, with great physical comedy from Luke Wilson.Shifting the pieces of this thing around in my head writing this, I still don't quite know what to make of it.  I laughed, and in a few of the scenes at the end, I was genuinely moved by the performances of Hackman and Stiller.  But the complaint that it's ""needlessly quirky"" is probably true, and some of the weirder eccentricities (Like Bill Murray's character's experiment subject) don't pan out, and neither do some of the techniques used to shoot the movie (Nearly all dialogue scenes are shot with the character dead center of frame looking at the camera...I wish I could understand why!).  And the New York of the film is cute at points, but it does grate; I kept wishing the Gypsy Cab company had more than the two cars that are seen in the movie over a dozen times.I guess I'm resigned to say that it's an interesting, if uneven, movie that you should see for yourself and try out.  Maybe not on the big screen, but this movie should be seen.  Great or terrible, it's far more involving than most movies I've seen this year, and deserves to be viewed for that reason at the very least.",The Royal Tenenbaums

There are some really touching moments in this film and I did come close to tears.

I have not seen so little energy in performances since ... well, Dragnet.  Any film which uses Bill Murray in this way should be burned -- what a waste of resources!  Only Gene Hackman seems to be engaged at all in this film, likely because he's supposed to be the charming-rogue character, whereas all of the rest of the characters are supposedly serious and therefore boring.  You can't blame the high-priced acting talent for this -- Wes Anderson deserves all the blame here.  Besides the bland and deadpan acting, there are innumerable shots of actors staring directly into the camera, saying and doing nothing.  The movie is broken up into 'chapters' in an annoying literary pretension that distracts rather than adds to the story.  Alec Baldwin adds a constant voiceover to move the plot, since almost none of what we see manages to do that.  Maybe this makes a great art film, or experimental cinema, but it fails as anything else.  It's 109 minutes of almost constant boredom, with only its lush cinematography to recommend it.",The Royal Tenenbaums

His colorful characters feature unmatched depth and are merely played to perfection as brought to live by a sparkling cast.

157,nqure,Anderson's off-beat humour an acquired taste,6,26 March 2002,"Having seen this & Rushmore' before it, I have to say that Anderson's films leave me feeling very ambivalent.  They try to balance idiosyncratic humour alongside tragedy, flipping from one to the other almost imperceptibly. Whether it works is a moot point.  The film is a series of vignettes and sub-plots linked by Gene Hackman's endearing performance as the raffish Royal, returning back to the bosom of his estranged family, a group of eccentric prodigies, whilst simultaneously trying to thwart a rival for his wife's affections.Tenenbaum's humour is much more subtle than the average Hollywood comedy and there are good set-pieces.  I particularly liked Royal's farcical attempt  including hiring a bellhop from his hotel to act as his medical consultant' - to fool everyone, apart from his suspicious rival Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), that he's dying from stomach cancer whilst munching three burgers a day.   Hackman has a wonderful way with one-liners especially invective.  He blunders his way back into the family through a mix of charm and unintentional cruelty.It's essentially a darkly humorous film about a set of dysfunctional individuals. Royal is held responsible for his family's failings and fall from grace but, in a sense, he becomes the agent for their recovery, i.e. Margot & Richie coming to terms with their feelings.I thought the ending was slightly disappointing with Royal finally reaching a sense of reconciliation with Chas at his death.   The film should've just ended at Etheline's wedding.  The symbolism in the film of Richie's hawk, Mordecai, roaming free over the skylines felt laboured, representing the characters' own inhibitions and their attempts to free themselves from their past.  On the whole, after leaving the cinema, I felt I'd watched an incomplete movie, one which felt less than the sum of its parts.  As another reviewer pointed out, the film is too dark to be merely labelled a comedy yet its drama feels too underpowered to be genuinely affecting.  It's interesting that we are never shown Raleigh's (the underused Bill Murray) possible reaction to the love-affair between his wife Margot & Richie, her 'brother'. Wes Anderson's dark, lugubrious humour is certainly an acquired taste.  I much preferred this to Rushmore' which soon began to grate on my nerves. However, I'm not sure I'll be returning for a third helping.",The Royal Tenenbaums

This particular piece of information needs to be accurate, since I am hard of hearing.This movie appeared to be okay, despite Gene the ""Hack""man.

Anyone will be able to relate to the love/hate relationship the Tenenbaums have with each other. They make each other miserable and yet need each other desperately.With this cast, filmgoers less likely to brave a more artistically adventurous film will buy a ticket to this one. For many, it will not be what they expect. It doesn't deliver huge laughs, but it's a sweet story laced with really clever humor. Anderson's visual style maintains a giddiness throughout. A simple cutaway here or reaction shot there serve to alter the tone of a given scene (such as the hilarious flashback to Margot's reunion with her real family in Indiana). ""Royal Tenenbaums"" is one great scene after another. There seems to be more set pieces than there were in Anderson's ""Rushmore"" of a few years ago. At times, ""Tenenbaums"" feels more like a Woody Allen picture than a Wes Anderson (by no means a bad thing). For example, the sidewalk-set scene in which Royal first tells Etheline he's dying.

Angelica Huston portrays a long-suffering matriarch who isn't about to compromise her affections for a suitor played by Danny Glover.Gwyneth Paltrow leads a team of infantilized adults (thank you NYT) including Ben Stiller who plays it for laughs and succeeds in beating his character into the ground. Did anyone else get tired of the red running suits? The remainder of Luke and Owen Wilson and Bill Murray (who looks embarrassed to be here  but shouldn't) do little to add to the development of the plot.

Their utterly twisted and often hilarious exploits bring to mind memories of that other lovably weird clan. But in terms of the little matter of family harmony, the difference is like oil and water. Neat? Sweet? Petite? The Tenenbaums? No way. Director Wes Anderson's oddball showpiece opens in 1979. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman in a performance that is nothing short of amazing), a mustachioed chain smoker like Gomez Addams but nowhere near as attentive a father, is separated from his level-headed wife, Ethel (Anjelica Huston, who, ironically, played the always-cool Morticia in the two ""Addams"" films). They have three kids: Chas, Richie, and ""adopted daughter"" Margot. Royal's blatant lack of interest in his children is the cause of the separation, and he makes no bones about it either. He purposely shoots Chas in the hand with a BB gun and openly criticizes Margot's play, among other things. And his reasoning for the separation? ""Well, we made certain sacrifices by having children."" Priceless. After his departure, Ethel takes the children under her wing and they evolve into underage prodigies. Chas is a wealthy banker, Margot a successful playwright, and Richie a tennis pro sporting the nickname ""The Baumer."" Disbarred and suddenly kicked out of a hotel room he's occupied for years, Royal, accompanied constantly by his Lurch-like Middle Eastern manservant Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), decides he wants to make amends for his actions by attempting to reunite with his estranged brood...even if it means faking a terminal illness. And that's when this delight of a movie really takes off. However, things have changed during the 17 years Royal was separated from his family. The children have reached adulthood and are shadows of their former selves. Chas (Ben Stiller), constantly bedecked in red jogging suits - and black for funerals - is a widower with two young boys. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), complete with a Wednesday Addams-style blank glare, is married to a much older man, human study author Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), and she spends six hours a day locked in her bathroom staring listlessly at the TV. Due to a childhood accident, she now has nine and a half fingers. Richie (Luke Wilson), following a humiliating burnout during a televised match, has become a recluse, travelling the world by ship and communicating only through telegrams. Meanwhile, Ethel is engaged to accountant Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), a Teddy bear in a blue suit. Oh, and Richie just happens to be infatuated with his sister Margot. The well-paced screenplay by Anderson and Owen Wilson (who also has a supporting role as drug-addicted, self-absorbed Western author Eli Cash) does a great job of fleshing out each of the main characters, and as a result, viewers will empathize with some of them, no matter their motives. Although it's not an outright knee-slapping laugh fest, one of ""Tenenbaums'"" best selling points is its aspect of physical comedy, which actually provides more laughs than the spoken variety and adds to scenes instead of bogging them down, as opposed to random, pointless acts of slapstick that do nothing to advance the plot. The outrageous is turned into  the subtle, and the results are hysterical moments such as Cash unexpectedly  walking off the set of a talk show, Royal attempting to inject a little delinquency into Chas' straight-arrow boys, plus the funniest moment in the film: Richie's embarrassing swan song on the tennis court. Just imagine, say, Pete Sampras helplessly flinging his racket at his opponent's serve or removing his shoes and socks and sitting forlornly on the ground. Then there's also a tour of Cash's quarters, complete with a handy stash of marijuana plants, a multitude of adult videos bearing colorful titles such as ""Dark and Dirty"", and a collection of large, horrid paintings that even Salvador Dali would have considered repulsive. Throughout the film, nutty covers of books scribed by family members over time randomly pop up and cover the entire screen like wallpaper. In fact, the entire movie is played out much like a book, complete with occasional ""chapter introductions"" preceding cuts to different scenes. The opening credits are shown in an impossible-to-ignore bold font that nearly usurps the screen. Although the aforementioned physical comedy is a hoot, the verbal is definitely no slouch. The snappy dialogue is full of witty one-liners, such as Royal's innovative use of adverbs when he describes Chas' late wife as ""a terribly attractive woman."" When Margot informs Ethel that she's been a smoker for 22 years, Ethel calmly replies, ""I think you should quit."" It's a no-brainer to say that the acting is through the roof. For such a large cast, there is a striking chemistry among the actors as they become so immersed in their onscreen personalities. In turn, the script is effective at balancing these roles out. Although Hackman is undoubtedly the star of the show, the other family members are given their time in the spotlight, and they are just as memorable as a result. The execution of the diverse soundtrack helps set the mood for both humorous and  foreboding moments, from the Rolling Stones' ""Ruby Tuesday"" to film composer Mark Mothersbaugh's inspirational cover of the Beatles' ""Hey Jude."" Royal's mischievous outing with Chas' sons is set to Paul Simon's classic ""Me and Julio Down By The Schoolyard,"" while Elliott Smith's dark ""Needle In The Hay"" is used effectively in a very disturbing scene. There's also plenty of classical mixed in with the classic rock, including Vince Guaraldi's ""Christmas Time Is Here"" (despite the fact that the movie takes place nowhere near Christmas), and my all-time favorite piece, Erik Satie's ""Gymnopedie No. 1."" What took some points off the board was the fact that Hackman and Paltrow light up constantly. I despise smoking in movies, but here it's barely significant in the grand scheme of things. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a terrific film that is easily recommended for those who enjoy quirky, offbeat yet intellectual humor, or for those simply in need of a good laugh...heck, it's great viewing for any warm-blooded human being, for that matter. Not since the Family Addams has household dysfunction been so much fun. Snap, snap. 9/10",The Royal Tenenbaums

My wife and I sat through about the first 30 minutes and both of us agreed to hit the off button. So many times, I sit through really bad movies and think ""It has to get better"", but it seldom does. This movie started off so bad that even if it got a lot better, it would still be very bad.This movie and the reviews here just show how different our tastes are.

171,shadow_blade-89459,Dramatically Funny,9,2 August 2018,"""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001) is a comedic drama about an emotionless, self-centered man named Royal Tenenbaum, played by Gene Hackman, as he tries to interject himself back into the lives of his abandoned family after finding out his wife Etheline, played by Anjelica Huston, is contemplating getting married to another man. Royal tells his wife, from which he is not divorced, that he has a terminal illness and only wishes to have his family back before his six weeks comes to an end. Etheline's fiancé, Henry Sherman played by Danny Glover, suspects there may be trickery afoot and a rollercoaster ensues. I am not usually of fan of redemption stories, but this is a great film. It reminded me that there is usually a Royal character in everyone's life. The director, Wes Anderson, does an outstanding job forcing the audience to care, from a distance, about this jerk of a man. The portrayal of the children in relations to Royal was magnificent. His two biological children Chas, played by Ben Stiller, and Ritchie, played by Luke Wilson, both capture an essence of Royal, but neither capture his characteristics as well as his adopted daughter Margot, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. As a viewer, you want and need to hate Royal, but Mr. Anderson, through his direction, keeps the audience from falling all the way over the fence. Overall, this is an astonishing film I only wish I would have seen earlier. This film sheds a different light on redemption storylines.",The Royal Tenenbaums

173,tendobear,Can't Stand Wes Anderson!!!,1,9 August 2012,"To me - and I know many, many people will disagree - Wes Anderson is another one of those directors whose movies I only like one of - I actually quite enjoyed The Life Aquatic (mostly because of Bill Murray and the quality stop-motion animation), but that's it. Everything else he does is just irritatingly boring, dull and completely unfunny. I've tried to like his movies, but I just can't. I hate directors whose movies are odd for the sake of being odd, and not because it's funny or it makes sense; it's just downright pretentious. He's not even weird or odd in a good way like David Lynch. Some might argue that his humour is too sophisticated or high-brow for my caveman mind, fair enough, I'm just here to speak my mind. This review is applicable to all Wes Anderson films (except Aquatic), so hopefully I won't have to keep repeating myself. Oh, another thing; I absolutely can't stand Jason Schwartzman!

He showed weird little aspects of each character's life, yet kept them mysterious enough to keep you interested.However, I expected this movie to be more than just ""interesting"". I expected it to be hilarious as well. Now, granted, it had its moments which were truly hilarious - but those moments are few and far between.I understand that this film's objective is not to make you constantly laugh, but there were times when I felt that the film could been funnier than it was, and a little dry.Somewhat disappointing.",The Royal Tenenbaums

While it certainly had funny bits in it I consider it more of a dramatic piece with occasional highlights of the ludicrous in life. That said, this movie is difficult to pigeon-hole in other ways. It has a fantastic ensemble cast but is more than a mere ensemble piece. It is dark yet sweet, funny and tragic. It is not the type of film I rave about (unlike Rushmore) as soon as it ends, but it is one that I will think about days after it is over.

180,The Gryphon,"Kinda like watching a dog eat peanut butter - funny, but sad.",5,18 December 2002,"This is a movie with a low grade temperature.  You keep expecting it to get better but unfortunately it devolves into a weird strain of ebola.  The first third of the movie provides the viewer with a quaint set-up regarding the history of an eccentric family of near-geniuses.  One of the children ""invents"" dalmation mice, for example.  The actors exist as set pieces for pretty funny dialogue, but have no souls, with the possible exceptions of Gene Hackman and Ben Stiller.In other ways, the good start leads to a disappointing 2nd and 3rd act, which involves a bizarre neo-incestous relationship featuring Gwynneth Paltrow, who exhibits all the passion of a zombie reject from ""Night of the Living Dead.""  I'm sure it's not her fault that her character was given every line to be delivered in monotone, but she should be punished, nonetheless, for her performance.  How anyone could fall in love with such a cypher is beyond me.  There is also a shocking seriousness to the scenes in the second act, (one involving an attempted suicide), that really do not fit the overall tone of the movie, if you ask me.  It sees to exist in a different realm than the rest of the film.The finale of the movie is a gumbo of working and non-working scenes frantically trying to paint itself out of a corner.  For the first third of this movie I give it an 8.  For the second act - a 2, and for the third, a 5.  Overall - 5.That's my story and I'm sticking with it.",The Royal Tenenbaums

182,garrettderose,A looked-over classic,9,13 July 2009,"I've been a fan of The Royal Tennenbaums for a few years now. It's one of those movies I can watch over and over again. The characters are original, and their struggles overshadow most of the humor and masterful cinematography Wes Anderson provides. There's many themes thrown around in this movie: The 'perfect family' - famous and successful, but having numerous internal problems.Forbidden love between brother and sister The boy-next-door who wishes he was part of their family (which I personally am a victim of) The widow, who is coping with the loss of his wife in the worst ways possible.The dead-beat father seeking redemption in the eyes of his children The divorcée finding love again after 20+ years The lost little girl trying to find comfort and solace in her life There's A LOT of stuff to relate to, for many people, in this movie.For the actors and actresses involved, it's my opinion that this is the top. This is the feather in their hat. Gene Hackman becomes my favorite actor of all time as Mr. Tennenbaum (or ""Royal""). The Wilson brothers are also very respectable. This is a pretty serious and thought-out role for Owen Wilson, who happens to be one of my least favorite actors of all time. He's great as Eli Cash.Angelica Huston and Danny Glover are on-screen champions of quality acting.I fell in love with Gywneth Paltrow during this movie. She's beautiful, and conveys a silent sadness that is unmatched by any other actress i've seen.Aside from all of these heavy things I have to say about The Royal Tennenbaums: The movie is fun! And it's stylish. It's full of life, and I always end up calling my dad (who I didn't get to see very often, and just so happens to be a very ill person himself) whenever I watch this movie.Please go check this out!

183,Sachin_Chavan,Hope for Hollywood,9,7 December 2016,"Is it even possible for me to not like a Wes Anderson movie? He makes me feel like Rashid Khan in Hindustani classical music: that there's still hope for Hollywood! 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is worth watching just for its visuals (which Anderson isn't?). But Wes is not a Bhansali - he doesn't just make eye candies. In fact, even his visual treat is in a different league altogether. Blended with the narrative, it gives the feel of reading a rich novel and imagining it visually myself. There's a lot of creative imagination behind it. As a writer-director Anderson's movies are humanistic-existential. Relations are dealt with adroitly and you get more than a glimpse into the recesses of his character's minds. The Royal Tenenbaums has plenty of family drama, but if you go looking just for that, you'd be underwhelmed. See it for the presentation, and you'd be satisfied, if not delighted. Anderson weaves the bright and the dark just like real life does. Wes's films may never break the box offices, but his style will be loved and studied by connoisseurs for decades to come. 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is where he broke through into the commercial mainstream, but has continued to maintain his own creative stream despite that.

And I thought Rushmore was a cute, fairly entertaining film that tended to go long because of the lack of story.This movie, however, is one of the worst films I have seen all year. And this has not been a stellar year for movies. Undeveloped characters, no story and very little humor. I was looking at my watch half way through the film - which was by the way shortly after the film's set-up. Breaking all dramatic rules (and not for any good reason - ala Bunuel's surrealist fare) - this snooze-fest features the longest and most pointless voice over I ever heard and also points up Wes Anderson's limited directorial skills. Wes doesn't know how to use visuals to move the story along, his sets are interesting but pointless and he doesn't know the first thing about story telling. And the flawed but interesting characters from his earlier films (and which I personally think has much more to do with Owen Wilson's writing talents that anything Wes can be credited for) are completely missing in this film.Let's face it. When this movie goes wide and America votes thumbs down on this piece of crap - it won't be because they don't understand it, but rather because the general public will not be as easily fooled as the indie film crowd.Bottom line - I had a much better time watching Dude - Where's My Car?",The Royal Tenenbaums

190,Euphorbia,Only in the movies can a con man be cured,8,22 April 2004,"Question: Can a two-bit, chiseling, psychopath and bully of a con man (Royal O'Reilly Tenenbaum) be re-born late in life as a human being?
Answer: Only in the movies. Specifically, in this movie. I have seen such con men try to ""be real,"" but it always turns out to be just another con. Wes Anderson built his movie on this unlikely -- make that impossible -- premise. He created an alternate universe, where a con man can be healed by love. There is a note of poignancy here, as if there were a psychopath in Anderson's own life, perhaps his father, whom he hoped would some day change. This cannot happen in real life, con men never change, so Anderson went ahead and made it happen on screen. And he did it well. As a straight drama this story would have been unbearably bleak. But as surreal fantasy with comedic structure, it tells it like it isn't -- a modern fairy tale rooted obliquely in the absurd, a fantasy of a world that only superficially resembles our own. Think of it as an intergenerational Amelie. The Royal Tenenbaums is clever, well cast (except for Bill Murray, who seems in a hurry to leave), superbly executed, and fully engaging. At least it was to me. On the other hand I can understand not liking this movie, especially if one is still susceptible to psychopaths (hint: if you watch Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw, or Ted Koppel, you're susceptible to being conned).
Hey, Hey, Hey! Wake up! It is OK not to be conned. The emperor really has no clothes. You have permission to stop being a victim. Turn around and walk away. In my business I daily encounter antique collectors who have been conned repeatedly, and usually it is because they cannot admit the possibility of being conned, so they just go along and make up a rationale for why it's not a con, when of course it is. Etheline Tenenbaum gets it. You can too. *",The Royal Tenenbaums
191,AW_McGOWAN,A Quirky Heartfelt Family Dramedy,6,3 December 2020,"Gene Hackman plays Royal Tenenbaum in this third feature from director Wes Anderson. Royal is the distant patriarch of his family - made up of his never-legally-divorced wife (Anjelica Huston), two sons (Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson), adopted daughter (Gwyneth Paltrow) and two grandsons (Grant Rosenmeyer and Jonah Meyerson). Late in his life, he wants to make amends with his estranged kin and strives to become the father figure his children deserve.I've said it before that Wes Anderson's aesthetic is often too artsy for my taste, but I won't deny that ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a lot of fun. Sure there are a number of visual eccentricities in the film - tents unnecessarily set up in living rooms, characters wearing the same clothes throughout, and sets that feel like the universe takes place in a diorama - but a very endearing script overrides such bizarre features.Wes' signature dry wit lends itself well to this new take on the family melodrama. Anderson wrote the script with co-star Owen Wilson (the same duo that wrote ""Rushmore""). In it, they craft a delightful cast of characters, each one with his or her own set of problems and stakes in the plot. Rather than get bored or fed-up with the dysfunctional Tenenbaums, we are eager to learn more about them and truly hope for the best as they navigate tricky, yet relatable circumstances.Ben Stiller and Gene Hackman are the most engaging. As Royal's oldest son, Stiller portrays a widower with deep contempt for his father. His anxieties as a single dad pull at the heartstrings and add some serious energy to Wes' silly world. Meanwhile, it is quite entertaining to witness Hackman living in that world. I usually associate Hackman with either the quiet hero (as per his role in ""The Conversation"") or the villain (as per his roles in ""Unforgiven"" or ""Superman""). Here he plays a man with misdirected charisma, trying to set things right in his life's final act. It's both heartfelt and humorous.Wes Anderson's artistic oddities aside, I suppose my main criticism for this film would be the complicated love triangle around Gwyneth Paltrow's character. I don't mind the competition between her husband (Bill Murray) and Owen Wilson's character, but throw in the fact that Luke Wilson's character is madly in love with her as well, and it starts feeling a bit strange. As aforementioned, Luke Wilson plays her brother. Though the siblings are not related by blood, a weird incestuous undertone persists, making this one corner of the film a little hard to digest. The dynamic brings about some pretty dramatic scenes, but they easily could have found their way into the film via a different door.Anyway, that's no reason not to appreciate the movie altogether. Even through the strange subplot, the viewer roots for all of these broken characters to achieve happiness. While most family melodramas from ""August Osage County"" to Noah Baumbach's filmography demonstrate that resolution is hard to come by in the genre, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" stands out in its refreshing ability to keep the audience smiling right up through the satisfying end.",The Royal Tenenbaums
192,taikman,"Quirky, offbeat, original and very funny.",9,20 June 2002,"Why are screwed-up families funny? Is it because we like to see social conventions, like the ones that state that normal families are made up of people who are nice to each other, turned on their heads? Or do we feel better about our own lives when we see misfits and malcontents on screen? Whatever the case, some excellent films and tv shows have been based on dysfunctional but likeable families. This is another one.Like 'Amelie', the other great comedy of recent times, 'The Royal Tenenbaums' begins with a deadpan narrator telling us of a series of bizzare, horrible and blackly funny events, as the film sets up its characters by showing us their past. In 1979 Royal Tenenbaum was kicked out of the house by his wife when their three kids were young, because, as Royal admits, 'I've always been considered an asshole'. There's no malice about it, it's just part of his nature. This is a man who always introduced his adopted daughter Margot as 'my adopted daughter Margot', who shot his 7 year old son Chas with a BB gun, who ignored this family for over 20 years then fakes a terminal illness to get back with them. In his abscence the Tenenbaums became prodigies: Chas a teen financial wizard, Margot an award-winning playwright at 14, Richie a tennis champion. Now they're all lonely and miserable, along with almost everyone close to them. Royal arrives to try and be a father and pep them up, as well as get a place to live, because he's broke.It sounds depressing, but it's not. There's a sympathy and charm to this tale, and a delightfully odd sense of humour, all heightened by the well-chosen soundtrack. The cast is amazing: Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller (NOT playing an idiotic loser for once), Owen Wilson and his brother Luke, Bill Murray, Danny Glover, and they're given roles that allow them to become characters who are unusual in cinema: actually unique and interesting people. There's not a dull character in this film, and because of that we care what happens to them. The slow pace and sense of humour will not be enjoyed by everyone, and some will want something more decisive, but I grinned all the way through.8/10",The Royal Tenenbaums

194,sloopydrew,Deviously clever and understatedly humorous!,9,20 February 2002,"This film is nothing like you think it is, unless you've seen it.  I've been wanting to see this for months, but I always thought it looked kind of dorky in the ads, even with the awesome Ramones' song (speaking of which, Joey Ramone's solo CD came out yesterday, and it RULES!).  None of the ads did it justice.  None of the critics did it justice.  I know that I won't do it justice.  This film is deviously clever and understatedly humorous, much like a Kurt Vonnegut novel, but like a Kurt Vonnegut novel, it's nearly impossible to describe what's so clever or humorous about it.  It just is. The ensemble cast is incredible (for the first time ever, it doesn't seem as though Gwyneth Pawltrow is phoning in her performance), the story is fun, and it's all wrapped up in a wonderful package that is incredibly unique in its familiarity.  That doesn't make any sense, does it?  I told you I couldn't do this movie justice.  You'll just have to go buy a ticket, and see for yourself.  While you're at it, why don't you write the Academy and ask them why they didn't nominate Gene Hackman for his wonderful performance as Royal Tenenbaum?",The Royal Tenenbaums
195,stefan-144,A too funny family,6,22 January 2003,"This is one odd family. All the kids are prodigies, becoming messed up adults. Sure, the father abandoned them, and the mother seems a bit too orderly - but still, I see no clue either to the genius of the kids or to their adult misery.The film is a pile of jokes and absurdities, and that's fine with me. Like a Marx brothers thing. But the Marx never pretended to have a plot worth contemplating, whereas the Tenenbaum story does. It doesn't compute. Every new information we receive about anyone of the characters - and there's plenty of it - just raises new questions. Why? How?Although there is a lot of fun going on, right to the end, the shortcomings in the plot and the lack of penetration into what drives the characters, sort of makes the film evaporate at the very moment it ends, leaving no lasting aftertaste.The Tenenbaums should have been a bit less funny, to give room for their characters to take form - or even more funny, never once leaving the absurd.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Both of them worth the accolades they received, however, for my part, I enjoyed The Royal Tenenbaums that much more. Rich, innovative, and captivating story telling, superb acting by an all-star cast (especially Gene Hackman, whom I hope receives some type of award for his performance in this movie), humor, and a story about forgiveness and hope make this, in my opinion, a movie everyone should see. Do yourself a favor, if you can relate to any dysfunctional family, check this movie out for a breath of fresh air.",The Royal Tenenbaums
197,jaysilentbob37,"""Hilariously tragic"" is a great way to describe this outstanding, quirky comedy.",10,25 October 2006,"In spite of what you may have heard, The Royal Tenenbaums is a comedy. Most people you may have heard it from were probably expecting another Meet the Parents, which I can assure you, it is not. It is among the quirkiest movies you're likely to see. What other word other than ""quirky"" can accurately describe a movie that finds bizarre humor in the lives of a complete failure of a family?The plot is always fascinating, and consistently entertaining. The three Tenenbaum children, Richie (Luke Wilson), Margot (Gweneth Paltrow), and Chas (Ben Stiller), were geniuses growing up, who each accomplished more in their childhood than most people do in their entire lives. Richie became a champion tennis player by age 17, Margot wrote plays and won a Pulitzer prize in 9th grade, and Chas, a financial expert, started a real estate company in his early teens. Unfortunately, they lacked support from their obnoxious father, Royal (Gene Hackman), and when their glory ended, the family became estranged from one another, and each of the three kids became a neurotic mess of an adult, with Margot being unhappily married to a neurologist, Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), Chas being an overprotective father to his two sons after a family tragedy, and Richie spending all his time at sea. When Royal finds out that his ex-wife, Etheline (Anjelica Huston) is contemplating marrying Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), he fakes a terminal illness, hoping to find redemption and acceptance from his estranged family. Meanwhile, a family friend, Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) is struggling with a drug problem.It's a story full of tragedy and sadness, and yet the movie manages to be hilarious. It usually seems as if the movie isn't even trying to be funny, as the tone is always kept rather dark and often gloomy. The (extremely subtle) humor is all based around sadness. Each joke ends in tragedy, and each tragedy ends in a joke. Of course, ignorant viewers won't find the film funny, and be highly disappointed. After repeated viewings, gradually becoming one of my favorite movies, this movie makes me laugh out loud frequently. But once again, despite the presence of various comedic talents (Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Bill Murray), this film is NOT like most films they're famous for, and people expecting slapstick and toilet humor will hate the film. But if you appreciate it for the strange quirk fest that it is, you'll find a lot to enjoy here.The production design is truly brilliant, and the locations are fun to look at. The props in the film are abundant, and wonderfully strange, pointless to the average moviegoer. Wes Anderson dedicates himself to making every detail of the family's weirdness fully evident, and the family's house (particularly the kid's bedrooms) is full of stuff you'd be likely to find at most European art shows, and Sky Mall magazines. Add surprisingly beautiful cinematography, and you have one of the best looking movies of our time. The performances are all brilliant as you'd expect from a Wes Anderson movie. After the critical acclaim of Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, every big name in Hollywood seems to vie for a role in one of this geniuses movies. They must really want them, as they each play their roles with dead-on brilliance, showing real emotion, and each being funny in their own subtle way. Ben Stiller, and Owen Wilson (who co-wrote the script) are great examples. While still funny in this film, they step completely out of character from their usual roles, which would have been a challenge for any other filmmaker that I can think of, or it just may be the brilliance of the script. I believe it's actually the latter. And don't even get me started with Gene Hackman... (funniest lines)...I highly recommend this to anyone who's had enough Adam Sandler/Rob Schneider for a while, and is looking for something new and original, that they can feel smart for laughing at, and give it a 10.It is rated R Some Language, Sexuality/Nudity, and Drug Content Sex: 7/10 Violence: 5/10 Swearing: 5/10 Drugs: 5/10",The Royal Tenenbaums

203,theresamgill,Wes Anderson at his Best,9,12 June 2018,"There are many directors that become famous for trademarks or gimmicks inserted into their films. Whether it be Hitchcock appearing in his own films or M. Night Shyamalan (attempting to) having a plot twist ending, some work and some are cheap.What we have with Wes Anderson is an off-beat tone that has drawn people to either love or hate him. Before I talk about the tone and mood of his films, what is further key is his visual style. Never before have I seen such attentiveness and perfectionism put into symmetry and bursting colors. You'll have a dinner table with equal amount of characters with one lamp on either side of the room and a bright red wall. The camera is then placed (movement is used more for pans-- and even with these the pans are symmetrical) specifically to draw the audience to the center of the screen while noticing that on either side will be similarities. The messages may be more subtle in what they represent, but the popping sets are exquisitely memorable and truly some eye-candy.I think that when some people will watch an Anderson movie, there could be an uneasiness or tenseness by not knowing if what you should do is laugh or walk out of the room before it's too late. And there are the dissenters that are perhaps expecting more traditionalist filming. If you don't know what you're getting into with one of these films, then I would recommend being a little hesitant. It's not for everybody.With that said, The Royal Tenenbaums begins with one of the best montages I have ever seen. It's Wes Anderson being himself while setting up the characters that truly need an introduction because they belong in this mad wonderland. You have Gene Hackman, the Wilson brothers, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, and of course Bill Murray. I'm not even sure where I would begin to describe these characters that are associated in one way or the other with the Tenenbaum family-- but as a start, Hackman is the father that has mainly neglected his family and attempts to have everyone reconnect and have more bonding time in a once blooming family.The middle of the film may be bogged down slightly with less exciting scenes, but from Anderson and Owen Wilson's writing, these otherwise mundanely watchable scenes are elevated by the captivating, dysfunctional characters (Gwyneth Paltrow's deadbeat Margot Tenenbaum may be my favorite) that provide unconventional unpredictability. I'm not even sure if unconventional unpredictability is a term that even makes sense, but all the more does it describe Wes Anderson.If you're still not sure what type of film this is, imagine a more modern setting with characters that don't belong but are trying to make it all work; the familial conflict is there, but boy did I have some laughs while watching it unfold. I have also seen Rushmore and Moonrise Kingdom, but The Royal Tenenbaums is both better as a film and as a starting point to understand whether you should watch more of these films. I was won over and enjoyed the movie thoroughly, but I still caution that the style may be off-putting for some.You can find this review and dozens of others at gillipediamoviereviews.blogspot.com",The Royal Tenenbaums

The father, Royal Tenenbaum desires his wife back (they never split up) so he tells her about the cancer he has been diagnosed with. This incident causes all three children to move back with their parents and lead their new, boring lives.

If u enjoy Wes Andersen's films but u haven't seen this one then do what ever u have to do to get yourself a copy of it and find a working DVD player or if needed a VHS player (yes it's available on VHS, I know this because I have one-lol). Get yourself in front of a TV and make it snappy and then just kick back, relax and enjoy the magic of a really finely crafted work of art. You will be greeted by the regal voice of Alec Baldwin. He'll introduce u to the Tenebaum family and tell u all u need to know about why they are the way they are and why they have strayed so far from their potential and one another.

Would Allen have put an egotistic, neurotic protagonist the center i.e an image of himself - here cinema, verity, redemption, maturity dominate. Allen poked fun at the self-destructing individual out of some sadistic depth but none of that self-gratifying fake intellectualism here. What we get is true 21st century compassion.

214,FranktheRabbit,And you thought your family had problems....,9,21 December 2003,"The Royal Tenenbaums (2001/Wes Anderson) ***1/2 out of ****In motion picture history, there are classic examples of dysfunctional families, from the Corleones to the Roses. But ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" brings to the screen the most oddest dysfunctional family in the history of cinema. The Tenenbaum family is led by Royal (Gene Hackman) and Etheline (Anjelica Huston). They have three children: Chas, the financial kid; Margot, a young playwright (she's adopted) and Richie, an all star Tennis player. Before the kids become prodigies, their parents seperate, and they live with their mother. But when the kids grow up, that is when the problems start to happen. Chas (Ben Stiller) has just lost his wife, and is at the verge of a mental breakdown. He always fears for his twin son's safety, to the point of having all three of them wear the same colored Adidas Track Suits! All Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) wants is to be accepted. She has gone through many relationships since her childhood, including a Jamaican recording artist, a French woman, her husband (Bill Murray), and her most recent affair with her brother's boyhood friend, named Eli (Owen Wilson), who is now a successful writer with a serious problem. And the last child, Richie (Luke Wilson), had a breakdown during a Tennis match, and has been avoiding the family ever since. Oh yeah, he is also in love with his sister! And finally there is Danny Glover, the family's accountant, who has just proposed to Etheline.What keeps this above the level of your ordinary family comedy, is the colorful and rewarding style by director and writer Wes Anderson. The soundtrack is also very interesting. Gene Hackman and Ben Stiller turn in funny performances, but the rest of the cast is kind of goofy, yet at the same time, surprisingly likeable. The film's offbeat approach is what glued me in, and now I want to go out and watch Anderson's other film, ""Rushmore"".

He pretends hat he is dying so he could see his children he didn't see for years, Margot, Richie and Chas.To me the most touching moments was when Richie was in the bathroom and he said he was going to kill himself.  He shaved and cut his hair and took off everything that reminded him of the past.  He did it because of Margot but it wasn't her fault.

218,dover,"Close, no cigar",7,15 December 2001,"Having not seen Rushmore or Bottle Rocket, I have nothing to compare this to, though I will say the film makes me want to see the other two Anderson has made.  ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is an interesting and entertaining film, but it has its shortcomings.  Namely, it seems to have lost its message somewhere in one too many little side commentaries about familial relationships. The film sets itself up to have a message, but none comes forth - is it about the downward career trajectory? reaching your peak too early? how selfish parents affect kid's lives? What?That said, the film is incredibly well made. The sets are very well done, you subtly notice things like the character's always wearing basically the same clothing, these kinds of things. There is a nice bit of subtlety as you continually see Ben Stiller's character (Chas) shut his father out literally and figuratively by turning out the lights in the room his father (Hackman) is in. The film is full of these kinds of impressive touches.The acting is a mixed bag - a couple of characters aren't written particulary well. Hackman, Bill Murray, and Danny Glover all shine in characters that are ridiculous to some degree. Anjelica Huston is great. Luke Wilson and Stiller are right for their roles, and Wilson makes a stunning transformation that fits well into the movie, and he does a fine job as the film's moral center (I think.) Gwyneth Paltrow and Owen Wilson's characters, however, appear to be included for the sake of advancing the plot - neither one really gets much of a chance to act, so I can't really blame them for their performances (though O. Wilson did, of course, co-write this, so I can blame him a little).""The Royal Tanenbaums"" felt like it still had a lot of rough edges to work out. There are a lot of hilarious, dark comedy moments, but the film seems to be concerned more with these moments that making any salient point. There are something akin to eight major characters (the five Tenenbaums, Glover, Murray, and Owen Wilson, not to mention Chas's two kids, who provide a number of great moments), each of whom have their own separate and interesting issues, and there isn't near enough time to explore them all - only Luke Wilson's Richie and Hackman's Royal seem to find their solutions (and maybe Chas) - the ending is kind if a cop-out, though I won't say more about it. Basically, the film kind of deals with everyone's problems, sort of, maybe, and for the characters whose problems aren't really adressed (like Paltrow's, Owen Wilson's, and Murray's) you have to wonder why they're brought up to begin with, because there really isn't one central turning point around which everyone revolves, as much as the film wants it to be Hackman. This is definitely worth seeing, for Hackman's (especially) excellent performance, for the way it was filmed, and for some a good laugh, but it doesn't quite reach the level of memorable piece it seems it was intended for.",The Royal Tenenbaums

220,slimjack,A truly odd classic,10,3 April 2002,"The Royal Tenenbaums is a truly great movie.  It is full of humor and humanity. The acting is impeccable, the story absolutely absorbing and the presentation stylish without becoming overbearing. It's also one of the oddest major studio releases in years. If you are unprepared for its oblique view of life you could be justifiably outraged by the movie.  This is a cheerfully filmed comedy about child abuse, divorce, adultery, mental illness, grief, suicide and death. It's the type of movie where a trip to the dogfights is portrayed as a bonding experience.  Despite.or perhaps because of.all this, it ultimately ends up a positive comment on the endurance of family love.Twenty years ago the Tenenbaum family was famous for their string of child prodigies.  There was Chase the financial wizard, Margot the playwright and Ritchie the gifted athlete.  All had accomplished prodigious feats well before their tenth birthday but then a terrible disaster occurred. Now all have grown to be twisted, neurotic and emotionally scarred adults. The terrible disaster was their father, Royal Tenenbaum.  Royal is simply the most obnoxious excuse for a parent ever to slither across a movie screen. He's Auntie Mame gone bad.  He's a self absorbed, conniving, cheating, racist b**tard.  As the movie begins he's been kicked out of his luxury hotel suite for nonpayment of rent.  He also finds out his ex-wife is going to marry her black accountant. Both these events impinge on Royal's self interest and so he devises a scheme he hopes will rectify the situation. The movie tracks the result of his scheme and the effect it has on the wreckage of his family.Royal is a pretty unredeemable character and Gene Hackman digs into the character's miserable hide with a tangible joy. Royal so full of wormy life one can readily see why a seemingly sensible woman like Ethel Tenenbaum would not only have fallen in love with him but still be carrying a guttering torch years after she's thrown him out.  As Ethel, Angelica Huston is fully the equal of Hackman.  Ethel is someone who's been raked over the coals by a loved one and who has done her best ever since to repair the damage. Ben Stiller is perfect as Chase, still nursing childhood wounds while trying to deal with the freak death of his wife. Gwyneth Paltrow defines the word ""neurotic"" as Margot, a woman hell-bent on hiding secrets no one really cares to know.  The whole cast was exceptional and each has a moment or two where they can shine. Only Luke Wilson, as Ritchie, seemed a little too remote for a man enduring the rigors of hidden love.
Does all this sound like a lighthearted comedy? Well, yes, if you're definition of ""light hearted"" is flexible enough.  It is one of the funniest movies I've seen lately. It's not a cruel comedy like the excellent, if extremely nasty, South Park movie.  You care about the Tenenbaums even as you laugh at their foibles.  With all its darkness the movie is surprisingly sweet.  There seems no clear-cut message except, perhaps, that even the lowest, most craven SOB has potential for salvation.  Then again, perhaps the only thought was to entertain us.  That The Royal Tenenbaums does, with great style and surprising warmth.",The Royal Tenenbaums
221,adamp-6,My cackle echoed throughout the enormous theater.,10,7 January 2002,"So, it's 4:50 on a Sunday afternoon, I'm in the biggest theater in the 20-screen multiplex, and I'm having a hard time finding a seat because it's so darn crowded.  We're all going to see ""The Royal Tenenbaums"".And we all laughed our silly heads off.Man, what a masterpiece of a movie.  Perfectly cast, perfectly written, perfectly directed -- it is without flaw (save for a couple of gratuitous shots of nudity, played for comic effect).  Fortunately, it's not just a comedy -- it also has touching moments that generate real emotion and empathy, something that shan't soon be achieved in an Adam Sandler movie.Along with ""Memento"" and ""Moulin Rouge"", this is one of the best movies I've seen this year.  And it doesn't even start with the letter ""M"".",The Royal Tenenbaums
222,Jenny Ho,Prospect of classy cast fails to live up to early promise,5,26 March 2002,"At the beginning of the film, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) is living in a hotel and we learn that none of his three children want anything to do with him.  All of the Tenenbaum children were child geniuses in one way or another:  Chas (Ben Stiller) was a one-time financial whiz and is now a single parent bringing up his two sons; the adopted Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow wearing way too much mascara and eyeliner) was a promising playwright and is now married but chooses to spend most of her time locked away in a bathroom secretly smoking; and Richie (Luke Wilson), was a former tennis ace who due to an infatuation with his adopted sister, suddenly lost a crucial match and saw his career plummet.  When Royal announces that he only has six weeks left to live, it brings together all members of the family under one roof for the first time in years.  I was looking forward to the prospect of seeing this film as I had enjoyed at least one of the films which each of the cast members had been in.  There are actually very few funny moments in The Royal Tenenbaums' but the characters are amusing in their eccentricity.  Although one suspects that Richie has not played tennis since his career took a nose-dive, he still chooses to mooch around wearing a headband like John McEnroe in his younger days.  Chas and his two boys are also memorable purely because of the fact that their wardrobe throughout the film consists solely of matching red Adidas tracksuits.The film is immediately engaging as the story is told by a narrator and unfolds like chapters of a book.  This technique is very effective in quickly introducing the audience to the characters and their situation. However the downfall of the film is that it is a little slow.  I prefer my comedies to have more laughs than this and I found myself shifting in my seat halfway through the film wondering how many more chapters there were until the end.  Unfortunately, like the child geniuses of the film, The Royal Tenenbaums' fails to live up to its early promise.",The Royal Tenenbaums
223,R Becker,One From The Heart!,10,25 January 2006,"So many others have given such eloquent commentary on this extraordinary film that all I can really add is that Wes Anderson is a genius! (Not that that hasn't already been observed by others.) Anderson has a body of work that is highly literate and highly literary -- here, the novelistic quality of his movies is directly referenced on-screen -- and it's his greatest strength (among many great strengths). Anderson is a writer/director that creates whole worlds that echo our own but are very much part of his psyche, and his ideas and ideals are warmly human and thoughtful.If I had to lump Wes Anderson with anybody else (which would be a crime), I'd put him with Charlie Kaufman (BEING JOHN MALKOVICH) and the Coen Brothers (THE HUDSUCKER PROXY). Gentler than the Coens, more hopeful than Kaufman, he nevertheless shares these other directors' secret status as modern fantasists: None of them are *called* fantasy filmmakers, but that's what they are.Of course, the entire cast of THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS turn in crackerjack performances (though Ben Stiller is a bit stiff), Mark Mothersbaugh creates an evocative and quirky score, and even Alec Baldwin does a solid job of narration. Standouts include Danny Glover for the pivotal role of Henry Sherman and Angelica Huston, as well as the ever-excellent Gene Hackman.A funny, smart, offbeat movie!",The Royal Tenenbaums
224,Marty-G,fantastic,9,22 December 2001,"Very funny, exquisitely acted, and beautifully filmed. It also has its moments of poignancy. It is intelligent filmmaking that works on a number of different levels. It's also one of the only movies I've come out of from the theater this year, not feeling the need to analyze and dissect... it's as if everything in the film works so well and completely, it totally satisfied and entertained, providing me with an almost-perfect movie-going experience... and that doesn't happen very often. Go see it.",The Royal Tenenbaums
225,deadkerouac,Anderson's best work to date,9,30 December 2001,"THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is this year's best film. At least, the best film I've seen all year, which says a lot, considering it's December and I've seen many films this year alone. Wes Anderson continues his ""quirky"" (I hate to use this term with him, but it fits) look at life, first explored in the marvelous BOTTLE ROCKET and the charming RUSHMORE. The title family consists of disbarred lawyer Royal (Gene Hackman in what should be an Oscar-nominated performance), whose mooching ways led his kids astray--at least from him. He is unofficially divorced--for twenty-odd years--from archaeologist wife Etheline (Angelica Huston, very wonderful in all her, albeit few, scenes) and has been living in a hotel suite--littered with Encyclopedia Brittanica and dated suits--for at least three years. When he is kicked out of his suite for not paying his hotel bills, Royal returns home, pretending to be dying from stomach cancer.The children--introduced as child prodigies, with The Beatles' ""Hey Jude"" playing in the background and Alec Baldwin narrating (his narration, throughout the film, is essential, his voice raspy and distinctive)--have outgrown their genius diapers. Chas (Ben Stiller, somewhat wasted but still funny) was the financial wizard of the family. He still is successful, but the loss of his wife in a plane crash has made him very protective of his sons Ari and Uzi (Grant Rosenmeyer and Jonah Meyerson). He even insists that they don smaller versions of the red track suit their father wears. He is the one most resentful of his father, who once shot him in the hand with a BB rifle when he was a child (the BB is still lodged between the knuckles). Richie (Luke Wilson) is a former tennis phenom who suffered a career-ending defeat at the hands of an opponent named ""Gandhi."" He also has a secret infatuation with Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), his adopted sister, as seen in the younger Richie's numerous portraits of her (and the fact that they once ran away together as children). Margot is a zombie-like ex-playwright who suffered the most under Royal, whom always made it clear that she was adopted, and, sadly, was very critical of her work, regardless of her age. She dabbles in smoking, watching TV in the bathroom for six hours straight, and avoiding her anthropologist husband Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray, always funny anywhere, even if his age is showing), whose latest case study involves a very peculiar nerd.Hackman shines here, especially in his snide comments, many of them directed toward Chas and Margot, who seem bitter at him (and who can blame them?). Upon learning that Chas' wife is buried in the same cemetery his late mother is buried in, Royal smirks, ""We'll swing by her grave too."" But Royal wants to change--possibly. His way to Chas' heart is through Chas' boys, and in one bravado touch, Anderson further intensifies the film's Seventies look (though lacking the grittiness, the film is set and filmed in an unspecified part of New York, the location of most Seventies films) when Royal approaches the boys near a rooftop jungle gym. The closeups remind us instantly of 1971's THE FRENCH CONNECTION, a film that earned Hackman his Best Actor Oscar. The exteriors are purely New York, a perpetually snowy and cold, yet sunny, NYC, unfazed by the goings-on at the Tenenbaum household.The lesser characters do well. Danny Glover as Henry Sherman, Etheline's current suitor, is fine and lovable, especially when he verbally spars with Royal--or, really, when he defends Royal's many quips. Kumar Pallana, an Anderson fixture since his amusing turns as Kumar the safecracker in BOTTLE ROCKET and Mr. Littlejeans the caretaker in RUSHMORE, plays Pagoda, the family's longtime butler, with the right amount of naivete and wholesomeness. Owen Wilson (who co-wrote the script with college buddy Anderson, as he had done with the previous films) is one of the film's funniest characters, Eli Cash, the family's neighbor from across the street. Once a quiet child in a red dinner jacket, he has grown up into a novelist, complete in Western wardrobe, and assistant professor of English Literature at Brooks College. His first novel was a dud called ""Wildcat,"" which was written in an ""obsolete vernacular""; his latest, ""Old Custer,"" as he notes, ""presupposes"" whether Custer really died at Little Big Horn, which he also acknowledges as fact. This is a man who has stacks of pornographic videotapes, dozens of cannibis plants, and paintings of hooligans with white facepaint on motorcycles in his apartment. Look also for Seymour Cassel (memorable as Max Fischer's father in RUSHMORE) as Royal's pal Dusty, an elevator operator at the hotel who later poses, in a witty scene, as his doctor.Anderson continues with the lively colors and soft guitar riffs that made his first two films quietly affecting. Baldwin's narration, along with cut scenes of the film's fictitious novel and the opening sentences of each chapter (though some of us may want to buy the hardcover version anyway), make the film thoroughly enjoyable for most viewers. While diehard Anderson fans (such as myself) may consider BOTTLE ROCKET his magnum opus, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS doesn't disappoint until the second half, when the Richie-Margot storyline slows the momentum. But the film ends on a (basically) happy note, and you leave the theater feeling content about how you spent your afternoon. I, for one, cannot wait for the next Anderson/Wilson feature. 9/10",The Royal Tenenbaums
226,Adpag,One line summary of this film? I can't do that.,9,27 August 2002,"Once again director Wes Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson have assembled a cast of slightly left-of-centre characters and turned out a brilliant ensemble piece. Like the same team's earlier Rushmore, the whole thing has a feel that you can't quite put your finger on but which sets it apart from just about everything else today. Rushmore improves on every viewing, and I suspect this will too. I am writing this a couple of days after first viewing and I can't wait to see it again.The cast in this story of a family at war with itself, from leads to smaller parts, is uniformly excellent but if I had to pick one out it would be Gwyneth Paltrow  I'm not normally a fan of hers but in this I found her almost totally unrecognisable. The soundtrack too, mainly 60s and 70s hits, is once again a standout  whereas lesser film makers seem to throw any old hit onto a soundtrack and hope it fits, Anderson gets the perfect one every time. Unique and unmissable.",The Royal Tenenbaums
227,Latheman-9,Postmodernist navel-gazing.,4,1 April 2003,"After reading the most recent 100 comments for ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" it's clear that this is a movie that one loves or hates, with little room for the middle ground. For me, watching this film was what I imagine watching a very long, very bad ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch would be like.Far from being subtle, nuanced, or understated, the acting of most of the players was as transparent as a vacuum. There are, among others, Ben Stiller (""Hey! I'm angry!""), Gwyneth Paltrow (""Hello. I'm depressed.""), Luke Wilson (""Hi. I'm wallowing in the despair of a secret, unrequited love.""), and Owen Wilson (""Hey there. Not only do I act in this movie, but I co-wrote and co-produced it as well. Am I talented or what?!""). Gene Hackman does a solid job in the role of Royal Tenenbaum, but by being surrounded by these others, his performance appears better than it really is. Anjelica Huston, Danny Glover, and Bill Murray are along for the ride, going through the motions as they wait for more suitable vehicles to which they can hitch their flagging careers.The writing suffers from trying to convey too many things: humor, angst, ennui, anger, affection, etc. The result is an inchoate teratoma of a script that can't decide what it wants to be. If co-writer/director Anderson were trying to make a film redolent with dark humor, he should have asked Todd Solondz for advice. If he were aiming for irony, then he would have done well to have given Jim Jarmusch a call. For a film about people living ""lives of quiet desperation,"" Mike Leigh is your man. After seeing ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and the also critically acclaimed ""Rushmore,"" I must say that Wes Anderson is well on his way to being the most over-hyped director since Steven Soderbergh.This film will be best appreciated by twenty-somethings and precocious teenagers who believe they 'get it' better than anyone else, whatever 'it' may be (Life, the Universe, and Everything). And judging from many of the comments, that appears to be be the right demographic. I find it telling that many who thought this to be an excellent film feel a need to heap abuse on those who would disagree. Rating: 4/10.",The Royal Tenenbaums
228,callaway76,Estranged Wes Anderson's Best Yet,9,17 July 2003,"I first saw this movie expecting a comedy, like many others. With a end to end cast of Hollywood's finest I knew there would have to be some redeeming qualities in this estranged film. About half-way through I realized that this was no comedy, rather a dramatic tale of social development in a disfunctional American family. By the time the movie ended I was left with my 'Chi' disturbed. I knew I liked the movie but could not seem to know why. Later when I realized the prestigious film company 'The Criterion Collection' put this movie on their 'A' list of DVD's, I decided to buy it and re-evaluate. The second time through I realized this was one of the finest original dramas I have ever seen. Granted, it has its funny moments but they are painted with a dark brush. Wes Anderson is an odd bird. He places much faith in melodramatics and creates what almost rolls off as British humor. On paper his ideas may almost seem like a passage from a diary in a mental institute, yet with the help of Owen Wilson he manages to create a unique blend between cartoonish story telling and social realism. In all he manages to engross and entice the audience (even though half the time we think to ourselves 'Why am I watching this movie?'). New to the trade he has made each movie with meticulous accuracy allowing plot and character development to slowly bloom. By the time you see the whole flower, you feel as if you have witnessed a small piece of life unfolding.Regardless, he is an odd bird and his movies are not intended for all audiences. Those who prefer the overly processed Hollywood movies (available in Sharp, Monterey or Swiss) will undoubtedly criticize this movie. Those with a taste for the exotic in film making will delight in this clever blend of Storybook sets, witty conversations, and only the finest acting allowed in today's films.",The Royal Tenenbaums
229,Theoron,Above and beyond anything else out there.,10,6 August 2002,"I usually have no problem rating 99% of the movies I see.  ""Das Boot"" is a '10', the ""Thomas and the Magic Railroad"" is a '1,' and lots of others fall in between.   But then, every so often, I come across a film that is beyond my ability to score.  It's as if rating the movie, no matter what number I gave it, would somehow be demeaning --more so towards myself than the film. ""Being John Malkovich"" was unratable, as was ""Microcosmos,"" ""The Graduate,"" and a handful of others.  Well, I've just added ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" to my list of films that defy my ability to rate them.I could tell you about the plot, but why bother?  It's not really all that important.  What is important is that Wes Anderson goes above and beyond the tremendous truck load of garbage that Hollywood dumps on us each year, and gives us something that actually makes us use our brains.  Those who have been living the unexamined life will find this film boring and pointless, and will hate it.  Those who rightly discern the cesspool that is modern film making will see this film, will also find it boring and pointless, then stand-up and cheer!  Why?  Because every single stinking film that comes out of Hollywood is boring and pointless, but they try ever so hard to be ""meaningful.""  Here's a film the revels in extolling the virtues of nothingness, and never pretends to represent anything even remotely close to having a meaning.This film has one of the most amazing ensemble casts ever assembled in modern times.  Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Danny Glover and Bill Murray all very willingly take part in this boring, pointless film.  Why did they do it?  Couldn't they read the script and see how stupid the whole thing was?  Yes, they read the script, they saw the stupidity, and they JUMPED at the chance to play some small part in it. They weren't prodded or cajoled or bribed into making this film, and I think some of them would have gladly paid Wes Anderson to be in it.We are ""outsiders"" whose only connection to Hollywood is throwing money at the box office to see the next multi-million dollar summer blockbuster.  We want to be entertained, damn it, and you clowns in California better get it right!  More often then not, they do, and we get to watch such cinematic masterpieces like ""Scooby Doo"" and ""Gold Member.""  But when you're inside of the Hollywood system, you get to see all the sewage which spews forth onto the big screen for what it truly is: crap.  But of course the unspoken rule is that you NEVER say it's crap, instead you speak of the artistry, the meaning, the wonder that is a Hollywood film, but deep down you know it just another load of excrement for the masses.Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, though a million miles away from being anything close to a Hollywood insiders, understands that Hollywood is the King of Crap.  It's not really all that difficult to figure out, but it does require some careful thought, examination, and critical thinking --skills which most Americans simply do not have.  (More honestly, they do have those skills, just choose not to use them.)  So Wes and Owen concoct a film that flaunts nothingness, but in doing so becomes something.
""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is not a side-splitting comedy, it is not a special-effects extravaganza, nor is it an action-adventure.  It is not any category of movie that currently exists.  Well, there is this category I call the ""comedy of the absurd,"" and that's probably the best label you can give it.  If there is a point to this film, it is that life is pointless, and making films about it is even more so.  Certainly this is a rather pessimistic take on things, but it is an honest viewpoint of the writer and director.  They go out of their way to avoid anything that might make this film ""meaningful.""  It just isn't there!  Life is absurd, pointless, meaningless, a joke.  The only character in this film who sees it in this light is Royal Tenenbaum himself, but he does not arrive at this conclusion through careful thought and analysis, but rather by the complete avoidance of anything even remotely close to self-examination.  He's very happily, carelessly living the unexamined life, while the rest of the family does their darndest to make ""something"" of themselves, and fail miserably.
Not only does this film speaking to the absurdity of life, but it is also a poke in the eye of Hollywood.  That's why the film critics, actors and directors love this film while most of the public can't stand it.  It is the ultimate ""in"" joke.  To us, Hollywood is some magic fairyland where magicians wave their magic wands and produce fantastic entertainment that transports us to different times and places.  To those who work there, it is a meat grinder and a whore house, but one that pays extremely well.The performances that the actors gave in this film where some of the best I've ever seen in any film.  Gene Hackman is fantastic, and Gwyneth Paltrow is amazing.  I've never seen the two of them shine so brightly.  All the other cast members give equally brilliant performances, but Hackman and Paltrow have the meatier roles, and make the most of it.Please, don't see this film.

Not only is your newest film a critical success but you get one of the all time best casts in Hollywood history fairly inexpensively.  That said, I ventured in to ""The Royal Tenenbaum's"" with huge expectations of a four-star film and found myself walking out with some disappointment.  When your able to get an all-star cast as Anderson did, your going to inevitably leave someone out somehow.  Somewhat disappointing was the fact that Gene Hackman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Luke Wilson were given ample running room, while Angelica Huston and Bill Murray languished in the back-burner.  This is not to say that ""The Royal Tenenbaum's was not excellent.  Ben Stiller and his sons were incredibly hilarious in their red sweatsuits (did they ever take them off??) and this is Gene Hackman's best performance ever (I never admired Unforgiven or The French Connection much).  The setting of the film (That funny little house) was also well-done. However, Angelica Huston doesn't get much work now that she's older and I would have loved for her to have more scenes and something else to do besides make cracks about her sometimes husband.  The ending was a little too conventional for my taste but all in all, this film was very well done and merits a DVD purchase.

Hackman won awards for his performance?? He is playing, as, for me he always does, Gene Hackman, but just dressed up rather oddly.Bill Murray should have played the part. No character development anywhere in sight. Gwyneth was wasted, Stiller played himself. Filling a movie with actors and then making it look as though they were all playing their parts in different rooms,(and in some cases, different countries.)does not work for me. It looked as if the cast were embarrassed much of the movie. Murray in particular wondering,""What am I doing in this?"" My verdict? A pretentious mess.

He does have a knack for making a two hour film seem like a threehour film, but I don't mind, because I'm completely enthralledthrough the entire length. The writing is what makes WesAnderson's films stand out from most of the other tripe that spewsout of Hollywood every year. When you combine this great writingwith a superb cast, talented acting, perfect direction andcinematography, and a music score that hits all the rightnotes...well...you can't really go wrong, can you?This film practices ""subtlety"", which is something you won't findwith most films, today.

237,jghbrown,Some people never can let go,7,5 March 2006,"I guess everyone gets something unique from a movie, and perhaps the hallmark of a great movie is that it can be interpreted in different ways. I'll say right off that I didn't find it all that wildly amusing  it's perhaps too true to life for that. However, I did find it touching. In places.Judging from the comments I have seen so far, the rogue in the piece is Royal himself, who is seen to be selfish and somewhat uncaring as a father. Royal deserted his family and now look what's happened.I don't see it this way at all. I see Royal as the only refreshing person in the family and the only hope for their salvation. He left them because he got sick of them. They were all high-achievers, egged on by their high-achieving mother. Not surprisingly, they burned themselves out and are suffering the consequences of it, each in their own way. They have one thing in common  none had a real childhood.Royal opted out of it. No doubt fed up with the pressures of being a high-achiever himself, he holed himself up in a hotel room with his encyclopedias and enjoyed the childhood which he had had stolen from him. Now he wants to give that childhood back to his family.However, he is too late  they are too set in their ways. The only one who moves forward somewhat from his time-frozen state is Richie, but he can't cope with the consequences. Chaz is an a**hole, who is set to destroy the lives of his young sons through a life of regimentation and high-pressure. Royal sees the dangers and tries to rescue them (notice how he first talks to them through the mesh of a ""cage""), but is thwarted. Margot is on the path to suicide herself. She is clearly beyond redemption. Hard-nosed Etheline sails on regardless, but she has given up love for financial security.For me, this movie is not so much about holding on as letting go. Royal let himself go and his life was so much the better for it. He wanted his family too do so as well, but they couldn't. They just couldn't.",The Royal Tenenbaums
238,dbn3,Too Irritating to Be Likeable (5/10),5,28 September 2002,"[I saw this on DVD, YMMV]This movie starts out very slowly.  There is a droning narration over a long sequence that introduces us (very slowly) to all the Tenenbaums (Royal and Ethel; their children Chas, Margot, and Richie; and a wannabe, Eli Cash) and their past.  Not satisfied with that, the movie starts over again to introduce each of the characters to us again (very slowly) as they are 22 years later.  Its an irritatingly long setup for a weak payoff.Nothing about this film is particularly funny.  The attempt at slapstick when Henry Sherman (Danny Glover) falls into a hole falls as flat as Sherman does.Nothing about this film is particularly dramatic.  Anderson cannot bring himself to write a true bastard of a man.  Instead he keeps placing Royal Tenenbaum into situations where is just a likeable, selfish boob.The characters are so flat and frigid that the incesteous relationship between Richie and Margot seems surreal.  There is no passion on either part.  There is nothing but a connection to the past when they ran away together as children.One part that works is the music.  I was pulled into the movie as Richie changes his appearance deliberately and dramatically while Elliot Smith's _Needle in the Hay_ floats in the air.  But I started to get irritated again as the complete flatness of the characters continued.I am not from a divorced family.  Perhaps Wes Anderson is relying on people to supply reasons for the odd actions of the Tenenbaum children from their own experience.  Reading other reviews here seem to suggest that intimate experience with divorce helps in connecting with this film.",The Royal Tenenbaums
239,jlangbert,Possibly the worst movie ever,1,7 August 2002,"Did I see the same movie that everyone else rated so highly?  This is a tragic waste of a talented cast.  The plot, if you could call it that, was plodding.  The storyline, uninteresting.  The characters, one-dimensional. Actually, make that zero-dimensional.  I can't say what happened at the end, as I fell asleep after an hour of the torture of trying to stay awake.  This movie makes a monotone Yom Kippur service sermon seem entertaining.  Bill Murray is one of my favorite actors of all time, and I will forgive him for this mistake.  Maybe he just needed the money.",The Royal Tenenbaums
240,aplato,"Dull, predictable, pretentious",4,19 July 2002,"The Royal Tenenbaums was marketed as a quirky, comic look at a family of prodigies and geniuses. I found that this movie had the same fundamental problems that director Wes Anderson's other train wreck, Rushmore, had: an absurd and overwhelming sense of its own quirkiness. This movie begs you to acknowledge and marvel at its ""strange"" behavior. I find this very annoying and somewhat pretentious. As if the Anderson, is so desperate for the fawning admiration of Cannes Festival attendees, that he made sure to slow down and point out all the ""cool spots"" in his work. Like a bad musician who replays his few moments of decent performance, over and over again. What is additionally frustrating is that the actors all do a very good job. Gene Hackman is, as always, phenomenal. Even Gwyneth Paltrow, whom I usually dislike, embodies her role exceptionally well. However, like Rushmore, the fine acting is cast inside a rather banal and ridiculous script. I didn't really care much about these people, and found most of them simply annoying. Moreover, we're told repeatedly what geniuses these people are, but we never see them actually behave like geniuses. We're expected to just accept them as such. I don't like that. If you're going to embody your characters with superpowers, you had better show them exercising them, at least once.  As such, all we see is these geniuses spiraling into obsessive compulsive behavior and psychotic neurosis. 
Furthermore, I did not find this movie very funny at all. The funniest character was Danny Glover and his nerdy, unsure of himself suitor of Ethiline Tenenbaum. The only scene that made me laugh was when Glover's character suddenly falls into a pit at an archaeological dig. It was a bright spot of simple, slapstick humor among a sea of pretentious grandstanding. Ignore the reviews on this one. It's dumb. Save your money, go rent something good like Donnie Darko.",The Royal Tenenbaums

I can't really see what the fuss is about.  As a comedy, Tenenbaums simply didn't make me laugh.  At all.  I didn't even know what I was supposed to laugh at.  As a drama, the story was mildly interesting.   The characters were pretty flat, though, and really didn't do anything to make care a bit what happened to them.Great actors, especially the always great Huston, and Luke Wilson had some moments.  Gwenyth Paltrow has depth, but again, in this film her character seemed one-dimensional.  All I can guess, is that like the music of Tenacious D, and the films of Guy Ritchie, the hipsters amongst us have decided that Wes Anderson is cool, and his material is vague enough that these people can claim that there's more going on than actually is.There isn't.  Zoolander is 10 times the comedy this thing is.  I'm giving it a 4 to offset the dopes that gave it a 10.  6 is probably more fair.",The Royal Tenenbaums

244,watchhawk,humerous but stale,7,4 April 2002,"I am surprised by the raving critics this movie has gotten.  An estranged father of three tries to come together with his family after 22 years of neglect.  Gene Hackman plays the father convincingly and that's it.  The rest of the crew except perhaps Anjelica Huston as the mother and Danny Glover as her fiancé do a decent job.  Ben Stiller as on of the siblings is energetic as always but his part ends up being very stereotypic and almost boring.  There are a lot of good ideas in this movie since the surroundings and expressions tell the story and the jokes as much as the said word but things are predictable and often the cinematography is downright clumsy. Although a comedy this movie has a meaningful undertone and seems to be about forgiveness and family values.  There are all kinds of hidden messages, e.g. the kids wear the same childish clothes their whole life (except the daughter who secretly has been smoking for 22 years) that might be a expression of halted maturity since childhood or what ever.  Perhaps it was just for fun but got boring.  Gene Hickman's character got to change clothes at least and was quite funny in his elevator warden.  All kind of characters are introduced to the story in the beginning in a rather lame way although not altogether unfunny. Gwyneth Palthrow as the adopted sister never rises up to be funny, ever in the whole film and puts a depressing face to the whole story.  Her kinky love affairs never rise to be funny or giving any meaning to the picture.  Gene Hackman carries this movie on his shoulders throughout along with his faithful family servant Pagoda played memorably and intuitively by Kumar Pollana.  In a way this movie reminds me of the French movie Emilé but it (this one) pales in the comparison.  This movie is too stereotypic and slow to ever rise to the hall of fame in comedy, but if the director keeps trying, something good might come out of it later.  7/10",The Royal Tenenbaums
245,Nikos7,Pretentious non-comedy,5,24 March 2002,"I was horrified to see the average rating in imdb for this film. Although I usually strike right in the middle of the public's ratings I think that this one is a totally overrated film. I wouldn't have bothered writing a comment on it if the rating was lower but now I feel the need to warn the potential viewer about it. This is one of those pretentious films that have emerged lately and which try to emulate comedy but... taking it to a (supposedly) higher level. A local leftist film-critic loved it because it actually shows that Americans are not all as happy as the media would want us to believe (or something like that...). Wow! How smart!Let's face it people. A comedy is supposed to make you laugh. If it doesn't , it's not a comedy - at least not a good one. A few funny moments, a set of oddball characters and a very good set of songs from the 60's and 70's do not necessarily make a good comedy nor a good film. In this case, they make a long, long set of scenes that never ever manages to take off.

On a more personal level I've no idea why i continued to watch it, even when it was clear that the plot line was not going to develop into something more interesting.The story follows the return of Gene Hackman's character, Royal Tenenbaum, to the family home, by weasling his way back into his estranged wife's aquaintance with a claim that he's dying. There's a lot of voice over work, with broad sweeps of the narator's brush cutting through the family history, something that continues right until the end.All the family children return home too, by one way or another, plus there is the family friend ""Eli Cash"" played by Owen Wilson. The dysfunctional aspects of the family can the  be explored (Oh how novel), with Gene Hackman's caracter being revealed as a lying, cheating, busted ex-lawyer; Ben Stiller is an over-achieving widower who lost his wife in a plane crash & who has look alike kids who's lives he's screwing up too; Gwyneth Paltrow is a disaffected daughter who's never adjusted to her adoption into the family; Luke Wilson drifts along as the ex-tennis pro & Anjelica Huston stars as Mrs Tenenbaum, the only member of the family to show any signs of being reasonably well adjusted.There's sub plots, twists & avenues along the way, but in reality it's all so limp wristed that it fails to hold your interest for long. It's not that important messages are lost under a veil of subtlety, the narrator holds the audience's hand far to firmly for that to happen, it's rather that nothing really happens.This is no more than a cheap TV drama, dressed up with a big budget, given a slight (& I do mean SLIGHT!) comic twist & sent scurrying off to the big screen by way of an all star cast.To be fair there are a few comic moments, best of all with Danny Glover falling down a trench as he walks alongside Huston. This scene is well done, but it's been seen a thousand times before since the days of silent films. As for the druggy Owen Wilson's appearance with his crazilly painted face that was enough to raise a smile, but that's about it.Ben Stiller can usually make me laugh, but not this time, as he didn't seem to get much chance to use his comedic talents. Gwyneth Paltrow played such a disipated character that she was almost forgettable & might as easily been invisible. Luke WIlson's failed tennis pro also just seemed to drift around the screen, as if lost, which just about summed up the matter for me. They all just drifted around.Bill Murray was a surprise, sporting a greying beard & glasses he seemed uncannily like Salmand Rushdie! You can tell it's getting desperate when it's something like that generates interest.All in all what this film was about baffles me. Family reconciliation.. so what, it's been done a thousand times before, done better & far cheaper too, no doubt. My advice is to avoid this dog.",The Royal Tenenbaums

The father, Royal,  is a egoist and cynical play boy that leave the family for running  his vices, the sons grow up and retinue to various disappointments have lost all of his quality and safety. Many years later Royal would  back to home because he is heavily sick and ready to die. Nobody of his familiars would believed he, but it's true? At first sight the movie start as a comedy of the high society, for the serious also the rich cry, but during the developed it's ever more clear the impossibility of the happiness, and how it's true this better feeling. The movie put extraordinary people in ordinary trouble and understand we that the life is hard for all, and above all the money not do the happiness, and that the people going accept for who are without think too them bad quality, but exalting them quality. Wes Anderson, the director is one of  the most original filmmaker and his way to see the life is touched and laughter at the same time and the laughter is ever better and reflective, but all of above the choice of the players is extremely hit on , each of them are excellent. In the leading role of the Royal we found Gene Hackman in great shape as a adorable rascal and rightly winners to the `Golden Globe', while in the character of his sons there are Ben Stiller as the finance genius, that had to little time lost his wife, Gwyneth Paltrow  as the adoptive daughter comedy-writer married unhappily with the psychology Relaight S. Clair(Bill murray that inspired the character on the Business Man that in play in `Rushmore', but with less efficacy) and Luke Wilson as the sporting promises of the Tennis, desperately fall in love to his adoptive sister, eventually Owen Wilson as the complex neighbour.

It is not as much of a comedy as I thought it was going to be, but I still enjoyed it very much. There are some 'normal' funny parts but also subtle humorous situations and dialog which turn out great. The movie is much more than that though...it's hard to explain. There's a lot of great stuff here: an big great cast, excellent script & direction, a lot of connections and detail, it's pretty amazing. I love how it's all because of Royal (who's sort of the bad guy) that everyone's problems and secrets come to light after all this time, which in turn let's them help their own and each others problems there by making all their lives better. It's because of Royal getting them all back together. It's different, a little weird and definitely not a typical played out story. I suggest you watch it yourself and see if enjoy it. I give it 7 stars out of 10. (sometimes I think it deserves more,..sometimes I don't. I just can't decide, so I'll stick with a 7*'s.Recommendation: Ghost World (2001). Not that these two movies are related much, if at all. I happened to enjoy very much and rate it higher than The Royal Tenenbaums.

250,fuldamobil,Absolutely beautiful,10,15 December 2001,This is without a doubt the most enjoyable movie experience I have had in ten years. A beautiful fairy tale of family and a love letter to a New York that exists only in dreams and movies. See it more than once. Wes Anderson has become THE American auteur. He is truly a filmmaker unlike any other. There is not a false note in this story of an American family of geniuses whose father tears them apart and then brings them back together.,The Royal Tenenbaums
251,AP-Project,Yada yada,5,6 November 2002,"I'm not one of those people who believes that if a director made one excellent movie, then all of his future films must also be considered pure genius.  Wes Anderson is an example of this phenomenon. This movie, the Royal Tenenbaums, lacks depth and lacks soul. The characters, as others have said on this forum, are mere caricatures of real people. The children of Royal Tenenbaum seem to represent all the worst qualities of young people associated with the ""slacker"" generation. Selfishness, venality, hedonism, egomania, egocentrism and more are seen here in the younger cast members. By contrast, Royal Tenenbaum  (who Anderson inexplicably calls the ""villain"" in his DVD commentary) comes across as a flawed, but friendly and down-to-earth guy.  Gene Hackman makes this movie worth watching, but that's the only reason to watch.  I'd watch him read from the phone booth and that might be an improvement over this movie. What could have made this better? Look at Rushmore, which is a true masterpiece of story-telling.  There, the whole story is funny and intriguing because we see the Schwartzbaum character displaying his genius throughout his childhood and we believe he is gifted in some way.  Sometimes his genius is manipulating people, but in an earnest way.  He has a manic energy which is infectious, which contrasts sharply to the droopy slackers in Royal Tenenbaums. Supposedly, the children of Royal Tenenbaum are geniuses also, but that part of the character development  (a crucial part) is given the yada yada treatment and I never accepted these children (now adults) as once possessing genius or charm or precocity. They just seem to be ciphers.  Now the movie wants to make a statement that divorce takes a toll on children, but that would be a dramatic theme which seems beyond the scope of this comedic film.  Also, as drama, it's not very convincing because, once again, we never learned to like Royal's children at any point during the story.  Also, much of their suffering seems self-induced and part of a strategy to shift the blame (to their father) for personal failures so as to avoid taking responsibility for themselves. As always, Gene Hackman is excellent to watch as a craftsman, but he deserved a better movie than this.  I wanted to love this movie just as I loved Rushmore.  However, this one didn't make the grade. For Hackman's performance only, I give the Royal Tenenbaums 5 out of 10 stars.",The Royal Tenenbaums
252,Masoo,Very clever; so what?,6,23 February 2002,"The Royal Tenenbaums is a clever movie with a fine performance from one of my favorite actors, Gene Hackman. Other than saying it's clever, though, I'm not sure what else I can add. It's not a movie about people with quirks; it's a movie about quirks masquerading as people. When Gene Hackman's character is redeemed, it's not so much unbelievable as un-earned. The film might have been better if Bill Murray, relatively subdued in his minor part, had played Hackman's character and rejected redemption.As an example of how director Wes Anderson is clever to no apparent purpose, I point to the soundtrack, which is a wonderful melange of mostly-60s buried treasures like ""These Days"" by Nico and ""She Smiled Sweetly"" by the Stones. (He even throws in a cut from Dylan's Self Portrait; what is this s***, indeed.) While each song is welcome in my house any time, their purpose in the movie is never clear. They're good songs, and their lyrics generally fit the scenes in which they appear, but why a movie taking place in 2001 would use minor classics of the 60s is left unexplained. It does show Anderson's good taste in music, and perhaps that's it: everything about The Royal Tenenbaums demonstrates the excellence of the filmmakers, but precious little convinces me I'm watching a movie that lives up to that excellence.",The Royal Tenenbaums
253,mreisman,Ambitious and trifling at the same time,7,20 August 2002,"I'm torn on this one.  I really like movies that have a crystal clear idea of what they want to look and sound like, and I respect Wes Anderson for giving us a very beautifully artistic movie -- it's much more polished than Rushmore, which I liked very much.  Its greatest strength is its STYLE; Royal Tenenbaums is stylized down to every detail, including the 70's soundtrack, the sparingly clever dialogue, the locations which say New York without ever actually saying ""New York"", the characteristic clothes each character wears:  Gwyneth's izod dresses, Ben Stiller's Adidas workout suits, Danny Glover's old-fashioned suits.  But at the same time, the style is its weakness; Anderson only treats his subject matter and his characters superficially.  This bothers me mostly in retrospect -- I know I was smiling while I was watching this movie, and I was admiring what Anderson was giving us and not hung up on what he wasn't.  So on the one hand, I can't give it a negative review, because it is fun to watch, but on the other hand there's that ""So what?"" feeling you get after you've seen it.",The Royal Tenenbaums

I do not want to sound like I'm beating a dead bush here but there actually is a certain kind of humor that some people just do not get, it happens all the time when I go to movies. People look at me like I'm on something that I laughed at a certain part of a movie. I've actually been told to quiet down or been told directly, ""That's not funny."" This is what I felt when I went to see this movie, like I was in some exclusive group that knew what was going on... I'll put people into two catagories (which I hate to do), those that laugh at episodes of 'Friends', and those that laugh at life itself.Oh, and if you hear someone laughing in the theater and you are not, keep your comments to yourself.

255,jmoneyg,The Royal Tenenbaums is a Royal treat...,10,14 January 2002,"First of all, this movie is not going to be hysterically funny to everyone. The quirky characters and odd situations they find themselves in can be laugh at loud funny to some, but leaves others saying, ""What are they laughing at?"" I was part of the group laughing hysterically. (Especially at the ATV's in the background on one scene, but I'll save that for you...) This is a story about a family growing up, shall I say, dysfunctionally?No, I'd rather not say that because I'd love to be a part of this ""Dysfunctional"" family as one character 'Eli Cash' so desperately wanted. They each have that something that makes me want to get to know them, and not just for their accomplishments. Royal, the patron of the family is a crass old guy who tells it like it is, ""Isn't there another body around here?"" Ethel, the matron of the family, is a sweet lady who has had her share of suters. Chas and Richie, the sons of Ethel and Royal, are child prodigies in the field of finance and tennis respectively. Margot, the adopted daughter of the Tenebaums, an acclaimed playwrite at an early age, started smoking at 12. Eli Cash, the next-door-neighbor, want's to be a Tenebaum and practically is. Three more characters you will come to love are Pagoda; Royal's assistant with a thing for stabbing, Raliegh St. Clair; Margot's husband and psychologist, and Dudley; Raliegh's hilarious patient with excellent hearing and color blindness. Unlike the Wes Anderson films before Tenenbaums, this one does not sink into a lull. The movie moves foward and keeps you laughing from start to finish. It's easily on my top five movies of the year.

There is relatively little I can say about The Royal Tenenbaums that will do it justice, so I urge you to see it.There was literally nothing about this elegant, subtle, subversive comedy which was bad. Casting was splendid, with Owen and Luke Wilson taking the crowns as the boyhood friends with serious baggage. Cinematography of a damp, decaying New York was gorgeous. Soundtrack was fabulously eclectic, encompassing many of the records in my own collection, taking me completely by surprise. The script, though - gentle, funny and ultimately revealing - was the real star. The humour is extremely left-field. I laughed out loud in the cinema, only to stifle my chuckles because no-one else seemed to be laughing. Royal's casual racism towards Glover's character is painfully acute, but terribly, terribly funny.The story is not original, concerning the redemption of a selfish man through the love of his family, but the structure and delivery is totally unique. I was transfixed throughout. I have rarely enjoyed ANYTHING as much as this movie.I simply cannot understand why so many reviewers hated this movie. Perhaps the humour was too dark, or the action too limited, or the music too retro, or the costumes too 70s. Whatever, it was all glorious to me.One of the finest films of the last 20 years.

Even with an all star cast of comedians (Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, and Danny Glover), this movie ceased to make me laugh.  Perhaps the man in the ticket booth had a chuckle at how much I paid to see this movie. Not only was it a poor comedy, it was also a boring drama.

Sure I chuckled here and there, but I think for a majority of people who are looking for a comedy, will be sorely disappointed.Gene Hackman's performance was pretty good.

For me, ""Bottle Rocket,"" ""Rushmore,"" and now ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" have each successfully pulled off the seemingly impossible: exceeding all expectations and elevating imaginative storytelling to lofty heights.  Wes Anderson is one of my favorite filmmakers not because his films are my favorites, but because each sublimely satisfies AND leaves me craving the next helping.Every character in Tenenbaums is blessed with a ludicrous past and an extraordinary future, with enough present peculiarities to keep the mass ensemble as inseparable as family.  The Canterbury Tales-approach to the story serves to focus our attentions on the individual characters and performances, but particularly to the profilmic details (set decoration (watch for the underwear art on the wall; it changes), wardrobe (beards for everyone!), and what's the deal with all those beat-up taxicabs?! Inexplicably hilarious.)  If I have one complaint, it's that overall, the sheer volume of material smothered some of emotional attachment I was looking for: by the end, I had less invested in what happened to everyone, though I trusted the story to reach an inevitably satisfying conclusion.

A clue. As one positive reviewer said, it balances on a knife edge between comedy and sadness. That's it in a nutshell. This doesn't necessarily make it a dark comedy; on the contrary, I found a lot of things to celebrate about dysfunctional families. This movie was funny, sweet, and sad; tweaked just right with Anderson's semi-skewed view of the world. If you can't appreciate that, then I feel sorry for you. To call this movie bad, however, just pegs you as...clueless.** Minor Spoilers ** Anderson & Wilson just keep getting better. I love Anderson's ability to compound an emotional scene with music. He carefully fits in the soundtrack in the most precise moments, it's beautiful. Consider the scene where Margot and Ritchie meet at the bus station with close up shots and Nico's ""These Days"" as a backdrop. I mean, I hate Nico's music, but it works here. Same goes with Nike Drake's ""Fly"" and Elliot Smiths ""Needle in the Hay"". Everything clicks.  I love the detail that Anderson puts into his sets.

I will say that Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Luke Wilson and Gwenneth Paltrow all give superb performances. In fact, there's not a week performance in the entire movie.

This is possibly the best opening to a film that I have ever seen.Finally, I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates original, quirky characters and to those who do not need multiple explosions, high-speed chases, gratuitous nudity, gross out gags,  etc. to enjoy a movie.I gave this movie a perfect ten stars.",The Royal Tenenbaums
266,maatmouse,The royal tenebaums - overly dysfunctional American family,8,9 June 2006,"I have to say that before this film, I was a Wes Anderson film virgin. I had never seen one of his pictures previously. This film is not a bad place to start.The Royal Tenebaums is the story of a family of likable American curiosities. You have the spiv runaway father done for trying to cheat on his son, the intelligent mother hen, the brilliant but now paranoid son, the genius adopted daughter who smokes incessantly but secretly and the ambitious ex-tennis player son who, through his love and jealousy for his adopted sister, no longer plays tennis. Added to that, a family friend who becomes famous and talented in his own right and becomes involved with the adopted daughter and you have the recipe for an interesting blend of people most of us recognise.This whole film was presented in a series of chapters, like those of a book. The cast are brilliant, especially Gwyneth Paltrow and Owen Wilson who manages to restrain his usual surfer dude schtick long enough to present a different, more moody side to his acting talents. It also presents us with straight acting from Ben Stiller who is normally renowned for doing very likable comedy, again playing the money mad genius son who is left a paranoid, safety conscious widower by an aircrash. And finally, there is Luke Wilson. A world away from his usually quite dopey but gentle comedy characters, Richie Tenebaum gives a new edge to Luke's acting talents. He far outdoes Owen in this film and gives a rich tapestry to a character who is jealous but sincere in his love for his adopted 'sibling' Margot and in dealing with her husband of convenience, played by Bill Murray. All the cast are wonderful.Lots of nice little touches, like Margot's secretive smoking, missing finger, fur coat costume and thick, clumpy flat shoes combined with tiny sports dresses and Kelly Bag, Owen's drug addled and porn driven cowboy with Gucci loafers and blonde, little boy lost bob haircut, Richie's sports wrist bands and mustard suit with dark glasses and long hair that disappears in his anguished response to his 'adopted sibling's sexual proclivities and his later passionate kissing with the same and, of course, Gene Hackman with his 'break all the rules' mad man attitude.",The Royal Tenenbaums
267,kanerazor,"Brilliant, deft, imaginative, thought-provoking, absorbing!",10,13 February 2002,"Rushmore was a highly enjoyable movie, but Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have really outdone themselves with this amazing piece of work.  IMHO it's the best film of 2001, and while I don't think it's gotten the critical recognition it deserves I am thrilled to see that it's earned an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay.  The movie gives us a wonderful array of characters, and presents their intertwined stories in a creative and charming manner.  Everything from the story book narration to the shots of magazine covers, book covers, etc. filling the screen to the slick editing to the mesmerizing soundtrack enhances the film considerably and that would still not add up to so much were it not for the superb script, the confident, skillful direction  and terrific performances from top to bottom.  I was really hoping the cast would get a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Best Ensemble, but although that didn't happen everyone should still be commended.  Gene Hackman is exceptional as wayward patriarch Royal, Anjelica Houston earns sympathy as long-suffering Etheline, Ben Stiller, in a rare dramatic role, shines as temperamental Chas, Gwenyth Paltrow is compelling playing rootless Margot, Luke Wilson breaks your heart as empty Richie, Owen Wilson is remarkable in his limited screentime as self-loathing Eli Cash, and Danny Glover and Bill Murray lend great support as Henry Sherman and Raleigh St. Clair, respectively.

268,yoveikivi,A strange potrail of a dysfunctional family that is extremely effective.,9,21 June 2021,"I love Wes Anderson and most of his films, my favorite one being Moonrise Kingdom. This is, as with most of his movies, strange but heartfelt and funny. This movie does a very good job portraying it's messages about love and death. The acting is amazing and the directing, as usual is quirky and amazing. If you haven't yet seen any Wes Anderson movie, I would definitely start with this before you get into The Grand Budapest and Moonrise Kingdom.",The Royal Tenenbaums
269,kiwisago,Clearly Obscure,8,22 January 2011,"Having seen a few of Wes Anderson's films, and sort of enjoying them, I thought I should try this one. I'm glad I did, it's my favourite of his films.The quirkiness of the characters in this film seemed to have more purpose (for lack of a better word), somehow, than in the other ones I've seen. The selfish patriarch, the house, the passing of time, all contributed to a framework within which the failures and misadventures of the characters felt more connected. And more beautiful, poignant, even. I think in the other films I got a more disconnected, existential feel, which partially drained the humour out for me and made me a bit irritated... but still very much fascinated by this director's distinctive vision.",The Royal Tenenbaums
270,aaronlbacks,Wes Anderson's Staple Film,8,2 January 2018,"It seems to be generally agreed that this is Wes Anderson's staple film, or perhaps his mission statement as far as movies he wanted to create: idiosyncratic, campy tales about complex relationships being told in often witty and blunt dialogue. And no one can forget the Wes Anderson tells - symmetry, pastel or earthy color schemes, and Bill Murray. Even though the way this story is told would never happen in real life (it felt fitting that the ""actual story"" being told was through a book), it still feels incredibly human and almost believable in an odd way. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) almost feels like the hero of a classic Greek tragedy, except the movie focuses more on gathering yourself the day, or in this case, the two decades after. Royal's ex-wife (Anjelica Huston), his two sons (Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson), his adopted daughter (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his children's friend from across the street (Owen Wilson) have all fallen on hard times (meltdowns, depression, drug use) decades after the family drifted apart. Royal attempts to reconnect with his family initially to keep his distanced wife from remarrying a tax advisor (Donny Glover), but throughout the film, he finds the best days of his life with his long-lost family. The group catches up with varying success and share in each other's mutual sadness. There are many beautiful and crushing scenes, heightened by the Wes Anderson style, and the story explores several different feelings and tones. I think the only real problem is that even though every character is written well and intricate in their own special way, and I believe each has an arc as well, there are so many people and histories to keep track of, it becomes a little bit of a nuisance. And the film struggles to juggle all these characters and all of this information in a balanced way; they each kind of have their moment and disappear for a while and then resurface briefly. And this makes the telling of the story a little choppy and confusing at points because you're always wondering who someone is or why they are acting the way they are until you remember through context clues. But if it weren't chosen to have this movie told through a book, I think it might have been much more noticeable. Of Anderson's films that I have seen, even though it is not my favorite by him, I'd say it's the best introduction to one of the best filmmakers in the industry right now.",The Royal Tenenbaums
271,ktappe,Distance of the characters keeps the audience distant too,5,29 July 2002,"I went middle-of-the-road with a ""5"" on this one. The film was indeed boring at times, but the characters were off the wall enough to keep the viewer intrigued more often than not. The montage where Royal shows his grandchildren how to live on the streets as urchins was priceless and should be shown to all parents.However, all the characters are off in their own worlds, keeping the others at arms length and emotionally distant. The primary problem with the film is that this effect carries over to the audience; we can't relate to any of them due to the way they keep their emotions bottled up. This leads to us not caring nearly as much about them as we could, and therefore not caring as much about the film as we could. ""Tennenbaums"" is apparently highly autobiographical. The author should have been a bit less self-absorbed during the editing and considered what the audience might have considered an interesting film.",The Royal Tenenbaums
272,moviewatcher747,"Wonderful, lighthearted comedy.",10,26 January 2002,"From the director and writers of ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore"" comes ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" starring the amazing Gene Hackman, the amazing Anjelica Huston, the amazing Ben Stiller...well, let's face it. Everyone involved in this project is simply amazing!To sum up this epic situation comedy, Royal Tenenbaum (Hackman) separates from his wife and his three children (Chas, Ricky, and Margot), returns some twenty years later pretending to have cancer and makes up a story that he doesn't have very long to live.The characters could each have their own films. Chas, the oldest Tenenbaum child, is a stockbroker at an early age. In the future, he has two kids (Ari and Uzi) and after his wife dies in a tragic plane crash, he's obsessed with safety.Ricky was once a great tennis player until he stunk up the court one game and never turned back to this profession, but he still wears that tacky trademark sweatband around his forehead. When the movie picks up, he finds himself falling in love with Margot.Margot Tenenbaum is the only adopted child. She lost one of her index fingers in a tragic accident and has a checkered life. She's married to unsuccessful child psychologist Raleigh St. Clair.Etheline Tenenbaum never legally divorced from her husband and is engaged to her black accountant, and of course, Royal has something to say about this. Owen Wilson is one of the film's highlights as the hilarious best-selling author who's books are awful.I absolutely loved this film. I'm a big fan of Wes Anderson (especially ""Rushmore"") and laughed constantly throughout. The plot was so intricate, and I think the art direction and set decoration should be at least nominated for an Oscar.I was thrilled was Gene Hackman (who was superb) won the Golden Globe for Best Actor. To sum up this whole review, go see this well-done comedic masterpiece!",The Royal Tenenbaums
273,oldskoolgeek,"Funny, but not Rushmore",7,15 January 2002,"This rebellious family comedy proves the Anderson and Owen writing team's creativity, but when compared to their 1998 Rushmore it falls a little flat. The cast is loaded with entertaining family members, who each has their moment, but it's Hackman that makes the movie.  As father Royal Tenenbaum, Hackman is a hilarious scoundrel who equals good parenting to taking his children to dog fights.  Hackman never stops and truly deserves Oscar recognition for this roll.  He does for this film what Bill Murray did for Rushmore; however, it just isn't enough.  The last half-hour slows down and takes a dark turn  the ending picks back up, yet by then it seems too late. The bottom line is that The Royal Tenenbaums lacks the liveliness and unity of Rushmore and reminds me more of Bottle Rocket  another very funny Anderson and Owen film that unfortunately comes off feeling a little incomplete.  The fabulous soundtrack and interestingly awkward scene cuts are right on the money though.   So it doesn't match up to Rushmore, so what? It still is better than over half of the films released this year.",The Royal Tenenbaums
274,melinda2001,I didn't get it,6,12 January 2002,"I was completely prepared to enjoy this movie. I love most of the principal actors--especially Angelica Huston who I see far too infrequently. Also, Bill Murry may even be my favorite actor since I've never disliked a performance of his. Until now that is. I thought that all of the actors fell flat due mostly to the rather stilted and formal dialogue. I'm sure that was intended, but it simply didn't work for me. The only bright spot for me was Gwyneth Paltrow who was beautiful to watch and played the only character who seemed even slightly more than two dimensional. The movie had something of the feel of _The World According to Garp_ though there appear to be no connection. So if you liked the Garp books and movies, you'll probably like this one. For me it was OK to watch but I mostly just didn't get it.",The Royal Tenenbaums
275,dood15,Royal is a fitting title for this film,10,9 April 2002,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  Brilliant writing by Anderson and Wilson.  The characters in this film are perfect and play off one another perfectly.  Funny, sad, and touching, if you have a family, you'll probably see part of them in this film, it is simply amazing and I urge you to see it if you haven't already... if you have, then see it again! It's really that good, i can't say enough good things about this movie, Gene Hackman is brilliant, the brothers Wilson are superb, Angelica Houston is amazing, and Gweneth Paltrow... well, she's naked but she's great in this movie, too.  Every one is, it's an excellent ensemble cast, a lot of times super star casts fail to deliver the goods, but every one comes together in this and it's simply amazing.

276,Don Stephens,Anthony and Dignan Ride Again...,10,7 January 2002,"Apart from Woody Allen, or maybe the Farrelly brothers, Wes Anderson has a singular voice in American Comedy.  He goes not for broad strokes but rather for minute character details.  It is understatements that get the biggest laughs.  And in an era where directors are desperate to get an audience rolling that they will resort to anything, (pie defilement, testicle eating, horse masturbation, etc.) Anderson's films have an air of confidence to them.  He knows you'll laugh, so he won't beat you over the head.And in the tradition of Lubitsch-esque films like his previous two; ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore,"" comes ""The Royal Tenenbaums.""  With this, Anderson has joined the leagues of the greats working today.  He must be mentioned in the same breath as such off-beat directors as the Coen brothers, Terry Gilliam, and even Stanley Kubrick. (Although he's dead.)  Let it never be said that attention to detail ever broke a movie.A lesser director might have taken the same materials that Anderson has here (A dysfunctional family of geniuses living under one roof with a shifty and untrustworthy patriarch) and made a terrible film ridden with stock characters and weak situations.  But this particular director has made these potential stereotypes come alive with their own little quirks and mannerisms and outlooks.  Consider for example a scene where Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson) is playing tennis, and is losing horribly for he sees his adopted sister Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) with her new husband in the stands.  He is in love with her, and he is at his wits-end, and his reaction to this on the court is funny and heartbreaking at the same time.  These characters can easily be classified as neurotics and too quirky for the audience's good, but that is a statement of someone who isn't paying enough attention.I usually shy away from all-star casts because that usually means that studio executives are swarming around the set insisting that changes be made to make the film more ""palatable"" for audience consumption.  But that is not the case here.  Everyone from the film's lead: Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum, to Kumar Pallana as his manservant Pagoda, are all they can be. This film is deeply enriching for general audiences, and for aspiring actors, this is the movie to see to learn how the pros apply their trade.**** out of 4",The Royal Tenenbaums
277,mifamily6,Not your average mainstream comedy but still pretty good,8,9 January 2002,"I first saw ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" on Monday and, unfortunately, did not like it.  The quality of ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore"" made me expect way too much from Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson's third outing and I felt disappointed.  On Tuesday, however, I began thinking about the movie.  Not just the dialogue but every part of the film (I'm sure you all remember the graphic paintings on Eli's wall).  Then, I started to laugh.  I then thought about how each time Royal (Gene Hackman in the hilarious performance) would introduce Margot, he would say, ""This is my adopted daughter, Margot.""  This was some great stuff.  Don't forget about Gypsy Cab Co.  By Wednesday, I had an appreciation for this movie that I did not have on Monday.Be warned that this is not your average mainstream comedy.  The movie is, at times, uneven, sluggish, overly quirky, and just plain depressing.  The trick is to walk into the movie theatre with these thoughts in mind so you can watch for the better moments.  The Tenenbaums are screwed up.  There's nothing you can do to help them.  Put down the first-aid kit and enjoy the movie.  The very last scene is probably the funniest ending I have ever seen in my short days.One thing that the filmmakers forgot to tell us was the time period.  What year was it?  They dressed like the '70s but I recall Seymour Cassel whipping out a digital beeper with instant messaging.  That must have been introduced no more than three years ago.  And Richie's hair and beard... what the hell was that?  Perhaps that was what they intended to do (A fairy-tale kind of world) so I'll shut up.  I just thought I might point that out.Now that I think about it, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a pretty good film.",The Royal Tenenbaums

The first and most obvious, I loved the movie and want all to know what a great film it is. The second much more obscure reason is that there are numerous votes of 10 or 9 at IMDb and I am thinking the film was trash.This film fits in the second category. Oh my God, this is bad. I couldn't even finish the movie on DVD (I was amazed I watched 2/3 before shutting it down.) and found the special features on the DVD much more interesting. Why is this a bad movie? The acting for the most part seemed wooden and forced to me. The interaction between the actors seems very rehearsed, very unnatural, and not even funny.

Most of the great actors in this film suffered from a horrible script and terrible direction.

282,bigspeegs,A nice change from Rushmore,7,21 January 2002,"RATING:  *** / ****Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have defined a style in their films. The formula is simple: take a few glum characters, plop them in front of a camera, stick in a quirky romance and let them loose. This has gained the duo many admirers, but I'm not one of them. Their films aren't depressing, just uninteresting and unpleasant. And after enduring the highly overrated ""Rushmore"", it's high time this formula worked.Gene Hackman is Royal Tenenbaum, a man bent on getting his family back after learning his wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston), who he never officially divorced, was with another man (Danny Glover as Henry Sherman). The Tenenbaum children are Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke Wilson). Chas is a financial consultant of some sort with two children. Margot is a Pulitzer Prize winning playwright who has always been known as the ""adopted daughter"". She doesn't communicate often with her husband Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), and is having an affair with her childhood friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson). Richie is a retired pro tennis player who has fallen in love with his sister. One day, Royal confronts Etheline and (in one of the funniest confessionals i've seen in a while) tells her he's dying. Is he? Of course not, but he wants his family back. Due to one thing or another, they all move in under one roof, and from there sparks fly.I had a wonderful time at ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". Anderson and Wilson have taken their normal formula and gave it a personal touch, resulting in a funny, honest effort. Unlike its morbid predecessor, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is warm and loves it's characters. The Tenenbaums are a family that has already achieved their goals in life and are now stuck with nowhere to go. They can only go back and catch what they missed: the feeling of really being a family, of caring for each other. Royal is making an honest effort to do this, but the only way he can try and gain his family's respect is to try to fake his own death. His ""fresh start"" is represented through Chas's two sons, who see Royal through a new pair of eyes.Oh yeah, and it's funny, too. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is full of fresh jokes and has its share of pratfalls, but it's in the characters that much of the humor lies. Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), Royal's friend and a doorman for the Tenenbaums, is played down perfectly so that when he explodes, you'll be laughing so hard you'll be begging for air. And Royal is a terrible actor; trying to convince his family he is dying of stomach cancer while he is out jumping into pools, driving go-carts and eating cheeseburgers. ""Tenenbaums"" revels in these kinds of ironic switch-arounds, giving the audience plenty to enjoy.The ensemble cast of ""Tenenbaums"" works nearly perfectly, with each other and in and of themselves. Gene Hackman's performance as Royal is pitch-perfect; giving Royal the edge he needs to win his family and the viewer over. The rest of the cast is exceptional as well, including Gwyneth Paltrow looking a lot like Christina Ricci, Owen Wilson doing a stoner and Anjelica Huston exquisitely handling her role as the woman caught up in the middle of it all. Some characters became a chore to watch after a short while. I was completely under whelmed with Bill Murray's Raleigh St. Clair. St. Clair is such a flat, empty character that there was no way I could sympathize with him when Margo ran away with another man. There's a difference between understated and soulless, and unfortunately, Murray does what he did for ""Rushmore"" and walks on the latter half of the spectrum (Billy Bob Thornton's performance in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is a good example of a well handled quiet performance). Also, what was the purpose of St. Clair's patient? Is his presence alone supposed to be funny? I wasn't laughing.Warts and all, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a family affair brought to you buy those who specialize in gloom. However, what separates ""Tenenbaums"" is how lovingly pieced together it is, with its characters kicking away from ""depressed mode"" and actually developing. With a smart screenplay, (for the most part) wonderful acting and a touch of warmth, you can't go wrong with ""Tenenbaums"".",The Royal Tenenbaums
283,wiseguymattt,Exactly what I was hoping it'd be,9,27 October 2013,"I'll preface this by saying before watching this movie, I had only seen one other film by Wes Anderson called Moonrise Kingdom. Although, I felt I was able to get a good impression on his style from that one film because it was s unique. With that said:The aesthetic in the Royal Tenenbaums is different yet very plain. It's hard for me to explain it. It had an almost warm, inviting feeling to it that pulls you right into the story. They did an excellent job developing each character enough to leave room for discovery. I mean, you got a general idea of who all the characters were but throughout the film you see them start to change and at the same time being tested in which they respond in their own ways. As I type this, I realize how hard it is for me to review this movie. All I can say is I thoroughly enjoyed it and have watched it twice since I got it not so long ago. The humor keeps you chuckling and the clever dialogue makes for conversations you wish to be part of. And be warned, you may start to fall in love with some of the characters. I know I did. Twice! But that's okay. It's perfectly normal to form relationships with fictitious characters.

Wes Anderson, while being a very GOOD director/writer, is not the greatest thing since Orson Welles.  Just because we want someone to be great like that doesn't mean there exists such a person and we cannot label someone who is, I grant you, very original, that mantra when he clearly does not yet deserve it.

Unfortunately, there are too many characters for any real depth. With the exception of perhaps Gene Hackman, all the actors in this film come off as caricatures. And needless to say, there is only a hint of a plot, and little or no character development.
In another age, some might say that many layers of fascinating atmosphere and detail are not adequate compensation for an embryonic story. Of course, those days are long gone. There are no real standards anymore. In fact, most of the Hollywood product has no more substance than the cartoons they are based on. Nevertheless, Anderson is able to capture his quirky vision on film. I came away with the same feeling I get from the typical Woody Allen effort.

But style alone cannot make a great film or a great director. What's missing? Let's try real, grown-up characters.  I was impressed by Mr. Anderson's ability to rustle up a great cast, but all they did was mope around in twee outfits.  Meanwhile, we're supposed to have empathy for this dysfunctional family and what they've gone through, but there's really no depth here. What a waste. Another issue is the pacing:  too slow, and not on the mark all the time. With time, the jokes are fewer and farther between. The film thus starts to drag after the 1st hour.

Burned again.I didn't like Mr. Anderson's previous works, but surely all of those big-name, talented actors wouldn't sign up for a dud. They did.

Quirky and imaginative are two words that come to mind and in many ways this was not so different than Wes Anderson's Rushmore and Bottle Rocket. But at the same time this film has a certain compassion that his other films lacked. In any case this movie is filled with cool stuff to look and laugh at as it tells a story that seems to be about family, forgiveness. Wes Anderson has put together a great ( star stunted ) cast and pulled off the difficult task of making the best of their talent while keeping strong his fresh yet offbeat style. Many may complain that this is no Rushmore but it is still very good. One can only hope that Wes Anderson will have a job in movies for years to come.",The Royal Tenenbaums
295,igmu,Mildly entertaining fluff,4,15 November 2006,"Great cast; shame about the film. The premise shows potential. Dysfunctional family deserted years before by their father who now wants to worm his way back in. Unfortunately the writing is so limp and the characters so underdeveloped that after twenty minutes you won't care at all about what's going to happen to any of them. Angelica Huston, Bill Murray and Danny Glover have bit parts so inconsequential that their roles could almost have been assigned to extras; of the Tenenbaum children only Luke Wilson's ex-tennis champ character holds any interest at all. Gwyneth Paltrow is at her most two-dimensional (not her fault, blame the script this time), Ben Stiller is completely wasted in his role and the less said about Owen Wilson's part and lack of acting talent the better. The film's only saving grace is Gene Hackman who is on top form and steals every scene that he is in - which is most of them.SPOILERSHowever, the plot device of him pretending to be terminally ill is done away with far too quickly, wasting a lot of comic and dramatic potential, and of course he conveniently dies at the end when no-one (except everybody that watches clichéd films like this) expects it.Also, what's with the title? Why is Hackman named 'Royal' other than to jazz up the film's name? It's never explained; personally I think that calling a film 'The Tenenbaums' would have had less appeal than one with a possible regal attachment, although it would have been more honest. The same association was used to much better effect in the UK sitcom 'The Royle Family', as the lives of the characters portrayed there are as far removed from those of the monarchy as can be. With the USA having no Royal Family what are we supposed to make of it all? Yet again, weak writing.So, to sum up, not really worth bothering with unless you are a die-hard Gene Hackman fan, and even if then I think you'd be better off watching paint dry.",The Royal Tenenbaums
296,duke33,Snooze...,4,11 July 2002,"After watching Rushmore a few years back and falling completely in love with the movie, I was eagerly anticipating Anderson and Wilson's follow-up, The Royal Tenenbaums. Unfortunately, i was thoroughly bored by this movie.  And, it really is a shame, since this movie has an all-star cast of great comic actors.  The sad thing is that several of the actors talents, such as Bill Murray's portrayal of Raleigh St Clair, were totally wasted on this movie.  Why you would take one of the great comic geniuses of our time and put him in a boring role with little to no lines, and no character development, is beyond me.The movie was quite reminiscent of Bottle Rocket for me.  There was a lot of background story, and you get the feeling that they are just building up to a greater story.  However, by the time the movie really gets going, it is just about over.  There was only one scene in the movie that made me laugh, and that was the scene where Royal Tenenbaum takes his grandchildren on the town, teaching them how to create mischief.  It was part of the trailer, so anyone who has seen it has seen the only funny part of this movie.  Maybe part of my disappointment was because i was wanting this movie to be another Rushmore, which is not fair on my part.  However, i don't think it can begin to hold a candle to its predecessor.  Rushmore was just a great story, without all the big-name actors.  It just goes to show that sometimes all the big names in the world can't help a story.",The Royal Tenenbaums

The cast line up is impressive, however the film fails to deliver the goods. If I would have paid money to see this film, I would have been very annoyed. This is one of THE WORST movies I have ever tried to sit through. It is a constant bore, with nothing at all to keep the viewer from falling asleep.

My g-friend and I went to this over ""A Beautiful Mind"" because we wanted to LAUGH. Heh, what a mistake. The trailers for this film are dramatically misleading (as I'm sure the producers realized what a piece of crap they had on their hands).. Anderson's film tries hard to be different, dark, imaginative or whatever, but it simply sucks. A comedy? Maybe for a depressed serial murderer, not for most people that were in the theater with us that night. This is one of those films that a portion of people are going to exclaim ""A Masterpiece!"" because they don't want to feel left out of the invisible ""Cool"" circle of underground filmgoers that are heads above the rest of us that ""don't get it"". Well I got news for you: there is nothing to get but a poorly written and directed script that is nothing short of dismal. After the premier in NY, members of the cast were riddled with questions from the media; ""Why did you agree to do this film?"" Clearly some of the stars didn't know how to answer, and it's my opinion this will be the first and last star-studded vehicle Mr. Anderson will ever direct again.",The Royal Tenenbaums
299,EmAn1213,"Tragic, Hilarious, and Definitely Worth Watching",9,29 January 2002,"""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is by far one of the smartest dark comedies ever made. Director Wes Anderson is back with his offbeat, oddball style, this time handling the subject of a seriously troubled, disfunctional family. Nearly every main character is played by a well-established actor. All-star casts can sometimes destroy a film, but in this case, every actor fits his or her part so well that you really forget you are watching Gwyneth, the Wilson brothers, and mega-stars like Hackman, Huston, and Glover.The movie follows the lives of the Tenenbaums. The father, Royal, is a deadbeat whose lack of interest in most of his children's lives has led to a long separation and almost non-existent relationship with them. When Royal and his wife Etheline separate in 1979, Etheline takes charge of the children's lives and education. Each of the three children turns into a prodigy in some way or another. Margot (Paltrow) is a young playwright, Chas (Stiller) is a financial whiz, and Richie (L. Wilson) is a tennis champ. Though each child achieves unimaginable success before the age of 20, in their adult lives they are unable to deal with any ordinary problems. All these problems seem to culminate when Royal abruptly decides he ""wants his family back, damn it"" and the entire family finds themselves living together for the first time in over 2 decades. As the story unfolds, the children's and Etheline's lives are shaken up by the scampish Royal. (Etheline's problems are further complicated by the fact that her friend Henry Sherman (Glover) has recently proposed to her.) It seems that Royal's dream is to restore his family, though he naturally goes about it in a very offbeat way. The results are so much fun to watch!The greatest thing about ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is that everything is hilarious, tragic, desperate, and detatched all at the same time. You laughter is often interrupted with the realization that the subject matter really is very sad. However, even if you don't find the Tenenbaums as engaging as I do, it's still worth watching for the performances alone. I especially thought that Hackman, Huston, and Luke Wilson were absolutely amazing. Danny Glover, Owen Wilson, and Bill Murray also spice up the film with their supporting roles.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Whoever described this film as comedy clearly has no concept of comedy. Gene Hackman as a comedy lead - come on!! OK so it's a dysfunctional family, I get that, OK so they are child protégés, I get that - but it goes no where, no development of plot or characters. If you want to see a real comedy about a dysfunctional family see The Adams Family where at least Angelica Huston acts. The scene when Hackman tells her he's dying is so bad as to be unbelievable, she is not a bad actress but the direction and lines in that scene destroy her credibility. How this film was nominated for an Oscar is beyond me, well actually when you think about it no, because the academy is full of pretentious sycophants who just vote on what they are told is good writing rather than actually putting some thought behind it - avoid this film like the plague.",The Royal Tenenbaums

306,crabzs,There is always a second chance,8,28 December 2012,"Director Wes Anderson presents the story of a dysfunctional family with gifted children in his film ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001), which is told in a curious way, it has a linear structure with flashbacks and a narrator at first. All divided by chapters: each chapter like a book, as the film begins with a book that opens.It is a sad and funny story at the same time, it is about loneliness, because we see each of the characters involved in his own world and somewhat miserable, each in their own way, but generally they are a family involved in loneliness. The characters are well armed, as they have a great personality, everyone has something that characterizes them: their dress, particular things they have in their homes, etc.. Every detail speaks a lot about them.It is a deeper movie than it appears, it has comedic moments, has good music, good performances and a simple story, but the plot and how it affects the characters and how they carry all is what stands the film. Appears to be many things and surprises, which gives the film a lot of wealth, as keeps the viewer a little unsure on how to react to certain situations, because there are things that seem funny, sometimes cynical, sometimes sad, nothing is predictable and everything that happens is completely different from the above, does not repeat anything.His presentation of characters is rather long, the story itself takes to start, but the film works because every time something happens, but at times is confusing because it has many characters and many situations.It is a film that engages the viewer because it is a simple story told in an unusual way and with good performances.",The Royal Tenenbaums

A complex comedy that orbits issues of familial dysfunction, TRT's ferocious wit speaks to all of us on some level. The cast is uniformly wonderful, especially Gene Hackman as Royal. This is the tale of a clan of geniuses in decline, with their estranged parents and associated pretenders to the family. Each character is drawn in such an individualistic manner, this harkens to our sense of identity while providing a visual style that is again, an Andersonian achievement. Alec Baldwin's stoic narration coupled with stark super titles that flash staccato style add to the off-kilter ambiance of the pseudo New York dramascape.  More outré than Bottle Rocket, more sagacious than Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums is a monumental accomplishment in visual storytelling, a milestone in Anderson's career, and one of the best American films of 2001.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Honesty, comedy, and tragedy all captured frame by frame.  The characters are so far removed from ourselves, but yet we find some part of ourself in each and every member.  The mixure of emotion one gets from watching this movie is unbelievable.  In one way envigirated, happy in life, but at the same time insanely depressed.  The combination is a sobering experience.

Ben Stiller is truly a great actor, not just a great comedian. I really wnat to emphasize Ben Stiller. He is really superb in this movie.

You would think that I would have ceased being amazed long ago, but I guess I'm a romantic at heart who really wants to keep faith.  Enter many comments that I have read on this site about one of the funniest, saddest and most touching films I have ever seen:  The Royal Tenenbaums.The fine line between comedy and tragedy is well known to anyone with any sense of dramatic history.  This film dances back and forth over that line with an evil grin (much like Happiness did as well), making you laugh, then making you pay for it with a moment of tragedy.  How could anyone say (as many of you did) that you ""didn't laugh once""?!  While I realize that no one was hit in the crotch with a golf ball (which ironically does walk that line between comedy and tragedy... hmmm), if you didn't laugh out loud at the deadpan one-liners like Bill Murray's ""she smokes?"", Dudley's ""Am I colorblind?"", or Angelica Huston's ""Well, I think you should quit"" there is seriously something wrong with you (or you were distracted waiting for Ben Stiller to make a funny face).  Check out the ""memorable quotes"" section on this page if you don't believe that there is anything funny here! By the same token, if you didn't fight back tears during Richie's ""hair cutting scene"" (with Elliot Smith's beautiful Needle In The Hay providing the only sound), Bill Murray's one word exit ""goodbye"" to Gwyneth Paltrow in the hospital, or Ben Stiller connecting with Danny Glover with the line ""I'm a widower too"", then you are colder than I can imagine!Rushmore was an indication of Wes and Owen's talent and gift for dialogue, disarming comedy and character development but Tenenbaums is their masterpiece.  The world they have created, where children and adults alike can isolate themselves from each other while all in the same house and tear apart the people closest to them seconds after making you laugh, is so unique and engaging it makes supposed ""heartfelt dramas"" like the Armageddons of the world seem offensive to all human sensibilities and supposed comedies like the Dumb & Dumbers of the world seem more base and childish than anything your kids watch on Saturday morning.  This is complete and powerful film making - with the full range of emotions and moods that life really has, even in a caricature of reality.  I can't imagine seeing this film less than 100 more time in my lifetime... and I can't imagine how you could feel otherwise.  By the way, even after the third viewing, Eli's pretentious ""Everyone knows that Custer died at Little Bighorn, what this book presupposes is... he didn't"" makes me laugh embarrassingly loudly.  That's how good this film is.",The Royal Tenenbaums
320,Grosik_Stim,An open letter to the nay-sayers!,10,15 August 2002,"I don't think the reason that so many of us have shown disbelief and frustration with the negative reviews on the site is due to relegating them all to ""boorish"" or ""Jim Carrey""-loving.  I think it is because we expect a higher level of film appreciation from anyone who would take the time to comment on a message board intended for ""film people"" (okay, cinema geeks!)  The fact that subtle humour and dry wit is horribly unappreciated in America is sad - Brits and Canadians have made this art form our bread and butter for years, why are the best complete and innovative comedians from these countries (Python, Young Ones, Mike Myers, Kids In The Hall, etc.)?!!  If someone didn't like the movie, that's fine .  But to call it boring, slow, or unfunny is just ignorant and narrow... in real life there are funny moments in tragic figures' lives!  Sorry.  I, personally, used the ""golf-ball-in-crotch"" analogy in a negative tone because I am so infuriated with that which passes for ""great"" in hollywood - or at least financially successful - that I take it personally as a lover of great cinema.  Imagine how boring Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" must seem to those people!  Just because Ben Stiller doesn't over-play a ""model look"" and there isn't a car chase every 5 minutes doesn't mean that the pacing and humour is flawed!  The point is that most of the negative comments I read (and I read over 100 comments for Tenenbaums) were inane and showed little grasp of the value of tragedy in a comedic melieux.  Having said that, I do blame the studio for not knowing how to market a film of this type to a mainstream American public.  As a default, they chose comedic trailers and tv spots, which was a misguided decision.Tenenbaums is not a comedy (not as North American audiences would categorize anyway).  It is truly a dramatic piece with an underlying sense of humour (which is why you laugh and cry in a matter of 10 minutes at points).  The laughs do come in a big way if you watch it as a drama with moments of comic relief.  The comments that sight the writing as a weak point are baffling to me, as are those that called Bill Murray under-used (his best performance in years), Gwyneth Paltrow's ""Margot "" pointless (her subtle cynicism and indifference is the most overt link to the themes of the film) and Ben Stiller disappointing (there is so much depth to his character... but you have to work for it, as it is all in the details). Anyway, to be disappointed in us for ""calling"" America's complacency and desire for more fast-food comedy is unfair.  We want the bar raised and, while Jim Carrey ( a Canadian) has his place in comedy, there is more to intrigue, inspire and engage us out there.  So for all of us who choose The Coen Brothers over The Farrelly Brothers, someone has to speak up and let people know that ""America's funniest home videos"" is not auteur film making!  Just thought I should let you know that we're not all mindless snobs who just like anything with the word ""art"" attached to it for the sake of being poo-poo intellectuals.

He looks like Robert Fulghum, but isn't nearly as interesting.It has the appearance of being an adapted novel. Lots of scenes that don't really make any sense and aren't necessary to drive the plot. Seems that they just needed to be thrown in somewhere.And some unnecessary nudity just tossed in for no particular reason, except perhaps that the director wanted to look at some nekkid chicks.I call it a three, but writing about it makes that seem generous.

I think anyone withany interest in the visual aspect of film making (that seems like afunny thing to say, huh?) should at least appreciate that aspect ofhis movies.  Likewise, he gets points for not catering to the LCD,either dramatic (ie. American Beauty, any ""drama"" Tom Hanks orRobin Williams has ever been in), OR comedic.  Still, the only thingthat makes him any more credible with the film school crowd than,say, Baz Lurhmann is the fact that he's got such a ""new wave"" retrolook to his films.  With the exception of Bill Murray, who for somereason always floors me (fond childhood memories of ""Ghostbusters""?)  and Gene Hackman, who should be recognizedfor probably the best ""dad"" portrayal I have ever seen, the acting ispretty flat.  It kind of reminds me of Hal Hartley, actually; thecharacters are kind of secondary items in the film; paper dollswhich Anderson can dress up and use as scenery.

325,BlackVelvet88,"Beautiful, just beautiful",10,16 October 2006,"This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever watched. It might as well be a favorite. Wes Anderson is such a talented director with a brilliance that not many people realize. The acting, the cinematography, the formation of the characters and story, they're all so perfect. There's just one word to describe these - beautiful.I can't remember who, but someone I met before said the characters were lifeless and ""dead."" I disagree. The Tenenbaums are some of the best illustrated people I've ever met. You can tell who they are just by looking at their appearances and/or movements. Margot is probably the best example. Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't just give her a beautiful face, but also incorporates her movements with such a poetic grace that makes her who she is. It was a good choice to make her a playwright, having a style like this. Her casual hair and furcoat with the simple '70s dress underneath shows the maiden Richie fell in love with. Around her husband, Raleigh, her face is depressing and melancholy, but around Richie, she is a graceful goddess. The definition of a natural American beauty, she is. (pardon the Yoda tone.) Richie is probably the one I most liked. Luke Wilson plays him with a soft but not shy voice with plain expressions and casual eyes. His somewhat scrunched walking position shows that he's not okay, all that the audience needs to know. From the moment we see him, as child or adult, we can sense that he is special and important to the movie's story. He becomes a special connection between several members, including Royal, Eli, and Margot.Luke Wilson's vulnerable character just lost a competition of his career because of Margot and throughout the movie, he fights one with life, and almost loses that too, because of Margot. But she helps him at the end and he stands back up. Their affection towards each other marks a centerpiece in this movie.Though you may sympathize him a lot, I actually found myself pitying Chas the most. The only Tenenbaum offspring to have children, he tries to be a strong father for his two sons, Uzi and Ari, an effort that goes in vain. While he tries really hard to hide the mind weakness that results from the hurt and grief of the tragic accident that killed his wife, he can't help but show it. Symbols are his two sons and their beagle Buckley, who survived the crash. His mind weakness is finally gotten rid of when Buckley dies yet at another accident, replaced by a fireman's Dalmatian, symbolizing the hero that Chas will be in the future.Eli Cash, the boy next door who grew very close to the Tenenbaums, does so in a not-so-good result. Like all three Tenenbaum children, he becomes successful, but as a drug addict and holder of an uncontrollable mind. His cowboy attire shows his wildness, and throughout the movie he proves himself more than that. His desire to be a Tenenbaum only becomes a thorn at his side and it proves him unreliable and uncontrollable. He finally gets help at the end, and although his ending is inconclusive, the scene with him at the drug rehab leaves a good feeling in the viewer's mind.The Tenenbaums live in New York, the high class city of today along with the highest jobs and highest dreams, all which the Tenenbaums have. Anderson's choice to put no buildings give a traditional view, to make the Tenenbaums seem simpler then they really are, an action that actually is a good choice for the film. Overall, it gives a sense of modern elegance to the family, a position of aristocracy and nobility that they all live in: the royal Tenenbaums, American nobles.Overall, this film is not a bad sight for the eyes, literally. Films that reach this achievement are rare, and it easily could have won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (but not Best Picture, sorry) and I praise writers Anderson and Owen Wilson for that. Once again, I repeat: Wes Anderson has created a work of art. Well done, Anderson.",The Royal Tenenbaums
326,msteedle,Not what you might expect,10,6 January 2002,"Attention reviewers: if you went to see this movie expecting something else, do not sound so disappointed that you never got it. It doesn't make the movie bad; it just wasn't your cup of tea, so stop defacing this page with bad reviews. Instead of complaining about the slow delivery of lines, sit back and appreciate the way each shot was masterfully framed. All of the actors fell in love with the script for some reason, so you might be missing something. Also, I highly doubt that the use of music in this movie was in any way intended to boost soundtrack sales, as was indicated by another reviewer - it is not a tactic employed often by talented and credible directors. Speaking of music, Wes Anderson is known for creating incredible and appropriate soundtracks. Try listening to the lyrics and comparing them to what is happening in the film. The details have significance.I am sorry that this movie was not the boisterous comedy that some people wanted, but if they had done a little (gasp) reading or checked out some previous films by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, they would have surely realized that their movies are more dramatic and serious than most comedies. Also, much of the humor in these films is in the situations and characters themselves, not in one-liners, and much of that goes unnoticed to some moviegoers. I am assuming that this will not change anybody's mind on the film, but maybe it will help you to sort out whether it is worth your time and money to go see The Royal Tenenbaums. My advice: if you enjoy watching blockbuster movies with illiterate actors and nine-figure production budgets, skip it; but if you really appreciate film, go see it right now.",The Royal Tenenbaums
327,WesAndersonFan,A masterpiece,10,3 November 2002,"Wes Anderson's ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a masterpiece of a film. Although ""Rushmore"" is still my own personal favorite, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" deals with a large cast of characters and a combination of comedy and pathos in a way which few other film could. The film starts out with a brilliant montage scored with an instrumental version of ""Hey Jude"", which tells the family's history. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) abandons his family, which includes his wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston), who becomes an archeologist; and his three children: Chas, Richie, and ""adopted daughter"" Margot. Chas grows up to be a businessman played by Ben Stiller, Richie grows up to be a tennis champion played by Luke Wilson, and Margot grows up to be a depressed playwright, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, giving one of her finer performances to date. In the present day, Royal has been staying at a hotel for 20 years and is getting kicked out after now being short of cash. (Danny Glover). Margot is married to a quirky neurologist (Bill Murray)Etheline is proposed to by her accountant . Chas is still trying to get over the death of his wife. Richie, after having a meltdown during a match, travels on a yacht in the middle of the ocean. Royal, who hasn't talked to his wife in quite a while, visits her one day and tells her he's dying. The family becomes reunited and the film tells of a few month period in the life of this family. The acting is excellent, especially Gene Hackman and Luke Wilson. The use of music, as in Anderson's other films is perfect. The script is brilliant. And of course, Wes Anderson's direction is absolutely magnificent. I highly recommend ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". 10/10",The Royal Tenenbaums
328,davidgkimberley,Wes Anderson gets the best out of people,8,10 January 2012,"Wes Anderson films are like exceptionally well done home movies. Its always the same actors in different costumes playing different roles as if to say; ""what shall we do now?"". The Royal Tenenbaums is the story of a family of five headed by Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman). The three children in the storm of their parents divorce all become child prodigies of sorts. Chas, played by Ben Still, is a money man making a killing on the housing market. Margot (who is adopted), played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is a playwright and Richie, played by Luke Wilson, is a world champion tennis player. Another character thrown into the midst is Eli Cash, played by Owen Wilson, who is Richie's best friend.The film begins by portraying the three as children all of whom seem to have massive potential, however, fast forward twenty-two years and the family is in rather a grave state. Chas's wife died in a plane crash and he has become extremely overprotective of his twin boys. Richie has had some sort of nervous breakdown and has been travelling on a boat, going around the globe, for several years. Margot, who has married Raleigh (played by Bill Murray) has not written a play for years and seems to have entered a state of uncertainty in her life. She is also having an affair with Eli, who has become a successful author. Meanwhile Royal, who hasn't seen his wife (they never officially divorced) for seven years and after falling on hard times is kicked out of his hotel.When Chas comes to stay at the house the three children grew up in, Richi and Margot become jealous and also want to stay. Meanwhile Royal, who supposedly has six weeks to live, also needs somewhere to stay. A strange family reunion is formed and the movie really kicks off from here, with Royal trying to salvage some sort of relationship with his children in his last remaining weeks and the children themselves trying to work out and resolve what exactly has gone wrong in their lives. As a kind of side story that seeps into the main one, Eli has developed a comically performed drug habit.Acting wise I loved this film. I love the choice of actors as aside from Jason Schwartzman this film seems to encompass all of the usuals. Characters who some people usually find annoying or of poor quality (although I like him, everyone seems to be annoyed by Owen Wilson) do a great job. I thought Ben Stiller, who I usually find very average / type cast, performed exceptionally well, especially on his comedic side. Gene Hackman was fantastic as Royal Tenenbaum, the lovable asshole and the rest of the usuals were good as ever, I especially love Kumar Pallana, who plays Pagoda.In terms of directing Wes Anderson is on point as usual. He has a real life doll house and whilst, annoyingly, he couldn't open it up to pan down the innards, the shots the scroll down the windows were wonderful. I also love the way he follows people, particularly in chase type scenes, because though showing you the action perfectly you also get to see everybody else's reactions whilst he simultaneously shows off the house / set that he's working in for all its weirdly wonderful characteristics. The soundtrack, as for all Anderson films, is really superb. Everything comes on and disappears at the right moment, and the music always matches the action.The writing is possibly the best bit. The story is very enticing, and within the film there are several different stories, secrets held by characters etc. that come together and manifest themselves in a perfect ending. The film is also very funny, there is a mixture of deadpan and just very silly humour that will make you laugh out loud and smile your way through this picture. Overall I think this may be Wes Anderson's best movie (apart from maybe Bottlerocket). Its very clever and you definitely won't have seen anything like it before. I would say that this would definitely have been Oscar worthy, its just that its probably not really serious enough for the expletives at the academy, though perhaps not for any acting (still, maybe Ben Stiller should have got best supporting?). Anyways this is a must watch, definitely go and see it!",The Royal Tenenbaums
329,scarlet caulfield,Wes Anderson's Best Yet!,10,18 February 2002,"The Royal Tenenbaums is that rare movie gem that leaves viewers thinking, ""I shouldn't be laughing at this,"" in between their cackles and grins.Wes Anderson is the young and brilliant man in the director's chair. The Royal Tenenbaums towers over his last film, the superb Rushmore, leaving no doubt that more masterpieces are yet to come.The greatest part of the film isn't the story - it's the characters.Gene Hackman is exceptional as Royal Tenenbaum, the estranged father of three child geniuses who are now grown.  It's beyond me how he wasn't nominated for an Academy Award.Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow and especially Luke Wilson are extraordinary as the three now adult Tenenbaums.Anjelica Huston shines as their mother, and Owen Wilson (who also co-wrote the screenplay) playing their childhood friend Eli Cash, is hilarious, as always. It is just impossible to name one performance as a standout, as all in the cast are absolutely radiant and deserve praise and honors.The characters are so out there, yet still believable and even familiar at times.They showed some traits that are likewise found in my friends and myself, which made me feel all the more guilty for laughing at their misfortunes.I suppose, however, that that's what this movie tries to do.Some people have told me that this film is too dark and ""offbeat,"" but I think it tries to get us to take life less seriously and sit back and laugh at ourselves, even when everything is going wrong.Call it an utterly dark comedy or a hilarious drama, it doesn't even matter: The Royal Tenenbaums is an all-out masterpiece.",The Royal Tenenbaums
330,sandrewsmith,More heady goodness from Wes Anderson,8,3 December 2002,"This third film by Wes Anderson is another testament to his ingenuity and original vision. There is a slight air of surrealism, hinted at by the made-up New York locations (the 375th St. Y, the Palace Hotel, Archer Ave.) that are actual New York locations in disguise. The (perhaps over-) abundance of detail is a treasure-trove waiting for repeated viewings. Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson have woven an intricate plot around intricately woven characters. These characters may irritate a viewer sometimes but are much more deeply drawn than they first appear: they are greater than the sum of their quirks. The score, by former Devo newwaver Mark Mothersbaugh, is a perfect amalgamation of Baroque and classical music and jazz-pop, in the same vein as his score for ""Rushmore."" I highly recommend this to anyone who ever thinks about his or her childhood for any reason.A note for viewers of the Criterion Collection DVD: Watch and be appalled by the ""Peter Bradley Show"" in which a man who looks vaguely like Charlie Rose incompetently interviews several bit players who seem either amused or very uncomfortable. Then, sharpen your eyes, switch discs and watch for ""Peter Bradley"" to appear in the movie in a couple of places. Finally, think really hard about the whole thing and what it might mean.",The Royal Tenenbaums
331,werdnaoslek,Weakens with time,4,3 April 2018,"A very dated film and feels a little Phoned in from most leads. The characters are mere archetypes but without any understanding of their flaws. I dunno, just felt kind of empty.",The Royal Tenenbaums
332,griffo-86546,"Pretentious, self-indulgent garbage",1,18 November 2020,"The Royal Tenenbaums is confused about what genre it wants to be:1. As a comedy, it fails, as despite a great line-up, the laughs are few and far between.2. As a drama, it fails, as the story is simply not interesting. A dysfunctional and quirky family full of completely unlikeable characters with various pursuits of differing success gather together in one house and some things happen to them. That is not only the premise, that is the entire plot.3. As a black comedy, it fails for two reasons. Firstly, refer 1 above. Secondly, if you're making a black comedy, a suicide attempt should either be implied or done in a silly or exaggerated way, for example, somebody tries to hang themselves and the rope breaks. What you don't do is shoot a highly graphic and realistic scene of a person slitting their wrists with a razor blade and blood pouring out followed by close-up, detailed shots of the aftermath including associated scars, stitches and bandages. Were we meant to laugh at that bit?I'm left wondering what was the point of the movie? It is implied at the very end of the movie that Royal Tenenbaum brought everybody together and that the family is so grateful for this, yet that is difficult to swallow given that most of the movie is dedicated to references to his poor parenting through decades of neglect, and continued failure in the movie where he manages to irritate everybody and lie to them leading to him being kicked out in disgrace. Somehow, against all logic, Royal manages to have some success in redeeming himself in the last 5 minutes of the movie, presumably for the sole purpose of setting up the closing shot.I don't know how anybody in their right mind could rate this movie a 10 or, even more unbelievably, claim it is the best movie that they have ever seen. I must have watched a different movie. Other reviewers are fawning over the colourful shots and the interesting props and backgrounds. I really wonder how that alone can be enough for them to praise this movie when other critical aspects are nothing short of woeful. If aesthetics are all that you care about, go ahead and watch the movie with the sound off. At least that way you won't be kidding yourself that there's something more to it.Another reviewer mentioned that when discussing this with others, they had to remind them of a couple of funny moments. They provided two quotes from the movie. If you have to remind people that a movie was funny by cherry-picking two isolated quotes, well, that is probably quite compelling evidence that the movie wasn't that funny.It's clear to me that this movie is the result of a director who is far too preoccupied with putting in the elements that he sees as necessary for his ego rather than making a movie that is entertaining for an audience. As for Owen Wilson, stick to acting. This Royal Tenenbaums is a very clear case of style over substance.",The Royal Tenenbaums
333,jickweez,the only joke's on you,1,11 January 2002,"The opposite of funny, this film is a cheap rip-off of 1977 TV's funny series, Soap. Gene Hackman is decent as a male counterpart to Katherine Helmond's more original matriarch, Jessica Tate. But the rest of the cast stumbles through this drivel, practically begging for laughs. Unfortunately, the only ones come at the audience's expense. Another lame installment in the much lacking American comedy diet.",The Royal Tenenbaums
334,stephenb,"Fine, meaty ensemble piece",9,24 July 2002,"Excellent performances by a strong cast, great dialogue, a whimsical style and some emotional depth make this a satisfying, entertaining and endearing film.  Gene Hackman and Angelica Houston deliver what we've come to expect, but Owen Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow surprised me with the depth and craft they brought to their roles.  I was only slightly disappointed by Ben Stiller who's role and performance seemed a little unidimensional.  The screeplay was excellent, giving the film the emotional substance and complexity of a stage play and along with the art direction, the whimsy of an Edward Gorey cartoon. One wishes one could be part of this eccentric New York family in their amazing victorian NY house, as much a character in the film as any actor, with all it's interesting stain glass windows, intricate staircases and pennant topped turrets.  All the characters are both likeable, neurotic and complex,  one wishes one could somehow become their friends and love them back to mental health overcoming the rend in their psyches from the breakup of the marriage of the patriarch and matriarch of this hurting but loving family. This film makes you appreciate your own family, your parents and your kids more, and forgive their foibles. This film could have benefited from a little more length used for some character development of some of the non-family roles (as hinted to in the cut scenes in the DVD).",The Royal Tenenbaums

The acting is very solid and attractive, especially Gene Hackman and Gwyenth Paltrow.  The movie is pretty funny, and definitely very quirky.But, what is the point?  Yes, it's about coming home and re-connecting, and it is very funny at points, and it is infused with an off-beat attitude towards a very dysfunctional family.  Hackman and Paltrow steal the show here.  They are both excellently cast; especially Hackman.  I couldn't imagine a better actor for this role.  He's great, as usual.  And Paltrow; that eyeliner is pretty wild.Ben Stiller left me really cold, though.  He's the weakest cast member, I think.Go see this if you, as I, like quirky films.

But as the film proceeded with the adult cast, I thought it became derailed. At the heart of my disappointment was the feeling that neither Ms. Paltrow nor Mr. Stiller (both of whom I have liked in other parts) were the right actors to have cast in the film.Ms. Paltrow tried hard but seemed like she was undergoing a particularly difficult scene in her advanced acting class. And I found Mr. Stiller stiff and wooden in his role. I did like Angelica Huston, Danny Glover, and Luke Wilson. Ms. Huston's experience and intelligence did credit to her character.

This time, however, i'm going to have to be that guy.  I watched this during the summer (in the middle of the night) and didn't enjoy it too much, i wasn't into the story, didn't care about the characters, and thought that the second half of the film was even more boring than the first.  My friend recently rented Tenenbaums again so i gave it another try and watched it at a reasonable hour.  Still, no dice.  The humor is too dry, there aren't any good laughs, and the story isn't even terribly original.  The acting is NOT superb, it might have been if the story had given the actors more to go on.  I got what the audience was supposed to be laughing at (theyre neurotic, right?) but i didn't find it funny.  Henry Sherman (Danny Glover) falling into a construction pit while having a conversation and the person he is talking to doesn't notice and continues on?  This was the ""brilliance"" everyone seems to get except for me?What i DID get this time was the direction was above par.

Luke proves to be an actor with some real talent unlike Owen.Gwyenth PaltrowGwyenth Paltrow has done some performances that didn't require muchacting talent, this however is not one of them. This is a dark characterwhich adds to the more realistically humorous side to the film.The Film ItselfThere's a great blend of humor in this, subtle humor, slapstick humor,black humor and witty humor. Each actor contributes to one of those certain categorizes. Wes Anderson uses great camera-work and cuts tokeep us involved and entertained. The darker and more realistic situationsmade the film more memorable than the absurd unrealistic situations. The sets are greatly detailed, especially the scene in the closet. However the best part of The Royal Tennenbaums is without a doubt the perfect cast.The Bad:Owen WilsonHe was over the top in his fairly uncomical portrayal of Eli Cash. I felt Owen Wilson's job in the film was to draw in a more mainstream audience that would come to see Owen Wilson films.Ben StillerThe character Ben Stiller played was unrealistic, over-dramatic and stereotypical. He's not a likable character, but neither was Royal Tennenbaum but if Ben Stiller was half the actor Gene Hackmanwas he could've made us sympathize him. He didn't.The Film ItselfOne part of this film that brings it down a little are the unrealistic situations. There's a fine line between an over-the-top situation that's funny and an over-the-top situation that's funny because you're stillin a state of confusion. There are a few parts in The Royal Tennenbaums that are an Olympic-gold-medal-of-a jump over that fine line. Another problem with this film is the originality of the concept.

So do Ben Stiller and Gwyneth Paltrow. The rest of the cast are not bad either. The editing and cinematography are very nice, and so is the soundtrack. The narrator is a nice touch too.But one thing is missing in this movie, which is the first and most important element of a movie: A STORY. Most movies try to tell a story, which is the centerpiece of what this art tries to communicate to the audience. This film seems to try, in vain. There's no story here! It was so boring to watch, and on top of that, the dialog is so lame! I expect that's a result of trying to fill 105 minutes with something other than music.Film making is an art.

Harlan,Just the best,9,1 March 2002,"Indie, or quasi-indie, American cinema is just as concerned with underexplored places and feelings as French or Iranian cinema (don't listen to the critics, American cinema is fantastic and rough these days).  The Royal Tenenbaums, sort of caught in time and place (what decade is it really?  where are they really?) and between their ""thought and expression,"" (lots of VU on the soundtrack) are prime examples of that American mystery.Maybe the quest for auteurishness is self-conscious--it thematically and aesthetically fits together too well--and a bit distracting, but there are some fascinating, emotive things at work here.  Some obvious symbolism, broken limbs, climbing up buildings, childish clothing, the book motif for people who don't know much about themselves, whatever, is still moving.And the humor, well, who wants to take the pains of rich geniouses THAT seriously.  They're not starving to death.  They're intelligent, but very normal.  Well, Wes Anderson's normal.  Second city America normal.

345,J. Harlan,Rebuttal to littlesiddie,9,16 March 2002,"First and foremost, I would say that the Royal Tenenbaums mocks hyper-successful urban hipsters more than it celebrates or attempts to appeal to them.   I mean, look at these people; they're ultimately not successful, they haven't done much with their genius, and their money has kept them so emotionally sheltered that they are 30-year-old wounded and alienated children.It's not a cruel indictment--there's little point in being nasty unless you're a Marxist.  It's more of a modern half-parody like the Simpsons-we're morons, we've done some things wrong, but we're good people with ultimately typical problems (growing up, expectations, parents, sexuality, intellectual and emotional focus, loss).  If the performances seemed strained, it was because these people were emotional midgets.  And I also think that is why the music, scenery, location and wardrobe were all so ambiguous--the Tennenbaums were basically children living in a mess of experiences from the 70's, 80's, 90's, and 00's.I don't think this is a postmodern attack on literature at all.  I think the book metaphor was just to highlight the gap between their intellectual and emotional selves.  That's why they all ultimately failed intellectually--their emotional selves had never been looked after.  And I think Anderson is trying to say that that sort of hollow intellectualism, that a heart without a head, is useless. It is a documentation and reconciliation with a way that a lot of people live.",The Royal Tenenbaums
346,EddieVilliers,Excellent picture.,9,19 November 2006,"The Royal Tenenbaums is a film that needs to be seen several times over. I have done just that and reason is that there seems to be layers to the film and its characters that you just don't get the first time you see it.The Royal Tenenbaums is the chronicle of the Tenenbaum family consisting of the patriarch Royal (Gene Hackman), the matriarch Etheline (Anjelica Houston) and their three genius children - two sons Chas (Ben Stiller) and Richi (Luke Wilson) and an adopted daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow). Chas is fitness-obsessed international financial wizard, Richi is a born athlete who has won numerous US National Tennis champions trophy and Margot is an avid reader and playwright who won a substantial prize for a school play. Richi's best friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) lives in the building next to the Tenenbaum's place and is more or less a part of the family.The story begins with Royal announcing to his young children that he is separating from the her and moving out of the family home to respect their mother's request. Overt the next 20 years all traces of genius of the Tenenbaum children is lost to Royal's abandonment of the family and several other events. Chas is still the financial wizard but has lost his wife dies in a plane crash. Richi (a.k.a The Baumer) has retired from professional tennis and Margot is married to an intellectual Raliegh St.Claire. Eli becomes a bestselling author.Chas is having a nervous breakdown after his wife's death which affects his two sons and their dog. Richi has retired from competitive tennis because of an on-field meltdown and is traveling around the globe on an ocean-liner and is visibly depressed. Margot's marriage to Raleigh is suffering. Eli's behavior is strange and Richi suspects that Eli has a drug habit.This is the information that the narrative (excellent voice over work by Alec Baldwin) provides us in the first 15 minutes or so of the film. That's the signature of the entire film - the reasons why each character is the way he/she is is provided slowly but surely in the dialogs and the narration.When I mentioned that every time you watch the movie, you will learn is that Etheline's character is very important and the first time you watch the movie the gravitas of the character is not quite revealed. She is the anchor of the family - the one dependable person in the family that everyone turns to. Even though Eli is not really family he keeps sending clippings of his work to Etheline to get some encouragement. When I watch this film I always think of an old Robin Williams movie - The World According to Garp. The story has strange twists, but draws the viewer to the sadness, loneliness, frustration and desperation that each of the characters feel and remains very sympathetic to each characters.The direction is top-notch none of the scenes are melodramatic, acting remains very believable. The normally over-exuberant Ben Stiller turns in a very solid performance. The depressed and heart broken Luke Wilson's Richi is by far the most humane character - he understands the pain that his siblings, parents, friends are going through and is always sympathetic to all of them, giving them another chance, never judging them realizing that he could be let down by them as in the past. Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent in her portrayal of the secretive Margot. Bill Murray's turn as the husband loosing his wife to reasons he dosen't understand and through no fault of his is very touching. Anjelica Houston's Etheline as the pragmatic, self-sacrificing Rock Of Gibraltor of the Tenenbaum family is the most understated performance of the entire cast. Danny Glover's Henry is not really developed to a great extent but he executes the role with great sensitivity to the pain of Etheline's children and understandably great distrust towards Royal. Finally, Gene Hackman as Royal, the brash, irascible, insensitive, conceited man who does not care for his family is excellent.All in all and excellent if script aided by equally great direction and excellent acting by a top notch cast making this a great movie experience.Trivia: I am sure I am not the only one who has noticed it, but every chapter in the movie always begins with Royal and how his actions affect the character of the chapter.",The Royal Tenenbaums
347,alexanderjallan,More of this pleeeeeease!,10,22 March 2002,"With all the mediocre films that flood the cinemas now, this film was a refreshing break from dull scripts and soppy character development- like in Pearl Harbour and in other large budget mainstream films (this being the main problem).  Hollywood is just getting too big and basic, relying on special effects and big stars like Russel Crowe to pull the crowds. However, in saying this, there are several big stars in the Royal Tenenbaums but the story is original, and complex enough to compliment the script development, which can be very sharp.  Note the rather endearing underacting of some of the actors but, which fits the characters well and makes you like them even more.Despite not liking Gene Hackman much, his performance was very good and I may be influenced by my attraction to Gwyneth Paltrow, in liking this film but I would recommend this to people tired of the lacklustre hollywood films.",The Royal Tenenbaums

350,dinesh_cena1989,Engaging and brilliant,8,20 July 2007,"Wes Anderson is a director I don't want to be seen talking about but this film by him, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS. A comedy that isn't a comedy and a film turned inside out. One of the weirdest and most interesting films I've seen and could be a re-birth of 1964's DR. STRANGELOVE (in terms of the comedy of course).Royal Tenenbaum and his wife Ethleine are parents to Richie, Margot and Chas. Chas is a child genius who is heavily involved with real estate and finance and knows it inside out. Margot is a playwright and Richie is a tennis professional, winning the US Nationals three years in a row. When Royal and Ethleine separate, everything goes downhill. Royal looses the respect he deserves from his family, well so he feels (especially for Chas, whom he feels doesn't appreciate him at all). Royal then fakes a heart attack so all members of the broken family and get together to spend time together and re-bond as he fakes his sickness. The whole film is one speechless outcome.Gene Hackman (whom I fondly remember from THE FRENCH CONNECTION) takes on a very unexpected role as the bumbly Royal, Angelica Houston plays his Etheliene, the woman who left him and goes to have an affair with another man. Gwyneth Paltrow takes on the role of Margot, the character who is secretive and some what a loner. Ben Stiller goes on for the part of Chas, the over-protective parent of Ari and Uri, his two sons. There are certainly many more people who are credited for this film but these few actors made the film how special it is in terms of comedy.Director Wes Anderson did something with the genre of comedy I can't even explain. He twisted it in such away, it doesn't even become comedy. It's plain quirky and weird but I guess, this is what makes the film an eye-opener, it questions how hard do you intend to respect comedy?? Loved this film and though many might not like, for those who do, we certainly speak the same language. Throughly recommended anyway.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Gene Hackman, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Danny Glover, Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray all combined to make a movie that makes `Ishtar' look like `Godfather II'.Sometime during the months it took to produce this colossal disaster, wouldn't you think that someone would have tapped someone else on the shoulder and said, `This Emperor has no clothes!'People were leaving the theater in total dismay, having stayed through the whole performance, as did we, just to be fair!Talk about bombs!

People expecting a typical commercial film where Ben Stiller makes them guffaw maybe won't like it.Gene Hackman deserved the Oscar for his nuanced role.

354,samlane86,The Royal Tenenbaums,9,5 January 2011,"I've watched this film several times over the years. It was my introduction to the films of Wes Anderson. I've heard many people complain about his movies because they are to slow or boring or not funny. He does definitely have his own unique style and pace that takes some getting used to. I've had to for some of his other films, but The Royal Tenenbaums is always one I've loved from the start.My first viewing was after borrowing it, along with several other random films whose names escape me at the moment, from my sister and her husband. I loved Anderson's brilliant writing and dialogue. I loved the cast and their characters (with Little Fockers in theatres now, which also stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, I can't help but think ""Why can't they make more movies like Tenenbaums and less like Fockers?"") and the way they refer to each other at times. Gene Hackman calling his children ""my darlings"" and ""my sweet boy"" are my favorite instances of this. And I loved the shot of Mordecai, Richie's pet hawk, flying across the cityscape upon his first release with The Rolling Stones ""Ruby Tuesday"" playing triumphantly in the background. To this day, that remains one of my favorite shots in, not just this movie, but any movie.I have since bought my own copy of the film after that magical first viewing. I've shared it with my other sister. And this afternoon, I showed it to my dad. Periodically throughout the movie he would say something to the extent of ""this is crazy"". This is quite an appropriate and accurate assessment. Much of what happens in The Royal Tenenbaums and many of it's character's actions can be defined as crazy, very much so. But what the hey? So often, life IS crazyCheck out my other reviews and whatnot at: notexactlyaquote.tumblr.com",The Royal Tenenbaums

356,adogg90,Fantastic and clever,10,20 June 2004,"When I first saw the commercial for this film, I thought it would be a goofy family movie. Then when I saw it, it struck me as a goofy family movie, but in a realistic way. You can see a dysfunctional family in this structure, which makes the characters more enjoyable.I also like how it did these split-second flashbacks of moments to give a general idea of what happened in a moment that was being described.This is another movie which has wonderful ensemble casting. The relationship between each character is amusing and understandable. Each character is important to the plot and the film. Anderson knew this, and made sure you could tell and have an emotion to each character.Bottom line: The ""Northern Exposure"" of movies 10/10",The Royal Tenenbaums
357,freddythreepwood,To what consequence?,4,22 December 2004,"Some movies stick in your mind because they are good. Some others because they are bad. Very few manage to persist because they are of no consequence, and yet are highly touted. The Royal Tenenbaums achieves this latter distinction very well.What I got out of it was a story that pretty much runs in any average household. Marriage, divorce, estranged kids, remarriage, angst, falling in love, falling out of love, etc.The blurb claims that the movie has an underlying theme of redemption - the divorced father trying to get back to his family, not so much for reasons of love, but rather for material gain (he is flat broke). His trying to wheedle back in with his wife and kids requires him to try his best to sabotage his ex-wife's relationship with her other prospective suitor. Eventually, he realizes that that won't cut it, because he's pretty much a cur deep down inside, just as he was when he got divorced the first time.Well, it doesn't really make for a movie, in my opinion. Maybe a chapter in someone's journal (which is kind of what the movie is based on, BTW). There are a few kinks thrown in, such as hints of incest (if step-siblings can be considered candidates for incest), an interracial relationship, promiscuity, drug addiction, an Indian manservant, etc. Unfortunately, none of these seem to blend in with much conviction or harmony, and simply come across as tedium-relieving contraptions, and don't really mean much otherwise.I've read other reviews that this is a ""dark comedy"". I've pondered it, but to me, it was neither dark nor comedic. All said and done, I'm kind of bewildered why Criterion backed this one. This simply does not contain enough artistic originality to make the cut, in my opinion.",The Royal Tenenbaums
358,mrfabulous1025,A mess,1,9 January 2014,"I guess by some of the reviews here that I am not the only person who thinks Wes Anderson is a lousy director. This thing is tediously miscast, poorly constructed, and unbelievably pretentious. The hype this movie got shows the incompetence of a number of our ""best"" critics who can't seem to see the total inadequacies of this misdirected garbage. This disaster shows that even with a large talent pool and gifted artists you can completely ruin a roll of film. Disappointment as word doesn't even hint at how poorly this piece of fiction has been handled. I see the characters and wonder how they would come off with actors who fit the parts and had a family resemblance. It would have also been nice if the period feel of the piece had been fully realized. The ethnic background of the main figures seems to be avoided and the behavior is highly irregular in some instances, not even close to real human emotion. It would great to see this story remade by someone who knew what he was doing. This is like a bad high school play version of good literature. I can easily compare its wrongness to the casting of Carrie Underwood in Sound of Music. This stuff stinks. It like all other Wes Anderson films is also boring.",The Royal Tenenbaums
359,hcrsteeves,a family of geniuses,8,9 September 2005,"I bought a copy of this film on VHS without having seen it. I watched it twice before I actually began to like it. This is an enjoyable film although it doesn't exactly jump out at you. You may not be sure at first if it is a comedy or drama and, to be honest, I'm not sure if I could classify it as either one. It is funny but in a quiet subtle way. All of the characters are quite odd, and the patriarch of the family, played almost perfectly by Gene Hackman, is a jerk, but not so much that he isn't likable. He loves his family but never seems to say or do the right thing. With a cast that also includes Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow and Bill Murray (palying a character it seems only Murray could play) this is a film that requires some patience on the part of the viewer but it's well worth it in my opinion. The DVD is a 2 disc set. The first disc is the film and the second contains extras including 2 trailers for the film, interviews with the major cast members and more.",The Royal Tenenbaums

From this point on everything else goes right down into the dumpster. For the first 40% of the film, the aura of depression permeates the screen. Even the music is dirge like, which adds to the film's major flaws, a lack of consistent writing and directing. It's like owning a stable of racehorses and all you can do is ram them into each other aimlessly. Bill Murray and Gene Hackman could have mailed their performances in.

The world must be upside down for a movie like this reach the 250 best films in IMDB and a masterpiece like Alain Resnais's ""Je T'Aime Je T'Aime"" don't even get a last place.

Because a movie is ""boring"" doesn't make it a bad movie (2001 is extremely ""boring,"" but is one of the few movies I would consider perfect). This is not meant to be a laugh-a-minute comedy.  It is (much like Rushmore) a comedic drama.  From a movie-making perspective, Tenenbaums is top-notch. Great editing, cinematography, writing, and use of music.  Likewise the acting was very good.  The only place were this movie fell a little short was that it seemed to me that it tried to be like Rushmore too much (given it's the same director, but Bottle Rocket wasn't visually similar to Rushmore like this one is).  This hardly detracts from the movie's good points, and there really is so much to love about the film in general. Overall, I give the film a 8.5/10.",The Royal Tenenbaums
364,Xanthippe,Quirky Subtlety Appreciated!,9,10 January 2002,"I was torn when I saw Rushmore.  I couldn't decide whether to like it because of its humor or hate it because of its perversely obstinate strangeness.  There's no such problem with Tenenbaums.  It's still strange, but it's not off-putting, as, in my opinion, Rushmore was.Don't get me wrong.  This is not a movie for the common crowd.  It will not be universally admired.  On the other hand, Titanic was universally admired, and so was Gladiator.  Neither of those two films will ever, in my opinion, hold a candle to this one.The glory of Tenenbaums is its characters; it is character-motivated and character driven.  Therefore I see people on this complaining that there was no plot.  On the contrary, I could easily sum up the plot in two lines.  I don't think this is an intellectual's movie; the jokes don't depend on having a certain IQ or shoe size.  They don't depend on being a certain age, either.  They do depend on having a certain sense of humor.  If you didn't like or understand movies like O Brother Where Art Thou? or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels you may not have the requisitely original (and in my opinion, rare) sense of humor to enjoy this movie.However, blaming it on the movie would truly be a mistake, as there are a lot of people who enjoyed it profusely.  There are some hilarious moments in this movie:  the tic-tac, the pictures of Margot, the mice, Royal's chosen epitaph.This isn't a movie for intellectuals.  It is a movie for subtle people. (Those two things are not the same.)  If you can appreciate the humor involved when a Klan rally prances around like the flying monkeys from Wizard of Oz (O Brother Where Art Thou) or the humor involved when a gangster father chastises his son for swearing while taking his son to work with him (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), you may not like this movie. The jokes will not come up and hit you upside the head.  They prefer to sneak up on you like a certain variety of cute, spotted rodents.",The Royal Tenenbaums

This film about a selfish, unkindly caring and depressive family that are truly dysfunctional in every sense of the word. Their world is the same as ours, but from a very different perspective. Wes' style of films are a kind of organized mess. Where pain, depression, love, hate, petty crime and shallowness are meshed together to make a perfect experience and depiction of strange people and their eccentric ways to love. Most would consider The Royal Tenenbaums Wes' magnum opus thus far, and I would not be one to disagree although Rushmore is my personal favorite. Each and every character gets enough screen time for you to either love them, hate them or have a slew of very mixed-yet-strong feelings for these characters. Whether or not you like them, you care. At the end of the film, I found myself immediately laughing and crying at the same moment, and that is no exaggeration in any way. Wes Anderson is my favorite director because he mixes such deep, profound drama with subtle, smart humor. Sometimes just one line in his film can make you feel both humor and sorrow. Exactly and only one line in this film set of my hysterical laughing with my hysterical crying.

Its a story of how a man, who's never really cared about his family, sort of atones for his wrongs, to help his family out of their misery. The long and short of it is that it's quite a different movie, one which might not have broken all sorts of records at the box office, or might not be cherished by many a people as their favorite movie, but I liked it, for it instills in the viewers, a real nice attitude towards life, and even in a sad ending, it ends on a positive note.",The Royal Tenenbaums

It had a cast of great stars including Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Bill Murray and Danny Glover.  It was co-written by Owen Wilson, typically a very funny actor whom I loved in Shanghai Noon and Zoolander.It was just sad.

I think it demonstrated perfectly how the most serious events in life can sometimes seem mundane & even humorous and the lesser incidents (e.g. Royal criticising Margot's play) can take on such huge significance in someone's life.I don't really see it as some Addams Family farce - the comedy came from the script and the meticulous attention-to-detail in the sets and costumes (e.g. the dogfight spectators 25 years' on, black tracksuits at the funeral), but the dead-pan performances added an element of pathos which made me want to watch it all again to see what I'd missed.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Since I am VERY economic with my time, I rarely rent poor movies.  Yes, I miss some good ones, but I almost never find myself watching a movie I thoroughly dislike.  I've only shut off one or two movies mid-way, and I almost shut TRT off.
I thought the screenplay was weak, and the ""style"" of the film was off. Devices I didn't like included the overt ""chaptering"" of the film, and the expository method chosen to introduce the characters. The casting was strange: Bill Murray in a small, unfunny role (at which I thought he did well), or Ben Stiller in a tense dramatic role (at which I thought he did poorly).The entire effort smelled too much like a private joke.  Apparently the Wilson brothers and the director have known each other for years, so I guess this was a vanity effort.  You know the script isn't very witty when the costumes are supposed to get laughs: characters wear the same outfit throughout their lives, for example, and for a funeral red sweat suits are replaced by black ones, ha ha ha.I gave it a ""2"" only because I respect Hackman and Huston too much to push the key with the ""1"" on it.

Not at all.People don't behave as they do in this movie, at least not on planet Earth they don't.What were we supposed to take from this film? Bad parenting can lead to screwed up kids?And this is a fresh insight ... how?Anderson fills his cast with excellent actors, and then refuses to allow them the freedom and latitude to actually go to work and find and express some honest emotional truth in their characters. Only the always dependable Gene Hackman manages to create an identifiable human being, in spite of the trappings they seek to impose on him. For instance the scene where he talks about having his life saved in India by the Tenenbaum's Indian butler -- or whatever he is. Royal had been stabbed by the butler who was seeking a bounty; instead the butler had a change of heart and rushed Royal to a hospital. This is a prime example of cute and ultimately bad writing. It says nothing about humans because it is incident that has never happened ever to a real human being, nor will it ever happen. It is a writer's conceit only. Too clever. The film suffers for it; it is but one of dozens of such transgressions.Anderson populates his films with human cartoons, then would have us believe he is filling us in on actual human behavior. There is nothing wrong with the human cartoon approach -- Dr. Strangelove leaps to mind -- But that film uses the humans to lampoon human short-sidedness and lack of self-awareness.For the life of me, I can't figure out what points Anderson is trying to make in this film.2 out of 10; film is boring, pretentious and tedious.",The Royal Tenenbaums

It was not a comedic masterpiece as portrayed by so many preveiws, or even what i would classify as a comedy. Yes parts were good for a chuckle and the like but nothing truly hilarious. Each and every character seemed incredibly well fleshed out despite their unusually high numbers. i saw (in other comments here)complaints about how they [the reviewer] didn't care about any of the characters and there were too many, but i found that quite not true (perhaps because my last veiwing was that of Gosford Park).Anyway i've gotten off track. I'm writing this because in reading other comments i saw no mention of the 2 things that botherred me throughout the film...they weren't awful things but i found them to be a hinderance to my veiwing.The first of which was the voice of the narrator. It struck me as a very non-narrator voice...it didn't sound good or anything to be described as positive...i believe it to be that of Alec Baldwin and thought it just plain bad, i'm probably alone here now that i think about it.
Anyway my next (maybe more valid) complaint is that of the music. Similar to the narrator complaint but with some possible explanation to it...i thought the music almost never went with what was happening in the story and was far too ubiquitous (look at my fancy word). It seemed to be going so often that you more noticed it when it was not playing than anything else.

I waited for cable, and boy am I glad I didn't pay for this one.I've only walked out of one film I paid for in my whole life (Ready to Wear), but had I paid for this, I would have walked out.The opening of the film was genius, but it deteriorated rapidly.  This film was boring, pretentious, dull, and an overall waste of two perfectly good hours of one's life.  I couldn't believe that this many good actors would sign on to this script.  What were they thinking?  One has to assume that either they read another script and it was changed, or that they were offered god-awful sums of money to participate in this fiasco.How this rates a 7.6 out of 10, I'll never guess.  Who is rating this thing above a 5?  I gave it a 4.  I would only recommend that you watch this if you are incredibly bored and there is nothing else on cable.This film wants to be an art film, but it fails.  One of my friends who is an avid film buff once told me: ""I love well done films, but sometimes directors get so full of themselves that they create an overly pretentious mouthpiece for their supposed genius.""  This is just such a film.  I got the feeling that Wes Anderson was giving his best attempt to demonstrate his infallible genius rather than to actually make a great film. 
If you want to see a great film...in the kind of genre and tone this film wanted to be...then I sincerely recommend you watch Being John Malkovich or Adaptation instead.  Charlie Kaufmann is a genius, but after seeing The Royal Tenenbaums, I have to conclude that Wes Anderson wanted to prove he could do something on the same level as Being John Malkovich, and made an incredibly dull film instead.Okay, so enough ranting....  On the good side, the costumes are entertaining, the sets are unusual, and the actors turn in decent performances given that they had utter garbage to work with in the script.",The Royal Tenenbaums
376,DrMoonlight,Real characters in a fictional world.,9,9 January 2002,"From the outset of The Royal Tenenbaums, there are no qualms made about the fictionality of the characters and story we are watching on screen. The movie is presented as a book, much like old animated Disney movies, except that, in those cases, they were based on a real book.  In The Royal Tenenbaums, even the book is fictional.  We are reminded of this at regular intervals by an extreme close up of a chapter heading and the first few lines of a page describing the scene we are about to see. Furthermore, despite the fact that the year is identified clearly as 2001, all of the characters seem to insist on existing in a strange year that never happened in the late seventies and early eighties.  This not only applies to the major characters, who have the excuse that they are trying to reclaim their childhood, but to every fringe character and all of the extras.  This extends beyond the pastel, retro clothes we saw in the preview.  Nobody seems to have noticed that things have been invented during the last twenty years: nobody has cellular phones, or even cordless phones, people send paper mail, Ari and Uzi, members of the youngest Tenenbaum generation keep books for their father's business using notebooks and paper and what looks like a four-function calculator.  People still listen to vinyl in this movie. To everybody's credit, all of the devices which intentionally prevent us from forgetting even momentarily that we are watching fiction do nothing to keep us from caring about and usual feeling pity for the characters. The fact that these characters do not exist makes it no less horrible to see their continually destructive behavior.  Gwyneth Paltrow is especially wonderful as Margot.  She manages to portray several distinct and intense emotions using only one facial expression throughout the entire movie.  I hope it inspires the Academy to begin a special awards category for most utilitarian acting. Among a lesser cast, Paltrow might have stolen the show, but the entire cast is so excellent, and each character is so well-developed that it is hard to give special mention to individuals.  However, it must be said that Gene Hackman gives a nearly flawless performance. The casting of the young counterparts of the Tenenbaum children is marvelous, lending great continuity to the film.

The subtle humor somewhat makes me think of Gary Larsons famous comic ""The Far Side"". All do not like it, but the ones who do like it, likes it a lot. But regardless of weather you like the script or not, you cannot discard the greatness of this film. No words can describe the brilliance of the acting this ensemble preform. This film has no flaws.

379,dwblurb,Dire,1,17 June 2002,"I usually avoid mainstream American so-called 'comedies', but went to see this one after hearing good word-of-mouth comments. I should have trusted my instincts. Described elsewhere as a 'quirky dark comedy', the director evidently forgot that quirky and dark do not on their own produce comedic elements. It is definitely quirky, but the 'quirkiness' feels forced, as though Anderson felt that to make up for tedious and virtually non-existent storyline he would have to inject another element into the film. It fails dismally. Even the quirkyness falls away towards the end as the inevitable American scenes of redemption are introduced. Where is the motivation for Royal to suddenly start to look out for someone apart from number one after apparently not having given a fig for the previous twenty years? The constant voice-over throughout the interminable introductory scenes is also most irritating.One may have felt some engagement with the characters had they had any genuine problems. Instead, they come across as merely indulgent rich Americans who need a good kick up the bum to get their life into order. What terrible crises precipitate their decline? If there are any, they are certainly not explained.One cannot fault the performances, and indeed Gene Hackman even manages to provide a spark of interest to his character. One day, however, Hollywood might discover the importance of a script rather than special effects, or in the case of The Royal Tenenbaums, merely a gimmick.1/10",The Royal Tenenbaums

Both movies have narratives about the people in a similar odd way, with a sort of comic book childishness to it. Both got released only one month apart in the same year, 2001.First I thought Hollywood had tried to copy the french one, since Hollywood is constantly doing remakes of foreign movies, and then adjust them to the US market (ex 3 men and a baby, kill bill, and hundreds of others). But clearly no one has been trying to copy anyone in this case since both movies were done in the same year, even released almost at the same time!

I guess even the best and funniest actors can't salvage a script that has no substance, and that goes nowhere. Going nowhere fast would have been one thing, but this one goes nowhere all too slowly. It seems to never end, and the only payoff is that the whole, jumbled mess is finally over. Gwyneth Paltrow is especially annoying in this movie, as is Stiller.

I'll never know. After an hour of flat, insipid, self-indulgent crap I put my eyes, ears and brain out of their collective misery and pressed STOP. My theory on the production of this film is as follows: that gifted auteur, Mr Anderson, secretly scanned my brain and detected all the things that I find funny, moving or intellectually stimulating- he then ensured that his film included none of these features. He then double-checked for all the things that I find boring, crass, pretentious and irritating and ensured that all of these features were emphatically stressed in his shooting script.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Put all together, this is something special. I could be feeling awful, but this movie will put me back in a special place in time. And, I love Anderson's unique take on reality. Reality is what you make it. It's not absolute; rather, it's relative. He gets that, and the people who love this movie get that, too.

This is not to say that ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is not a good movie. It is a sweet diversion, though meandering at times. The story plays like one of John Updike's more lighthearted novels, with its caring depiction of the intricate dysfuntions of a family of geniuses. Kudos to the actors, who all are cast perfectly. Were these roles written with each of these folks in mind? Seems like it. Gwyneth is especially fine as willfully neglected and secretly rebellious Margot Tenenbaum. Music choices are great, as usual with Anderson's films (more of Mark Mothersbaugh's tickly score cues would've been nice). My only real beef is that it didn't quite make my moviegoing heart sing the way ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore"" did. Maybe if Anderson had focused a bit more on one or two characters, as opposed to trying to give each family member equal time, it might have been more emotionallly affecting.

Written and directed by the same people who put out the brilliant Rushmore three years ago, and Bottle Rocket before that, the pedigrees were in place for a brilliant followup.Royal Tenenbaum (played by Gene Hackman) is the head of an estranged family, curiously full of child prodigies, who brings them all together when he announces he is terminally ill.    The cast in this film is stellar. Angelica Huston as his ex-wife, Danny Glover as her new boyfriend, Ben Stiller, Gwynneth Paltrow and Luke Wilson as their children, how can you possibly go wrong?<polite pause>Well, I don't know either, but somehow, somewhere, this movie lost its' way. Despite (very) occasional moments of brilliance, for the most part, I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of them.  Unfortunately if you're going to try and tell a clever, witty, character-driven family dramedy, that's just a death sentence.   For the better part of two hours, the movie just plods along, never really doing anything, or showing us anything interesting in these many people's lives.And that's a shame, because with the talent available in this film, the Tenenbaums could have been one hell of an amusing family.",The Royal Tenenbaums

But when I was reading the other comments, I read that some people dislike it because they can't relate to the Tenenbaums. Why do you have to relate? Why do people always make a big deal about that? The point of movies like this one, is that you look from the outside and be glad you can't relate.And the ending was too happy. Everything came nicely together and everyone had wath they wanted. But that's a typical Hollywood error, the problem is that most people like it. But if you look at the greatest films like Dr. Strangelove, Requiem for a dream, The Sixth Sence, No Mans Land, American Beauty,... None of them have a happy ending.

The script, locations, design and ""feel"" are all top notch.  Most importantly, the cast is AMAZING.  They all deliver rock solid performances, making you believe this movie is actually peering into the dysfunctional Tenenbaum household.

And now that I've seen it, I can't wait to go see it again. I'm sure this movie will be talked about for a long time coming and deservedly so. Early on in the movie, one would think that Wes Anderson was reverting back to his dark comedic roots (Rushmore, Bottle Rocket) but the reality of it is that this movie is a completely different animal. One knock on Anderson I have heard in the past is that his pacing leaves a little to be desired, but in my opinion that is where his genius lies.  He strays away from the standardized three act form of screenplay and concentrates more on just telling a kick ass story. The story is about Royal Tennenbaum (Gene Hackman) trying to assemble some type of relationship with his dysfunctinally brilliant family of old before he dies?. What stuck out with me in this movie was the lack of emotional attachment that everyone showed to one and other. It is almost to a fault until Royal drips just a bit of feeling into the movie and then every member of the brilliant cast gets to respond to this new found sense of expression. I never thought I'd see a movie where Ben Stiller made me cried, Gene Hackman made up for Heist and Gwenyth Paltrow shined without smiling.

Rushmore, (I understand was written by the same people) was kind of wierd and I didn't really understand it, but this film is a new addition to my top ten.

True, I wouldn't sport a red sweatsuit everyday but his reaction to his father's favoritism was endearing and his character evoked the most empathy.

What's amazing about this film is that they have gone from making ""Bottle Rocket"" with only a supporting performance by a washed up star (James Caan, who's great nonetheless) and now attracted one of the best casts imaginable (Hackman, Paltrow, Stiller, Murray, Glover, Huston) while upping the ante of creativity instead of selling out. It's amazing how all of the characters have an incredible amount of quirks while remaining totally believable and touching. Hackman breaks out of his rut of playing crusty authority figures and creates a one-of-a-kind character that is fully realized and funny.

403,LordDave,"A very touching, interesting movie",9,23 January 2002,"I'm amused by the people who are dismissively claiming that they ""get it"", and then proceed to reveal how little they understand about the film. First of all, this is not a film to be ""gotten"".  If you are leaning forward in your seat and squinting at the screen, trying your best to understand the method behind the madness, you need to relax. This is a simple, touching portrait of a family in (extended) crisis.  What makes Gene Hackman's character so different from any emotionally distant father?  Why is Margot so different from your neighbor's goth-style depressed sister? It's a very simple look at the dynamics of a family (presented elegantly in the odd sort of book form), that happens to involve some ""geniuses"", which in this case means eccentrics.  Certainly, the laughs come most often from the quirkiness of the characters.  But that's not the important thing. To say you ""get"" this movie, and then proceed to complain that it didn't make you laugh out loud, is silly.  This is not Joe Somebody, or some brainless ""look, man fall down"" giggle-fest. This movie defies category.  Rushmore had a similar quality to it, although that excellent film is a little closer to being a clear-cut comedy than The Royal Tenenbaums is. In regards to the ""cardboard cutout characters"" that you can't relate to: If you can't identify with Ben Stiller's character's loss, or Eli's longing to fit in, or Gene Hackman's revelation that he has wasted long years in self-imposed exile from his family, then you're looking to hard for laughs. Or you aren't human.  I'm tired of movies that show me an average-guy protagonist that is supposed to be just like me, expecting that I will identify with his very blandness, and love him for it.  I can identify with the Tenenbaums, because they have the same problems us ""normal people"" do, and the same family struggles.  They just happen to be more fun to watch. That doesn't diminish the pathos at all.  In fact, I think it highlights it. You want these amusing people to be happy.  Because you yourself want to be happy. If you want to watch a ""comedy"" or a ""drama"", or a ""thriller"" or some other prepackaged genre of movie, pick out any of the usual patronizing Hollywood productions. That all being said, I obviously enjoyed this movie.  It made me think, smile, feel, and want to go back and see it again.  I gave it a 9/10, because it wasn't perfect, and I liked Rushmore better, but on a second viewing, that rating might increase.  Please go see it.  If you end up hating it, fine.  But give it a chance.  By the way, did anybody notice the odd ways they played with the size of certain characters in the movie?  Especially Margot.

404,Chi-Town-2,An absolute gem...in MY opinion,10,30 December 2001,"WOW. After reading all these reviews, I think everyone will fit into one of these groups after seeing ""The Royal Tenenbaums"":A) You will love this movie with all your heart. Not for the humor, or the people starring in it, but for the wonderfully filmed details, the subtle nuiances of the script, and the unique 'environment' that Wes Anderson created in this little world.  Each actor is slotted into a specific character for a reason, and portays them to perfection.B) You will be disappointed, because you were expecting a slapstick comedy after seeing the previews, and don't have the flexibility to change gears and simply recognize good moviemaking.  You probably thought 'Rush Hour 2' was a good film.C) You will complain that it isn't as good as RUSHMORE or BOTTLE ROCKET. Come on! Don't base it against those classics.  Base it against the other 1,000+ movies that have come out over the past three years. This one certainly ranks high, considering the excellent balance of emotion, visual artistry, humor, and HEART that you were fortunate to sit through for two hours.We should all go to the movies demanding QUALITY entertainment for our $8, and the entire crew gave us just that.  Their love and caring shows throughout. If you enjoyed it, then I think you are someone who understands that gems like this should be appreciated for what they are, and thanked God you weren't spending your money and time on another ""Pearl Harbor"" or ""Saving Silverman"".",The Royal Tenenbaums
405,Chi-Town-2,You will LOVE it or HATE it,10,14 July 2002,"This movie stays low key, and hits on a lot of levels with a lot of characters.

OR, you will grip the steering wheel tight and feel the anxiety that comes with not going faster.Apparently there are two definite sides here:  those who think this film is a gem, and those who think it is a waste of time.   I personally thought it was great, precious, and wonderfully done.  BUT, had I gone in expecting something more funny (ie. ""Meet The Parents"") I would have been disappointed.Either way, its a flavor that is definitely worth tasting.

406,killergawp,Thank you Wes Anderson! The film is brilliant!,9,27 December 2001,"I think if someone tries to watch a Wes Anderson film, they have to have a certain kind mind to understand the real meaning of them. After being awed by the Royal Tenenbaums, I left with a certain kind of joy that only a great film can give me. It's like flying an electric kite, it's that hard of a buzz. As I began my travel down the stairs of the theater, I heard this couple talking about how stupid the movie was, and how they are going to ask for a refund. I suddenly smiled, because I hoped that they would get one. I think that I got something out of the film that they didn't. That inside the frames of the movie I felt like I was in good company and had a understanding for the material that they didn't.  What is so good about the Royal Tenenbaums?  The great detail in every frame, from the costumes (and they really are costumes)to the design of Chas, Margot, and Richie rooms and the house. This is brilliant film on every level, a delight for the senses and for the mind. This movie makes you think, and without giving too much away there is a lot of surprises that come from the characters dialogue and their past.  High kudos go to Luke Wilson, I loved his performance as the suffering Richie.  If you loved Rushmore, there is no doubt that you will love this film because it is at par with it, except that its a bit darker in tone.   I think its funny that way that people look at film, we each love or hate a film based on our own perception(and mind there are people who just watch film for entertainment). So if you have a complicated mind and you enjoy watching a challenging film, then the Royal Tenenbaums is for you. As for me, I plan on watching it again so I find more things to love about it. Thank you Wes Anderson, so much. You made laugh, you made me smile and I cried. A thousand times, thank you!",The Royal Tenenbaums

The funniest movie I've seen in years, and yet, when describing the storyline to friends, I'm sure it won't sound that funny. The performances and the way they performed this very smart dialogue are what made the movie as great as it was. Gene Hackman was amazing. I never knew he could be so hillarious.",The Royal Tenenbaums

BY FAR.  every movie i saw this year didn't do very much for me.  most were incredible disappointments or just okay, save snatch, made, zoolander, mosters inc. and jay and silent bob (off the top of my head).  this one... wow.  i'm speechless.it's a shame that the oscar means nothing anymore, because if it did, anderson, wilson, hackman, paltrow, and luke wilson would definitely walk away with a little gold guy.  it really makes me sad to see brilliance go unappreciated.  well julia roberts will at least have some competition when she wins this year for the mexican.  god bless wes.",The Royal Tenenbaums
409,DanielleMyBelle,Poetry.,10,18 March 2002,"This movie was a rich, lovely, sweet masterpiece. The delicacy of the language and specificity of the cinematography combined to form a sort of symphony. One with a steady tempo and many seamlessly blended harmonies. Most importantly, though, was its beautiful melody that was sometimes playful, sometimes serene, but most often simple and honest, making The Royal Tenenbaums pure poetry in film and a genuine, unabashed reflection on humility and humanity.",The Royal Tenenbaums

412,fable104,A wonderful film on all accounts.,8,31 July 2007,I had almost forgotten about this movie over the last few years and then I watched it again on Sunday night and was instantly reminded how much I enjoyed this film. The cast is brilliant and whoever chose the actors deserves a round of applause. Bill Murray alone would have made this a good movie. I'm a huge Gene Hackman fan and he and Anjelica Huston have great chemistry. Danny Glover plays an excellent rival to Gene Hackman. Ben Stiller and the Wilson brothers show they have real acting skills and can do more than comedy. I don't normally like Gwyneth Paltrow but this is an exception and she shines as Margot Tenenbaum. Pagoda was a memorable character as well. This film went past the cliché family movies with everyone getting along in the end. The Royal Tenenbaums has heart and wit. The eccentricities Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson gave their characters helped me connect with them as human beings while making them hilarious. Wes Anderson should be proud. He made a film that people can watch again and again and still find enjoyable.,The Royal Tenenbaums
413,dirtydan1,Great Movie?,1,26 January 2002,"Before I went to see this movie, I read many reviews.  I read that it was a master-piece and one of the best movies ever made.  I will have to go against every review and say that this movie was quite possibly the worst I've ever seen.  I realize that this review will probably never make it on the web-site, but I thought my opinion should be heard, if not by many, by some.  I had high expectations for this movie because I usually enjoy movies that have Ben Stiller and/or Owen Wilson in them.  But this movie was a great exception.  I rated this movie a 1 out of 10 because it is impossible to rate it a zero or worse.",The Royal Tenenbaums
414,ehsfb2001,Comedy or Drama?,1,4 August 2002,I don't think the movie could decide what approach to take.

The actual tone was melancholy.,The Royal Tenenbaums
415,coop37,My favorite movie of 2001,10,25 April 2002,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed Wes Anderson's previous efforts Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, they are both far outdone by his latest, The Royal Tenenbaums. I had a tremendous time watching the understated performances by the entire cast, most notably Gene Hackman and Luke Wilson.  Perhaps some will dig up critical flaws in the film, but for a truly enjoyable movie that doesn't take itself seriously, Royal Tenenbaums takes the cake.",The Royal Tenenbaums
416,Tenenbaum21,The greatest movie made since The Godfather,10,16 September 2002,"The Royal Tenenbaums is one of the best movies I have ever seen! This movie is absolutely superb. The acting talents of Gwyneth Paltrow and Luke Wilson especially stuck out in this film as outstanding! This film should have received a lot more credit than it did by magazines, websites, and most of all, by the ""Academy"". The most entertaining thing about The Royal Tenenbaums is the characters. Bill Murray, Danny Glover, and Ben Stiller played their parts beyond what I expected. I also took special interest in the young talented actors who played Chaz Tenenbaums' sons, Ozzie and Oozie. The costumes were great and so were the writing credits of Wes Anderson and of course, the great Owen Wilson. But, I believe that no one could have done the characters of Mother and Father Tenenbaum like Anjelica Huston and Gene Hackman. I would highly suggest that you rent this film if you want to see a movie to make you laugh and turn you on! The nudity is in two seperate scences, but not for very long. The language is not that bad either. I somewhat disagree with the R rating, but the nudity brought it up to the ""RESTRICTED"" standards. The Royal Tenenbaums is a true classic!",The Royal Tenenbaums

418,allendavid50,Magical!,10,4 December 2003,"Wes Anderson has topped even the vertiginous heights of 'Rushmore' with this wonderfully-crafted ode to dysfunctional families. Anderson is a cinematic sorcerer, weaving a complex story with skill and dazzling the senses with a schmorgasbord of cinematic masterstrokes. The characters are the real juicy morsels in this visual pudding, however - each is as complex, contradictory and downright fascinating as you or I. The film had me guffawing like a madman throughout, save for various moments of heart-wrenching drama, where I near wept like a newborn. This film will stand the test of time.",The Royal Tenenbaums
419,hemmelmol,tedious and not funny,5,12 September 2004,"I had high hopes for a really good evening. But my mistake was to think this movie was funny. Well, for fun you'd better watch Happiness.Imagine a family of depressed members. Flat characters, that don't come to life. Everyone is strange and has his own single issue. And they all sit speechless staring in front of them. Well, that's the movie.You'll expect something to happen and the persons to come to live. But you'll be disappointed. Even the things that happen are slow, unemotional, and predictable.Sorry, did I say predictable? Sorry, no. No-one can predict such boring, little changes in the lives of movie-characters, which are supposed to be EN-TER-TAI-NING. The music is badly chosen. The best parts are the ones without soundtrack, and then suddenly you get distracted from the plot because of some annoying, wrongly chosen pop song. This happens so often, you'll think someone is trying to make a statement you don't get. Bad luck it's never quiet for a whole scene. Because I like happy-endings, I don't see the point of discovering why someone is depressed, and then ending the movie without showing this knowledge did make any difference to the person.Let's end positive. Gene Hackman was OK. And the nice part of the movie is when he takes out his grandchildren to teach them to be naughty.",The Royal Tenenbaums
420,WhaDoYaGot,"Wacky, yet brilliant = Wes Anderson's opus.",8,9 April 2014,"Wes Anderson has always been unusual among his films. He writes and directs with an abnormal yet original taste that many favor and many don't. So when his third feature-length came round in 2001, it was relaxing to say he'd deliver exactly that but with the hopes of introducing a few new fans. I can admit The Royal Tenebaums shaped me into a fan of Anderson.It's when where we're first introduced to the Tenenbaum family we realize they're a wacky bunch built up of Royal (Gene Hackman) and Etheline Tenebaum (Anjelica Huston) alongside their three children (Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson). If the family's all under the same roof together, things won't go gently - which is the basic premise of the story. A divorce between the couple lead to an abundance in time since the family were together - until now when Royal aims to reunite. And like that we have the unexpected and wonderful tale of The Royal Tenenbaums. Enter Owen Wilson, Danny Glover, Bill Murray, and say hello to a wonderful blend of actors. Always funny and always memorable. Don't forget Alec Baldwin who obtains perfect storytelling as the narrator. The cast fit their characters extremely well, so it's hard to mention flaws and easy to say, ""Congratulations on a perfect cast.""Next to be blown away by is the cinematography. It's out-there, yet simple and mesmerizing. Hail to that. It has one of cinema's most remarkable sequences to adore. Touching the cinematography is the fitting soundtrack featuring appearances from 60s sweetheart, Nico, and The (well-known) Rolling Stones. It miraculously fits the Tenebaum family; Outgoing, surprising and mildly doting.So if you think Anderson is too much a genius for you then ponder this: There's a Tenebaum in all of us. We'd like to shake our heads and chuckle at the statement, but it's hard to let go in our mind. It's Wes Anderson's unique charm that casts spells like that.",The Royal Tenenbaums
421,toni_41,The Royal Turdbombs,1,6 February 2007,"Was there any point at all to this film?? It never went anywhere, was never interesting. No plot, no laughs, nothing. The characters were never developed, they were all pretty much alike: DULL. I was beyond bored. SPOILER ALERT-STOP READING HERE: I have walked out of few films. But during the suicide scene, I couldn't take it, it hit a touchy nerve. (This is an extremely personal topic for me and that was just way too much. There ought to be some rating for scenes like that, when something might be way too personal for the audience.) The character's suicide seemed to come out of nowhere, unmotivated, unnecessary and unsubstantiated. I think if the a-hole directors/writers had ever truly experienced a loss that awful, they would have never included it in the film. Don't waste a second of your life with this nothing film-don't rent it, don't recommend it to anyone. You'll be better off staring at the wall for 2 hours.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Was I supposed to become engrossed in the characters and care what happened to them? They weren't real, no one acts like that, so I couldn't get behind them. I couldn't find myself relating to them.

I am tired of this notion that ""you just don't get it"", like there is a secret club of pretentious intellectuals who are the only people who understand this film.Pretentious, that is the best way to describe it. There are moments that are actually humorous, but they are few and far between. The overall tone is very melancholic, but even if you try to dig deeper for meaning it's just not worth the effort. The movie drags a lot and tries to act incredibly self-important. You can do dark humor very smartly, but the Royal Tenenbaums insists upon itself and the humor just isn't there. It put me off to Wes Anderson movies because if this is some of his best work, then what else is there?This movie is boring an pretentious. I can appreciate a slow burn. 2001: A Space Odyssey and other slow films at least have something to keep you interested. The Royal Tenenbaums is mostly just scenes of people talking neurotically and you're supposed to derive some quirky humor from it. I guess I'm not enough of a know-it-all hipster to ""get it"". There are some good character moments and scenarios, but a few flashes of light aren't enough to carry such a slog of a film. Are we having fun yet?",The Royal Tenenbaums
424,tank69-2,The least funny comedy of all time!,1,18 February 2002,"How dare this movie be billed as a comedy? At it's best it's a poorly done drama. The few people that did laugh in the packed theater smacked of the fake Broadway play guffaw. The sound was coming from a person so desperately trying to convince everyone else that this film was funny.My wife & I wasted two free tickets on this piece of garbage. The movie starts off really slow introducing characters. Every few minutes you meet another person and get a little background all the while thinking it's going to get funny any minute now. You soon realize that will not happen, but you continue to wait.This was the first time my wife has ever walked out of the theater before the movie credits. Unfortunately it took 55 minutes to get that annoyed. I was ready to leave after 8 minutes, but instead I counted the total number of people who walked out early. Eleven people walked out prior to our hasty exit and countless others were discussing how bad this movie is.In summary it was one of the slowest moving movies I have ever witnessed. Save your money it will be on network TV soon enough. I really doubt a premium movie channel will even purchase the rights to air it.",The Royal Tenenbaums
425,JohnnyChill,I remember when comedies were suppose to be funny...,1,30 December 2001,"Having seen and enjoyed 'Bottle Rocket' and 'Rushmore' I was really looking forward to 'The Royal Tenenbaums'.  The previews made the picture out to be a comedy.After seeing 'The Royal Tenenbaums' I can't help thinking to myself 'why is this movie receiving any positive reviews at all?  Is it me?  Am I missing something?'I would not even recommend to people that they wait for the video to see this movie.  My only recommendation would be; not to see it at all.The only humour in this movie takes place in the preview.Bill Murray is wasted as Ms. Paltrow's husband.  I couldn't help thinking from his and Gwyneth's expressions that a funeral was about to break out around them.  Ben Stiller has never been unfunnier (I know unfunnier' is not really a word).  He seems shorter in this movie (can't blame the director for that I suppose).  The recurring Dalmatian mouse gag is annoying, unfunny, and too obvious. 
When the movie focused on the relationship between Danny Glover and Anjelica Huston, it was even more boring than the other boring parts in the movie.Rushmore' and Bottle Rocket' were clever and witty.  'The Royal Tenenbaums' is neither.  Are peculiar characters alone funny?  Anderson and Wilson seem to think so.By the end of the movie you really don't care what happens to the characters, you just want to get out of theatre and start warning people not to see this movie.I know people will disagree with my views regarding this movie, and so be it.  But if you read this and go see the movie, you can't say Johnny Chill didn't try to warn you.",The Royal Tenenbaums

The film tells the story of a disfunctional family of child prodigies, allowing us to witness the most obscure and simultaneously commonplace events within their life.

You almost feel like part of the family and understand why Owen Wilson's character wants to be a Tenenbaum!It's not a easy laugh comedy but a subtle one with many details and one-liners that will make you smile and sometimes burst into laughter.The directing is very good, with great editing. They both bring a whole new dimension to the movie.I doubt that such a great cast with such chemistry will ever be seen in another movie again.

429,AgentSD,"Genius, simply genius.",10,29 January 2002,"I got my first dose of Wes Anderson when I saw Rushmore on television a couple years ago.  I was amazed.  It was one of the funniest movies I had ever seen and at the same time, the plot and dialogue were both extremely clever.  A little while later I saw Bottle Rocket on IFC.  I didn't enjoy it quite as much as Rushmore but it was still very impressive.  So, needless to say, I was pumped when I saw my first trailer for The Royal Tenenbaums.
As soon as I could get to the theater, I saw it with a couple friends. While sitting there, amazed at the intelligent plot, incredible acting, and great humor, one of the kids in front of me delivered the complaint ""It never ends...""  He followed this up by tapping his friend on the shoulder and exiting the theater with him.  There was a good 20 minutes left in the movie.  My friend and I were amazed.  Both of us loved the movie.  How could somebody possibly walk out of this film?  Later on in school, I talked to some other people about the movie.  To my surprise, they weren't too fond of it.I have come to one conclusion about this film.  It isn't for everyone; just people that LOVE movies.  The plot in this movie is actually pretty deep at some points and I've even heard the film called ""pointless"".  I couldn't disagree more.  This is an extremely intelligent film with a good message to it.On top of all that, there is the acting.  Amazing.  The Wilson brothers, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltro, and the mom who's name I can't remember all deliver amazing performances.  Gene Hackman, however, really shines here.  This is the best performance I have ever seen from him.  I must say, everyone in this movie is great.  Hell, even Ben Stiller's kids are entertaining.And who can forget about Hadji?  I must say, he may be the funniest character in any movie, ever.  I'm serious.  That's whats really great about this film.  The plot gets really serious at times and its really compelling but director,  Wes Anderson always knows how to throw in some quick, extremely clever humor.  It's just brilliant.Basically, all I can really say about this movie is that if you haven't seen it yet, please do so right now.  This movie should be remembered for a long time.",The Royal Tenenbaums
430,kellyjam,Royal Flush (down the toilet),1,9 September 2002,Quite possibly the worst movie I ever saw.

Probably too intellectual for us.,The Royal Tenenbaums
431,Jesper Engsted,Where did the plot go?,4,4 February 2004,"I was looking for the plot in this movie, but it seems to have either disappeared or be hiding very well or just maybe never have existed. The movie is just a mix of strange occurrences and although you could argue that there are some stories like Royal's attempt to get redemption, you never really care about the story because the characters are so superficial. That is the biggest flaw in this movie. The characters are caricatures and most of them are selfish and anti-social. So why watch this movie? I guess there are a few mildly funny moments (like three or so), and it is very beautifully shot. I especially like the camera movement, which is very dynamic and gives a smooth feel to the movie. Instead of cutting back and forth Anderson often uses pans, which works well. Like in on of the final scenes, where he pans slowly across the fire truck and registers all the different reactions to the crash. Also his use of music is quite good (I love Ruby Tuesday). But what is form without substance? The thin plot and the superficial characters turn this movie into just another failed attempt of making a clever movie. The end result is just a tiny bit better than the absolutely terrible ""Rushmore"".",The Royal Tenenbaums
432,willfilmone,"Not as good as ""Rushmore"".",1,25 February 2002,"And it pains me to say it, but it's true. Please, Wes Anderson, don't go the way of ""P.T. Anderson"" and ""Q. Tarantino"" and get all precious and distant and hip.  I was so looking forward to this film, and it has absolutely no emotional resonance to it at all. It does however put an end to several myths propagated by well paid publicity agencies; 1. That Ben Stiller can be funny. 2. That ""the Wilson Brothers""- Owen and Luke- can act. 3. That Gwennie ""don't hate me because I'm beautiful""- is beautiful.This film belongs to the older guys, Hackman and Huston and Glover, who seem to be the only ones NOT patting themselves on their shoulders with the self-congratulatory cocky hipness that seems to have infested the 'kids' of the story.And I use the word 'story' with extreme prejudice. There's not much of a story. There are a lot of camera moves. The music blasts in at odd places and for no apparent reason. The actors don't hold my attention. A big disappointment.",The Royal Tenenbaums
433,winobob,Loved it.,10,13 February 2002,"Like the others say, it you went to this expecting something the run of the mill comedy, you'll be disappointed.  If you went to see this because Danny Glover is one of your favorite comedic actors, you'll be disappointed.  If you like those moronic Jim Carrey movies (Truman Show and Man on the Moon excepted), you'll be disappointed.  If you like any movies that are further away from a first sequel to an original movie, you'll be disappointed by this.  If you don't like to think, you'll be disappointed.  If you think the new Steve Martin movies are intellectual, you'll be disappointed.  If you like crustless mayo sandwiches on wonderbread, you'll be disappointed.
All that being said, this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. While I loved Rushmore, it's my opinion that this is even better. Anderson's camera angles are nothing short of an artform themself.  The acting is great (even Ben Stiller didn't make me ill like he normally does). Anderson introduces new character in a unique way that proves to be efficient timewise and adequate enough to let you understand who these people are.In short, if you like the offbeat and arent afraid of thinking, you'll enjoy this film.  If you enjoy the normal Hollywood fodder, stay away.",The Royal Tenenbaums
434,fat_dude_007,How can so many people hate this movie?,8,6 March 2010,"""Described elsewhere as a 'quirky dark comedy', the director evidently forgot that quirky and dark do not on their own produce comedic elements. It is definitely quirky, but the 'quirkiness' feels forced, as though Anderson felt that to make up for tedious and virtually non-existent storyline he would have to inject another element into the film.""dwblurbWhat is this guy talking about? Non existent storyline? A bad father trying to make up for all his mistakes. That's one storyline. One son dealing with a tragedy, another son dealing with depression, a daughter not sure of who she is or who she loves, this is a true family comedy that deals with almost each family member and their struggles to forget the past. Some call it dark and some call it quirky and it's a little of both. I'd say that the story line makes this dark, not necessarily the humor of the movie. This movie is a film that is very serious while being funny at the same time, and give credit to Wes Anderson, who I greatly respect as a writer and director, along with Owen Wilson, these two really put together a great script which leads to a great movie.Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) falls in love with Etheline (Anjelica Huston) and decides to marry her. Then they have 3 children: Chas Tenenbaum, Margot Tenenbaum who was adopted (her father would always mention this), and Richie Tenenbaum. After Royal and Etheline divorced, Etheline raised the kids to be child geniuses. Chas specializing in business, Margot a famous playwright, and Richie a famous athlete. Royal did not spend much time with the kids, with the exception of Richie who he would favor over everyone else. Royal to say the least, was not a good father. One of my favorite lines from the movie, Royal just watched his daughters first ever play. After the play is over, the kids sit with Royal and ask him what he thinks, Royal didn't think it was very good, Margot can't believe what he said. Richie asks if he thought the characters where well developed, and Royal dismisses that they were characters at all. Margot ""I'm going to bed now"" begins to walk away, Royal ""Honey, it's just one man's opinion."" Margot walks off. That's the kind of father Royal was, brutally honest and just seemed like he never gave a damn about them. 22 years go by, and the kids grow up, but none of them were they same. Richie (Luke Wilson) loses his ability to play tennis, Chas (Ben Stiller) lost his wife in an accident, and Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), who has not written a play for many years, is clearly unhappy with her husband Raleigh St. Claire (Bill Murray). Royal learns that he is about to die, and realizes that the only people he actually loves absolutely hate him. So he decides to take on the task of reconnecting with his family. You know what's cool about all this, there is still more elements and story lines to this movie. Eli (Owen Wilson) is probably my favorite character in the movie, and he is best friends with Richie (Luke Wilson) which leads me to point out that when the Wilson brothers are in the same movie, they are flippin (stupid profanity rule) hilarious.This movie was very well written, and in my opinion very well directed, but this is where I think a lot of people lose interest in the movie. Wes Anderson has a goofy, quirky style. That's really the only way to explain it, I mean, I could try to explain how all his shots are goofy, and how all his angles are unbelievably unique but boring and plain at the same time, but it's a lot to talk about. I think this is the best thing about Wes Anderson, he has his own style that no one can touch, but for some it's a turn off. Saying that...The performances of the actors are great, some performances might be dull as many have stated, but it fits the characters and the direction of the movie. A lot of these characters are not all there emotionally, so their reactions are not going to be as intense as other characters would be. Danny Glover's character (Henry Sherman) has a great deal of pride, so when he is insulted he takes it very seriously and stands up for himself and gets loud and brutish, yet Margot when she finds out some disturbing news, doesn't even look like she cares, but she does, and you know she does, but she refuses to show it. These characters are different and unique, and the performances, each one of them fits the characters perfectly. You should not skip this movie because of some really awful reviewers, in fact, this is a must at least try to watch movie. Don't listen to anybody who says that there is not a story line, cause they don't know what they are talking about. This movie is smart, this movie is serious, this movie is touching, and so much more could be said. Watch The Royal Tenenbaums.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Amid all the cookie-cutter movies coming out of la-la land, this little gem is unique and interesting. It's not meant to be a laugh a minute comedy, but a sort of understated, quirky, chuckle to yourself movie. I liked this movie because it's different.  The soundtrack is really good, too.  If you like a good, odd movie, then this is the best and oddest to come along in awhile.  There are a lot of reviews likening this one to Rushmore, and while it's similar in it's look and feel, I liked the characters in The Royal Tenenbaums more. I also thought that this movie had a better ending than Rushmore.  All in all this is a very entertaining movie that I am going to watch again.  In fact, I thik I'll go watch it right now.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Wes Anderson's quirky vision of an unbelievably odd while oddly believable family is impeccably, even astonishingly, realized. The cast are remarkably comfortable with one another, seem to be thoroughly enjoying what they are doing, and deliver some of the best performances of their careers. Several scenes are breathtaking in their execution--a rare feat in contemporary film. Gene Hackman is astonishingly touching, and Huston and Glover could not be better. This is a work of genius: perfectly paced, emotionally authentic, unrelentingly off-beat, hilariously funny, and tremendously entertaining.",The Royal Tenenbaums

The only thing keeping us in our seats was each other being there. The personalities on screen were hollow and vacuous, selfish and myopic and not one was sympathetic or alluring enough to care about, nor were their actions those to get behind. I much prefer to be entertained for my dollar. If I'm going to be frustrated by what I see on screen, I want it to be by people/characters I care about, or at least goals I care about, or commentary I care about. This movie had none of these, and I still don't understand the enthusiasm of so many movie critics, including some whose judgment I normally respect and agree with.",The Royal Tenenbaums
441,icekweem23,"Timeless, subtly hilarious classic",10,10 September 2004,"Wes Anderson loves his characters.As a matter of fact, if one were to take the actual plot of The Royal Tenenbaums (not Wes and Owen Wilson's screenplay), one could imagine how any other Hollywood director might have approached the matter- after all, it isn't an overly complicated story- an estranged father wants back into the family he just about ruined with his insensitivity and boyish antics. For most big-name budget movies this would be but a subplot of a romantic comedy with sharks.No, when you think of it this film isn't really about much at all. But Wes Anderson has an all-too-rare mastery of his craft, an innate gift of being able to visualize every single nuance of action, every minute reaction of every single one of his characters BEFORE rolling the film.Of course, crafting lovable, understandable characters is one of the primary jobs of a screenwriter, but what makes Wes so unique is his (and you all knew this was coming) SUBTLETY. Little details flow in and out, things are seemingly set up for no reason and paid off with this filmmaker's one-of-a-kind sense of humor.Like fine wine (and his previous films, Rushmore and Bottle Rocket), time is on The Royal Tenenbaums' side. This is a film that, in a decade, any devoted student of film can sit down and watch, literally, as an audio/visual bible- I could go on for hours about the film's exceptional sense of style and humorous recurring themes, but I know mere words will fail me. I highly recommend you watch this film with an open heart and mind. In an age where people don't really pay attention to the movies they watch anymore, TRT may not be for everyone, which is a shame because it's an instant classic, no matter what the cant-stand-20-minutes-in-a-film-without-a-car-explosion generation has to say about it.His dialogue is perfect. His attention to detail is hilarious. His characters are what they need to be- nobody is trying to grab the camera's attention here. So what if attention deficit moviegoers, the Academy, the BAFTAS and the Globes don't recognize his brand of greatness? Wes Anderson is the filmmaker of the future.",The Royal Tenenbaums

No force alive that I know of could possibly prevent all those talented actors from being allowed to express their comic and acting geniuses so utterly. The worst scene in this movie is when two characters appear to be ready to engage in a serious fight and you feel that something exciting may finally be about to happen and they stop lie on the ground and stare at the sky. You feel that something, some force almost knew something good was about to happen and prevented it from happening in the most boring, lame way possible.The only real world analogy I can think of is if during the Cold War an acting troupe of America and the world's best talent was touring the USSR and taken captive and forced to perform Soviet run movies and plays.

Obviously a picture of extremes.  Lost on me.   I'm not sure what the Director was trying to do with the film. Its fragmented with a range of unsympathetic quite weird characters that have no redeeming features. After the first 30 minutes a third of the cinema left. By an hour another third had left.

444,Pontifex-2,Flllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaat,4,9 February 2002,"You can definitely appreciate Wes Anderson's artistry and skill with costumes and set design and character quirks, especially if you haven't seen Rushmore previously, but he makes some serious mistakes in the script and compounds it with the way it was casted and the characters were portrayed.In short: if this is a drama, it is very shallow, if it is a comedy it doesn't generate many laughs because 7 of the 8 main characters are depressed or repressed, some quite severely. The only character with consistent energy on screen is Royal (Gene Hackman), perhaps that is why he has received some award nominations.I think that the characters were played with some degree of truth and everyone gave a good performance, but the writer and director have to take the ultimate blame for this - when 7 out of the 8 characters are flat, unemotional, listless, suicidal, uncommunicative and/or cold the whole thing starts to draaaaaaaaaaag out.I really enjoyed Rushmore and appreciated Bottlerocket, so I was pulling for this film big time, but if you've seen Wes' flair before then you don't have much left to enjoy here. Just some poor fundamental choices.It almost felt like an experiment - can we pull off a comedy about this many flat characters? unfortunately the answer is no.On one final note, I never thought I would think this, but I do dearly hope that Wes doesn't become another Guy Richie, who is so talented in editing and style that he doesn't seem to bother with character and story. Yes, seeing Rushmore affected how I viewed this film, of course, when you have seen so much come together it is harder to appreciate the few things that work in Royal Tennenbaums.By the way, did that ""Wes Anderson's Masterpiece!!!!!"" review strike anyone else as a poor studio schmuck trying to hype this for oscars or something..jeez, why not just sign it Rex Reed. :-) And I mean that seriously, I know that some studio starting trying to hype films on Yahoo's message boards by posting fake reviews by studio hacks, a sad sight indeed.",The Royal Tenenbaums

452,diejohnny,"great movie, confusing marketing",10,8 October 2002,"I think the main reason people get turned off by this movie is that they go in thinking it's going to be a straight comedy. With some of the members of the cast (Stiller, Wilson, Murray...) and the wacky costumes on the poster, it's not hard to see why. I really wish they wouldn't have marketed this movie as such. If you see the trailer, all they show is the funny moments of the movie. They really don't give you any clues that it's sort of a drama, romance, tragedy, comedy hybrid. The first time I saw it in the theater that's what I expected, and thus I was a little disappointed. However, on the advice of almost everyone I talked to, I saw it again and absolutely loved it. It truly is a wonderful little movie, if you take it for what it is. I'm surprised there are so many negative reviews of the movie on here, but I understand that it probably didn't turn out to be what they thought it was going to be. Maybe try seeing it again; it worked for me.

453,ChaGuana,"Too many characters, but wonderful no less...",10,8 January 2002,"I enjoyed this movie greatly, however, I was surprised a little at Wes Anderson's choice of casting so many characters. The fact Anderson billed so many big stars wasn't troubling to me, it was the fact that he tried to squeze all of them into equal time on the screen. You see, the beauty of Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, was the fact that there was only two or three (three at the most) main characters. We got to see each main character in many aspects of life, which, in this special brand of humor especially, is SO IMPORTANT. However, this is all very petty, because I loved the movie regardless. I've always loved reading Salinger, and I would be partial to this movie regardless of how well done it was! There weren't too many strong links to the Salinger stories, but Margot Tenenbaum (Paltrow) reminded me a lot of Franny Glass. I was skeptical of the casting of Ben Stiller, not because he isn't talented or anything, because he IS very talented (see the Ben Stiller show) - - but because he hasn't been in ANY good movies lately (see Zoolander, Meet the Parents). But he pulled it off. He was my least favorite character, but he did alright I guess.Richie Tenenbaum, played by Luke Wilson, was great though. I loved the character. The scene where he punches the glass and then stands beside Bill Murray as they both look away was so hilarious! Also the scene where Luke is shaving it very powerful and moving. I dont know how Wes Anderson pulled off such a serious scene in a movie like this, but he pulled it off. But again, it would have been better had we known Richie a tad bit better. Luke is too talented in this type of humor to be underused. Owen Wilson needed more time as well, and a better character then what he got. He is also too talented and funny in this kind of comedy to be so grossly underused. The scene where he talks about his book on Custer was so funny, I was just waiting for his character to develop and it never did.
When I see the Wilson brothers in these type of comedies I wonder why they make so many BAD movies outside of Wes Anderson (see Home Fries, Anaconda, etc) Outside of Wes, the best movies they were a part of were probably Dog Park for Luke (directed by mad genius Bruce McCulloch), and Cable Guy for Owen.But I'm whining again, when I should be praising. All this talk over who was underused when I should have talked about how great Gene Hackman was!!! Overall The Royal Tenenbaums was a wonderful movie that I'll treasure forever, but it finshes a close third behind Rushmore and Bottle Rocket.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Just a tasteless, insipid script. I just don't feel for the characters. What's special about them is just their peculiarities. I always try to find something likeable in every movie I see, even bad ones. But this time I really get nothing from it. Not at all impressed by the soundtrack either.

""No.""), great story, and great message.The message I got from watching this movie was that family is really more important than the grudges you hold against them. This movie teaches us to follow the characters' role models. If you're the one who caused the problem, realize that and try and make it up to your family. If you hold the grudge, and the other reaches out to you, don't retract. Accept their apologies and move on with your life.Everyone is great in this movie, but Gene Hackman's role is what really stands out. He manages to play a complete jerk and have the audience still like him. Ben Stiller is great, as are Bill Murray and the Wilson brothers.Back to how hilarious the movie is. The movie is so strange and quirky, you can't help but laugh.

461,morphie1,Pretty Awful,2,20 January 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** If you are considering watching ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" here is my advice: Go to a multiplex where they are showing another movie in which you are interested, starting about twenty minutes after ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". Watch ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" until the scene where Royal (played by Gene Hackman) explains to his estranged wife why he wants to come back into her life and the lives of their pathetic children.  This was truly the *only* even remotely humorous scene in the movie.  After that scene, get up and go watch the other movie or, if you feel that is unethical, stay, as I did, and be ""treated"" to one of the most insipid, self-indulgent films, ever!  When I saw that the movie had been written, produced *and* directed by the same person, I wasn't surprised.  This movie sorely needed some checks and balances.  The whole thing is very heavy-handed.  The jokes are so painfully obvious and trite that you will ask yourself repeatedly, ""Is this really supposed to be funny?""  Even the camera angles are tiresome, the dialog is dull, most of the acting is downright bludgeoning.  Only the Danny Glover character could elicit *any* empathy and his is sadly a relatively small role.  The rest of the characters are never fleshed out and certainly not people with whom you want to spend your time.  I found that I just didn't care at what happened to them.  In fact, they were so unmemorable that at the end of the movie I couldn't even summon the energy to try to recall their names.

Or for that matter feel anything for any of them.'Complete `scmuck' of a father comes back into there lives and in the grand tradition of Hollywood everyone finds out that they are a little bit closer and learn the lesson that family in all its many shapes is everything.Some of the detailing in the movie was nice.  Moments of true comedy are completely wasted.  Some great acting talent is completely wasted.  The rating for this movie on this site is way too high.

464,bjmartin21,"It's Wes Anderson, and therefore excellent",8,21 July 2007,"Say what you will about Wes Anderson, but there's one thing that can't be denied--when watching one of his movies, there's never any doubt about who made it, as he leaves his creative imprint all over everything he directs. And The Royal Tenenbaums is no exception. Sandwiched between the great Rushmore and the even greater The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, The Royal Tenenbaums provides yet more proof of Anderson's offbeat, textured genius. It's a typically witty and original piece of quiet desperation that follows the efforts of Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), an aging ex-lawyer and patriarch of a trio of former child prodigies, to get back into his family's good graces. We learn pretty quickly that Royal has made some major mistakes in his life, but he's still the sort of guy you root for as he tries to get back on track. In that sense, he's a characteristic Anderson protagonist--not everything he does is admirable, but his intentions are good enough that you can forgive his shortcomings.As Royal and his family try to piece their lives back together after a series of tragedies small and large (filled in efficiently via flashback), themes of betrayal, redemption, and family dysfunction run throughout, all handled by Anderson with a deft touch as the script juggles multiple personal stories with an eye on the bigger picture. The pacing, dialogue, and humor are mostly pretty low-key--Anderson doesn't pander to the audience with any shocking plot twists, pratfalls, or overwritten histrionics. That said, to describe this film as dull would be woefully inaccurate, as Anderson's gifts as a visual stylist are very much in evidence as always, along with his knack for music selection (never more so than in his use of Elliot Smith's incredible ""Needle in the Hay"" for one especially dark scene). More than pretty much any director I can think of, Anderson clearly devotes a great deal of attention to creating a distinctive look and feel to his films, and this movie demonstrates that tendency even more than Rushmore, as it's awash in retro color and the characters' appearances are plotted down to the smallest detail.The cast, as with pretty much any Anderson movie, is a murderer's row, and pretty much everyone involved is in fine form. The characters generally don't resemble anyone you'd meet in the real world, but in spite of what may initially appear to be one-note indie movie quirks, pretty much all of them manage to emerge as eminently human, if deeply flawed. It's especially nice to see Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller, who lately seem to be a competition to see who can appear in a larger number of mediocre Hollywood comedies, actually get to play somewhat layered and interesting characters who are worthy of their abilities. I was a little disappointed that Bill Murray, who plays leading roles in Rushmore and The Life Aquatic, wasn't as prominent here, but some Murray is still better than none. Everyone else--Luke Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelica Huston, and Danny Glover, to name a few--is at least solid, with Luke Wilson doing an especially impressive turn as Royal's son Richie, an ex-tennis star struggling with a forbidden love. On the surface it's not a huge departure from his typical regular-guy performance, but Wilson conveys his character's inner turmoil extremely well without a lot of undue emoting.Like anything Anderson has made, this movie isn't for everyone, but if you're willing to dig a little deeper than usual when watching a movie you should find a lot to enjoy. For those looking for something smarter than the average comedy and funnier than the average drama, The Royal Tenenbaums more than delivers the goods.",The Royal Tenenbaums

I don't understand why I didn't see it coming, what with the films that came before and after it. It just goes to show that even with a stellar cast, a movie may die a horrible death. What I haven't worked out yet is who exactly it's meant to impress. It was long and rambling, and without a point. The fact that it had Ben Stiller and BOTH of the Wilson brothers in it should have sent me running in the other direction. The only redeeming feature of this film was the soundtrack, and the mice were somewhat entertaining, even if the idea of dalmatian mice was that of a pretentious writer struggling under the delusion that he was funny. It was not quirky or funny. It just floundered under its own weight, and it caused otherwise good actors to flounder along with it.",The Royal Tenenbaums
471,freedom17,I didn't get it,3,30 January 2004,"Maybe Owen Wilson's idea was to present a ""cocaine dream"" instead of a tangible story line. The Royal Tennenbaums left me wondering what just happened. Nowhere in the story's weaving in and out of Royal Tennenbaum's life did I find a character that I actually cared for, which was the first flaw. And Royal's revelation that he's dying makes me wonder why I should care. His character has done nothing to make the audience feel endeared to him, so the news is met with more of a ""hmmm"" instead of an ""oh no!"". I left the theater laughing, but only because it was the most ridiculous thing I'd seen in a long time. And I was laughing at myself for plunking down 8 bucks to see it.",The Royal Tenenbaums
472,ellie-c3,Wow,7,11 February 2012,"Writing/Director team Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson follow up their wonderful 1999 film Rushmore with something not completely different but altogether more satisfying and a good deal more powerful.The Tenenbaums are a wealthy New York family of eccentric genuises, headed by Angelica Huston. The pater familias Gene Hackman has been kicked out and estranged from the family for twenty years. The film begins with a prologue detailing the lives of the Tenenbaum clan - Ben Stiller, the real estate genius and safety obsessive, now widowered with two boys. Luke Wilson a former tennis wunderkind, now an isolated, lonely character all alone in the world and Gwyneth Paltrow, the adopted daughter, playwright, depressive and all-round misery guts. Other players include Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Danny Glover.The excellent cast is testament to the fantastic script. Filled with one-liners, hilarious situations and visual gags, it is a real winner. However, it would be a mistake to take this for an out-and-out comedy. Two-thirds in, the script takes a turn for the utterly dark with a bloody, affecting scene, not to everyone's taste and at odds with the film gone beforehand. It's a brave move by Wilson and Anderson and one that pays off in dividends, elevating this movie above others in the genre.",The Royal Tenenbaums
473,jimmiewing,A child's eye view of a grown-up world.,10,26 August 2004,"This amazing, endearing, hysterical film is tough to label. Perhaps the best description I've heard is that THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is ""an adult world seen through a child's eye."" There is definitely an innocent quality to everything you see in this film, although the humor is usually very intellectual. Furthermore, every performance is note-perfect, from Gene Hackman as the rascally head of the family, to Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Luke Wilson as the kids- all screwed-up, bitter, and melancholy in their own ways. Although the story deals with some very difficult familial themes- ranging from divorce, abuse, neglect, even incest(!)- THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is never downbeat. Amazingly, this heavy subject matter is presented as if it were all lightweight kid's stuff- and somehow, it all works.",The Royal Tenenbaums
474,Monster0352,An interesting film!,7,2 January 2017,"So I think it is safe to say that I am not a Wes Anderson fan. I believe his bizarre take on his films can sometimes cause confusion and also give a nauseating effect on the viewer. I understand one can have an artistic approach to define yourself and separate your work from others, but I believe sometimes you have to know how your audience will react. Many film buffs love Andersons work. I don't understand why but then again whatever floats their boat. I will say one positive note about Anderson. I believe he has mastered the ability to reach into his inner creativeness and imagination to produce work that is different from anything else on a film reel. His uniqueness has reminded me of other great filmmakers like Darren Aronofsky, Quinten Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, or Sofia Coppola. These filmmakers create an environment or Mise en Scene that gives its unique element to the film. Although I don't like the film The Royal Tenenbaums, I will give the director credit where its due. He does a well job providing the viewer with an exquisite Mise en Scene that helps give his character's complexity, depth, and personality. My character that I decided to choose is Chas Tenenbaum (played by Ben Stiller). I know a lot of people will choose Chas but he is an easy and fun character to write about. Chas Tenenbaum can easily be described by just viewing his apartment or appearance. With out hearing him speak one can already know that he is a very complex character. From the moment the film starts introducing the Tenenbaum children, you can already see what kind of a prick Chas really is. As a child his room was basically like a tax office. He had a jail style bunk flanking the wall in between large filing cabinets. Although he was a child prodigy, his ego took the best of him. His fight or flight mode was never really turned off as an adult ever since his wife had passed away. The image of his home as an adult shows the type of wealth or class that Chas embodies. His tier 1 personality shows as he is always wearing a red Adidas jumpsuit similar to what you would find in a Run-D.M.C. video. He even has his children dressing just like him with the curly hair. I see his character can have some form of narcissism being that he hates his father and its all about Chas. Ben Stiller does a fantastic job bringing the depth to life in Chas. The ""daddy problems"" is a vital issue that really demonstrates the mental issues that Chas has and postulates the true for of his inner character. This guy seriously has issues. I believe the colors used in the introduction scene of Chas as a child were important because the bland non colorful pastels helps set up the character's personality with out giving much details. Basically with out spelling it out for the viewer. It is similar to a horror film. When the villain is about to ill someone, the dark and ominous music plays to help give the scene its dramatic effect. Like I have previously stated on Wes Anderson as a director. Anderson loves to use the same actors in his films, like Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray. He is not my favorite cup of tea, but his creativity is un-matched at this moment. And for that I applaud him. It is very difficult to be your own person when it comes to Hollywood. Nonetheless it is difficult to put your own image into something before it becomes ""white washed"" or ""revised"". Anderson has managed to craft his own followers and fans when it comes to his pictures. I honestly try to avoid his films. If I want to be confused I will watch Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream or The Fountain. But to each their own.",The Royal Tenenbaums

I really liked when they showed the back stories of the characters. This movie has a great story line and a stellar cast, this movie has a great balance of comedy and drama.

Ben Stiller, Danny Glover and Bill Murray were fit for the roles they played which was not acting. It appeared as if Hackman was trying to save the movie. While Huston and Paltrow gave up on the roles and appear to want it over as soon as possible. In general it was not a good movie and had no value. A waste of film would be putting it mildly.

However, with the comments of Danny ""Gone Fishin"" Glover, I am considering a personal boycott of the film.Now, I understand that Danny is ""just an actor"" and sometimes when you play make believe for your living, you lose touch with the real world.  What's more, he absolutely has the right to state his position to any who would listen -- that's what America is all about.  But I also have the right to tell him that he's wrong.Mullah ""Taliban"" Omar just the other day mentioned that he's looking for the ""...extinction of America.""  Well, you know, it would be quite difficult to put on the little dog and pony show over there in Hollywood if there was no one left to fill the theaters.  These terrorists want to eliminate us and our way of life.  They don't have any problems with their own brand of death penalty - one based on some scary and backward ideals.

He was shocked that I didn't like it, but couldn't really give me a reason why I SHOULD like it (maybe because critics/film snobs TOLD him to like it?)  Unfortunately for my wife and I, I soldiered on.Did ANYTHING happen in this movie?  Was anything supposed to?

It is mostly unfunny although populated by a lot of weird characters and only little is revealed about the motives for their strange ways of behaviour (which are suggested to be mostly found in the past). Thus, the good cast doing their best cannot overcome the feeling of aloofness that makes you stop caring about what's happening to them.

486,tjordan90,Possibly one of the worst movies I have ever witnessed,1,2 August 2002,"After watching a movie, my typical routine is to log onto imdb.com and rate the movie.  My taste in movies is fairly broad, and for the most part, my ratings generally correspond to other IMDB users.  Because bad movies generally don't inspire me to write a user comment review, I haven't written many bad reviews.  After I finished watching The Royal Tenenbaums, I knew I had a clear and definite `1.'  Had I seen that many people agreed with me, I would have merely cast my vote and departed.  But when I logged on to imdb.com, I was aghast to find that this movie not only received an average rating that would require two hands to count with, but also was sitting in the Top 250 list.  And that is why I am writing this review.The words `artsy' and `cultured' keep coming up when people defend this movie.  This movie serves an injustice to those movies that are in fact artsy and cultured.  This movie has no plot, no laughs, no emotional connection to characters, no important theme, and no point.  These qualities (or lack thereof) do not make a movie artsy or cultured.  This movie was like a Stanley Kubrick film without Stanley Kubrick directing  it just doesn't work.Let's talk about humor.  There are a lot of movies that do not have humor, but this movie's lack of funny bone stimulation is incredible.  For the purpose of this review, I am working under the presupposition that this movie was supposed to be a comedy.  If the cast didn't include some comic actors and had I not known anything about the movie beforehand, I would have been hard-pressed to call this movie a comedy.  I laughed only twice during this movie: during the scene in which Ben Stiller's character chases Owen Wilson's character and pushes a priest down the stairs, and during the scene that shows Royal Tenenbaum's tombstone inscription.There were other times when I got the feeling that the movie was trying trying to be funny.  But it was like watching a comic fail on stage, having missed his timing or the joke's set up.   During these scenes, I just kept grimacing, `If they had just set it up a little better', `If they had just not played the most dreary of background music', `If they had just tried to be as funny as they tried to be weird and eccentric'And remember, humor is a reaction, not a choice.  It isn't called a `sense' of humor for nothing  it as much a sense as our five senses.  You can't justify or explain why we laugh or don't laugh.  Why do we laugh at some things and not at others?  We might be able to identify certain patterns or trends that lead to our cachinnations (the timing, the context, the delivery, the punchline, the randomness, the wit, the irony, etc), but as for answering the question of `Why?', your guess is as good as mine. People have tried to defend the humor in this movie against the gross-out, perverted humor prevalent in today's mainstream comedies by guilting (through condescending oversimplification) those who enjoy laughing at things that are A) socially unacceptable and B)funny as hell.  It seems that nowadays we'd rather remain tight-lipped when something funny happens at a funeral and we'd rather laugh when something not funny happens in a situation in which we're expected to laugh (polite laughter to our unfunny friends, family, and coworkers).  This is insane.  For instance, I find the concept of wheel-chair basketball to be particularly funny.  Perhaps it is insensitive, politically incorrect, and mean-spirited (it is most definitely all of these things), but if I were to tell you that it wasn't funny, I would be dishonest.  The truth is, this movie just isn't funny.And another thing, if you are not absolutely in love with bright reds, you may want to adjust your television.",The Royal Tenenbaums

489,gregorykmitchell,Precocious Cult Comedy + Deep Emotional Resonance Excellence,10,14 March 2002,"Although I can see this style of storytelling begin to wear thin on plenty of jaded/cynical types, I think The Royals does an excellent job of presenting a John Irving-like ""dysfunctional"" family on the big screen better than any actual Irving film adaptation has.Plenty of people have bemoaned the precocious and cheeky nature of Anderson/Wilson's ""off beat"" characters in Rushmore & The Royal Tennenbaums, and I can somewhat see the point; continuing in this direction/style may lead these two talented writers to inadvertently parody themselves. But in their defense, The Royals actually *feels* more like the big emotional opus that they might have written *before* their more accessible and popular Rushmore, and was realized with confidence as a result of their second films' successes. I'd love to read more on these fellows and see who came first, the Royals or Max Fischer.And anyone who has cited PT Anderson's Magnolia when evaluating The Royals hits on something solid. The *real* emotional resonance of Richie's suicide attempt and the *real* trauma inflicted on the kids' young & adult lives by their father (not just simply the wonderfully comedic and laugh out loud bits by the stunning Gene Hackman, but the *true* ramifications of his actions/inactions) digs deep, and gives the film a seriousness that cannot be ignored. Relegating the kids to supporting players in the ""Isn't Royal Tennenbaum The Funniest Dirtbag Dad *Ever*?! Show"" would have been foolish and superfluous - Anderson and Wilson give the whole family such great depth and emotional tug that it may offset the verve and flow of the comedic aspects of the film, but it also pushes this great work into something more special, something memorable. Like Magnolia, people were walking out of the theater or sighing heavily at the alleged preposterousness of it all - but both films cut so deep and memorably that I can't help but hold both in the highest esteem.

492,p1mp,The Royal Tenenbaums are to movies what a hangover is to drinking,2,3 January 2002,"I would first like to ask if everyone that is reviewing this movie has actually seen the same film that I have watched, because the words ""incredible"", ""best of 2001"", and ""masterpiece"" are the last words that come to mind when I review my thoughts on this film.  There is no need to re-iterate the basic plot and characters of the film, as the have been adequately laid out in other reviews.  Instead I'll give a basic run down of what is wrong with this film.The film itself starts interestingly enough, with a fine cast in the roles of an eccentric family that has been apart for years, but is brought back together for various reasons.  We are shown snippets of the Tenenbaums, and through the film we learn bits about their childhoods, their pasts, and where they currently stand.  Everyone seems to have their own quirks, but alas, by the time the film marks the half way point, you start to wonder - where is this story going?  The answer: no where. It plods along at the same pace throughout, and is mildly engaging, but has no real story to tell.Of course, there are snippets of real life that might make you smile in recognition from time to time, but it is far from what one would term a 'Comedy'.  The few true comedic lines come from Royal Tenebaum's (Gene Hackman) faithful servant Pagoda (Kumar Pallana).  Unfortunately, this accounts for less than a minute of the films overall running time.  The rest of the time, I assume we are supposed to find humor in the extreme eccentricities of a deplorable cast of characters, as they pull us through scene after scene of monotonous monologue.There are some who say that Bill Murray or Danny Glover ""stand out"" in this film.  I dont see how this could be further from the truth since both only have about 4 lines throughout the entire film.  The same can be said of Anjelica Houston, who's entire character consists of yelling at Royal from time to time, and otherwise just staring ahead with a vague smile.Overall, the film is not horrible, but it is far from something great. Wait for a rental on a really boring night, and make sure you watch it alone, because I'm sure if you rented it with friends at least one of them will never let you pick a movie again.  What else can I say? A waste of money for people sucked in by the trailers, and an even bigger waste of money for whoever backed this film, because when it hits wide release, no amount of stars will be able to make this piece of cement float.

I enjoyed Rushmore somewhat, but I far from creamed over it. Since I heard nothing but raves about this movie, I was excited to see it. It also contains some of our finest actors and comedians. But my view is that a great soundtrack, great actors, beautiful cinematography and whatnot does not a great film make. It is a far cry from this movie to, say, Harold and Maude. If anyone wants to see a great ensemble movie that fleshes our characters fully and is funny and has great drama, filmwork, etc. try Hannah and her Sisters or MASH or Fast Times at Ridgemont High, to use a scant couple examples. I'm not saying we don't have a talented filmmaker here, it's just that it's obvious he comes up with the music first, story second. If I wanted a video I'd watch MTV. Dramas can be humorous and comedies can be deep and dark, it's been done a thousand times or more in the past. But I am thoroughly convinced that a generation (or older) of moviegoers brought up on fast edits, commercial breaks and films with soundtracks that play like someone's ""real cool"" mix tape doesn't understand or crave the real thing.

There is no dialogue in this movie that will have you doubling over in laughter, but the combination of minute details makes it so that you have to really pay attention to understand some of the comedy. Try not to giggle when you see Richie and Eli talking with the paintings behind them. Gene Hackman puts on one of his best performances of his career (I know, you've heard it before). There is one part in the movie that jumps out and grabs you when you least expect it. It totally changes the atmosphere of the movie.

497,The Avenger,unfunny contrived and pretentious,1,25 March 2002,"I see many films (its my job..yawn) and normally resist writing any comments.  However on this occasion I feel obliged due to the somewhat bizarre high rating this film gets here.  This was the most over rated film of the past 12 months.  The cast list looks good but don't be fooled.  I shall not repeat the plot as its done elsewhere.What I would say is that this film wastes the talent quite incredibly. There could have been a good story here, with good character development, but it fails on both counts.Never have I seen such an unfunny film.  It really is bad.  I'm not sure what the Director was trying to do with the film.  Its fragmented with a range of unsympathetic quite weird characters that have no redeeming features.  After the first 30 minutes a third of the cinema left.  By an hour another third had left.  By the end only 20 people remained and that sums it up. Maybe it works to US audiences but in England it fails.  I really suggest you spend your money elsewhere. 0/10 its that bad.",The Royal Tenenbaums
498,CeeJayDK,Where's the humor ?,2,21 April 2002,"This movie was clasified a comedy and in need of a little humor I went to see this.I wish I hadn't. This movie never delivered any comedy , yet it simply remained vaguely interesting enough for me to see it to the end , much like you can't stop watching a crappy soap because you just have to watch what happens later on. It didn't remain interesting enough for the ONLY other person in the theater but me - he walked out after about 30 minutes.I didn't laugh at any time during this movie , and only smiled once. The cast may be good .. but don't be fooled - This movie is not worth seeing.",The Royal Tenenbaums
499,msb2512,A film depicting the attempt of a man to win back his problem stricken family of geniouses,10,15 October 2002,"Here is a film which can be so much a comedy, but deals with many heavyhanded concepts centered mostly around death, suicide, lovers betrayal, and a disfunctional family due largely in part to a failed father.  The concepts are heavy, but it doesn't dwell on what's depressive, and although the film ends with a sad moment it leaves you on a high note.  It's a big step up from Rushmore, which is also an excellent film.Also the shooting style blends new with old.  Many shots refuse to cut and just keep going, then when it finally cuts you're often at a new scene.... it reminds me somewhat of david lean.  Also incorporated are a couple zoom shots.... very rare in film these days, and some pivitol jump cutting..... It's all really sweetcinematography.if you liked ""rushmore"" you'll love this",The Royal Tenenbaums
500,brianhumby,Movie Royalty,10,1 July 2011,"I don't usually write reviews, but the fact that several people decided to review this movie with one star propelled me to do so. The Royal Tenenbaums is by far one of, if not, my favorite, movies of all time. There is comedy, sorrow, happiness, and beauty perfectly placed throughout the story. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson were obviously inspired when writing this story, and it shows. I think everybody knows this kind of family, and if they do, they can probably relate to Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) in some way or another. I don't mean to perpetuate cliché, but this is one of those movies that makes you laugh, and makes you cry... sometimes at the same time. There is a sentence engraved into the very end of the movie which perfectly wraps up the movie itself, and if it doesn't make you both laugh and cry at the same time, then you don't have a heart.I've noticed that many of the bashers are from the U.K. using words like ""rubbish"" to describe this movie. Maybe there is a cultural barrier at play here, but I think a better explanation for those who've given this movie a bad review would be some sort of psychological problems... anti- social personality disorder comes to mind. So I implore you, watch this movie. I guarantee you that within a week of watching it for the first time you will own it, you will have seen it 4 times, you'll have the poster, a clipping of Wes Anderson's hair off of Ebay, and will be posting a review as I am now, praising the work of everyone who worked on this project. Thank you Owen and Wes for making one of the greatest movies of all time.Brian",The Royal Tenenbaums
501,shantaram,The Boring Tenenbaums,4,19 June 2003,"Spoilers herein.Royal Tenenbaums is a brave effort, one that mr. Wilson wanted to be remembered by. Cinematography works, acting is brilliant at times (not surprising with cast such as this), musical score is above average, to say the least.Yet the movie fails miserably. For a dark comedy it lacks humour (try comparing it to Dr. Strangelove). For a drama it lacks a direction in which it supposedly is going. An utter failure for a cast that includes Hackman, Houston and the promising Paltrow.The only way to moderately enjoy this effort is not to expect anything prior to watching it. Especially avoid expecting humour. It is scant to say the least.Shantaram's evaluation: 2 of 4 - Has some interesting elements",The Royal Tenenbaums
502,nikeswim17,Royally Wonderful,10,11 November 2003,"Intelligent. Funny. Creative. Ingenious. A rare gem in the movie industry. Gene Hackman stars as Royal Tenenbaum,a dead beat father who returns to his dysfunctional family claiming to have stomach cancer, and reuniting the separated clan. His family includes his wife (Angelica Houston) who is coming to terms with her life and pondering a marriage to her accountant(Danny Glover). Royal (Hackman) and Etheline's(Houston) children consist of a dazzling cast of colorful characters. The ""family of genuises"" contains Ben Stiller, a slightly obsessed and painfully strict father, Luke Wilson, an ex-tennis player who's inner pain is overwhelming, and their adopted daughter Gwyneth Paltrow, who is secretly the love Wilson's life, and a playwright who cannot come to terms with her marriage or life. Other brilliantly cast stars include Owen Wilson as an eccentric novelist on acid and Bill Murray cast as Paltrow's psychiatrist husband whose love is lost in an exceedingly empty life. All of these characters come together to construct the most colorfully delightful and creative cast I have seen in a long while. The performances are top-notch and the witty pastiche humor is fresh and welcome. This film contains a well-balanced serving of drama and comedy packed with an exceptional soundtrack and script. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" has quickly become one of my favorite films that tragically has not received as much credit as it deserves. A definite must-see.",The Royal Tenenbaums

This, however, was one of the worst films I have ever seen, not just one of the worst comedies. I watched it twice just to make sure and can confirm that there was only one point in the whole ball-achingly long viewing that managed to raise a smile. If you're thinking of watching this... don't. Watch something else - a wall, a flame, rain on your window, anything but this utterly mirthless waste of space and time.If I was you and you were me, I would thank you eternally for this advice.",The Royal Tenenbaums
504,Chezna,Hilarious and thoughtful,10,19 February 2004,"This is my first comment on this site; I'm prompted to write to counter the bad reviews for this film.  When I saw The Royal Tenenbaums, it instantly became one of my all-time favorite comedies. I suppose I understand how some people wouldn't like it; the humor is very dry and quick, and you have to suspend reality at times to accept the premise.  But you have to do that for a lot of good movies, and this one worked for me. I have rarely laughed so hard as during the conversation in the hospital between Luke Wilson (in bed) and Ben Stiller and the one between Anjelica Huston and Gwyneth Paltrow in the tub.I enjoyed Rushmore as well; neither movie is a comedy where the heroes are extremely likable and cute people, like Eddie Murphy or Adam Sandler (except in Punch-Drunk Love, a slightly similar movie I also loved).
The Tenenbaums and friends are quirky to the point of dysfunction, and you can get frustrated by the choices they make, but those quirks and obsessions are what make them such interesting characters. To the reviewer who didn't find Gwyneth's character's smoking habit funny, I guess you have never been a smoker or had a friend who smoked who, as an adult, still tried desperately to hide that weakness from their family - the reasons they give and lengths they go to to keep up the lie are fertile ground for comedy, to say the least! There is much ironic humor and some sadness inherent in the character's panicky attempts to hide her smoking, while the bizarre behaviors she displays openly don't seem to faze her at all.The movie is very, very funny with touches of regret and sadness, and a good dose of desperation; but ultimately redeeming. It might not be for you if you can't stand Fargo, Raising Arizona, Rushmore, Catch-22 and so on, but you should try it anyway, and I of course highly, highly recommend it.",The Royal Tenenbaums
505,yoshijosh57,"Dull, boring and useless",1,20 March 2005,"This movie is, quite frankly, the most boring movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I sat down on a cool Sunday evening hoping for a nice comedy to give me a good laugh to end the week, and I expected that from this movie, what with the likes of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson.Instead, I got served up with a dull, lifeless movie with no real meaning. The was nothing to be achieved from this movie, and I have completely no idea as to how or why the producers managed to get such an all-star cast for such a boring movie.Somehow, I don't think I am alone in my opinion. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are in many movies, Meet The Fockers and Starsky and Hutch for example, and most, nee all of them are good comedies, good for a nice laugh. How on Earth they managed to keep such a straight face in a movie they would not have been used to is amazing.Gene Hackman: I admire him. I admire his movies, but this spoiled my view of him. He plays such a boring role in this movie. He is, and I apologise for frequent use of this word, dull. His character lacks any life.Overall: 1 out of 10, and it purely gets that point for its cast, nothing else.And let me say, Thank you for ruining my lovely weekend with your lifeless, boring movie.",The Royal Tenenbaums

The main problem with this movie is THERE ARE NO CHARACTER ARCHS! There is no story. They start the movie off and their life is crap, they end the movie and their life is crap. Plus with that overrated hack Ben Stiller added into the mix, the movie had me sighing the whole way through. On top of that the Wilson brother's are some of the worst actors you will ever come across, Gwyneth Paltrow should be laughed out of Hollywood anyway, not just for this film. Finally, this film was an insult to great actors like Angelica Houston, and Gene Hackman. Anyone who thought There's something about Mary was a witty piece of movie magic should run out see this film, love it, and then never again comment. This movie is trash, and is just praised by the legions of no talent hacks who have no perception of what makes a good movie is, but want everyone to think they do. In all of my life, this is the only movie that made me want to get up and leave the theater. Wes Anderson is not a genius, and should be scoffed out of Hollywood.",The Royal Tenenbaums
507,c_a_o,Wes Anderson's Ageless Classic,9,9 March 2015,"What happens when you combine the fast-paced eloquency and intricacy of a Wes Anderson film with a heartfelt message and an all star cast? Easily his best film, the rare Anderson film that combines brisk entertainment with a message that resonates, 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is an amalgamation of the aforementioned characteristics, and the following analysis will display how it both captivates and provokes, a rare occurrence in modern cinema. To begin, lets examine just how 'The Royal Tenenbaums' captivates the audience in a way only Wes Anderson can - through the use of his always beautiful production sets, he successfully places you and I in his fictional world, controlling almost every single aspect of this world like a child building a fictional world from scratch. Alas, Anderson has always done this, as from 'Bottle Rocket', to 'Moonrise Kingdom', to 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', his enchanting sets always inspire awe, hence his multiple Academy Award nominations. His very distinctive screenplay is also very engaging, with his frequent narration proving charming and his unique ability to make choppy, sully dialogue appear, as was the namesake of this section, captivating. To become a 10/10 film, however, a film must not only entertain, but provoke - Despite 'The Royal Tenenbaums' unique, quirky manner of projecting its theme, it is still relevant and meaningful. First of all, what is the theme? Imprisonment. While this sounds like a rather dark theme for a Wes Anderson film, or any film branded as a comedy in particular, that is part of the beauty of the film - the way it makes you laugh and feel at the same time. So, how is imprisonment relevant? Look at every character in the film, and how they are held back by a restriction, imprisoned and unable to break free until the end. The following list displays each character and their individual restriction, contributing to the intricate theme.Royal - Royal is constantly imprisoned by his past actions of restricting his children in adolescence and is only able to break free by having to fake a terminal disease.Etheline - Imprisoned by marriage, she is finally able to get a divorce and be freed at the end of the film.Chas - Imprisoned by his wife's death, unable to break free and become his former self.Margot - Restricted through taboo of brother-sister relationships, her marriage to Raleigh, and her cigarette addiction.Richie - Imprisoned by the social taboo placed on brother-sister relationships and is constantly unable to communicate his feelings.Henry - Restricted by his social standing, which makes it difficult to truly communicate his feelings to Etheline.Raleigh - He has been restricted by his marriage and his constant thoughts of Margot having an affair. Eli - Imprisoned by his drug addiction, as it essentially takes over and controls him - his rehab stint at the end of the film signals his freedom.Uzi & Ari - Imprisoned by their father's overprotective nature, attempt to break free and 'live a little'.Ultimately, 'The Royal Tenenbaums' captivates and sends out a unique, dark message regarding life, all while incorporating well put- together subplots, and incredibly creative world, and a story that makes its audience laugh and experience all in one remarkable, noteworthy amalgamation.",The Royal Tenenbaums
508,abhirajyaguru,The Tenenbaums live farthest from Wes-universe!,5,2 May 2020,"Stunning visuals and deft camerawork are collectively not enough to make TRT soar; in the end it's the story that is a major let down.
The idea of a dysfunctional family trying to work around their problems is not fresh, and the movie's jarring screenplay adds even more burden. Though Wes is known for his skilful framing and visual artistry (case in point: Grand Budapest), TRT feels more like a threshold of the camera symmetry that he magnificently displays in his future works.
Barring Gene Hackman, the cast is always bored and out of place. I understand the intentions of why they act the way they act, but after a certain point it makes you loathe them. Paltrow's act is purely depressing.
Certain scenes deserve merit: the stunning slo-mo sequence of Paltrow getting off the bus to meet Luke Wilson, the visual montage of Paltrow's various marriages, the slithery camerawork of the climax, are all note-worthy instances.
All in all, this is a passable one-time watch, because it is far away from the Wes-universe we all grew up to adore.",The Royal Tenenbaums

We ultimately care for the Tenenbaum family, and feel joy at their reconciliation, even if we weren't really cheering for any character in particular. 7/10.",The Royal Tenenbaums

515,hyperjulius,Didn't like it? Watch it again...,10,6 November 2002,"I will make this review short and sweet.  You have heard everyone else's descriptions of the film, but I want to defend it.  The first time I watched it, I liked it a lot, but felt it was missing something.  The more times I watched it, I found it to be a beautiful and incredibly-well directed film. It is rarely ever laugh-out-loud, but more of a sublime kind of humour that is strange, yet so original that puts a smile on your face.  To everyone who I know who didn't like the movie, I reminded them of all the humourous bits:Henry: Hello, Royal. How are you doing? Royal: Not too well, I'm dying.Chas: Was it dark? Richie: Of course it was, it's a suicide note.Not really a punch in the face, but try to watch it again, and try to really see it.  It's like watching a foreign film with subtitles, much more demanding to watch, but it's the visuals and the bits and pieces that are so absurd and humourous.  All of Anderson's films were a ""second-time-around"" for me, such as Rushmore.  I wasn't a fan of it, but I watched it again after Tenenbaums.  Now I adore it.  Wes Anderson is a brilliant director, with actually something new to show us.  If it's still bad, rent it with ""National Lampoon's Van Wilder"".

My initial impression of this movie was that it would be a pretty funny comedy because the cast had some great actors, but it sure turned out awful if you were planning on watching the movie for a few laughs.  I don't understand these other comments saying how ""subtle"" the jokes were because this movie needed a sign saying ""joke"" to let you know that they were even trying to be funny.

Great acting from everyone, particularly Gene Hackman. I will be extremely disappointed if he doesn't at least get a Best Actor nomination at the Oscars this year. Anjelica Huston, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Danny Glover and Bill Murray all gave fine performances, as well, though I would have liked to see more of Bill Murray's character. It seemed he was about the most normal character in the film, which I found extremely strange.In any case, I'm not surprised that a lot of people really didn't care for this movie. It's one of those movies that's either for you, or it isn't. My advice to anyone who is considering seeing this, but isn't sure based on the mixed reviews they've read here is to rent Rushmore for $2, watch that, and if you really like it, give The Royal Tenenbaums a chance. They are very similar, but not in a sequel kind of way. Think Boogie Nights and Magnolia or Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and you'll know what I mean.I plan on seeing this again soon, but my first viewing of it had me giving it nothing but praise.

519,pete-711,Dull And Tedious,1,9 May 2007,"Unfortunately this ranks alongside the worst films I have ever seen. I thought it was going to be good based on the impressive cast with Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, and Bill Murray etc. The crits were good. The film was described as being darkly humorous and quirky. It was even nominated for an Oscar. So I sat down and started looking forward to smiling or laughing or at least being entertained in some way. I struggled on for forty minutes as the characters were introduced by the painful narrator. I couldn't stand it any more and had to stop watching but felt that I ought to persevere as things must surely improve. So I alternated between ten minutes of snooker and ten minutes of the film and managed to get to the end eventually. It was such a relief when the credits appeared and I knew I had to endure no more. I felt that not only was the family dysfunctional but the film was also. I know a lot of people thought it was wonderful but unfortunately this film didn't do anything for me.",The Royal Tenenbaums
520,acl06,Gene Hackman Saved the Movie,8,5 November 2006,"Royal Tenenbaums is certainly not your everyday film, much like Wes Anderson is not your everyday director. This is my favorite of his films, because the serious overtones are more moving than those in Life Aquatic or any others. Also, I believe it has the best cast assembled in the last 15 years!!! Anderson likes to incorporate not-so comedic characters and situations into his movies(You probably won't laugh at Ben Stiller the entire movie). The way Gene Hackman is throughout the film as Royal Tenenbaums is priceless and he goes down as one of my favorite characters in all of film, although this movie prob wouldn't make my top 25. I respect and actually find intriguing Anderson's ability to have you laugh, learn, sympathize with, and love the characters. Overall, the movie is pretty entertaining.

People are messed up. Being a person you most likely can vouch for the fact that we are all strange and have deep seeded emotional problems. The Royal Tenenbaums reminds us that everybody is like this so maybe we aren't that strange or troubled after all. Maybe we are just people. This reality is what makes this movie. However, if you don't want to think or feel and you don't need character development then there are lots of mindless high budget movies out there just for you that aren't this movie.The entire cast of this movie came through with strong performances, even the butler whom I don't even believe was an actor (he just fit right in there).

I finally realized who the narrator was and that we were not going to see him in the movie (smart move, Al).All right, I admit I watched the whole thing. Maybe I thought all those brilliant actors would break out of the script. No such luck. The editing zeroed that hope. Usually I like seeing popular actors like Gwynith Paltrow doing something creative. And I like off the wall stuff, too. This was just off the ground, and not very far, either. If you have to have a narrator explain the story all the way through, there is something wrong no matter how famous that narrator is.

So much of the acting was monotone apathy, which is fine but if you're going to have that sort of delivery then the lines need to spark on their own. For the most part, the script was full of visual quirks and bland dialogue. The only thing on fire in this movie was the set designer who must have spent days on each room.I loved ""Rushmore"" and was looking forward to seeing the maturation of Wes Anderson in his third full-length film. Instead I saw a regression. Admittedly he's very intelligent and it shows once again in his humor. But telling a joke doesn't require quantum physics smarts. It's very simple: set-up and punchline. Yet Anderson misses the second half of the equation throughout most of the film. He has enough set-ups to last for the rest of his career. He packs the film with so many beginnings that there's no time for a satisfactory ending. Half-breed mice, oddly named pets, Halloween clothing and a quiet Indian servant. It's a nice and good until you wait for the payoff. ""Royal Tenenbaums"" had such great potential and ended up being just a scatological listing of quirky character traits.",The Royal Tenenbaums

I was totally shocked by all the bad reviews and disapointment. In my opinion, this is the greatest movie that I have ever seen in the theaters, however, I am only 17 -- so that does not say much. ANyway, I fell in love with this movie. The plot itself was serious and personal.  If the movie was directed by well, anyone, it would of been great. But Wes Anderson made the movie what it was, he made it quirky and funny. Not by gross out American Pie situaitions, but rather from pure honesty and emotion. The humor was intellectual but tangable. I have to say that the best scene was where Gene Hackman took his grandkids out for a day of fun, and they end up going go - cart racing. Ohh yeah, and the acting, superb. Hackman better win an Oscar for Best Actor, or the Oscars just should not exist. I love the fact that 71 year old veteran can lead the way with such a Generation X based cast.

Royal Tenenbaum is a bizarre and complex man who does have good intentions lurking somewhere in his body, but he just can't find them.It is packed with witty lines, laugh-out-loud moments, fantasticly rich and detailed characters and a soundtrack that is fantastic.This is so far my pick for film of 2002.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Bottle Rocket is both excellent and funny.  Rushmore is hilarious, mature and complex. Tenenbaums is not only funny, mature and complex as well, but it stresses pure human emotion.The characters that are well rounded and seem to be acted genuinely (i.e.- Royal, Etheline, Chas, Henry) are done so well that you care about them even if they seem dispicable.  The characters that seem deadpan are given a certain element, be it an entire scene, a certain look, or just having the benefit of others talking about them to make you feel what they feel, much like the people you know who do not seem to ever show emotion, but every now and then, they let on and you get a glimpse of how they really feel.It is a comedy that is stylistically clever and very touching.",The Royal Tenenbaums

535,indy11,A modern fable?,8,22 May 2002,"This movie can be categorised as a comedy drama. While the comedy ranges from slapstick to witty, obvious to the bizarre, the drama is much less intrusive. Even when things get heavy there is a feeling that the comedy is only a thin veneer from the surface.Royal O'Reilly Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman: French Connection I & II) plays a father who has allowed himself to become totally disconnected from his Wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston: The Adams Family) and three gifted children Chas (Ben Stiller: There's Something About Mary), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow: Shakespeare in Love) and Richie (Luke Wilson: Charlie's Angels). On hearing that his wife is to divorce him after a separation of 17 years in order to marry her suitor (Danny Glover), he goes all out to get his family back.This is a slow moving story that starts of at a stroll and speeds up to saunter. But if you want pace don't go to see character driven stories. I came to the consideration that this is a modern fable. But there are several possible lessons that in it is trying to teach. Such as 'It's never to late.' Or 'You don't now what you've got till its gone.' You have to pay attention and think about this movie while your watching it. It may seem like too much hard work for some thing that's supposed to be entertainment, but it's worth it with this one. While this story may have been told a hundred times, but then what story hasn't been, Anderson put a novel spin on it.Hackman again delivers stalwart performance as a wise cracking tell it like it is type guy. He has you loving him one minute and cringing the next. Hackman and Luke Wilson are given the two most interesting characters, with the rest of the cast give parts that are two dimensional to the point of being caricatures. Despite this the cast all turn in fine performances. Ben Stiller given fewer straight gags and more neurosis based humour plays it straight for a refreshing change from his recent roles.Director Wes Anderson manages to rework the magic he cast in Rushmore. Using cuts and shots in some scenes that give the film a home movie feel. Given that the whole story is told in retrospect, with a narration by Alec Baldwin I found it effective. It's hard to comment on his direction of the cast given the names involved in the project.",The Royal Tenenbaums

If you're looking for a good laugh or a good story, I would pass. It's not a comedy! There are great actors doing great acting here - Gene Hackman is the standout- but the film is all too precious and it's trying so hard to be art with a capital A that the performances are not enough to redeem it. There's also far too much background music, something that's probably necessary to sustain the ""hip"" feel.

539,TerryKnerryBoy,Birds are not meant to be kept in a cage,10,12 November 2002,"This an intelligent movie about a family that has lived in a sedated state of mind for many years. The patriarch of the Tenenbaum family defines it as: maintaining status quo. We slowly witness how each family member and their trusted family friend slowly leave their metaphorical cage and start spreading their wings. The movie is accompanied by a terrific score and is subtle in its approach to the interpersonal relations between the family members. This is necessary since the story consists of several different sub-stories related to each family member. This allows the viewer to understand what each family member is experiencing.Old man Tenenbaum starts out as a man who wants nothing more than to be a part of the Tenenbaum family (as strange as that me sound). He goes about doing this by treating his kids as adults and he is only able to establish somewhat of an affectionate relationship with Richie, the future tennis player. This has a profound effect on each family member and as we discover, they choose not to act on their feelings of frustration, love and fear but rather maintain an unhealthy status quo.Twenty years later we see what has become of the family. The outside world has labelled them a 'highly gifted family' and fails to see them for who they really are. Namely regular people who happen to be gifted in certain area's of their lives.During the course of the movie we witness how each family member slowly leaves his/her cage and confronts their fears and frustrations.

You should be shot.",10,15 August 2002,"Yes, that's right, if any of these thoughts crossed your mind while watching The Royal Tenenbaums...quite frankly, you should be shot. Why? Because it's people like you who give directors a reason to direct other people's screenplays, who laugh at the trailers for Zoolander -- and generally anything that goes for cheap shots and obvious dreck, who are responsible for the Adam Sandler movies (not Punch-Drunk Love though, that's gonna be great because the other Anderson knows how to elicit greatness in the unlikeliest of places), and generally the state of films today -- that is to say terrible, one out of every ten movies is decent...maybe it's just the summertime.I've sifted through many of the comments here and they've thrown me into a bilious rage. Boring? Go watch a movie where fast moving cameras work in horrible tandem with fast editing, that's where you'll get your fix. Doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy or a drama? Are you stupid? Drama comes from Greek, which roughly translates as ""Sacrifice"", essentially the victimization of someone/something conducive to sadness. Comedy is the same thing -- victimization conducive to humor. Drama and Comedy are the same thing, they just happen to yeild different results. Now, most people would be satisfied with that mesh alone, but Wes Anderson has done us a great service and gone even further -- a kind of absurdist humor situated in a warped and utterly self containted universe -- a microcosm where humor, sadness, the outrageous and the endearing coexist. If you disagree, you should be gagged, tortured and...well, you get the point.I have found some of the comments hilarious, if only for the stupidity of it all -- someone explaining how a good movie resolves everything at the end, someone explaining how humor is a reaction and should only be a reaction to be funny, so on and so forth.It's people like you -- YOU know who you are, you idiot -- that are responsible for the destruction of The Magnificent Amberson's lost footage, for the proliferation of stupid teen comedies, for the PG-13 rating system (read: cutting a piece of crap down to appeal to the masses (read: teenagers)) Whew, double parenthetical, and for...god, I'm so tired...what's the point?One last thing: Something that I have found funny in the movie, which I have tried to express to my friends without success, is a very subtle but gut-wrenchingly hilarious touch. When Owen Wilson's character says to Luke Wilson's character ""And she's your sister"" to which he retorts ""Adopted"" and then there is a long pause, Owen Wilson looks to the side, then back, and the movie just cuts straight to the title card. That's brilliant. I think I've seen it before in an older director's movie, his name I can't remember -- the characters saying everything they need to say, and then the camera lingering, the actors waiting for the next scene and then the rush of the title cards. Great stuff.",The Royal Tenenbaums

The directing, the dialogue, the acting, the characters, the plot, all spectacular. This movie has a damn near perfect mix of hilarious comedy and strangely human drama. It's in the top five funniest movies ever made in my opinion (the others being The Big Lebowski, M.A.S.H., Dr. Strangelove, and The Life Aquatic) It may be safe to say that Wes Anderson's directing ability is second to none. He always knows the perfect shots for expressing the feelings of his characters. He also fuses music into his scenes perfectly. To me, for a movie to be truly amazing it has to get you to understand the ""bad"" characters. In this film some of the characters do some pretty horrible things to each other, but when everything is all said and done, you completely identify with them and don't see them as bad or villainous. This film also has strong morals about forgiveness which I think we could all learn from. All of Wes Anderson's film are grate, but this one is the best in my opinion.

543,Joe96366,Some people are just dumb.,10,8 December 2003,"Despite what many people say, this film is fantastic. Maybe these people never read any books by, say, Roald Dahl when they were kids. The script is brilliant. I suppose if you're IQ is below 100 AND your parents have been happily married for 45 years, then okay, you're excused. All the children have this brooding inner turmoil that was caused mostly by their father. The character Eli Cash is great. He's that kid that did have parents, but the parents didn't really care, so he latches on to another family.Even the color palette of the film reminds me of a storybook. The cinematography is mostly subtle, but there are the parts in the movie where it zooms in really fast, and not very stable, like the part where Royal approaches Uzi and Ari. The soundtrack is great, especially the Elliott Smith song in the suicide scene.As for Anderson getting all high and mighty after the success of Rushmore, I haven't even seen it. So I can't really compare. I've seen Bottlerocket, which is a hilarious film. This movie isn't pretentious in anyway that I can tell. Aside from the ""adult"" themes in the movie, this is a fabulous children's book, about the gaining of innocence that was taken away way too early in life.Watch it.

545,kyle-hodge,A Wes Anderson Classic,8,28 March 2014,"The Royal Tenenbaums was the very first Wes Anderson film I ever saw, and was instantly captivated. As with all of his films, Wes Anderson wrote, produced, and directed this film. He and his co-writer Owen Wilson earned an Oscar nomination for their work on the movie. The duo were nominated against the Nolan Brothers's Memento, but both excellent movies lost to a film called Gosford Park, which I can't say that I've seen. Wes Anderson is one of the most unique directors in the world. I could probably sit down and point out every single one of his movies after watching it for 20 seconds. This unique, quirky style is one of the main reasons the film, along with all of his films, work.The cast is also excellent. Aside from the upcoming Grand Budapest Hotel, this is my personal favourite Wes Anderson ensemble cast. Everybody owns their character. Gene Hackman as the lead, trying to get back with his family. He plays the father of Stiller, Paltrow, and Luke Wilson's characters. Hackman won a Golden Globe for his excellent performance. Ben Stiller as the paranoid, resentful eldest child. Gwyneth Paltrow as the moody, mysterious, adoptive daughter. Luke Wilson as the emotional ex-tennis player with a secret, Owen Wilson as the drug addled author, and best friend of Luke Wilson's character. Anjelica Huston, Danny Glover, and the great Bill Murray round out the exceptional cast. (Alec Baldwin as the narrator isn't a bad thing either.)The story revolves around Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) trying to reunite with his family. Initially he is successful by borrowing of medical equipment, and convincing his family that he has stomach cancer. He bonds with the entire family until, Danny Glover's character discovers that it was all a ruse, and Royal is cast out once again, leaving him to struggle to continue to mend his broken relationships. Along the way, many things and subplots happen during the movie. Most of them work, but some of them didn't. The best sub-plot was revolving Ben Stiller's character, Chas Tenenbaum. His wife died in a plane crash a year before the events of the movie. This makes Chas very over protective of his two sons. Royal eventually breaks these barriers down through bonding time with , resulting in Chas lightening up and Royal finding 3 relationships mended. The sub-plot that I found didn't work for me was the one revolving Paltrow's character, Margot Tenenbaum. Margot is married to Bill Murray, and she is going through marital problems. What bothers me is that she had relations with both Owen and Luke Wilson's character, but neither are really explained. It is finally revealed that Margot and Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson) are actually in love, but this love square felt a little out of place for the movie.Overall, while I didn't like the brother/sister love dynamic, the rest of the movie is a Wes Anderson classic. Along with Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Royal Tenenbaums should be viewed before watching The Grand Budapest Hotel.",The Royal Tenenbaums
546,jbscreenwriter49,"Perhaps not the greatest film of all time, but my favorite regardless...",10,11 February 2003,"This stroke of cinematic brilliance is verifiable proof that Wes Anderson's genius and style of filmmaking will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on the entire filmmaking community in the future.""The Royal Tennebaums"" is a fun house mirror of sorts, a revolving door of seemingly unrelated plot twists, layered themes, and character discoveries that will do well in both making audiences uncomfortable and amazingly captivated.The film is a coming of age symphony for director/writer Wes Anderson, who gives us his third masterpiece in ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" (following the wonderfully weird ""Bottle Rocket"", and brilliant ""Rushmore"").  A darkly amusing fable about the nature of redemption and mellancholy, the film chronicles the mental, physical, and emotional journey of the famous and/or infamous Tennenbaum family.The family patriarch, Royal Tennenbaum (hence the name of the movie), is a savagely insensitive and arrogant man.  He divorces his wife Ethel Tennenbaum early in his three childrens lives, Richie, Margot, and Chas, and his continual insensitivity and blatant absence in their young lives creates an invisible barrier between him and his children that is never fully overcome.A large portion of the film is devoted to explaining the fame of the young Tennenbaum family.  Margot was a stellar playwrite with a pulitzer under her belt as a young child, Richie a championship tennis player, and Chas a brilliant real estate financer and scientist.  Their father, Royal is a prominant attourney and their mother is a archeologist.
The real story begins when Royal, after 3 years of no contact with anyone in his family, claims that he is on the precipace of death.  This declaration leads to every member of the family living under the same roof for the first time in 15 years, and a slew of misadventures and tragedies.
In short, ""Tennnenbaums"" is a sadly endearing and brilliant saga, quite simply the finest film I've ever watched.",The Royal Tenenbaums
547,jbscreenwriter49,"A Wonderful Film -- ""Tenenbaums"" is another Wes Anderson masterpiece.",10,22 April 2003,"The Royal Tenenbaums is the essence of the unique and (admittedly) unorthodox voice that Wes Anderson, as a writer and director, has brought to the film industry; Indeed, he wasn't named (by the Scorsese himself) as the world's next Scorsese for nothing.  The beautifully shot, appropriately acted, and brilliantly written work of cinematic wonder that is ""Tenenbaums"" is a revolving door of sorts, a literal montage of emotion, intellect, and irony, neatly wrapped and tied in a bow of beautiful direction; a true gift to the film-watching community.Not only in this film, but in all of Anderson's three works (his other movies include Bottle Rocket and Rushmore), a melancholy, quirky undertone is nearly always present.  Anderson's style as a director is, admittedly, off the wall.  A slew of overhead tabletop shots, vintage Rock songs, oddly placed jump-cuts, and wildly eccentric costume and set design have not only placed Anderson among the forefront of new American directors, but also earned him a reputation as one of the most avant-garde.  The Royal Tenenbaums is his most finely crafted work to date.The film centers around an estranged, emotionally stunted, New York City couple and their children (labeled geniuses at an early age) who bring fame and fortune to the family name (not surprisingly, Tenenbaum).  Anyone who has seen the film is made perfectly aware in the unusually appealing prologue, exactly what accomplishments each of the children achieve early on: Chas Tenenbaum is a financial and real estate expert, as well as a scientist, Margot Tenenbaum (the adopted daughter) is a brilliant playwright, winning a braverman grant of 50,000 dollars in the third grade, and Richie Tenenbaum, by a very early age, is a champion tennis player. Their father and mother, Ethylene and Royal Tenenbaum, separate early on, and Royal's consistent insensitivity and emotional disconnection to the family (save Richie, who he chooses as his favorite child) causes much emotional angst to the children.The true meat and potatoes of the plot begins 20 years proceeding the prologue; it is apparent that the children ""peaked early"" and now live lives tattered with shame, depression, and emotional confusion.  Royal hasn't spoken to anyone in his family in three years, and after being evicted from his apartment, announces that he has a terminal illness.  It's a desperate attempt to, not only simply find a place to sleep, but also undo wrongs and past oversights within his own family.  At the end of the movie, the film's true success can be judged on whether or not the audience truly accepts Royal at the film's climax -- as a character with a soul, with a conscience, and true feelings of remorse.  Redemption is the underlying theme here, not only for Royal, but for his children and every major character in the film.Wes Anderson's penchant for limited but, still, meaningful and insightful (often humorous) dialogue is one-hundred percent present through this entire film.  The screenplay is a brilliant piece of writing (the only facet of the film that the Academy simply /couldn't/ refuse a nomination for) that, like all his films, lends itself to interpretation on many levels, and creates a cast of memorable, multilayered, and ironic characters (the core of all Anderson scripts).  It is Anderson's directing however, that is truly the savior of ""Tenenbaums.""  Robert D. Yeoman's cinematography is flawless (with the exception of moderately poor lighting in certain scenes), and the actors convey the ""blankness"" (for lack of a better term) and stoicism of the characters with grace and humor, while still making the underlying emotions and depression of the characters visible; they are convincing and memorable. You can also expect to see the usual, recurring Anderson gang (Bill Murray, Seymour Cassel, Kumar Pallana, etc.)   The plot is unique and quirky -- one of the films foremost tenants is that it's based on a book -- a book that doesn't really exist.This, perhaps, leads directly into the misinterpretation that has been made of the film on several occasions.  There have been critics and fans alike that have perceived the film as one of Margot's plays, even going as far to say that Richie is the unseen director (a metaphorical allusion to Richie's failed painting attempts).  This is not so -- the text that appears on the ""chapter"" subtitles is no more than text from the screenplay (what else could be provided?).  The brilliance of ""Tenenbaums"" lies, not in the complexity and surprise element in the plot, but in the complexity and personal struggles of every single character, ensuing the kind of sad, melancholy humor (ranging from acts as slight as Richie punching a pane of glass, to something severe as Eli crashing his car into the Tenenbaum estate) that has been a trademark of Anderson films from square one.Like ""Rocket"" and Rushmore, ""Tenenbaums"" can be considered a fable of sorts; a modern fairytale.  The setting is familiar, but far removed from any New York City we've seen or been exposed to.  This kind of unique set design is another element to the overall feeling that the Anderson films convey.
Although The Royal Tenenbaums has done well in both delighting and boring audiences, Anderson films don't particularly lend themselves to the entirety of an American film audience that always seems to prefer cheap entertainment over content, or the latest Adam Sandler gross-out comedy over the masterpiece playing at the local independent theater.  Like all Anderson films, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a post-modernistic masterpiece, written by an intellectual director who lends himself to a more intellectual audience. Wes Anderson's many influences are apparent here, from Mike Nichols to J.D. Sallinger, culminating in the most original, sadly funny, beautifully melancholy film to hit the silver screen in years.  Anderson is a director for a generation, and The Royal Tenenbaums is proof that his impact is lasting.  And although the film is neither as culturally affecting as The Graduate, nor as artistically poignant as The Catcher in the Rye, it is, never the less, an affecting work of art and a brilliant film.  10/10.",The Royal Tenenbaums

I first saw Bottle Rocket while in high school and talked about it for an entire year. I thought it was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen, then we were given Rushmore, which was another gift from Anderson, and finally we get The Royal Tenenbaums, which is the culmination of an incredible collaboration with his writing partner Owen Wilson and his cinematographer Robert Yeomen. I read a comment about this movie earlier that calls all the characters stereotypes, and I couldn't disagree more. I've never come across characters quite like this and I'd like anyone to disagree with me by pointing out examples of other characters that are so beautiful and comically flawed. I cared for each of the characters, I was rooting for Royal and I did laugh my ass off. I watch this movie often now, it's on my list of my top films. If you want something very unique, something is a great soundtrack, incredible acting, near flawless directing and writing, then you MUST see this movie. This isn't the comedy that is for everyone, mind you. This isn't some Cameron Diaz or Reese Witherspoon hand-feed you comedy using all the cliché conventions to rile a laugh out of you. It isn't slapstick, it isn't forced joke set-ups and pay-offs. This is intelligent, complex writing of situational humor motivated by very strong characters.

When Richie attempts suicide and Elliott Smith plays (Needle in the Hay), or when Nico plays as Margot gets off of the bus early in the movie, the music puts a particularly poignant feeling into the audiences' minds. A lot of people say things about not getting the humor even in a subtle way... how could you miss it? Even the camera angles were humorous at times. For instance, when the camera focuses in on Henry Sherman's face after listing Etheline's previous suitors, or the stark perspective change when Raleigh moves the board from in front of Dudley's chin. And what's not funny about Gene Hackman getting stabbed with a pocket-knife? Some also complain of the writing being shoddy. Well, the movie transitions nicely, and the voice-overs done by Alec Baldwin fit in nicely as the plot goes along... And lastly, some denounce the movie as having no redeeming qualities or values. Come on, the entire movie builds up and up and up with the various plot-lines to the last scene, where Chaz finally starts to forgive his father, after Royal has finally come clean with himself and lets Etheline go... the entire message of the movie is one of redemption and forgiveness. It's pretty hard to miss. Anyway... I'm probably biased. Bill Murray is my hero.",The Royal Tenenbaums
554,fake_plastic_wings,Masterpiece!,10,17 August 2004,"I loved this movie from start to finish. The characters were so exaggerated and the situations were so outrageous that I came to love the family. This is also the kind of movie you have to watch more than one time. Each time I find a little joke or something about the scenery that makes me laugh. Even the most mundane phrases become funny (i.e ""Stop belittling me""). The soundtrack is also out of this world. The music fits perfectly, from the Rolling Stones in the tent with Margot & Richie, outlining their relationship, to Elliott Smith's ""Needle In The Hay"" during Richie's suicide attempt. A few of my friends found it boring, but it all depends on what kind of humor you like. I give my approval this movie to anyone who likes dry/dark humor.",The Royal Tenenbaums
555,EddyIMDB,"Wes Anderson's Original, Creative and Hilarious Take on Families",10,5 January 2014,"The Royal Tenenbaums may be my favorite movie of all time. Narrated by Alec Baldwin, Wes Anderson's 2001 film, follows the story of the wildly successful Tenenbaum family that plummets into irrelevance ensuing the divorce of the Tenenbaum parents. The film, which I first watched a handful of years ago, was at first just a good film with some laughs. After viewing more Anderson films, I came to appreciate it even more. The film, which had a safe spot in my favorite 15 movies of all time, made a case for number 1 after I took a course on the modern child at Pepperdine University. This film, along with Moonrise Kingdom, The Little Mermaid and Wall-E (as well as several books and short stories), were examined. How Anderson portrays the modern family in this film through an unbelievably dysfunctional family actually works very well. The film is acted superbly well by a cast that you would often expect to just see easy comedy from. A must see.",The Royal Tenenbaums

557,vfrench69,Wes Anderson stuns us again!,9,19 February 2006,"After Rushmore, Wes Anderson already sold me with his witty black-comedy humor and excellent casting. A dysfunctional family with a heartless, yet charismatic father played by Gene Hackman attempts to recover the family ties. Gene Hackman does so by telling his family he is near death and wishes to spend his last days with them. These last couple of weeks where the family reunites and blends together reveals new secrets by each character. Wes Anderson creates this ""stuck in the 70's"" mood by his choice of indie wardrobe, classic 70's music, typical NYC settings and even makeup, as shown through Gweneth Paltrow's mod eyeliner. Music by the velvet underground, the Beatles and even the Ramon's, it really creates the feel for each mood of the characters. With salmon pink painted walls, the Indian doorman, and the detailed bedrooms, the house shows a personality of its own. All three of Angelica Houston and Gene Hackman's siblings return home, as well as Gene Hackman himself, to come to closure and resolution with their individual, as well as family, issues which only brings them closer together. I found the movie incredibly entertaining and it's one of my top three movies of all time.

562,LuisLoyo,Nothing royal about this family...,1,28 March 2002,"I've started to write this review at least 4 times, and I can't find the right words to describe the terrible experience I had watching this film. The story is supposed to be about a family of geniuses who get together when they find out that the father is dying. And that's it, there is nothing more to the movie than this.The characters are not well-defined: The father who walked away from the family and everybody hates (except for one of the sons). The mother who raised the children but gets no appreciation from them. The oldest son who was a tennis pro and 'dropped out' for love, and who is the only one that has some respect for the father. The adopted girl who is a chain smoker, is always depressed, and does not appreciate anybody, including her husband and his son(?). The youngest son who doesn't care for the father and has his children dressed like him and crunching numbers for him. The family friend, who is a drug addict. And the mother's boyfriend.That's it for the characters, who never develop (and when only one of them does, you can't understand why), and that's it for the plot. Nothing really happens throughout the movie, up until the last 3 minutes of it. It's not a drama, it's not a comedy, I can't define the genre.It's been a long time since I've seen people walking out of the theater during the movie, and I just saw that yesterday. I spent the whole movie waiting for something to happen, waiting to see if it gets better, and when something finally happened with the story, I saw the ending credits.It's not worth it, not even for the performances. When studios put together a cast of 7 big names in one movie, it's either a great movie or the worst thing available. I'd rather watch 'American Pie 2', at least that one was sort of entertaining.",The Royal Tenenbaums
563,JRoberts,"Ok, I get it--but it's still awful",2,21 March 2004,"I don't hate many movies, but this one comes close.Only Gene Hackman rescues this from rating a 1. In short, you might like it if you haven't seen many good movies, or if you're not expecting something very interesting.Simply put, a good cast is truly wasted in this dreadful and boring film, which is full of itself, full of sledgehammer social commentary, and full of all-too-cliched sentimental nastiness which passes for intellect and wit.
And yeah--I do ""get it."" ""It""--the contrived quirkiness, supposedly humorous morbidity and lightweight darkness inherent in the dramatic situation, the irony poured on as delicately and thickly as corn syrup over premixed pancakes--""it"" you can't miss if you stay awake during the movie and have been alive past 20!Yikes! What a simply terrible follow-up to the precocious Rushmore (though can't we all agree now, after Lost in Translation, that even Rushmore owes more to Bill Murray's performance than to Wes Anderson's intermittent genius?).With the exception of Hackman's scenes misbehaving with his grandchildren--which are absolutely great and all too brief--the whole thing is about as interesting as watching lint. Make that ""pretentious lint"" :)In truth, Anderson may be a great director (he certainly hasn't created anything that would put him into my handful of choices yet) and Owen Wilson may be a great actor (ditto handful of great actors), despite his recent career trajectory. But neither of them are accomplished enough writers to pull this comedy of dysfunction off, and it shows all too obviously here.So is it fair to blame Wilson and Anderson for not being, say, Charlie Kaufman here? Yeah, I think so--they just can't write their way out of this mess--they write into it instead, if you get my drift, without really exploring anything new or interesting.So while all of the surface marks of literacy are shown again and again in the film(and played up all-too-ostentatiously), they all remain on the surface.And even a surface comedy or satire would be OK if the film was all farce or signaled its own problems. In the end, though, it asks us to believe that its own meanness is somehow insightful--not parody at all. And that's the final slap across the face to an audience--look how stupid we all are, taking these ciphers seriously! Wink, wink... In fact, nothing resonates here except how embarrassing this will all look in 10 years :)",The Royal Tenenbaums

It seems that whether you loved or hated this film (and seldom does an opinion fall between the two, in this case), it generates such strong reactions.  A perfect example of how Wes Anderson is well past nearly anyone in filmmaking ablility.  Take it from me, kids, this guy is smarter than any of us, and will continue to make films that are far beyond the emotionally constipated society he resides within.  I can't even talk about how this film and the specifics of it affect me anymore.  It's like trying to explain why you're in love with someone...you start listing things, but slowly realize that those things only mean something to you.  Wes Anderson's films are living, breathing, entities--much like the greatest of paintings, or fine literature, a pure work of art.  The film is unreviewable--it exists, and not to please you, but as pure expression.  I pity those who went in expecting a raucous comedy, victims of Buena Vista's marketing technique--you left disappointed, even angry--perhaps because you knew that you were missing out, and subsequently you're the one who loses.  Life isn't meant to make you happy, but to surprise you, which is how Anderson's films reflect life in his own eccentric vision.  Depression, bitterness, pain, and loneliness are universal--but salvation can be attained with hope, faith, introspection, and a sense of humor.  This truth is the link between the films, and you'll either buy into that premise or you won't.",The Royal Tenenbaums

I couldn't figure out when the story was set, a gravestone indicated someone died in 2000, yet everyone had rotory phones, ancient elevators, old cars, old computers (with flat screen monitors), ok...... so obviously the writer/director was trying to set some sort of strange mood to the setting (it takes place in a generic city called ""metropolis"", no relation to Superman).We figured, IMDB rates this movie HUGE, lots of big name actors, how could you go wrong.  The acting was fine, just the story was nonexistant... oh yeah, I think I already mentioned that.

Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson are geniuses and if this screenplay isn't nominated for an award it would be a crime.It does not miss the mark at all.  Character development, great casting (even the younger versions of the Tenenbaum kids), plot lines, laughs, intelligence, everything about this movie clicks, even with such a large and dynamic cast.I'm glad that even though this movie is only playing on about 300 screens that it is making good money because it is about time the world recognizes Wes Anderson as the master of black comedy (as he should have been after Rushmore, as both he and Bill Murray got robbed in the awards circuit).If you want to see one movie this year, go see the Royal Tenenbaums, you will not be dissappointed.",The Royal Tenenbaums
567,mark-478,Dark Comedy at its Best,9,27 January 2002,"Perhaps fifty of us watched The Royal Tenenbaums.  Me and four strangers had a good laugh.  I noticed the five of us didn't always laugh at the same time.  Forty-five didn't laugh much at all.  Sometimes I was the only person laughing.  I found that amusing.TRT is written and directed by Wes Anderson.  Once again, Anderson collaborates with fellow Texans Owen and Luke Wilson.  Like me, Owen and Luke are from Dallas.I'm proud of this Texas triumvirate.  They have there own thing going. First they collaborated on Bottle Rocket.  Some critics loved Bottle Rocket. Few people saw it.  The Texans followed up with Rushmore.  Rushmore was a critical smash.  It received a larger audience.Still, I like TRT the best.  It's not as funny as Bottle Rocket.  Instead, TRT is the perfect balance between the humor of Bottle Rocket and the poignancy of Rushmore.TRT is about a strange family of five.  Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) may or may not be dying.  He needs to reconcile with his wife and kids.  Wife Ethel (Angelica Houston) raised their three children on her own.
Daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) is adopted.  Like her siblings, Margot was a wunderkind.  As a young playwright, she won awards.  As an adult, Margot's talent seems to have dried up.  She is secretive and cold.  Margot silently rebels against the family.  She's smoked cigarettes since she was twelve, but no on knows.  Later, we find out Margot has searched for happiness in some rather unusual ways.Chas Tenenbaum (Ben Stiller) was a financial genius at an absurd age. Father Royal once shot Chas with a pellet gun.  Sounds kind of cruel? Yeah, especially since they were on the same team.  Chas is openly hostile towards his dad.Richie (Luke Wilson) is the most likeable of the Tenenbaum children.  He was a successful tennis player until he had a nervous breakdown on the court. The scene is like many in TRT.  If you're not laughing, you're either in the wrong mood or the wrong theater.  Oh, and Richie is in love with sister Margot.TRT is the most difficult of comedies.  It's more than a little grim.  The characters are beyond eccentric.  Symbolism is tossed around liberally. Entire essays could be written on individual wardrobe selections.But, if you like dark comedies, TRT is going to eventually suck you in. There's a priceless scene in a drug addict's apartment.  The paintings on the walls are easily the worst paintings ever conceived.  The art depicts nightmarish images of what appear to be zombies on riding lawn mowers. Then another wall features a cow's head with a lasso around one ear.  I was in tears.TRT is one of the best films of 2001.  The rest of the cast includes the following:  Bill Murray, Danny Glover and Kumar Pallana.  Pallana (an Anderson favorite) steals several scenes.  The underrated Alec Baldwin narrates.Anderson handles his ensemble cast like a pro.  Hackman again solidifies himself as one of the best American character actors, living or dead. This is not a whimsical or unreasonable statement.  Houston made me wonder if she needs a new agent.  Why isn't she up for these roles more often?  It was good to see Houston again.

570,julesy9,Best movie of the year,10,28 December 2001,"There were hints of it in Wes Anderson's first feature, the spare but engaging Bottle Rocket, and Rushmore's second act revealed a sweet, wistful heart beneath its quirky surface.  But Anderson's latest film, The Royal Tenenbaums, is his first to truly embrace the quiet, melancholy mood that his two previous films showed flashes of, and it fills his off-kilter universe with an emotional resonance those earlier efforts lacked.Presented like a book and feeling even more like a play, The Royal Tenenbaums is imbued throughout with a low-key tone of sadness and pain, but it never gets depressing.  The characters are so specifically realized, and each of the actors perfectly suited to play them, that the somewhat morose feel of the story might have weighed down a production less in love with its own environment.  But Anderson's flamboyant style and obvious attachment to the subject matter and atmosphere remain intact and prevent the story from getting crushed under its own weight.  Like his first two movies, Anderson co-wrote the screenplay, about an estranged father of a family of geniuses who attempts to get back into his children's lives after a prolonged absence, with Owen Wilson. The pair are so attuned to each other's sensibilities, and have cast actors equally equipped to portray the oddball characters, that barely a note rings untrue.The cast is superb, from Gene Hackman in a career-best performance as father Royal, all the way down to Anderson regular Kumar (stealing nearly every scene he's in) as Pagoda, the Tenenbaum family servant who aids Royal in his scheme to win back his family.  Portraying the once-celebrated children, now fully grown and scarred with emotional traumas from a childhood spent as the son of their careless, magnificent bastard of a father, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and Gwyneth Paltrow come through admirably.  Paltrow plays skillfully against type as a somber, emotionally insecure young woman crushed by her father's indifference (she is the family's lone adopted member, a point that Royal made sure to mention when introducing her) as a child; Wilson trades his everyman joviality for a bit of wounded reticence, and his expressive eyes and hangdog expression are the perfect depiction of the film's subdued feelings; only Stiller sinks into his familiar mannerisms as perhaps the most overtly off-the-wall character, a widower still crushed by his wife's recent death and now obsessed with protecting his two children (scene-stealers themselves) from any and all possible dangers. Bill Murray, fresh off his triumph in Anderson's Rushmore, has a much smaller role this time around, but his wit and delivery liven up some of the film's most tangential scenes.The film opens with a superb, rapid-fire montage introducing us to each member of the Tenenbaum family, with Alec Baldwin delivering voice-over narration.  Luke Wilson's Richie was a star tennis player until a spectacularly funny breakdown at a national tournament; Stiller's Chaz was a financial wiz by age 12 but couldn't escape from his father, who once inexplicably shot him with a bb gun during a childhood game; and Paltrow's Marge was a young playwright who shared a connection with Richie but grew up to flit between countless sexual encounters, desperately seeking the approval her father never gave her.  Owen Wilson has a role as Eli, a childhood neighbor who always wished he were a part of the Tenenbaum clan and continued to send his press clippings and college report cards to Ethel Tenenbaum, the mother of the clan, played warmly by Anjelica Huston.The detail heaped upon each character is immense, and may, to detractors, appear a bit superficial. But although there are a lot of people to get to know and only two hours in which to do so, the characters are so fully realized and affectionately rendered by the director and cast that they all succeed as three-dimensional portrayals.  And, like in Rushmore, the quirks are there; just look at Danny Glover's bow-tied, purple-suited landlord Henry, who with his white goatee and kind, dignified manner is the film's most together character.  His proposal to Etheline sets the plot in motion. Anderson and Owen Wilson share a wonderful sense of humor and it shines in this picture, but just as the somber tone is tempered by the brilliant dialogue and absurdly pertinent comic situations (all of the humor is character based and not in any way at the expense of, or superfluous to, the plot), the hurt behind the humor, and the depth of emotion felt by the family members, is never overwhelmed by the laughs.  The film is grounded in some real emotion, and by the final act, it gets downright touching.Visually, Anderson is a master.  His frames are loaded with detail and perfectly constructed, from color to props to placement; his shots are impeccable and lend the film an air of artistry not available to most current filmmakers.  His choice of music accentuates the melancholy tone of the film (from The Velvet Underground to the Rolling Stones), and his ability to layer so much information into just one shot is astonishing.The Royal Tenenbaums is a big film, but one with a small, deeply felt emotional center.  A lot of the situations are bizarre, and the characters are not your run-of-the-mill creations, but they all ring true and the pain through which they are navigating comes through loud and clear.  When all is said and done, The Royal Tenenbaums is not only the funniest movie of the year, but also the sharpest, and most unexpectedly tender depiction of a modern family to come along in some time.  The Lord of the Rings might be the biggest movie of this holiday season, but The Royal Tenenbaums is the best.",The Royal Tenenbaums

The child actors, both in performance and in casting, are truly excellent. Visually, it's a solid film, although some scenes are so beautifully composed, it makes the ""normal"" sections of the film seem almost bland.A little too much ensemble character jammed into the single film runtime, but the mood and pace is better for the lack of lengthy singular character development.

Wasting that kind of talent is tragic.

But I understand where the others are coming from, they just can't accept some aspects of this film, therefor they can't accept the film.This isn't a laugh until your face is blue film, but I was highly entertained and did laugh aloud a few times. For me this is a film I'll watch a hundred times and always like. I've watched it about 5 times in 2 weeks and I liked it more everytime.Wes Anderson has such a way with crafting stories and no one can deny he didn't put a lot of thought into it. So to everyone I say at least watch it once, because this film deserves that much.Oh, and the film is a comedy.",The Royal Tenenbaums

584,blueprintfilms,one of the worst films i have ever seen!!,1,3 January 2002,"Putting aside Wes Anderson's pretentious and irritating personality for a moment in an attempt to consider this film from an un-biased point of view, I would still have to say that it was one of the worst films i have ever seen. Every merit you would use as criteria to evaluate a film completely falls through the toilet in this third feature of Anderson's. The camera direction is awful with countless sweeping blurry pans that stink to imply that he was too lazy to edit two separate shots. It is nauseating to watch this film through the p.o.v. of a thirteen year old with a camcorder for two hours while still trying to figure out exactly what the film was about. The general plot is of a father(Gene Hackman) who stages an act that he is dying in an attempt to reconcile with his three sevant children and ex-wife (Angelica Houston). The problem here is that in two hours NOTHING REALLY HAPPENS! The acting in general is decent in light of the films gratuitous shadow of bad taste comedy and dis-jointed rhythm, although Gene Hackman especially offers a rewarding performance. This film is obvious and simply just not funny. it resounds a dry inane humor that is stale and just plain corny. The most frustrating thing within the entire piece is the reoccuring use of beatles songs to distract and amuse the audience from the feature in a meek attempt to shadow the obvious short-comings of this film. Although I greatly enjoyed Rushmore, and give credit to Bottle Rocket. I would strongly suggest against The Royal Tenenbaums, take your eight bucks and go drink it across the street. You'll still walk away feeling more productive than if you sat through this absolutely rank film.",The Royal Tenenbaums
585,Bob_St_Cul,A subtle masterpiece,10,25 February 2002,"It's not every day that every element of a film comes together in just the right mixture-but this is such a film. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is being marketed as a comedy, but ""Scary Movie"" it's not. Those who are looking for belly laughs can keep looking. Instead, Tenenbaums revels in the type of subtle humor rarely seen in a mainstream release nowadays-the type that hurts beneath the surface.The film centers on the Tenenbaum family, who've been affected by irresponsible father Royal (Gene Hackman). While Royal and wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) are divorced when their oldest son is 12, Royal's involvement with his children is suspect from the beginning. He shoots his oldest son in the hand with a BB gun on a lark and trashes his adopted daughter's first play with a review more appropriate from a professional critic. After the divorce, Etheline pushes her three children to excel-and it works, for a while. The kids become famous for their precociousness-Chas as an entrepreneur, Margot as a playwright and Richie as a tennis pro. As adults, they fall apart. Chas (Ben Stiller) becomes obsessed with his health after his wife's death, overprotecting his two sons. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) stops writing and chain-smokes in the bathroom for hours on end. Richie (Luke Wilson) has an on-court breakdown and takes up residence aboard a ship, drifting around the world. For different reasons, all three move back into their childhood home-as does Royal, who's been kicked out of his apartment and feigns terminal cancer in order to regain access to his family's lives. The film is brilliantly acted by an ensemble cast that also includes Owen Wilson, Bill Murray and Danny Glover. It would have been easy to turn these characters into caricatures of a dysfunctional family, but no one takes the easy way out here. All, especially Hackman, portray real, sympathetic characters in spite of their many flaws.**** (out of four)",The Royal Tenenbaums
586,worldblee,"A fantastic, authentic movie",10,21 December 2001,"The wait after Rushmore was worth it. Wes Anderson has crafted a funny, touching, and bittersweet story of a family in chaos. There's more than a touch of J.D. Salinger in the story, but Anderson makes it his own--Tenenbaums is the best film I've seen this year. Wes Anderson films may not be for everyone (a friend once told me they didn't like Rushmore because ""it was too depressing""), but for the rest of us they're wonderful. The cast is excellent (Gene Hackman as well as Anderson's usual suspects), the script is great, and the direction is deft and sure. Do yourself a favor and see a wonderful film made by a director who puts his all into his movies and knows his craft inside and out.",The Royal Tenenbaums
587,xerospy,What's up with the bad reviews??,10,22 December 2001,"I have to admit, I waited 7 months for this flick to show up and I was far from disappointed.  Obviously, it IS one of the best films of the year. The writing by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson along with his direction was nothing else but ingenius!  The emotion of each character well fitted their role of a ironically disfucntional ""successful"" family.  Ben Stiller (Chas), Gwyneth Paltrow (Margot), Luke Wilson (Richie) all did excellent acting in showing their characters bland emotion of secrets and disappointment that was PERFECT for movie's atmosphere. And let's not forget about Gene Hackman (Royal) that made everyone laugh in the theater even 5 minutes after the scene was over. If you expected everyone to be happy and go-getty for this drama/comedy film are sadly mistaken.  The only bad part about this movie was there wasn't enough of Bill Murray, but that does not phase the movie of what it's really worth.  Basically, GO WATCH IT!  BUY THE POSTER!",The Royal Tenenbaums
588,kidbeat,"Beautiful, detailed, affecting, funny, painful...",9,20 January 2002,"This is a superb work by Wes Anderson, a film rich in detail and full of incredible characters.  I have not seen a film this funny all year, nor have I seen a film this moving since Magnolia.  Like Magnolia, it inspires such a genuine love for every person on the screen, because you can see that they are real people.  It demands involvement from the viewer, people who just want to sit back and have an experience happen to them are going to be left in the cold.  Every detail of this film is important because, as becomes clear, it is the details that the characters surround themselves with that give you the best clues and insight into their identities and inner-beings. This is also a highly personal film, in that it hits you on a personal level.  People with open wounds from family tragedies (and really who doesn't have these) will notice that this hits very close to home and may be put off by this, but I promise that opening up to it and giving yourself over to it will yield an unparallelled cinematic experience.",The Royal Tenenbaums

I'm a loyal fan of Wes Anderson, Rushmore, etc.. and I'll be the first to admit that not everyone is going to like this.. as you'll see from the mixed reviews his movies receive, but if you liked Rushmore or Bottle Rocket, or want something a little offbeat, check this out.So many things are perfect in this movie.. the humor that only half the audience could laugh at, the scene changes, the sets, the queer artwork, the development of the characters.

It was cruel, boring and lacked any semblence of human values. Killing a pretty dog at the end to justify bringing in a real dalmation was obscene. The characters had absolutely no socially redeeming values and were definitely not amusing. The direction was very disjointed. Photography was mediocre. Gene Hackman should be ashamed to have his name on the bill. It was a cynical, cruel film and ought to be missed by all. We only sat through it to the end to report on it to a film club.

Maybe it's just me not understanding the humor of it, but I think I appreciate a lot of movies, and I'm able to count the movies I didn't finish watching on one hand (with 5 fingers intact :) ) but this movie was simply tedious, I was waiting for the fun to kick in after the introduction of the characters, but after 40 minutes I was quite sure there wasn't going to be any fun within my comprehension.

I, too, respect Gene Hackman as an actor.  His natural and typically seamless character portrayal did not resurrect this film for me, however. It seemed to be edited in such a way as to confuse the viewer as to chronology ... the dialogue was occasionally unintelligible.  It had a general mood of depression and hopelessness and dysfunction, which I realize was intentional to the plot.  The color shift was predominantly to the red, which created a disturbing mood... hopefully, this was intentional... and it worked.  I literally forced myself to watch it to completion because I am a voting member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and wanted to give it full consideration.  But, I found myself not caring one bit about any of the characters personally... and this is a fatal flaw in my book. I found the film editing confusing and awkward... almost amateurish.

With outstanding performances by the whole cast, especially Gene Hackman and Luke Wilson, not to mention Bill Murray, my personal favorite, this film will have the audience laughing until they plotz, not to mention the semi-sweet dramatic parts of this movie that add so much to this film.

604,CrunchCameron,Cinematic Masterpiece,10,7 January 2003,"Now I'm not going to express my opinion about ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" as one everyone should follow, or as one that everyone should kick their own ass for not agreeing with. Different people like different movies. Lord knows I can't stand ""The Matrix"" or any of the Harry Potter movies, but everyone else loves them.""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a movie you shouldn't disagree with in the sense of calling it a horrible movie. I myself love this movie, and it is slowly becoming my favorite of all time. When watching movies that don't concern immediate action or comedic values picked up by the audience, you have to actually take on an almost hidden mentality where you can decide yourself what message each scene is trying to tell you. Wes Anderson's films have a grand, refreshing and oddly independent feel to them. The continuum of his type of direction can sometimes reflect the characters in his movies: These people don't really seem to care, nor are they striving to break through in any mainstream way just because they care too dearly what everyone else thinks of their success. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" really stresses the entertainment in actually ""watching"" movies instead of just viewing them. When I say ""just viewing"" I mean sitting down and going through a movie and not letting yourself comprehend anything further than the dialogue and action that follows. There are still a lot of people who don't care to actually expand their appeals further than today's filmmakers drawing every meaning and aspect of the film out in crayon.Wes Anderson strictly constructs this film in a very orderly manner that relieves today's true movie lovers. From the introduction of all the characters back in 1979 (and the violin laden introduction of all the characters 22 years later) to the ending of the film where Gene Hackman found his peace with his family and carrying it with him at the end of his life, the movie does a good job of leading on emotional value. People who say the movie is too serious and then too quirky don't realize that its nothing but a strong balance of a character study. The Tenenbaum family are definitely off the wall, and also emotionally challenged, but their parents didn't so much raise them on love as much as they did to deem them brilliant. Even the actors outside the family, such as Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, and Danny Glover, seem to add comedy to the film, especially Bill Murray, who doesn't even have to try to be funny in this movie. The Luke Wilson suicide attempt scene was probably the most compelling scenes I've ever seen in a movie because I understood through his character study just how twisted his life was at that point, and Elliot Smith's ""Needle in the Hay"" really added to the scene for a reason I'm not sure, but then again the whole soundtrack went with the movie so well.",The Royal Tenenbaums

He is worser than Sydney Pollack. Boring boring boring. Don't waste your time. I really go forward about not to watch Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson films in the future. Awful story with bad background.

That said, I rented this movie with very high hopes after all I had read about it. I love Gene Hackman and Gwyneth , and when I heard Bill Murray was in this too, I was intrigued...I was even willing to deal with Ben Stiller! I am sorry I did. This is the first movie I have ever commented on in this site, primarily due to laziness and not wanting to register. I registered simply because this film was so awful I had to let others know. The idea behind the film isn't bad, but the way it is done is almost hypnotic. My wife fell asleep twice, and it took all of my patience to not just pull it out half way and take it back. Hackman was good (but this is not his best work by far) and this may have been the worst performance I have ever seen by ALL of the other cast members. This movie starts off slow, and then slows down while taking the viewer on a trip to nowhere. The constant narration became a huge distraction, and it may have been the best part of the film.

Or maybe I'm just not cool enough to get the joke. To me, stylized doesn't automatically equal smart and deadpan doesn't automatically equal funny, unless you happen to be Buster Keaton. (Don't get me wrong, I love non-traditional approaches to storytelling, but only when they support the narrative thrust of a piece rather than simply calling attention to themselves, as is the case here.) The characters here feel like poorly fleshed-out types rather than real people, and the actors seem to have to fall back on physical gestures and mannerisms to try to breathe some life into or give some specificity to these shells. Anjelica Huston, of course, rises above the fray, as always, and gives a nuanced, beautiful and very real performance. But the other performers could have used an injection of good old-fashioned earnestness. Of course, I suspect that any attempts at portraying real people would have been squashed by Mr. Anderson, as his directorial style doesn't seem to leave any room for unstylized, honest-to-goodness affect.

At first, I just laughed at the witty and direct verbal jokes, but then I began to have a devilish grin on my face while watching some scenes. SPOILER- For example, when Richie tries to commit suicide, I felt sorry for him, but I also irrationally chuckled at the indirect dark humor. Richie and Margot were my favorite characters in this movie. I think their eccentric love story is the most interesting sub-plot in this movie.

Not since Peter seller's ""Being There"" have I seen a comedy that touches all human emotions as well as wes Anderson's ""masterpiece"". Never before have I called a comedy a ""masterpiece"", and, in fact, by calling the Tenenbaums a comedy I feel as though I might be shortchanging it. This movie is not a comedy. It is not a drama. It is everything wrapped together into a collaberation that meshes all genres together. The Royal Tenenbaums represents the arrival of a more sophisticated humor that touches more closely to human emotions than the typical slapstick or parody, and, furthermore, it represents a dramatic work that blurrs comedy as it asks you to see the humor and the tragedy of each character. Thus ""The Royal tenenbaums"" teaches us that human nature is both humorous and tragic.

This film (and subsequently Wes Anderson) is absolute genius. The subtle comedic acting by Paltrow, Huston, Murray, Glover and the Wilson brothers are overshadowed only by an outstandingly hilarious performance by Gene Hackman. The writing is near perfection with vastly complex characters made relatable through their family relationship and the directing is underrated as the less enthused moviegoers often miss the beautifully complicated art direction and cinematography. As if the sets and camera work were not enough, Anderson uses perfectly placed music by artists which vary from the Beatles to Nico to Elliot Smith to add deep emotion to a number of different scenes and completes his masterpiece with an amazing soundtrack. In closing, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" touches on everything from humor to drama, from sadness to joy and all in less than two hours. As far as a recommendation goes, all I can say is that this movie has leaped into my top 5 almost overnight and that is not an easy task. I highly recommend it: 10/10.",The Royal Tenenbaums
616,Schimmel,Why?,5,30 December 2002,"I can't really see the point in this comedy-aspirational film, how can anyone bother to filmatize it? While not being awfully bad, most of the movie I watched with a wondering expression on my face. What's the impression you're supposed to take? What is the point? Most funny part was my friend coming up with a new word for engine power in a car.",The Royal Tenenbaums
617,deconstructingjamie1984,uninspired ... where am i supposed to laugh?,1,9 August 2005,"The only spoiler is that this film is rubbish! I rented this on the back of a friend's recommendation, but right now I just want to force him to go through two hours of water torture so he can know just what it feels like.The only time I laughed during the entire length of the film was when Gene Hackman's character fell into the pool. Hilarious, a 5 year old could have dreamt that one up. It's really quite worrying that so many people in Hollywood are paying hard money to finance this sort of drivel.Oh look, there's half a dozen alienated kids sitting around and fed up with the world at large. There's also some OK cinematography and scenery, but when the hell does that make a good film? Or at least one that averages 7.6 on the IMDb scale? It is dull, monotonous, and so slow that a Skoda would overtake it. This is clearly a film that belongs to a certain clique of people who consider themselves to have the 'inside joke' when it is readily apparent to most normal people that there is, in fact, no joke.Frankly on the whole I would have more fun detaching my testicles and selling them on eBay.",The Royal Tenenbaums
618,parazyte,Original and thorough,9,12 August 2003,"This movie emphasizes on characters and relations there between. I adore the presentation of each character, and the movie stands out in a direction of its' own. The plot can be dissatisfying for the greater audience, because it's not that interesting, but it's almost like it didn't matter to me. The movie's originality, characters and their behaviours, thorough background information about all the small details and of course the photo, makes this movie a trip to unventured places for the viewer. Enjoy!!",The Royal Tenenbaums

The smart humor is fantastic and you can tell how much he has invested into every little detail of this movie.  The cast, character, even the house is perfect to a T. BULLSEYE Wes, BULLSEYE! I can not wait until the next project comes out!",The Royal Tenenbaums
621,Hazel_Ra,critics everywhere,10,5 April 2003,this movie is outstanding. by far owen wilsons best (and funniest) role ever. i dont even like the guy in any other movie. people who get down on this movie dont understand its true beauty. the humour and the actors are meant to be patheticly funny and outragously overdone. the movie itself is based on the views of the adopted daughter (paltrow). its her story the way she saw it. hackman was great. i love watching the scenes where him and his grandsons are running a muck through the city.damn good.,The Royal Tenenbaums
622,pedrocalheirosmenezes,Tragically hilarious,8,8 June 2015,"""Royal: I've always been considered an asshole, for about as long as I can remember. That's just my style.""Far from the conventional comedy, Wes Anderson presents us the history of the Tenenbaum family and its close friends, with a premium cast: Gene Hackman, Bill Murray, Ben Stiller, Luke and Owen Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow (presenting us with one of the film's best scenes, coming out of a bus). Also Anjelica Houston is not to be overlooked, perfectly representing Etheline. Wes ""geometrical"" signature style pops out from the beginning of the film 'till the end, always with utter attention to detail.Creating a sort of parallel world, the film is set at a non-clear epoch and also in an unidentifiable city. The story develops taking its time, describing us the life of a quirky (at least) family where Etheline and Royal's children have a special childhood, becoming prodigies in the most diverse areas. However, their lives tend to fall apart, in some way due to their absent father, becoming depressed persons. When the family comes back together, new conflicts arise and old memories return and between the family dramas, always with Wes characteristic humor, this eccentric film entertains managing at the same time to be tragic and hilarious.Also worth mentioning is the excellent soundtrack with songs from Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Nick Drake, Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Clash, Ramones, Velvet Underground and others.",The Royal Tenenbaums

624,Lewistoo,My go-to recommendation whenever someone asks,10,8 October 2020,"The Royal Tenenbaums is a good example of an imperfectly perfect movie. I personally think this is Wes Anderson's best movie and is exemplary of what makes him interesting as a film maker. The best thing about this movie is the feel it has to it - the production design, camera direction, soundtrack, even the colour schemes portrayed through the movie are all IMPECCABLY stylish and have resonated with me personally ever since I first saw it when I was about 15. In terms of aesthetics it is certainly the coolest film ever made, perhaps second only to Anderson's Life Aquatic. The performances are all fantastic, my favourites being those given by Hackman, Stiller, and Luke Wilson.Watch this damn movie, I guarantee you will have a good time. Probably my favourite movie of all time, though I'll have to think about it and get back to you.",The Royal Tenenbaums
625,tiqtoq,Fantastically detailed and moving.,10,14 March 2004,"What can I say about this film? The richness of its detail and whimsy is fantastic. Literally, fantastic as in it has created a fantasy world down to the smallest elements. Ultimately moving and human, however, it is the product of great care and intelligence. The director's other work (Rushmore) is similarly detailed his style is instantly recognizable. The movie is a great ensemble piece of talented actors who inhabit characters at once offbeat and familiar. The music is also completely thought-out and a great backdrop to the action of the film. The dialogue is spare but full of meaning and never rings false. Gene Hackman is great as the unseated patriarch of a family of failed geniuses. The Wilson brothers also deliver with their unique blend of solemnity and wise-stupid behavior.",The Royal Tenenbaums
626,mathumphreys,"Slow, boring and unfunny",1,4 August 2015,"I see I am in the minority here. I watched this movie based on the large number of good reviews but it turned out to be a confused dud that didn't know if it was drama of comedy. I persisted with this movie but honestly wish I had not. I found the movie slow moving, boring and just not funny. The characters aren't engaging, relatable or even believable. The setting was boring, the premise was shallow and nothing of any real interest happened at all. The music was good, the cinematography nice, but all in all totally underwhelming, which was a real surprise considering the big name cast members. I'm a big fan of Gene Hackman but he wasn't the right choice with this movie, I think this was just a pay cheque for him.",The Royal Tenenbaums

628,danielsaun,Slow-burning masterpiece,10,27 September 2004,"I first saw this film on TV and have never seen a director quite like Wes Anderson displaying his outlook on life so expertly. He and Owen Wilson have created a family beyond dysfunctional. Their underplayed script of various oddballs all with their own tale of despair is as left-field as you'll find, with each character, and I stress this, as pathetic as the next.Gene Hackman plays the lead role of Royal with huge confidence while Paltrow (Margot), Stiller (Chaz), and Owen and Luke Wilson (Eli and Richie), develop into fully fledged actors in their brilliant well-rounded performances. Anjelica Huston plays the strong matriarchal head of the family and gives the biggest whiff of normalcy from the film with Kumar Pallana, the knife happy friend/butler/colleague at the opposite end of the spectrum. Along with Pallana's inspired creation, comes Anderson's strongest hand - background players. Like the Coens, he truly adores every character and you feel background with each one. Whether it be Danny Glover's sombre turn as Huston's love interest, Royal's colleague and partner in deception or Buckley the dog. They carry the film and keep it fresh.The script is as above mentioned, slow-burning, letting its characters develop with ease and no constraints. This sits perfectly with Anderson's patient camera, and eye to present the story in a skit-type basis which it very well may be with its spot-on throw away one-liners. When pestered about the nature of his suicide note Richie replies wryly, ""Of course it's dark, It's a suicide note.""Its along with these, the acting and Andersons direction that Tenenbaums is promoted from simply a cult or indie classic into something so much more. The slow moments perfectly sober the funnier and give room for rest and perspective. It is also where the film delivers its most touching and poignant moments. The wedding scene is totally destroying and will levels the viewer flat. As with Richie's graphic suicide attempt and Royals ultimate demise in the company of his previously absent son.I cannot praise this film enough but I have tried.",The Royal Tenenbaums

I have talked to people who liked it, but I just don't get it. It was boring, un-moving, impractical, and slow.The actors in the movie are great actors, mind you--Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, Danny Glover... all class acts. And they do their parts well, Danny Glover especially with such enthusiasm for his part.What am I saying here? That the movie was bad, poorly written, and poorly presented. The actors did a really good job but were given really bad writing.Overall, it was very hard to follow and not very interesting.

I think it was just because i was sad and it cheered me up.Anyway this movie kicks ass. let it be known, i love this movie.The reason i loved this movie is because it looks at life in such a different way. I really was attached to the character played by Luke Wilson, as well as Gwen...eh don't remember her name.The movie plays into my personality very well, and I'm not a creepy person at all.

633,mneilson-2,The perfect balance of drama and comedy,10,9 November 2004,"I loved this film.The Tenenbaum's dysfunction (while amplified for the screen) is quite an accurate portrayal of family life. Families are, essentially, groups of people living in each other's pockets, and, invariably, those people who love you and hate you the most.Don't get me wrong, Royal and his (thermo)nuclear family of brilliant buffoons do not represent my family (or any other in the world I think!) but the family united against a miscreant father is a motif a lot of people can understand. It is this common humanity that really appeals to me as a film watcher, and what, ultimately made this film so very memorable to me.The ensemble cast is astonishingly proficient. They all lend a perfect quirkiness to the roles. Anjelica Houston is the perfect former Mrs Royal Tenenbaum, down to the smallest nuance, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson turn in wonderful performances, and this is the only role I've seen Gwenyth Paltrow in where I actually thought she was someone other than Gwenyth Paltrow (this is not an insult, it's just that people don't always do it for everyone, you know...?). Bill Murray, Gene Hackman, Owen Wilson, all excellent, all the time.The black comedy counterbalanced with the drama of the issues raised in this film left me feeling like I'd witnessed a film event, rather than just another film. I loved every frame of it, from the Baldwin narrated opening, to the final tying up of ends. It never dwelled on melodrama, or the more potentially unsavoury elements, and it didn't sink into the schmaltzy ""We all love each other"" end it could well have. It began perfectly, and it ended perfectly.I can't recommend this movie more highly. It's a must see for anyone who loves quirky and emotive storytelling, great characters and beautiful dialogue.10/10",The Royal Tenenbaums
634,kvhaesen,"Lasted too long. Disappointing experience, in spite of showing Anderson's potential",6,3 March 2018,"This film was a great disappointment, perhaps because I had watched The Grand Hotel Budapest first, a much better movie. The Royal Tennenbaums shows Anderson's talent and potential yet also the many flaws and growing pains that came with this early production. The main flaw however is not the acting nor the storytelling, but simply the film's lenght: instead of 110 minutes, this film should have lasted maximum 90 minutes! The redundant 20 minutes consist of unnecessary scenes, random filling or simply bad dialogues. Compared to Wes' later films this one does not live up to the expectations. Moreover, there is a very graphic, disturbing suicide attempt by one of the characters, which is completely out of tune with Anderson's fantasy, colorful style: the scene simply breaks the flow - if one can use that word, because the film never becomes really fluid like The Grand Hotel BUdapest does. It lacks rhythm annd grace.Interesting only for those who are die-hard Anderson fans and willing to be very forgiving for all the flaws. For all others, I recommend Anderson's later work, especially the animated films and his masterpiece so far, The Grand Budapest Hotel.6/10 (and I feel I'm still being too generous with my rating).",The Royal Tenenbaums

Every character in the movie was a glove fit for the part . I must say this was my first Wes Anderson experience .Gene Hackman was perfect as he always is .I think it puts a human face on being human and the way we deal with life, and how it happens although not to the extreme of the characters and the movie .I think the music in this movie was perfect .I think we all have a little bit of the tenebaums children in all of us .When we in a since lick our wounds from things in our past .In the great thing is that everything in the end pretty much stayed the same but the characters just learned to deal with their dysfunction instead of finding some magic cure by the end .An this movie has made me a new fan of Wes Andersons work.It's about time movies not spell every little detail out to you,But you have to actually watch this movie, 2 to 3 times to really get it an that makes it great.",The Royal Tenenbaums
636,uberpoof,Beauty found in comic places,10,24 January 2005,"The Royal Tenenbaums, to put it shortly, is a weird movie. It is the story of a family longing for its heyday to return. It is the story of a man who wants to be accepted. It is a story of redemption, filled with small epiphanies and smaller details that make for excellent viewing. It takes delight in showcasing its brilliant characterizations and depictions of social oddities. Many will find it hard to relate to such strangers and therefore decline to revel in this film's cinematic glory. We can pity them.Those that enjoy Wes Anderson's films can be put into two categories. There are those that simply find them to be quirky joyrides and laugh them off as such. Then there are those who recognize the loneliness in all of the characters Wes Anderson writes - it is this sense of loneliness that Wes Anderson, as a storyteller, brings to the screen. It is this sense of loneliness that makes Wes Anderson one of the most visionary filmmakers out there today.The Royal Tenenbaums is an altogether thrilling experience. It is epic, filled with pageantry. Though categorized as a comedy, at times it seems darker then typical black comedies - a drama, or even a triumphant tragedy of life's unrealized outcasts. As Margot Tenenbaum (Gwenyth Paltrow) says in one of the last scenes: ""Well, I'm sure he'll get over it."" The Royal Tenenbaums is a rejoicing in the human spirit's reluctant but continuous march forward.",The Royal Tenenbaums

This is the type of movie that gets better with more viewings. This film gives off so many different emotions: Life,Art,Love,Death, and the the feeling that any family can overcome their differences. Nothing in this movie seems unnatural and the characters seem so close to home. Since I'm not a writer,filling up a minimum of ten lines seems like a chore.

645,ahmckinnon,Overrated,3,15 September 2006,"Wes Anderson pays attention to extraneous details and smothers his movies with cuteness. TRT hasn't evolved from the promise of ""Rushmore"". ""Rushmore"" was fun and promising but after two feature-length films, ""The Royal Tanenbaums"" and ""Life Aquatic"" he still hasn't developed past his high school autobiography. Obviously he commands a lot of star power and financing, more than is good for him. He wastes the talent. He doesn't know what to do with them, Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, Michael Gambon and Bill Murray. Bill Murray jumped the shark (for me) in ""Lost in Translation"" a self-indulgent paean to Sofia Coppola's rich, spoiled and precious life. Wes Anderson falls into this category. The 3 points are for his dedication to set design and aesthetics. He clearly cares a great deal about cute details, dolphins with cameras following the boat etc. how these enhance the story and the audience experience, I don't know.

647,lozza778,The Royal Tenenbaums,9,30 June 2007,"I expect many will dismiss Anderson's Magnus Opus as one of two things. 'Quirky' or 'insubstantial'. They are, in no uncertain terms, wrong. Yes the film is offbeat, innovative and original, quirky even, and yes the production design is near saturated with wondrous stylistic flourishes. But, crucially, this is not a case of style obscuring substance. This is style begetting substance. For every Dalmatian mouse, we get a fantastically realised character, for every kitsch tableau, we get a wonderful moment of human interaction. The Royal Tenenbaums is a movie steeped in acute, ingenious, absurd observation. It's a deceptively complicated fable of human loss, grief and redemption, played out with beguiling subtlety by its all star cast. The screenplay (written by Anderson with long time collaborator Owen Wilson) somehow manages to give each character of the large ensemble cast immeasurable depth . It's a stunning achievement considering the relatively scant screen time each actor gets. When Royal (played by a twinkling Gene Hackman) confronts his estranged wife Ethel (Angelica Houston) , with the news of his imminent death it's a wonderful moment. With approximately eleven lines of dialogue, we are given an astonishing insight into the two characters. A lesser film would struggle to impart so much in its entire running time. Not only is this sequence informative, it is both moving and laugh out loud funny. It's a combination that the film pulls out of the bag often. Thematically The Royal Tenenbaums is supercharged. The witty banter, and recognisably comic actors conceal very dark undercurrents. Divorce, suicide, drug abuse, incestuous relationships and death all are brought to the fore, thinly veiled by sparkling delivery and a rose tinted camera lens. Surprisingly amongst Stiller, Hackman, Murray and Glover it is actually Luke Wilson who emerges as the films star. It's perhaps his most impressive performance and suggests that he is capable of depths that his brother couldn't dream of. As tragic ex-tennis player Richie Tenenbaum he shoulders most of the film's heavy lifting. It is he who embodies the film's darker subtexts, yet he does so in a way that is entirely affable, warm and affecting. This approach is synonymous with the film as a whole, and those who accuse Anderson of producing a film altogether too cutesy have clearly just not paid enough attention. His amalgamation of offbeat design and darkly comic tragedy makes for a film that is both sparkling and effectively introspective.Not only is The Royal Tenenbaums armed with an acute, deceptively profound script, and blessed with fantastic performances, it is graced with a soundtrack so perfect one is tempted to break down and weep. The Rolling Stones and The Beatles rub shoulders with Erik Satie and Elliott Smith, whilst The Ramones and The Clash do battle with Bob Dylan and Nick Drake. Like the film it's an eclectic mix, and its possibly the best soundtrack since Pulp Fiction. With so much going for it, it's hard to see how the haters could be so blind. There's not a character who's not endearing, there's not a line that's wasted. Suffused with delightful styling, impeccable comic timing and sumptuous melancholia, the film is wry, glowing, and finally, in its own very particular way, life affirming. See it, then see it again.",The Royal Tenenbaums
648,mns_bhat,Wes Anderson at his best!!,9,20 January 2009,"This was the first Wes Anderson movie that I watched. It appealed to me so much that I landed up watching most of his other movies with the latest one being ""Darjeeling Ltd"". Wes Anderson's other movies like ""Rushmore"" and ""Life Aquatic"" were also good but none was able to recreate the same joyful experience that was set by Royal Tenenbaums.The movie portrays the dark side of a dysfunctional family. But the different characters in the movie, each having their own quirkiness, weave together to form an interesting and joyful storyline. The casting is perfect with Ben stiller playing the role of an over protective dad, Luke Wilson as a depressed brother and Gene Hackman playing the title role of an aloof father. Gwyneth Paltrow looks beautiful as she makes a serious attempt at acting. As with all Wes Anderson movies, this movie too has a heavy blend of wonderful background scores and a subtle dash of comedy.In all, this movie is a pleasurable watch especially if you want to experience the trademark Wes Anderson directorial style at it's best.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Gene Hackman's performance, the best thing about it, wasn't that good anyway.  And I am totally sick of the Wilson brothers. They have absolutely no range.  They have no idea how to play anything other than their fantasies of the type of cool offbeat dudes that they wish they were in real life but probably aren't.Everyone else in my family liked it, and I have no idea why.

The whole setup zips along through each character from the brilliance of their childhood to the immobility of adulthood.  Gene Hackman has one of his most juiciest rolls ever.  In Royal Tenenbaum, Gene gets to let out some fog and crankiness with a smile. Brilliant casting job!I think the movie should have kept the cream puff tone through the end. Towards the second half, I felt it strayed too far into uncomfortable territories unnecessarily.  Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have a gift for dialogue and genuinely funny situational comedy with some good deadpan. Wes brings a real freshness to film with his complex characters blended with music and retro style.  Bravo to a surging talent.",The Royal Tenenbaums

The music, games, book designs, interior design, clothing, and feel of this movie is so seamless, and reminds me of ""Ghost Dog"", in which everything surrounding the characters screams out ""the best has passed"". The story, pacing, and dialogue are so uniquely Wes Anderson that if you're in that kind of mood, there's nothing better. If not, or if you disliked his previous work, it's just another movie. The casting is top-notch, and the actors give a wonderful performance.

It isn't easy to hum along, true. But it's like a masterpiece of painting you can stand in front of and think of each little brush stroke the artist made.I'd like to see how much each of the well known actors (many Wilson brothers...) has been paid for this film, but I don't think that any of them was in the movie for money. There are few films today, where you can truly feel that the actors wanted to be in the film just for fun (or art...).I recommend everyone who wrote those bad critics, to watch the cuts, the pictures, the images, the lines and the scenes of this movie and compare it to some music examples of the 60s - very suggestive.",The Royal Tenenbaums

The audience reaction was so warm and appreciative of the dialogue and I believe felt close to the characters as each represented someone each one of us knows personally. Top marks to the cast and crew who captured the essence of what makes ""family"" unique and the bonds that are shared among blood.

664,ricardosuave,great movie,9,11 May 2006,"Wes Anderson is one of my favorite film makers today. He can truly capture the meaning of the human race and how we interact. He can show the beauty and also the evilness in humans. This movie I really enjoyed. The characters were well developed and the storyline i thought was heartwarming and also had a lot of depth behind it. I also like the fact that some of Wes Andersons movies are made to look sort of retro. For some reason, I like that style and it makes everything seem like the past which isn't a bad thing. To go along with this retro idea, all of Wes Andersons movies have very good music in them, primarily old, classic rock, or whatever it is, it fits. Anyways, I thought that Gene Hackmans character was funny and also charming in his attempt to essentially regain his family back again. I just love the part when Royal takes Ben Stillers two sons out to do some misbehaving fun. I kind of wanted to see the two sons actually get to do something a little exciting and mischievous for a change, and Paul Simons, ""me and Julio down by the schoolyard,"" was a good song choice for that scene. I would recommend this movie for anyone who would like to see something particularly meaningful. You will leave the movie feeling like you've seen a work of art. I would also recommend Wes Andersons other movies. Rushmore, Bottle Rocket, and Life Aquatic.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Seeing it the second time I was able to hear even more that made me laugh, that I hadn't heard the first time.  Really great movie; awesome acting by Gene Hackman, Owen Wilson, and the rest of the very impressive ensamble cast.

I did not find anything funny in this film. To be honest, I've never seen any other work by Wes Anderson. Maybe his other films are alright.....who knows. What I do know is that I won't be renting any of his movies any time soon.....yeah....I am letting one bad apple spoil the whole bunch.When a movie that runs just under an hour and fourty minutes seems like three hours you know that it's definately lacking something (a plot maybe). I felt bad for making two of my friends see this movie with me, as they seemed to enjoy it less than I did.In all fairness, I did recommend this movie to my parents. Every theatre goer over 35 seemed to love this film.I only laughed twice during the film. Once when the man sitting behind me snorted; and again when the lady next to me touched my arm with her fur coat (hey.....it tickled).If you like off-beat, dark, and often boring (ok, completely boring) comedies, go see the Royal Tenenbaums. If you are under 35 or do not enjoy the above......save your $8.00, go to Blockbuster and spend $4.00 to rent something so won't feel so bad returning if it was completely horrible (you might even have enough money left to buy some Gummi Bears at the checkout).",The Royal Tenenbaums

I feel sorry for those who didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I can't help but feel that they missed out. I loved The Royal Tennenbaums. I'm biased, however. I have been closely following the carreers of Wes Anderson and The Wilson Brothers since Bottle Rocket. I nervously watched their stars rise, hoping they wouldn't sell out. (Kind of like your favorite local band who signs a record contract) I loved this movie. It was what I expected. Anderson has become quite the auteure. Certain themes have repeated themselves in each of his movies. Meanwhile, his visual style has grown. He and D.P. Robert Yeoman can create visually staggering images of the most mundane settings. Kudos to the art director as well. Each frame is so full of color and detail! How can you become bored watching this? There is so much to see and hear. The script was amazing. No suprise there. The acting was superb. Again, this I expected. Anderson seems to be able to pull great performances from his actors. Bill Murray should have won an Oscar for Rushmore and gene Hackman better win one for Royal Tenenbaums. And I believe Luke Wilson should be considered for best supporting actor.",The Royal Tenenbaums

It illustrates the family, trauma, loss, forgiveness, love, failure, success, in a funny, dramatic, and very creative way. The dynamic is unique, you never get bored and the photography is just amazing, every shot looks like a painting, with bright colors and perfect symmetry.
And the cast...all the actors are excellent, the main ones, the kids, the old, the dog. At the begging, when the characters were introduced, it gave me chills, it was just amazing.
To finish, I'd just like to say that I love the reality that Wess Anderson creates in his films, there's nothing else like it. And I recommend this film, it made my Saturday a lot more fun.",The Royal Tenenbaums

I'm not yet willing to say that it is better than Bottle Rocket but it will only get better with time. Go see it more than once!

From the opening voiceover ""explaining"" the family's history, I kept waiting for it to become funny. Now, I appreciate humor and think that I have a rather dry sense of what is funny but I never found it here. I kept trying to make myself laugh (and did chuckle here and there). I was profoundly disappointed in the film. Perhaps I am not sophisticated to appreciate the writing, but then, I don't think so. I did not feel alone. The audience chuckled a few times as well; the rest of the time, the theater had the atmosphere of an unoccupied tomb.

674,PhilTheCanuck,My New Favorite Movie!!,10,21 January 2002,"Having seen Royal Tenenbaums 3 times already (all in the past weekend), I must say, I could definitely see it again.  It is by far the greatest achievement in filmmaking of 2001.  Having said that, I am quite surprised by the abundance of negative comments posted by users of IMDB. Who are these people?  I have only come across one person, among the many with whom I have spoken, who did not love this movie.This film is superbly acted, bringing an excellent performance out of Luke Wilson and even more surprisingly, a very watchable performance from the otherwise annoying Gwyneth Paltrow.  And then there is Gene Hackman, one of the greatest actors of our time who even when unmotivated turns out great performances. Well in this one, he was nothing short of stellar.  He gave life to his many brilliantly penned lines, written by Wes Anderson and the underrated actor Owen Wilson. And speaking of underrated, Ben Stiller, who is oft noted for his slapstick, funny performances, delivers an excellent performance in this role.  Danny Glover, Bill Murray, and Angelica Huston round out the cast beautifully along with a criminally underused Sam Cassel.Could it be that the naysayers don't get the humor?  There are many posts saying ""I get it, I just don't think it is funny.""  I believe that they are just looking for Stiller to be a bumbling fool like in Meet The Parents, or for Owen Wilson to reprise his role from Shanghai Noon just because the two characters share a wardrobe.  This is not a film that smashes jokes into your head a mile a minute.  The writers are not interested in creating nonstop laughter.  This is a brilliant portrayal of a man trying to be accepted by the family he abandonned, just trying to feel some love.  It is about 3 children who peaked at an early age and want to get their lives back in forward motion.  It is about battling demons and trying to get better. It shows us the other side of that facade of success with all its ugliness. It is definitely not for everyone, but well deserving of my 10 out of 10!",The Royal Tenenbaums

There are so many characters you can view this movie from. From Royal, to Richie, to Chas, to Margot, and so many more. Each character is so real, and you can relate to each one. This movie is better than perfect, if I could give it higher than a 10/10 I would.
I didn't even enjoy this movie the first time I watched it, I was on my phone the whole time and barely paid attention. I understand those who don't like it that we're just looking for a funny comedy. But this is better than that, this has heart and its just special. Thats the perfect word, special. I've never seen a movie quite like this in my life.

Throughout the movie you start to understand and enjoy their quirky mannerisms. Ben Stiller shines in this film, but the undisputed star of this movie is the lovable Royal, played by the great Gene Hackman. He plays the kind of father that I'm accustomed to which strike me as yet another similarity this movie has with my family.

680,zaphodgonzo,Pure Genuis,10,16 January 2002,"This movie has some of the most diverse characters ever witnessed in film. Which has to be a great accomplishment for not only the director and actors but for the screenwriters as well. The movie starts out just as any normal movie would, setting up the characters and plot. People are here watching the movie thinking and expecting it to be a comedy but yet behind all the jokes lays a bigger and deeper meaning. Looking at all the kids knowing that they don't hate their lives but maybe want better ones. I think the biggest achievement is that you feel every emotion the character feels. You feel compassion and loneliness for Ben Stiller over losing his wife. You feel butterflies in your stomach over Luke Wilson's deep obsession with his adopted sister Margot(played by one Gwyneth Paltrow). You feel unworthy when you see how Gwyneth Paltrow latches on to these low life losers. Its a great movie. Gene Hackman had the best character out of them all. Its a roller coaster of all coming down into one house hold. GREAT MOVIE.",The Royal Tenenbaums
681,ronche,I get it.,10,11 January 2002,"Let me just sum it all up for you.  ""Royal Tenenbaums"" is a movie with what I call, ""weird humor.""  This is the kind of humor that I'd say 50% of people get and 50% do not.  It's just stuff that seems out of place or doesn't really make sense.  For instance, one of the most halarious parts of the movie in my opinion was when Eli, !POSSIBLE SPOILER! after crashing his car into the Tenenbaum household asks, ""Where's my shoe?"" and then Dudley comes into the frame, kneels, and presents him with his shoe.  Another great part was when Royal and Pagoda were kicked out of the house, Pagoda stabs Royal for the second time, and Royal says something along the lines of, ""That's the last time you put a knife in me!""  Oh god my sides were splitting! Most people would probably think that's just dumb.  Anyway, if you like this kind of comedy, the kind that's also in Rushmore, also a very good film by Wes Anderson, then without a doubt you should see ""Royal Tenenbaums.""

682,pawnshopsign,incredible.,10,7 October 2001,"I was ridiculously lucky enough to find tickets to the premiere of The Royal Tenenbaums at the NYC Film Festival and I hardly know what to say.
I won't give away anything at all or go into much detail about characters or what happens.  Suffice it to say that the film is shockingly superior to Wes' last two films (yes, including Rushmore), and that I've never ever seen a dramatic film that was this funny.  There were a few scenes where the audience couldn't even hear what was being said because everyone was belly laughing so loudly (one scene in particular between Luke and Owen stands out...it's hard not to watch the interior decorating).
Wes crams SO much information and so many jokes into this film; I found myself thinking about the film afterwards and laughing out loud and jokes I'd almost forgotten (the tennis match, for example).  The film does take very dramatic turns, but usually not for long.  To compare, it may not be ""more dramatic"" overall than Rushmore, but the themes it deals with are a bit heavier.  I'm not explaining that very well.  I'll skip it.The acting was sensational, the direction was literally jaw-dropping, the music (The Beatles, Nick Drake, The Ramones, Elliot Smith) was perfect, and story is hilarious and heartbreaking.  I'll have to see it a few more times to come close to digesting it.  How else can I describe it...an instant American classic!  That's what I think, anyway.",The Royal Tenenbaums

This was definitely linked with that title. I loved most of the actors, but where did the story go? Gene Hackman, whom I love, tries to bring his family back together again, now that he is broke, and a pathetic figure that one can not even root for. I guess I really like a comedy, with feel-good moments and do not care if a picture has a message, which seems to be the thing today. I remember action comedy movies by Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner,,,Romancing the Stone, and Jewel of the Nile, both exciting, funny, and romantic.

It's a disjointed, meandering, catatonic mess of a movie held together by seemingly endless voice-over. And no, this garbage was NOT funny. Quirky? Sure. Colorful? I suppose. All-Star cast? You bet. But these things do not a good movie make. Sure, Gene Hackman was steady, and there were intermittent humorous or clever moments, but these were overwhelmed the dull, forced and utterly pointless parts of this colossal failure.I find it sad and telling that a number of critics, and quite a few people commenting on this website, would praise this obvious dud simply because (I suspect) it was made by a couple of young, up-and-coming filmmakers who have one good movie under their belts.

Unfortunately, even that was absolutely not enough to make up for the preceding one-and-a-half hours.
I think even Britney Spears in her Crossroads would have been more interesting. Many people walked out during the film, it was only that we had to pass some ten people in order to leave that we stayed and hoped the film would get better. So not! Go see this film, the easiest way to waste your money!",The Royal Tenenbaums
694,shorge_sato,Homer Tenenbaum?,9,16 December 2001,"The tone of the movie's treatment of family values reminded me most of a live-action version of the Simpsons.  Hilarious tactlessness counterpoised perfectly with genuine, hapless, ineffable longing--is this not everyone's family in caricature?The dramatic tension in this movie--and all of Wes Anderson's works, it seems--is in framing an unlovable protagonist's impossible need to be accepted against his unflagging and feeble attempts at redemption.  Each character has their own impossible demon to vanquish.  For Royal, it's overcoming the past.  For Chas, it's risk.  For Margot, it's alienation. For Richie, it's taboo.  What is common and instantly recognizable is the longing that dominates each character.  Like Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, Anderson manages to craft every scene with multiple layers of sight gags, intelligent wit, and almost unbearable precocity, and only a few times does it ever come across as remotely forced.  The acting is phenomenal--especially Huston as the Marge-like matriarch and Hackman as a duplicitous everydad.  Owen Wilson's demented pop-western novelist Eli Cash (author of ""Wildcat"")--need I even draw the comparison to an older, cowboy Bart?",The Royal Tenenbaums
695,maxwellsmith,Not their best work...,4,16 December 2001,"Well I like these guys so I dont think there's any real need to pan in a big way, but this is not at the level I was hoping for. The characters were interesting as were their vignettes, but the writers forgot to include the cement that binds great films. The movie was star-studded but unnecessarily so as Luke, Gwyneth, Stiller and Glover gave very uninteresting performances. Whether that was their fault or the script's, it's hard to say...This was two guys (writing) and one guy (andersons direction) just having fun on a big budget with big stars and big ideas.

None the less, there is no better movie. Ever since I saw Bottlerocket and Rushmore, I knew Wes Anderson was a special director and the Wilson/Anderson writing team was top notch. This movie merely proves that beyond a shadow of a doubt. _The Royal Tenenbaums_ deals with issues such as drug use, suicide, incest, infedelity with such a tact and perfect dichotomy between humor and seriousness.The acting: Gene Hackman at his best since his Oscar win for _The French Connection_, Angelica Houston and Danny Glover give their best performances in years, Luke and Owen Wilson as always give great performances under Anderson, Paltrow in her best performance ever, Stiller's best performance as well (in his first decent role), and Bill Murray shines again under Anderson. Of course, one cannot mention a Wes Anderson movie without mentioning his troupe of actors that you will find only in his movies. Kumar Pallana as Pagoda steals every scene he is in, and Seymour Cassel as Dusty is another great accomplice to the scheming Royal.Perhaps Anderson's greatest strengths lie in his ability to bring out great performances from his actors, and the subtle detail in every scene. Watch the movie a second time: look at the walls in the Tenenbaum home. Even these miniscule details build even more upon the rich characters of _The Royal Tenenbaums_. See it again and again.JurorNo8's Rating: 9.8/10",The Royal Tenenbaums
698,kathrynclare76,Wes and Owen Strike Again,10,5 January 2002,"For the past year, I have been waiting patiently to see The Royal Tenenbaums. Like most movie geeks, both Bottle Rocket and Rushmore are on my short list of favorite movies. Finally I was given the pleasure of attending what, without a doubt, will be hailed as one of the best movies of all time. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, the comic and dramatic geniuses behind Bottle Rocket and Rushmore have outdone themselves with The Royal Tenenbaums. The movie is both humorous and touching, light and dark, and just all-around fabulous. I will admit, at first I had my doubts about the cast. What made the first two movies so good was the mix of the unknown (Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson in Bottle Rocket, Jason Schwartzman in Rushmore) and the well-known (James Caan in Bottle Rocket and Bill Murray in Rushmore). To hear that the cast included such mega-stars as Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston and Gwyneth Paltrow did not sit well with me at first. But, I can admit that I was dead wrong. There could not have been a better cast for the film. Gene Hackman, at 71, plays the role of a lifetime. After he wins the Academy Award, Royal Tenenbaum will always appear in any story about him. Luke Wilson is amazing in the film, and after watching his performance, I am upset that the media has not given him his due for the part. The set decorations are amazing. I have never seen so much color and detail in so many shots in one film. The ambiance of the sets is what gives the film its edge. The Royal Tenenbaums is a 10 in my book. The perfect movie. I just can't wait to see what Wes and Owen come up with next. I'm on the edge of my seat.",The Royal Tenenbaums

From the assassin east indian butler to the amazingly bizzare physciartist (played by Bill Murray) you just laugh at how crazy this movie is.There is a lot more to this movie than star power and I highly recommend it to anyone who is bored of movies that rely on ridiculous slapstick (eg. not another teen movie) to get a laugh from the audience.a 10/10 in my book",The Royal Tenenbaums

It's been a family favorite for years and each time we see it we notice something new.

Without going into detail about the story or characters -- though loads could be written -- I'll just take a moment to comment on the cinematography, which was superb.  I don't know how he does it, but Wes Anderson manages to frame and shoot films that feel almost like Renaissance paintings -- the frame is full, but balanced between foreground and background, vibrant colors contrasting in different parts of the frame, with an almost obsessive attention to detail and nuance that fill out the main focal point of the shot.  How he manages to integrate this technique into the film, without pulling you out of the narrative or being gimmicky (later-day Scorsese, I'm looking your direction), I cannot describe or understand, but he does manage it. Once again, Wes Anderson has managed to combine a vibrant, moving and very funny story with exquisite artistry in film-making.My only regret is that we have to wait 2 years for another new film. At least there is the Criterion DVD to look forward to!",The Royal Tenenbaums
703,jamesamy,A very well written story (a rare 9),9,30 December 2001,"The Royal Tenenbaums is a very well written story.  I enjoyed all 2 hours and 10 minutes.  Although this movie had many characters, I felt I had met each and every one of them before (with exception to Owen Wilson's character).  This movie is not your classic American film where the climax builds for 1 hour and 55 minutes and then comes to an end 5 minutes later.  This is a story very evenly told, very un-annoying, very entertaining.Do not go to this movie thinking it's a hysterically funny comedy, it's not although you will laugh later.  Go to the movie and see it much in the same way you look at a painting. Various details catch your attention and all are woven together in some crazy or simple way.  If you can teach yourself to not look for the plot, but to look for the theme you will enjoy this movie over and over again.My only criticism is Owen Wilson.  I felt he was just an over used ""extra"" for friend's sake.I gave this movie a rare 9",The Royal Tenenbaums
704,nickjwat,The reason why people make movies,10,2 January 2002,"This is the type of movie that makes real film goers want to call Wes, luke, and Owen and say ""can I give you my life to help you make another movie like this.""  Because its movies like this that make life worth living.  So, if you guys happen to read this can I have a job doing anything?",The Royal Tenenbaums
705,spangk,"Take Comedy, mix in Drama, shake well.",10,5 January 2002,"Well I already wrote a little snippet (don't know if it was published or not) of what I thought about the movie.  However I realize now, after reading some of the other comments that that may not suffice.  I don't think many of the people writing these comments have even seen any of Wes' other films, or would even want to, for that matter.  Some of you can see brilliance when it's in front of you. you are the ones that say, `Wow, Thomas Edison, that was just genius. Electricity will change the world.' The rest of you just sit back and say, `Yippee, what the hell do we need that for.'  Now I know that is a terribly exaggerated analogy, but I'm cramped for time, and I'm trying to make a point.  For those of you who just don't get The Royal Tenenbaums, just think about the movie for a bit, you might start to realize that it's more of a play than a movie, and who knows you might actually get some of Wes', and Owen's brand of humor.  It's not in-your-face fall down gags (except maybe one or two) or mindless sexual-innuendos, it's more `intelligent' humor.  I don't mean to classify any type of humor as better than another, but in Tenenbaums, you just have to read between the lines - you have to think.  The jokes are present - they are definitely there, you just have to listen.  For example, all of the characters kept the same clothes, adding to the caricature-like portrayal of each person, thus giving the viewer a better understanding of each personality in a very short amount of time.  One of my favorite things about Anderson's films is the behavior of each character; it's the same type of funny that you see when you sit back and look at life in general.  It's obvious by many of the reviews that I've been seeing, that several people just don't get that type of humor though.  However, to those people, I'd just like to say, `Keep trying, eventually you'll get it.'  Look at all the big stars that have fallen victim to loving that type of amusement:  Gene Hackman, Bill Murray, Danny Glover, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Seymour Cassel, Alec Baldwin, Jason Schwartzman, and obviously Luke, Owen, and Andrew Wilson.  One might say, well everybody makes a bad movie now and then, but if that were the case, why would they keep coming back? I think movies need something lately. people are making movies left and right, and most are good.  However, good isn't something we should strive for, movies should be great, and movies should be different.  Wes Anderson show's the movie industry what it should strive to be.  He uses vibrant colors and beautiful scenery to make memorable settings.  His musical choices are so fitting to the movie and it's respective moods (contrasting with most movies now-a-days that just throw in some songs that are popular to sell the soundtrack, or cheap shots like the very African-American music played throughout the whole movie Ali with little regard to the mood or tempo of the movie).  Combining Wes' artistic approach at sight and sound with his extraordinary use of dialogue and behavioral antics he makes the movie so pleasurable to the eyes, ears, and everything else you can think of.  To all the fans that have loved Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson's films so far: thanks for the support, you helped put out one of my new favorite movies of all time (which I drove 2 hours each way to Philadelphia, 3 days in a row and once more after that, just to see this piece of classic cinema history).",The Royal Tenenbaums
706,mjharks22,Not what it's cracked up to be,2,4 January 2002,"After weeks of previews for The Royal Tenenbaums and all the great reviews, I waited anxiously for the movie to finally be released. The story seemed interesting, and the impressive cast lured me to believe this would be an excellent movie. Gene Hackman and Angelica Huston are Royal and Etheline Tenenbaum, with Ben Stiller (Chas), Gwyneth Paltrow (Margot), and Luke Wilson (Richie) as the 3 ""genius"" Tenenbaum children. Also with Owen Wilson as Richie's friend Eli Cash.  So I came in with pretty high expectations. The movie began very slowly, documenting the early days of the Tenenbaum family when the children were at a young age, with Alec Baldwin narrating. I kept waiting for there to be a point when the movie would get rolling. But there never really was that point. It just dragged on with an occasional joke that would be sort of funny but not that funny. As the plot twisted and turned along the way, there was never a point throughout the movie that you could really embrace the characters. It was like they were just a bunch of boring people standing around. I could go video tape a bunch of people standing around doing nothing for two hours and it'd probably have the same effect as this movie.  However, there was one bright spot in my opinion, and that would be the  performance by Gene Hackman. He did a terrific job of playing the old grumpy  man trying to get back on the side of his kids whom he'd treated like garbage their whole lives. Gwyneth was OK, but her character Margot had absolutely no personality and therefore dragged the movie down. And Ben Stiller was hardly entertaining, his two boys were fun though.I seriously almost walked out of the theater in the middle of this one. This movie had so much potential, but it dragged on so much that there didn't seem to be any point to sitting through the whole thing. Besides Gene Hackman, there's not much reason to see this except for maybe curiosity. But if you are looking for entertainment, you might as well forget this one.I'll give it *1/2 out of 5",The Royal Tenenbaums

That's ok too, there are lots of movies other people love that I just don't 'get' either.  But, in the last month I have seen 4 or 5 movies that other people raved about, including Harry Potter (cute, but too long!), Lord of the Rings (cool, but waaaaay too long!) and Vanilla Sky (incredibly, insultingly, degradingly way way way too long).

Granted, Angelica Huston gave a wonderful performance (is she capable of anything less?). Danny Glover seemed to be the rock of this picture (I hesitate to call it a film). His character is the only one who has the slightest amount of common sense. As for everyone else, get over yourselves.

The characters lacked substance, and as a result, I felt nothing for them...didn't hate 'em, didn't like 'em...couldn't care less what happened to them.  What a waste of a Sunday afternoon. And what a waste of some great talent. Although I'm not generally impressed with Miss Paltrow's body of work, with both Ben Stiller & Bill Murray in the cast, I mistakenly thought this ""comedy"" would be a winner.  And poor Danny Glover, he obviously received some misguided career advice.  Apparently, according to some of the other reviewers on this database, I just don't get it (and neither did the 4 others in my group).  But when a movie is highly touted as the best comedy (of the year, decade, century), I expect laughs. At the very least, a few giggles, smirks, grins. Nope. Even throwing a ""dark comedy"" label on the movie--and adjusting your expectations accordingly--wouldn't save this one.

But then ten minutes later I would be on the brink of tears, coaxed by the incredible soundtrack. I found the characters to be extremely lifelike; all performances were flawless. I can't say I've ever seen a movie that took me from one extreme to another emotionally like the Tenenbaums. Even the very unique way the store is told, like from a book or directly from the score. I plan on running out to rent all the other Wes Anderson's movies, the only shame being that there are only two of them, Rushmore and Bottle Rockets. Some very unique movies aren't for everyone, usually hitting the wrong chords with movie go-ers just out to laugh, not expecting the wonderful roller coaster effect present in this movie.

I absolutely love his quirky way of setting up reality, making the most mundane situation seem on the same plane as the most dramatic of events.  This manner of flatening the world around us is what, I believe, makes you either love or hate his films.You will not leave the theatre thinking: ""that movie was ok.""  You'll love it or hate it, so prepare for that.  I think Gene Hackman puts in one of his finest performances that I've witnessed.  His depiction of Royal, the loveable, yet unbearable conman father is bang on and left me giggling to myself for days.  Both Wilson brothers are their usual subtly funny selves. Gwyneth is, for once, nicely watchable (and HOT), but perhaps that is more to do with her choosing of chick flick scripts at ALL times.  Bill Murray was the only disappointment for me...not at all his fault, simply a weak character.You MUST see this film.  You may hate it, but you may also find it to be a golden treat.

After another viewing the two films were on par, and after a few more Rushmore had become my favorite film of all time.I kept this in mind going into The Royal Tenenbaums.  I couldn't help wanting another Rushmore, and I left feeling let down (as did a few other members of the audience who walked out during the touching final minutes). The film was much more up-front with it's human misery than Rushmore was, plus Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson's humor is so simple and so subtle it's almost as if you have to know it's coming to really laugh at it.  I found myself thinking in my head during many scenes that the next time I watch this film I'm going to be dying of laughter.This was true upon my second viewing.  I was anticipating moments and finding new details to enjoy.  There was more than one scene where I was the only one laughing in the theater.  The film really opens up the second time one sees it, due in no small part to Wes Anderson's brilliant ability to maintain continuity throughout the picture, both from the visuals as well as the music.  Also, the misery seemed to give way to aching tenderness.Finally, the acting was amazing from the entire cast.  Although I feel Danny Glover has been under-appreciated for his role as Etheline's love interest (and Royal's rival) Henry Sherman.  I propose nothing short of an Academy Award for best supporting actor.I'm looking forward to future viewings of The Royal Tenenbaums as much as I have enjoyed repeated viewings of past films.

The twists and turns of the story has the jokes unraveling slowly over the course of the movie. I have to say, in comparison to many of the recent releases, this movie kept me entertained from start to finish. I couldn't guess the next line or coming plot twists once. Its the story of a very eccentric family dealing with the impact of change and the denial they have been living in. Anjelica plays a very dry character, deep in sarcastic wit. Ben a very complicated man dealing with the pitfalls of life. Owen and Luke show glimpses of the bizarre, yet down to earth. Hackman, what can you say about Hackman. He's always on in this type of comedy. Gwen was left as a complicated yet intriguing, beautiful woman. Don't expect lounge singing antics from Bill, he only plays a supporting role. This isn't slap stick but I would put one of the scenes at the top 10 of my ""most hilarious sketch or scenes"" from a movie. Its not necessarily the kind of movie that needs to be seen on the big screen. I thought to myself, ""it would have been nice sitting on the couch with my honey watching this one at home"".

I thought overall that it was a well-directed film. I enjoyed it thoroughly; it is full of extremely poignant scenes. The black comedy is quite appropriate and not overly gross or gratuitous. The writing is well thought out and the punch lines are right on cue. The conceptualisation was well planned and quite brilliantly executed. I highly recommend it for fans of the genre, as well as people just looking to have a good laugh to cure the ills. A bittersweet story of life, its tragedies, and how it can become a comedy of errors and mishaps.",The Royal Tenenbaums

730,supahsweepea,it's not like I don't get it...,5,25 February 2002,"Saw Rushmore, Bottle Rocket. Fell in love with Wes thanks to liberal use of the Kinks, well-placed awkward teenage floundering, perfect swearing, and the poignant sting of misappropriated genius.  Flush with erudition I cringed at bad reviews from co-workers... ""it's boring."" ""what time period was it supposed to be in?"" Idiots, I guffed. They don't understand Wes' concept of our generation's neo-americana...the aura of the decaying institution -like hardwood floors in a public school, board games, typewriters, rotary phones. That's what the music is really all about - those songs are really the stuff of our Sesame Street childhood, bells and harps and wailing punk genius.  Tenenbaums seems to make the most of those props - really bringing it into decaying New York luxury, failed aristocracy, smudged celebrity.  The idiom is too lush for words, like a coveted childhood novel you can still enjoy, timeless yet static...but the language behind it - this time the movement was missing. I wanted Gene Hackman to let loose, I wanted Bill Murray to do something, I wanted it to be bolder. Royal isn't supposed to go around saying out loud that he wants his family back.  The whole genius behind Rushmore and BottleRocket was each character's insanity was tenaciously preserved, even as they acted as if they were completely normal.  There is still redemption, change, growth for each character, but no self-consciousness. Not so in Tenenbaums - each character keeps commenting on how crazy they all are, as if they knew the difference!  The only good part was when Royal takes the kids out - even this could have been a little bolder. Everyone was holding back.  So yes, I get it, I understand Wes' vision, I think he's great - but this time he missed the mark. There needed to be more writing and less fluff. Sorry - I was really bored and disappointed.",The Royal Tenenbaums

It was not funny, it was not dramatic, there was no action, there was nothing. I have been coming to this site for years now and this is the first time I have given a review, that is how much I hate this film. With such a great cast I expected a lot more. This is no Bottlerocket. A friend of mine was raving about this movie, talking about how he laughed for 10 min about the painting on Owen Wilsons' wall (the four wheeler guys with the wrestling masks). So I went to see it on a double date(I know...Lame) and all four of us almost walked out. Needless to say my respect for his movie picks has dropped dramatically(even more when I found out the he hated Clerks among other greats).

732,arentol,"Boring, Stupid, Pointless.... And I am holding back.",2,15 June 2002,"I must have seen 25 films in the theater in 2001 and this movie was by far the worst.My understanding from the trailer was that it would be a dark comedy.  It was indeed dark, but it was utterly lacking in comedy.  I didn't laugh one time, and almost never smiled (and I am generally easy to get a lough out of).  I almost enjoyed ""Manos, The Hands of Fate"" more than this movie!I think this quote from a ""positive"" review almost says it all..""A mellifluous, labyrinthine thing, indescribably delicious and ambitiously literate."" -- Walter Chaw, FILM FREAK CENTRAL""melliflous"" means smooth flowing... ""Labyrinthine"" means maze-like.  So we have that is a ""a smooth flowing maze"".  What I then get from that quote (after translating it back from ""intelligencia speak"" is that the movie is long, confusing, more or less pointless, and keeps moving along so you don't have time to realize how lost and pointless it is until it is all over.""ambitiously literate.""  When I hear about a BOOK that is considered ""ambitiously literate"" I know I don't want to read it because it will doubtlessly be ""incredibly dull"".  The last thing I want from a movie is something as dull as the dullest of books.""thing""  This clinches the issue for me.  What you are seeing on the movie screen when you watch this film is not in fact a movie.  It is something else.  As far as I can tell it is a book...  I will get back to this in a minute...When I actually sit down to analyze the movie there are a few primary problems with it that jump out at me...Every single character in the movie is a sterotype (All sterotypes rarely works unless the movie is a pure comedy).  Every single character is completely dysfunctional both in their personal relationships and within themselves (When EVERYONE is dysfunctional to this degree no matter what happens the whole movie is usually a downer).  Their is almost no character development of any character but Royal himself (this is probably because of the sheer number of secondart characters in the movie).  The lack of character development is clearly meant to be covered by the fact that everyone is a stereotype.  Clearly the writers felt they didn't have to do much more than introduce them to you for you to understand them since they are all sterotypical.  Unfortunately understanding the characters is not the same as BONDING with the characters.  The lack of a bond with any of the characters for the first 90% of the movie (you don't even get close to Royal until nearly the end) means that all the character interactions that take place are disconnected from the viewer.  Basically the you (as the viewer) end up a disinterested 3rd party watching a bunch of complete losers you don't care about try to resolve a bunch of problems that you don't give a damn about.By the end of the movie you are supposed to have a connection with Royal and actually be interested in what he does.  You are supposed to be rooting for him to get his life, and hopefully his families straightened out. Unfortunately you know he is an ass and after seeing everything he has done, while you have a connection with him, it is a connection of either loathing or pity, or both, depending on your nature.  No matter how you slice it you end up feeling very negative emotions and no minor laughs can completely correct the problem. ...Back to the book thing.  The movie is presented as a book.  In my opinion that is what it should be, a book, and not a movie.  With a book that actually explored the inner thoughts and emotions of the characters you would have time to develop the connection needed to empathize with the characters and thus be entertained by what happens to them rather than bored.The final nail in the coffin is that the humor is just not that funny. This is actually mostly a matter of timing.  Lots of the best humor is in the intro.  Then the rest of it is squeezed into or between scenes that are very negative.  It just doesn't flow right in my opinion.  Also some of the humor is to quick, some is to subtle, and some is too long.  All of it could have been tweaked for greater effect I think.  At least part of those issues are probably due to having the writer in the cast and on the set every single day.  Most directors will tell you that most writers just shouldn't be on the same set with their work during filming because they don't have sufficient objectivity to not interfere when something that they thought was great on paper ends up sucking on film and is changed.Anyway, if you want to see it then by all means do so.

I saw the movie the second day it was out and all the expectations were not only met but blown out of the water... the movie was just well written and the acting, (especially by Gene Hackman) was phenominal, The cinemetography was unreal and the movie is a must see because it has everything you want in a movie.

I would rank this movie in my top five of all time on par with movies like American Beauty and Gone With the Wind.The scenes that include Hackman and the play between Gwyneth Paltrow and Bill Murray alone were worth the price of admission, but what keeps the film from getting stale are the internal tensions played out in the film.

741,roberttolchard,"Black comedy about brilliant but dysfunctional family, set in recent America.",9,2 January 2008,"I would guess that if you enjoyed ""Amelie"" &/or ""Little Miss Sunshine"" you'd enjoy this a whole lot too, for it contains similar elements to one or the other work when not both: in-depth studies of unusual characters and relationships,dark humour, great storyline, script, acting and music track and last but best, gorgeous visuals! Whatever film stock it was shot on produced rich, muted, luminous reds, which underscored a delightful conceit: that of the leitmotif red object (bag, padlock, hair-slide, whatever) in about 80% of the shots, right to the end, to the lipstick-red Mercedes.But more than this, what blew me away was the result of the painstaking set-up of nearly every shot in terms of the particular palette of colours and textures used, rendering even the mundane (chain-link fence, weathered paintwork, urban roof-scape, building site)things of beauty. I have enjoyed many films for the other elements referred to in the first paragraph, but it is a long time since I was so seduced by a series of such delicious compositions (some almost iconic, like Paltrow's character in front of the green buses). In fact, it would have been ""Valerie and Her Week of Wonders"" (a Czech film from 1970) that last hit that particular spot. There are too many examples of these set-piece frames to list from the Tenenbaums, but I want a copy of the film, not only to enjoy again as a deeply satisfying tragi-comic drama,but as a visual reference work and as a feast for the eyes.I've spent time rattling on about this aspect of the film, because no-one seems to have drawn attention to it and yet I think it adds immeasurably to the overall ""feel"" of the piece, but hey, maybe I'd had a couple of glasses of wine too many? (actually, probably more of a stoned thing, but then I don't do that any more - too risky!).Many of the other reviews are right on the money in terms of synopsis and critique, so there's no point in my duplicating these, but there's my two-pennyworth in respect of an element that might sometimes be overlooked, in spite of it being right there in front of us!",The Royal Tenenbaums

The narrator and the story book images contribute to this feeling. What can I say - I loved this movie.  I've had family and friends comment that they thought it unfolded too slowly.

754,dimitarkum,Judge for yourself,7,11 November 2009,"I've just watched the movie and after that i took the usual comment tour. It seems the opinions of the movie are quite extreme, people either love the movie or completely dismiss it...and i was wondering what should one attribute that to?Well firstly i'm going to look at the positive comments - the part of the viewers that felt in love with the film, watched it few times and find a quality in every aspect are actually attracted by the atmosphere in my opinion. No, this is not a subtle dark comedy or anything of the sort, the feeling is quite different compared to other quirky comedies filled with dark humour, especially compared to the British style. But yet it has something to offer, it's most distinct in its manner of handling the drama, it doesn't dwell too much on it, nor doesn't it instantly resolve it. Even though the story is not very earthly it has some realism in it, characters are not of the type that grow easily on you, but yet they seem to show some complexity. Other then that i would say that some people just seek to hard and try to find things that are not there, i myself enjoyed the movie very much but i wouldn't say it's such a deep movie, that can show all there is to know about family and do it in a comedic way.Now i got to the current of comments completely destroying the movie, people with the self-confidence of true films critics, giving it a rating of 1-3 stars. What most shocked me was the argumentation of their low rating, they say that the movie doesn't cover it's comedy promise, or that it's rather distant than dark. They ask themselves the question- why didn't i enjoyed the movie, saying that they failed ""forcing"" liking of the movie. This just seems so wrong, they've watched it entirely through some genre, through some general opinion, forgetting that each movie is an unique experience. What was so wrong in the movie itself that would make it worth 1-3 stars? It's the fail of completing expectations, prejudices that really destroyed their view of the movie.

755,variolad,Why this film has lasting value,10,5 July 2004,"Prefacing this by saying I am in my late-20's...The reason this film is so great is that everyone involved was dedicated to the director's vision of the film. This film never sells it's characters out, it never compromises it's vision of an alternative-70's era New York City, and it features great performances including what should have been an Oscar-winning lead by Gene Hackman.I think the film has polarized a lot of people, who are turned off by the oddness of the setting and the somewhat bizarre actions of the family.There was a film that they showed us in grade school where two kids hid in a museum...Wes Anderson, doesn't steal from that film, but pays homage to it....I'd love to know what the name of that movie was.If you went to school during the 70s and early 80's maybe you get on the wavelength of this film....to me watching it is like wrapping myself in a blanket and remembering the past.",The Royal Tenenbaums
756,Stavroginandtonic,Best film...possibly ever.,1,22 February 2003,"This film should be hailed as one of the top-ten best ever.  Its greatest assets rest in the untold and unexplained bits of the film and the tongue-in-cheek stabs at all of the characters, people (with the exception of Pagoda, The Butler) who have been taking themselves way too seriously for way too long and their discomfort around their father, a man who never took anyone seriously in his life, least of all himself.The subtle character development IS the story.  Unlike most films, where the characters are boring and easily explained within two minutes, this film relies on the observer's knowledge of human nature, their empathy, and most of all, their willingness to explore a story that doesn't rely on a big, flashing red arrow pointing out each significant detail.I loved it!",The Royal Tenenbaums
757,sparrowc,this one just gets better each viewing,10,28 February 2003,"If you loved Rushmore you'll love Tenenbaums and vice-versa. Very, very funny (you will REALLY laugh watching these films), though not jokey at all. As in Rushmore, you are propelled forward by the characters and their inner and outer conflicts, laughing all the way and also empathizing with the characters and hoping for their successes...Tenenbaums is even more surreal and eccentric than Rushmore. Similar flavor and setting, a kind of dreamlike zen journey for meaning for various characters against a backdrop of the disillusioned/dysfunctional educated middle class, with themes of lost and found relationships/selves/trueloves. Plenty to think about, but don't get me wrong, meanwhile these films are just so funny. Surreal, and yet more real than most films you see currently, at times they really strike a chord. The characters are just so interesting, for one thing.  The humor is unlike any other films being made currently, the Anderson/Wilson writing is definitely unique and after you see it you just want more. The characters in Tenenbaums are kind of like caricatures, almost like a cartoon, so how come we identify with them so easily... many shots are even shot in longshot increasing this cartoon effect, and the effect too of this kind of being a parable, and the characters maybe representing ""everyman"", and as you are watching you can't help but see yourself and others you know in the roles....it's a great effect. I got the feeling sometimes that these longshot views were kind of like a birdseye view of everyone (maybe Mordicai's).  Anyway, very funny, totally entertaining, and touching, too. Many beautiful scenes. Visually unique. Super soundtrack, too. Not to mention the brilliant cast. You can see these films many times and not get tired of them. That's rare.

758,johncrisco,A Must-See Recommendation,10,8 July 2010,"The Royal Tenenbaums is, in my humble opinion, an example of a great movie. I watched it for the first time a few days ago, and could not stop thinking about it. So much, in fact, that I watched it again the next day, and enjoyed it just as much, if not more.The plot takes a while to get going, but the opening scene and introduction are cleverly hilarious, giving you a look inside the life and childhood of the Tenenbaums. Characters such as: Eli Cash (Owen Wilson), Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), Dudley Heinsberger (Stephen Lea Sheppard), and Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), are used sparingly, but seem to make the movie complete.The background of each character is so unique, yet hilarious, with Richie (Luke Wilson) being a tennis-star, Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) being an extraordinary playwright, and Chas (Ben Stiller) being a mice breeder business extrodinare. Then, to top it all off, you have Royal (Gene Hackmen) who is the king of the deadbeats.The movie is tremendously well-made, down to the flashes to pictures of books or pictures to show past events or the different chapter of the book pages to symbolize the start of a new ""act"", if you will. The music is spot-on, almost making the movie, and the narration is done perfectly by Alec Baldwin.The movie, in my opinion, was very good up until the last scene with Richie, in which it became a great movie. For spoiler sake, I will not discuss this scene, just that it is a pivotal part in the movie and has quickly became one of my favorite movie scenes of all time. It was exceptionally well made and deserves more recognition.I would recommend The Royal Tenenbaums to anyone who has not scene it. It is packed with an All-Star cast, one of which each character brings something different to the table. It is hilarious at times, and at others sad and seeming more to the drama genre. In other words, it is a hard movie to explain, with no real genre, in my opinion, but it was one that deserves to be seen by movie lovers.",The Royal Tenenbaums
759,Reddragoon100,Wes Anderson hates dogs,1,12 November 2021,"Don't watch this garbage. Not only does Wes Anderson kill off a beagle to further his horribly shallow perception of someone who is struggling with addition to drugs, but he doesn't allow any emotional response from the children who watched their dog get splattered on the pavement before their very eyes, making them into inhuman robots. Then he just has the dog replaced with a Dalmatian (the firemen that come to the scene of the crash just SELL THEIR DOG TO A COMPLETE STRANGER?!). They have a memorial for Buckley, but no one ever cries or mourns the dog's death in any way. Fine if Wes Anderson wants to be edgy by killing off pets in his films but unacceptable that he doesn't know how to portray the human aftermath of such a traumatic event.",The Royal Tenenbaums
760,movieviewer1486,"Emotionally pleasing, humorous cult classic",10,2 June 2003,"*Possibly contains spoilers*
This movie is well-crafted enough to become a cult classic.  The story and characters develop naturally, the music perfectly complements each scene, and the design is wonderfully whimsical (Alec Baldwin narrates the movie like he's telling a bedtime story).  The Royal Tenenbaums is certainly not the mainstream comedy it was marketed to be; the humor is too subtle and off-beat.  That's not to say that most people won't catch the humor, it's just not laugh-out-loud absurdities every minute like Zoolander--which also features Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson.  However, that is an advantage in this film because it leaves room for the characters to have real emotions and personalities.  I really felt for Ben Stiller's character, who is obsessively overprotective of his two boys after his wife dies, and Anjelica Huston perfectly portrays a self-reliant mother who has raised her children alone and is now learning to love again.  Every character forms some sort of emotional attachment with the viewer.  Although the movie is strange and a little far-out at some points, by the end everyone seems to have grown more normal and well-adjusted, and the story draws to a satisfactory conclusion. I appreciated this movie more after a second viewing, since the first time through is a little confusing and unexpected.",The Royal Tenenbaums

Oh, unless you consider not knowing his adopted daughter's middle name. I suppose this is meant to be funny (or perhaps this is some sort of transatlantic irony struggling for life) but it's just flat. It looks like the makers tried to have too many quirky characters and rather than deal with one or two relationships ended up with nothing but that quirkiness. Big deal.

The film accomplishes what sculpture also does; It causes one to look at an object or objects that can be common to our own lives, and force us to see them in an entirely new perspective.

I loved every scene, every song, and every story line, but, I think the first and second acts of the film were better than the third act, as, to me, it felt very out of place compared to the start, and while watching it, I was left wonder where the plot would go after The Tenenbaums find that Royal dying was a hoax, but I still enjoyed it overall.My recommendation would be if you haven't seen it, give it a watch but go into the film expecting a funny yet dark picture.",The Royal Tenenbaums

The film is a roller coaster; you'd think that it will be a light-hearted comedy, a typical of Wes Anderson. No, he will side kick you in the ribs with these scenes which you could relate to if you have ever been sad, depressed, angry, helpless. I was tearing up in several scenes. My friend did the same, esp. because of what Luke Wilson's character was doing when he felt truly helpless. I love you Wes Anderson. Your movies always give this light shimmering hope despite our messy lives full of mistakes, wrong doings and strained relationships.

I found myself wishing for it to be over and done with just 10 minutes into it...or, at least, a quick death for me. I became so bored with the movie, that I couldn't take my eyes off of it. I was entranced by how terrible the movie was. I kept waiting for something funny to happen (being that it's supposed to be a comedy), but no such luck.

All I saw was a bunch of people doing and talking about boring things. I never was absorbed into the movie. I always knew I was watching a bunch of actors and actresses saying their lines. Why was the Ben Stiller character so angry with his Dad? Was this supposed to be funny or sad or what? I didn't care. Gwyneth Paltrow spent 95% of her time on screen silently and sullenly smoking a cigarette. Is this entertainment, or what?

By presenting such a wide mosaic of eccentric characters, any focus on a certain one is lost. All actors in this film have only about twenty minutes screen time as they try to share the lack of plot with everyone else. Every character is bereft of most emotions, and instead exists only as a specific scenario. With a few exceptions, all that was required of the actors in this movie was blank, vacant, disconnected stares, and deadpan dialogue. Through the first half of the movie I kept thinking that it was just about to get to the good stuff, but it never did.

Believe me, it was hard keeping my eyes propped open with matchsticks. But I did it. Maybe it's coz I paid 8pounds and I wanted to get my money's worth. Maybe it's coz I had nothing else to do.

776,wilderwitch,Subtle perfection,10,3 March 2005,"This film is simply breathe taking. Anderson and Wilson teamed up again, creating another film with their unusual style.This film portrays a family trying to regain a past glory that was never truly there in the first place. The family is composed of supposed 'child geniuses' that grow up knowing they are no geniuses and have trouble dealing with this 'fall from grace' that they know very well was never there in the first place. Their mother, Ethelinne, (Angelica Huston) was loving but never did raise the children with personal attention, instead she insisted on trying to make them something they were not- perfect. Their father, Royal, (Hackman) left the children at a young age and nearly disappeared from their lives.This film truly shows human emotions and reactions in a way only Wes Anderson can. The subtle sarcasm, the defense mechanisms, the denial...all portrayed so amazingly well that you don't really notice it, but subconsciously realize it.There is no good way to describe this film (other than the essay that comes with the DVD) other than the words 'subtle perfection.Many people think this 'movie' crap, and I believe that is due to a lack of recognition of reality in film.

778,stella_heystella,Tragically Witty,10,12 November 2006,"CONTAINS SPOILERS This film was profoundly melancholy. The subtle elements of comedy juxtaposed with the desperation of the characters such as Margot, Raleigh, Richie and Chas added equally to the humour and sorrow. Margot's frankness about being adopted/left out was an amusing trait to her character, but only exposed the sadness she felt; at her failed marriages, at her Faux family set up and the disappointment she faced at the hands of her marriage with Raleigh. But equally, and also brilliantly, I found myself saddened by the mismatch of she and Raleigh; neither of them were bad characters/people, they just needed things in each other that weren't there. All characters were superficially ruined by other members of their family, but ultimately it was their own insecurities which lead to the desperate situations they were in.Gene Hackman was extremely vibrant compared to the rest of the cast (excluding perhaps Owen Wilson and at times, Ben Stiller), but he in no way outshone anyone. I anticipated Richie to be irritating at first. The role of 'Tennis Champ' sounded off-putting, and regrettably I took to him with a closed mind. However, it was that facade which created a striking contrast between his inner and outer self. The way in which he embraced his father, tried to keep the peace, loved Margot for so long and attempted to forget her by selflessly going out to sea to avoid complicating matters. It was the moment he said ""I'm going to kill myself tomorrow"", which demonstrated a manifestation of all his complexities and longings. One would usually find characters such as Chas annoying; the overbearing strait laced father. But once again, character development allows the audience to put aside stereotypes, lending weight to the equal roles each family members had in the demise of the different relationships, and subsequently the re-union of them. Every moment with ""cringe"" potential managed to beautifully side step any clichés, embarrassment, or predictability; I was rooting for Margot and Richie to be united after his suicide attempt, for Chas and Royal to reconcile and even for Eli to overcome his emotional and chemical issues.Even the smaller characters such as Pagoda weren't there for mere tokens of humour; we see his loyalty to Royal as he helps his with the stomach cancer ploy and even his own background, when Henry confronts him about the cancer set up and in his room, traditional West Asian music is playing and there are religious pictures integrated into the background. The plot was so satisfying because of the acceptance of each undesirable situation, in terms of typical story structure. For example, Royal and Ethel did not reunite romantically at the end, Royal dies, Margot and Richie do not (as far as we know) fully embrace their love of one another. It's these quiet nods to reality and further dysfunction which makes the story so empathetic. Life does not always turn out to be perfect, the conclusion of the film does not tie up all the loose ends, because life cannot go on forever without something unravelling.The outstanding notion that this movie left me with was empathy; you could feel the pain of everyone, no matter how unlikeable they had the potential to be at times. The one and only criticism of mine would be the lack of development of Etheline. As the mother of the entire dysfunctional brood, it would have been interesting to see her feelings on Royal, her marriage to Henry and Richie's suicide attempt. However, this does not at all take from what's already there. It was the flaws that made it flawless.",The Royal Tenenbaums
779,acharlevois1,not worth the time. Don't search for hidden meaning - there is none.,3,10 July 2005,"I just watched this movie this afternoon. The first part of the movie was spent describing everyone in their youth, the next part was spent showing their present state of affairs, and then it was over.I read somewhere where someone described the characters as paper dolls in a shadowbox, and compared the movie to a doll house.After I watched the movie I felt ""empty."" I said ""what the hell happened here in those 2 hours?"" Big deal, we learned that they're all weird and someone tried to off himself. Big deal. Royal Tenenbuam wanting to bring the fam together is just a device used to bring these characters back together to place them in this ""doll house."" The scenes are beautifully and meticulously set-up, and maybe this is why nobody ever moves. It's like looking at photographs on the wall come to life - somewhat. Everything seems so random and has no payoff. The characters reactions are bizarre and minimalist. I kept thinking ""well maybe this is a metaphor for something."" Maybe it was supposed relate to a greater, more epic story or something. Richie, with his long hair and beard, at points, looked kind of like Jesus, and his reactions were sort of Jesus-like, (i.e., you're my brother and I love you.""), and in fact, he was set up to be the ""savior"" of the family...Sort of trying to get everyone to understand Royal's side of things, and vice versa. But that was never actualized (and admittedly, would have been pretty cliché if it had). Alas, we see that Richie feels The Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name for his (adopted) sister, Gwynneth Paltrow. He tries to kill himself (a decidedly un-Jesus thing to do) after learning that his sister is a slut who smokes like a chimney. (Also, did anyone else think that in certain parts, he bears a resemblance to that stupid skit from SNL, ""The Falconer?"") Just Weird. Why? Nobody knows, and after watching the Directors Comments, I don't think there is an answer. The parts with Luke Wilson and Gwyneth, and when Luke attempts suicide, are really the best parts of the movie. It's the closest it comes to any actual emotion. Other than that, everyone and everything seems so oddly detached. It seems so over-edited or something. It almost reminded me of those (I think) Calvin Klein ads in the '80s for Eternity or Obsession, where 2 people would have a totally random ""conversation"" while never even looking at each other. (I don't remember the ads but they went something like ""His eyes are trees."" ""My head is weightless."" ""Purple is Angry."" or something equally ""deep."" And then some french-accent voice-over.) Basically, the substance of this movie is about the same.I thought ""there must be some meaning beyond this."" So I watched the movie AGAIN - with the director's commentary. Wes Anderson just talked about himself and all of the clever ways he came up with this color for the background and how very CLEVER he is and he did this, he did that, all about technical stuff. Sadly, this man suffers from delusions of grandeur, likely because of all of the yes men around him. All he spoke about was how he set up the shot, how he thought of this, he thought of that, etc. The word ""I"" was stated more than I have ever heard it said in a 2 hour space of time. Nothing about the characters, really. Nothing to answer the question WHY they do what they do, or what he's trying to say. In fact, more than a few times, he said, ""I don't know why I decided to do it that way, but it seemed to work."" Don't waste your time. Those who attack people who have a less than favorable opinion of this movie as ""just not getting it"" or being somehow intellectually challenged, WRONG. To all of those people I must say that if Wes Anderson is the brilliant filmmaker you purport, then the running joke that he's playing is actually on you. This film requires very little intellectual work beyond what you see on the screen. The movie would have been much more satisfying and worthwhile if he actually did give it an actual story, rather than just a contrived set-up tool masquerading as a plot.This director pays a lot of attention to detail. So much so that I think he neglects the ""big picture"" - i.e., the story. He misses the forest for all the little the trees. Oh well.That said, I will give this movie a couple of stars for its amazing attention to detail. I just wish one of those details was the plot.",The Royal Tenenbaums
780,Buggman,Honestly the worst movie I've ever seen,1,12 August 2005,"This movie is absolutely the worst movie ever made. With such a great cast you would expect something at least decent, but like in all of his other movies the sophomoric director and writer, Wes Anderson, managed to tear to shreds a movie with so much potential. The movie was directed as I imagine a 14 year old might direct a movie if you just gave him a camera and told him to mess around with it, and as far as the plot is concerned, Wes Anderson (and Owen Wilson who co-wrote the film) did even worse. The acting in the movie was fine, but under such poorly written dialogue you'd scarcely be able to tell. The idea of a screwed up family and its members' sometimes funny and sometimes tragic interactions with one another is hardly a novel one, but in all fairness the film doesn't really act like it is and that's fine. This is not my problem. The problem is that in this movie the interactions never actually are humorous (despite Anderson's attempts at ""tongue-in-cheek"" humor, which, again, would be fine if they actually were comedic in this respect, yet they aren't), and as tragic as other scenes may be, the characters are so poorly developed and at times so cliché, a viewer of this film finds it impossible to relate to the characters and ends up having little or no regard for their fate. Worst of all, the movie fails in what is clearly its main goal and the entire point of the film. The story is supposed to show how despite his having ruined the family in the past, Gene Hackman's character brings them all together when he dies. Anderson makes a despite attempt to show this one meaningful point in his train wreck of a film, and yet, as far as I'm concerned the message doesn't really come across at all. The end of the film thus leaves its viewers conflicted because they know what Anderson wants them to think but the conclusions anyone would draw for themselves show an entirely different picture. I remember after watching the film, with a plot that amounts to hokum at best, I put in the special features disc of the DVD and watched the egotistic Anderson walking through the house that the movie took place in saying how he chose the colors for all the different rooms to correspond with the different characters' personalities. That's great, someone needs to tell Wes to stick to interior decorating and stop trying to make movies.",The Royal Tenenbaums

So my dad and I are sitting on the couch watching Gwyneth Paltrow look miserable and smoke cigarettes and Ben Stiller be a funny dad and that guy from Seinfeld be another great character (and a dad, although not necessarily great), and I guess we both got bored so we turned it off. I didn't watch it again for a long time and never really thought that I was missing out on anything having never seen The Royal Tenenbaums in full.But then one day I rented it with a friend with equal ""strange-movie"" appreciation, and watched it the whole way through. I even laughed aloud at bits and pieces. The best part of the movie, the same as all the other movies by this guy, is how awesome the characters are: if I could remember more about them I would describe this in a little bit more detail.

Not only is this film very visually satisfying and beautiful but, it is genuine and uplifting, too. Anjelica Huston is radiant (as usual) and Owen Wilson's strange wannabe Tenenbaum character truly kept me on my toes. While this review may sound a little on the a** kissing side, I do genuinely feel that this movie is more than just an Anderson-loving hipster's bonanza. It is movie that tells a unique story and remains one of my favorites of all time. There is a reason it is on the 1001 Movies to See Before You Die list!!!",The Royal Tenenbaums
787,wendys_magic,An excellent festival film,10,14 January 2006,"The Royal Tenenbaums is one of few films which is appealing on a variety of different levels. It is compiled of subtle humour, perfectly illustrated characters and a gripping storyline- all the components for an excellent film. The characters are so excellent in this film- all at once they can make you cry, wretch or laugh. Another excellent point to this movie is its music soundtrack. From the interesting Elliot Smith, whose ""Needle in the Hay"" perfectly compliments the depressing lows of Richie to the beauty of ""These Days"" by The Velvet Underground to the marvelously composed theme music of Mark Mothersbaugh. The Royal Tenembaulms is an excellently written and composed film and is certainly one that should be seen before your demise. Once again Wes Anderson delivers an interesting and entertaining film.",The Royal Tenenbaums
