0,Leofwine_draca,Much of a muchness,5,14 September 2021,"The film that proved such a success that the teen sex comedy was revitalised at the box office, with endless sequels and rip-offs following (worse luck). This one has some memorable moments for sure and a warmer hand with the characters than you might expect given the genre, but it's all much of a muchness to me.",American Pie
1,SnoopyStyle,Great high school sex-romp,8,6 December 2013,"A group of high school friends try hard to get to the next level. When the guys find even the Shermanator got laid, the 4 friends (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas) vow to score before high school graduation. It's your basic teenage sex romp.It could have been so easily a nothing movie. But the friendship elevates it, and there are plenty of funny things going on. It doesn't get funnier than Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad. And these young actors are so compelling.Of course, Jason Biggs gets the big scenes. The Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) scene is hilarious no matter how many times I see it. And the pie has all the people talking. Just like the shower scene in Porky's, this becomes bigger than the movie.And rarely does a movie leak into the popular lexicon. For MILF alone, I'm willing a add an extra point to my vote. And is there anything more adorable than Alyson Hannigan's ""This one time, at band camp....""?",American Pie
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Some funny moments, overall an okay watch",6,14 January 2016,"""American Pie"" is already 16 years old by now. How time flies. It was a huge success back then and everybody from younger age groups, mostly teenagers growing-up, had seen it back in the day. Obviously, with time, it has lost a lot of significance, but it was maybe the 1999 film that reflected society the best back then. It has not aged as a classic or must-see comedy by any means, but these 95 minutes are certainly worth the watch. There are some really funny scenes in there, the beginning when Biggs' character gets caught masturbating by his parents, basically every scene that has Eugene Levy or Alyson Hannigan, Stifler or Stifler's mom, the pie scene... There were definitely also many scenes that weren't really that interesting, which is why I cannot give this film a higher rating. It is certainly not funny from start to finish, but during its best moments, it is extremely funny I think.This was directed by brothers Paul and Chris Weitz before they became Oscar nominees. The writer is Adam Herz and he has basically written almost nothing outside the ""American Pie"" franchise. The cast includes a handful actors that are still known today, but no real superstars. The most known is probably Alyson Hannigan, an actress I like quite a lot and when this film here was made, she was already quite a star thanks to ""Buffy"". Back to ""American Pie"", this film is probably at its worst when it tries really hard to be also dramatically relevant in terms of relationships and sex between young males and females. It's not really working. But the comedy makes up for it on many occasions and makes this probably one of the most known comedies of the 1990s. Still today, almost everybody over the age of 20 has heard about ""American Pie"". You could maybe say that it was a defining film for a generation back then. Still, it's not a masterpiece or a classic, but definitely worth the watch if you are looking for a light goofball comedy. I recommend it. And if you like it, you can check out some of the sequels too if you're in the mood.",American Pie
3,kosmasp,A new era,7,21 July 2009,"With American Pie a new era of Teen comedies began. In the Porkys tradition (sort of), this revitalized a sub-genre, that seemed derived of new ideas. But the mix of characters, their story (promise/oath to each other) and their embarrassments to achieve said goal(s), a new breed was born.While the showing of flesh (naked body/ies) seemed to be a problem for the censors in America, the movie got a ""12"" (equivalent to the PG-13 in America) rating in Germany, in it's ""unrated"" form. Some of the stars seemed to have a bright feature ahead of them, but most of them didn't do anything. The most popular one, although not represented much in the first installment, was Sean William Scott (aka Stiffler). Shannon Elizabeth and Co. kind of ""dissapeared"" after a while and don't seem to make many movies nowadays.But that doesn't take away the fun that you can have with this movie. So if you're not too prude, just go ahead and watch this. Despite all the sexual gags, this still got a heart",American Pie
4,lee_eisenberg,as American as apple pie without the sugar,7,28 December 2005,"Capitalizing on ""There's Something About Mary""'s success, ""American Pie"" has some Michigan high school students trying to lose their virginity. The most famous scene of course involves a certain pastry, but there are plenty of other gross-out scenes (namely the beer). Really the best character in the movie is Eugene Levy as the kindly dad who's always willing to talk about sex and everything related thereto. I haven't seen any of the sequels, and it seems that most of the unknown cast members haven't done anything of particularly high quality since this movie came out (although Shannon Elizabeth and Jason Biggs both had great roles in ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back""). All in all, this movie is ridiculous, but pretty funny. On the subject of anything, would that one scene with Shannon Elizabeth - you know which one I mean - count as one of the famous sex-drive-inducing scenes in movie history?",American Pie
5,jboothmillard,American Pie,9,9 March 2005,"Before this film the successful teen movies were from John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club), and then they got crude and gross in Porky's and National Lampoon's Animal House, this was a much needed return to the genre that combined all the elements into a modern box office hit, from director Paul Weitz (About a Boy). Basically in East Great Falls, Michigan, four high school friend, awkward and sexually naive Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), lacrosse team player and assumed jock Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), confident student Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and sophisticate Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) all share something in common, they are all virgins. At the party of swearing and sex-obsessed Steve 'Stifmeister' Stifler (Seann William Scott), geek Chuck 'The Sherminator' Sherman claims to have lost his virginity, so the four friends make a pact that they will lose their virginity (consensually) before they graduate high school, and the prom is the last opportunity to do it. Kevin tries to convince his sweet girlfriend Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum (Tara Reid) that they have been together long enough to take the next step, but she sometimes wonders if he is just with her for sex, and gets advice from knowledgeable Jessica (Natasha Lyonne). Oz joins the jazz singing choir to find a girlfriend, and he gets the attention of Heather (Mena Suvari), she does find out his reputation, but he wins her back, especially when he leaves an important lacrosse game for a choir competition, and specifically for her. Jim gets embarrassing advice from his Dad (Eugene Levy), masturbates a apple pie (he was told third base was like ""warm apple pie""), and he attempts to get with Czechoslovakian foreign exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), and he puts his attempt on web cam for the whole school to see, as he prematurely ejaculates twice. Finch meanwhile does not seem to be making many attempts to find a girlfriend, he is found out to have paid Jessica to spread rumours about his sexual reputation and get a date for the prom, but Stifler has revenge putting laxative in his drink, leading him into the girls' bathroom, and come out humiliated and dateless. At the prom Kevin and Oz have their dates, Jim was forced to ask flute playing band geek Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan) as his date - she also apparently hadn't seen the internet video, and Finch is alone, the pact may be dwindling, until they overhear that Sherman lied about losing his virginity, taking pressure off the boys. It is at Stifler's post-party can fulfil their pledge, Kevin and Vicky in the upstairs bedroom, who afterwards break up because of college differences; Oz and Heather in the dock house, after he confessed the pact and realised his true feelings; Jim and Michelle in the young Stifler brother's bedroom, Michelle confessing she did see the video and is surprisingly aggressive; and Finch alone strays into the basement and meets Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge), she is attracted to him and they have sex on the pool table. Jim, Oz, Kevin and Finch have breakfast together the next morning and are all happy that they fulfilled the pact, and they toast to ""the next step"", and it ends with Jim dancing on web cam for Nadia, with Jim's Dad peaking and walking away dancing embarrassingly. Also starring Molly Cheek as Jim's Mom, Lawrence Pressman as Coach Marshall, ""AM To PM"" singer Christina Milian as Band Member, Justin Isfeld as Justin - 'MILF' Guy #1, John Cho as John - 'MILF' Guy #2, Eli Marienthal as Matt Stifler and Casey Affleck as Tom Myers. The cast of young adults are all suited to their parts, Biggs as the likable fool, Klein as the jock wanting to change, Nicholas as the wannabe nice guy, Thomas as the slightly weird Corinthian, Scott as the obnoxious foul-mouthed womaniser, and Levy as the embarrassing father. The film is full of just right balance of stereotyping, and it invented and popularised the term MILF (Mum I'd Like to F***), the characters all have their own great qualities, the story is one you can easily follow, and the slapstick and dialogue jokes all work fantastically, it is certainly one of the best teen movies ever made, a must see comedy. It was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for the Internet broadcast, and it was number 7 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!",American Pie
6,BA_Harrison,Even Chris Klein is good.,9,13 April 2008,"Fed up with their lack of success with the opposite sex, four teenage boys make a pact to lose their virginity before leaving high-school.In 1999, the teen sex comedya genre that had last flourished in the early to mid-80sreturned with a vengeance when American Pie became a runaway success at the box office. Directed by newcomer Paul Weitz, and featuring an almost unknown (at the time) cast, the film had 'em rolling in the aisles thanks to its no-holds-barred, gross-out humour. Masturbation; oral sex; premature ejaculation; diarrhoea; intercourse with baked goods; the accidental ingestion of baby gravy: nothing was considered off-limits to these guys if it had the potential for hilarity.However, what made American Pie particularly special was that, despite the fact that the film's humour consisted primarily of wall-to-wall vulgarity, it also managed to be kinda sweet in the process. The main characters, a group of likable high-school geeks who are faced with the seemingly insurmountable task of getting laid, are not presented as vacuous ass-holes with one-track minds, but rather as young adults who are simply coming to terms with the responsibilities and pressures of adulthood: something that most people have to deal with at some point in their lives.Of course, from a bloke's point of view, it doesn't hurt that the film also features some rather gorgeous women: Tara Reid is oh-so pretty; Mena Suvari is doe-eyed and innocent; Shannon Elizabeth is smoking hot (and nekkid!); and Alyson Hannigan is there for all of those who dig nerdy chicks. Something for all tastes, it would seem.",American Pie
7,Quinoa1984,1999's equivalent of There's Something About Mary,7,28 April 2000,"American Pie is a teenage comedy that works on a level and then does not on conservative levels.  And that can be summed up by one word as does not not work for conservatives- Pie.  This film has many teen stars that will probably make it as good actors (New Jersey native Jason Biggs is in 2000's Loser already).  Also, this film is the best for teenagers looking for a laugh after Austin Powers 2.  The story is simple, but the scenes are expanded.  The plot involves 4 seniors who want to lose their virginity by the end of the school year. What ensues is a journey that makes Dumb and Dumber look like The Winslow Boy.  Pastry sex, lacetive dumps, premature ejaculation, the sex books and Eugene Levy provide the best parts of the film, and the romance provides the parts when we can pause from laughing.  Because this film is one of the best comedies and films of the decade.  A+",American Pie
8,Coventry,Shameless and lurid high school fun!,5,15 April 2004,"American Pie (and the whole trend of high-school comedies it started) can be described best Farrelly bros. comedy for adolescents. A constant barrage of vulgarity and cheap sex-jokes without an actual story to tell. American Pie introduces four desperately horny young men who make a pact. Before their graduation, they have to lose their virginity no matter what! To obtain this goal they're willing to go through all possible forms of public humiliations and mockery. Throughout the whole film, it is exclusively the male teenager who's portrayed as a filthy-minded creature. The girls in American Pie are sensitive, intelligent and generally considered to be the superior species, which is a pretty fresh and satisfying point of view. The films contains a few sequences that are notorious alreadysuch as the `bakery-masturbation'-scene and  oh yes  the magnificent striptease by the gorgeous Shannon Elizabeth
American Pie is lamebrain entertainment in its purest form. The acting is overall good, with some new fresh faces as well as some veteran actors (Eugene Levy steals the show as Jim's dad). The jokes work, the screenplay contains some fun, memorable quotes (`It's not a space shuttle launch, it's SEX') and the creators DO know their classics! Just look at the terrific reference to `The Graduate' near the end of the film. You can easily skip both sequels thoughmore from the same, only worse. American Pie became a huge success and one of the biggest box office hits of the late nineties; while modest, intelligent little films from that same period are being catapulted straight into Oblivion. Cinema may not always be fair, but American Pie sure is fun!",American Pie

11,preppy-3,Gee--isn't sexual humiliation so much fun?????,1,8 August 2007,"Dreadful ""comedy"" that was (sadly) a huge hit. It's about a bunch of idiot high school guys (all who are clearly in their 20s) trying to have sex before they graduate. That's it. Seriously! That's the whole plot! Now you COULD make an OK film out of this idea (maybe) but this film doesn't even try. It just thinks up every single way a guy can be sexually humiliated and/or appear pathetic and throws it at the audience full force. Hey, why be subtle? Jason Biggs especially is made to look like the most pathetic loser I've ever seen. I suppose the actor DOES deserve credit for humiliating himself again and again. He has sex with a pie, drinks a drink with sperm in it, has premature ejaculation TWICE (which his whole school sees), has his parents catch him with a full erection, does a truly stupid dance to turn a girl on which are his friends playing a joke on him...are you laughing hysterically yet? If any of those above antics make you crack up you might like this movie. Obviously many people did. I just found it stupid, offensive, cruel and pathetic with a disturbing mean streak running through it. The sole bright spot in this is Alyson Hannigan who gives the ONE good performance.Mean, stupid and very unfunny. A 1 all the way.",American Pie
12,lastliberal,God bless the Internet.,7,7 March 2008,"I went into this thinking that it was going to be crude and filled with fart jokes, but I was really surprised. Sure, on the surface it is crude, but underneath was a very good story of young men trying to grow into adulthood.The hardest thing is picking whom I liked the most. Jason Biggs was great in his second film, but so was Chris Klein, who really grew, and Eddie Kaye Thomas (Harold & Kumar). And Mena Suvari (Kiss the Girls) was fantastic, as was Natasha Lyonne.It was a funny and, at times, very tender movie that was entertaining from start to finish. I'll have to check out the sequels.",American Pie
13,Boba_Fett1138,Poop- and sex humor doesn't get any better than this!,9,22 November 2005,"Out of all the teenage comedies we were bombarded with the last couple of years, this one is by far the best. The comedy is cruel and perhaps predictable but the execution of it is perfect, thanks to the actors and the characters they portray and some excellent spot-on timing.Really what makes ""American Pie"" superior to other teenage comedies are the characters. There are lots of characters in the movie and all are well constructed, crazy in their own way and simply fun to watch. On top of that their dialog is very good and highly realistic and believable. Although I normally hate it when some teenagers are being played by some twenty year old, I had in this case no problems with it, simply because all of the actors fitted their roles like a glove. I especially liked Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott. But best role of the movie was played by Eugene Levy as Jim's dad. Quite honestly one of the best and most hilarious movie dads ever created!Most of the jokes and dialog are cruel and is mostly about only sex and poop but it works surprisingly hilarious, with as a result some hilarious classic comedy moments. Of course the apple pie sequences has already become a bit of a classic but I even liked the whole web-cam strip sequences with Jason Biggs and Shannon Elizabeth even better. Yes, I even liked the poop humor with Eddie Kaye Thomas as Finch in the movie. There are truly some hilarious sequences in the movie that are perhaps at first sight a bit lame and predictable but all perfectly timed and performed by the actors. Poop- and sex humor just doesn't get any better than this! Plus it also has a good morale in it that works out in the ending without ever getting lame or too over-the-top.A teenage comedy classic, that works in almost every way!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",American Pie
14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Probably the best of the teen comedies,8,17 April 2004,"This is pretty much the film that started the whole trend of making teen comedies with a lot of sexual jokes and gags, and definitely one of the best. Any teen will be able to identify with the situations and the characters, at the very least to some degree. The plot is very good, and it moves along at a pretty good pace; sort of laid-back, not too quick but not slow either. The characters are all well-written, very real and even though some of them are cliches or stereotypes, you can identify with them and understand their actions in the different situations. The actors all perform well, I didn't really think any of them did a bad job portraying their respective characters. I think the script was very well-written, it allowed for some extremely funny scenes(of course, there were also some right-out disgusting scenes, this is an R-rated teen comedy after all), and most of them were pretty true to life too. The humor was very good, and had an excellent pace and timing. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys teen comedies, and aren't easily offended. Especially teens will like it, and identify with a lot of it. 8/10",American Pie
15,neil-476,Smutty teen sex comedy with heart,8,17 April 2012,"American Pie tells a story of four lads, about to leave High School, wanting to enjoy their last summer together, not to mention getting laid. That's about it in terms of plot - nothing terribly sophisticated or original.But the four lads and their girls are all well drawn characters, there are some very funny (if rude) set pieces, and the movie has a great deal of heart - yes, it may be smutty, but the genuine relationships between the characters carry a great deal of meaning above and beyond what might otherwise simply be tacky.It is worth singling out Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad for the funniest performance, and Alyson Hannigan for the single funniest (and most unexpected) line.And here is where I go against the flow a little. Seann William Scott delivers a brilliant performance as Stifler - obnoxious, crass, loud, overbearing, uncouth, gross. I dislike the character, as I dislike such characters which seem to have become the mainstay of American teen comedies, often being the hub around which everything rotates. By all means have such a character, but when they become the centre of attention (and, worse, become portrayed as lovable and laudable), I no longer want to hang out in their company. This is the direction the series started to follow.",American Pie
16,anaconda-40658,Try a Slice.,8,29 July 2015,"American Pie (1999): Dir: Paul Weitz / Cast: Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Eugene Levy, Seann William Scott, Shannon Elizabeth: Here is a vulgar teen comedy where its biggest pitch is to feature a teen male with a baked apple pie plastered over his crotch. It reflects the teenage sex drive with a title suggesting innocence that they do not possess and their parents do not see. Four teenage males make a pact to lose their virginity before prom night. Director Paul Weitz understands the teenage sexual hunger. Eugene Levy steals scenes as a father who understands his son's sexual appetite and arrives home presenting him with issues of Hustler and has long discussions about masturbation. Jason Biggs brings out Jim's sexual longings and becomes involved in an Internet stripteases. Chris Klein takes singing lessons to impress a girl who doesn't realize that she is being played. Seann William Scott highlights the gross humour particularly when he drinks a beer without knowing what was expelled into it beforehand. Shannon Elizabeth is the fixation of Jim as foreign student Nadia whose homework session becomes a web cam sensation. While humour will discourage some, it is the sexual freedom being flaunted that may send the wrong message. Theme regards teenage sexual appetite with an ending that sends the wrong message of clothes coming off and everybody waking up in someone else's bed. Score: 8 / 10",American Pie
17,Aaron1375,"This is considered funny, why exactly?",3,10 February 2018,"I never watched this film back in the day, I never found the trailers all that funny for it. My fiance told me how funny it was so she pulled it up on Netflix and we began watching it. It had an opening that was sort of amusing, a disgusting scene involving a beer, a completely retarded scene involving a pie and a bunch of losers trying to lose their virginity. Wow, what a concept! Like there has never been a film like that in the 80's or several of them! Suffice to say, by the end, I haven't laughed much at all and my fiance was baffled as to why she found it funny back in the day. The story, why four guys want to lose their virginity. One of them is a jock who tries to lose it with a college chick, but she doesn't go for it. One has a hot girlfriend who gives him oral and not understanding why he really cares and two are just losers. We get to watch them try different techniques to get girls like joining a jazz choir or having a girl come to your house, but you'd rather send a crappy feed to your friends than try to take advantage of the situation. Seriously, this crap makes that Tom Cruise flick ""Losing It"" seem really great by comparison.So there isn't much in this film I found funny. The whole pie scene which is kind of this films big laugh scene is completely moronic. Why the hell would someone do what the character did to that pie!?! Like his family isn't going to notice it gone? The beer scene was just gross as all get out and not funny and none of the characters are likable. They are like Friday the 13th victims to me, hence, I would be rooting for Jason to kill them horribly! So this film was a huge success and made lots of money back in the day. I do not understand why, other than people have very differing taste as to what is funny than I have. The actors in this film all were retched human beings and Eugene Levy as the father was moronic and I usually like Eugene Levy. This would go on to spawn several sequels, but near the end they were pretty much direct to DVD fare as like a lot of comedy franchises it got wore out quick. You can only do so much with the same characters. I missed this film back in the day and I am wishing I had missed it now and never saw it.",American Pie
18,StevePulaski,"The structure and plot is the pie, while the characters are the attractive and sweet whipped cream",8,21 March 2012,"American Pie is smarter than many, many other teen films that I've seen over the last few years. Its depiction of the fun, spontaneous antics that exist in high school don't take the nihilistic or dehumanizing route many films of the same genre do. Some have written the film off as ""unoriginal,"" and while it really isn't, it's a comedy for a new generation. The seventies had National Lampoon's Animal House, the eighties had Porky's, and the nineties got a nice helping of pie.The film follows four naive Michigan high school students, who are close to each other, but not to the people they truly want to be close to; girls. Jim (Biggs) is a pasty, awkward teenager hoping to get lucky with the foreign exchange student Nadia (Elizabeth), Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher (Klien) is the all-star lacrosse player trying to make things work with the sweet, innocent, and charming choir girl Heather (Suvari), Kevin (Nicholas) is the self-confident and sexually motivated one of the group, hoping to have sex with his girlfriend Vicky (Reid) before they go off to separate Colleges, and Finch (Thomas) is the shy, solemn soul who usually sits idly by while the antics unfold. The four make a pact to lose their virginity by the end of high school, hoping to make it all happen the night of Senior Prom. The gang's motivation comes from their loudmouth buddy Steve Stifler (Scott), who is unapologetically crude, yet irresistibly lovable.Perhaps the funniest character in the entire film is Jim's dad (Levy), who must be the most conscious and understanding father in the history of film. Many teen films portray parents as out of touch codgers with no knowledge or comprehension of current events. Jim's dad is the total opposite. He is way too understanding, even when his son tries to practice his moves on a baked apple pie.One character that seems tragically underused is Vicky's friend Jessica (Lyonne). The character is seen at rare points in the film, usually providing her friend with sex insight. She seems like the black sheep of the group, who doesn't fit in anywhere and doesn't really want to. When she does turn up on screen, usually for a slender amount of time, she is witty and fun, much like the rest of the characters.I was never hugely fond of the eighties' generation-definer Porky's. I found it to be a little weak on the characterization, yet still on par with its projection of high school students. The reason why American Pie soars high on the grading scale is because it manages to provide us with lovable characters that would become familiar to us like those in a sitcom. These characters are sunny and infectious with their one-liners and their wisdom. They aren't indulgent, meaning they are always learning new things and reciting a good moral or two. After not seeing the film in many years, the end scenes were a big surprise to me. It shows the characters are gaining insight and knowledge; I thought that simply couldn't happen in a teen movie. The end also goes in a way one did not expect. I was crossing my fingers that it wouldn't turn into the cartoony cliché I was thinking, and what do you know, it turned out to be just as sweet as the film itself.What a joyous and lovable excursion American Pie is. It provides well delivered, intelligent laughs and realizes that it doesn't need to discover a new ""breast per screen"" ratio in order to be funny or memorable. It introduces us to naive, confused teenagers, perhaps somehow reflecting ourselves at the time, and goes from there in what appears to be a totally fresh take on the subject of losing ones virginity. It is simple, efficient, and wholesome even when it shows its darker side.Starring: Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Chris Klein, Natasha Lyonne, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Eugene Levy, and Eddie Kaye Thomas.

19,Smells_Like_Cheese,Highly over rated,3,14 September 2004,"Ah, the famous ""American Pie"". How much has this movie been apart of our culture? How many parodies? How many immatators? Etc, etc, etc. I wasn't too pleased with ""American Pie"". I don't mind a little gross humor every now and then. But the whole pie and Jason Biggs scene was a little too much for me. While the movie has it's moments, and a few good laughs, it's too much being thrown at. I don't know, maybe this is the ultimate ""guy"" movie. I think that's why.

20,=G=,A raunch rage of sappy humor...,5,7 August 2000,"...""American Pie"" is a ridiculous and vulgar High School coming-of-sexual-age comedy. A pathetic cinematic endeavor, this senseless string of vacuous gags and situations is not for the jaded or sophisticated and will play best in frat houses and college dorms or to audiences with a similarly unfettered sense of humor. The number of shelves the video occupies at Blockbuster is a reminder that ""popular"" is often synonymous with ""mediocre"".",American Pie
21,MovieAddict2016,It's pretty tasty...,7,2 October 2003,"Characters can make or break a movie, and this goes especially for ""American Pie,"" a rude, crude, and downright raunchy film that would probably be considered one of the worst of the decade if not for the film's obvious love of its characters and their shortcomings and exploits. Some of the best of all comedies are so simply because they treat their characters with such loving affection - from works of comedy such as ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" to more dark and brooding comedies like ""Fargo."" Without love of characters there is a lack of respect, a film goes nowhere and an audience senses both and disregards it. A film like ""American Pie"" may not be the best of all films but I laughed, not so much at the gags but rather because the characters taking part in the gags seemed pretty darn infectious and sweet. Beneath the crudeness there's a heart - you just may have to dig through some waste to get there. The film lacks the honesty and realism of teenagers that made John Hughes' 80s films so appealing to audiences - this is more or less a routine sex-and-prom teen comedy - but, like I said, the characters make up for this. It's about four graduating teenagers - Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Stifler (Seann William Scott) - who make a pact to have sex by prom night. Bring the whole family to this one - you'll have a ball! A pretty immature and borderline basic plot we have that is put to pretty good use through some crazy - though immature - antics. The title of the film is more than just a figure of speech. There's a scene where a foreign exchange student named Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth, not to be confused with Elizabeth Shannon of ""Saturday Night Live"") undresses in the Biggs character's room and *everything* is broadcasted across the Internet. I can't divulge into anything else because I'm writing for family websites. But let me say that if you think ""Austin Powers"" had a mouthful of innuendos, ""American Pie"" has that plus some. (It's sad to think that they had to guarantee an R-rating by inserting nudity and constant language - is the MPAA so ignorant that without nudity a film crammed with sexual innuendo like this would be PG-13?) We also get to learn the meaning of the word, ""MILF."" I really can't say very much about this movie, or even go into its plot any further. All I can say is that I laughed. I liked the characters. I liked the innocence of blunders; that the characters often do things and humiliate themselves but not on purpose like in some comedies. But what holds me back from giving this a great rating is that the content is a bit too strong even for those 17, which the MPAA finds a suitable age to view this (it makes promiscuity seem all the more nerdy; the characters never consider the after effects of their night of passion). It is a very typical and cliched teen sex comedy, in a way, which holds back my rating a bit. It is a pretty funny film, no doubt, but the basis and outcome are both very typical.

22,paul2001sw-1,As conservative as apple pie,3,2 June 2005,"The American high school, as depicted in modern comedy, is a strange place indeed: full of over-aged, foul mouthed jocks and sexy, self-aware young women and what's more, every one of them is affluent. In a country where many real schools have metal detectors on the doors to keep out firearms, it's a relentlessly aspirational world, which, for all the cruelty and anguish on display, the target teen-aged audience can dream that they belong to. In addition, for all the toilet humour, it's a profoundly conservative world as well. 'American Pie', for example, may set new lows (if that's how you want to consider them) in toilet humour, but fundamentally this is a film about the joys of belonging; belonging with your friends, your lovers, even belonging with your decidedly weird father. In this narrative, the fear of isolation is eventually banished through the mere possession of an essentially good heart. Real outsiders, if they appear at all, appear only as losers, virtually labelled as the child-abusers of the next generation in punishment for their failure to learn how to fit in.In fact, viewed in these terms, 'American Pie' is far from the most offensive film in it's genre, with a little less smug sanctimoniousness behind the smut than is usual in such fare. Unfortunately, it's just not that funny. The plot is simple: four guys try to get laid, and the absence of real narrative reduces the film to a series of set pieces devoid of real context. Even the eponymous pie gag isn't even particularly gross, and there's none of the offbeat charm of 'There's Something About Mary' (which aimed at a slightly older audience and which I found rather funnier than I like to admit). The success of films like this is all about selling a lifestyle: this is a film about how the average teenager might like to lose their virginity. Real life is darker, but also, often funnier as well.",American Pie
23,bowmanblue,There was this one time – at band camp – when we watched a really funny film,8,11 October 2015,"Okay, so I know that 'teens behaving badly' is hardly a revolutionary genre when it comes to film-making. However, sometimes a film comes along that, while not really offering much that's new, sort of revitalises the genre (and naturally spawns one hundred and one poorer imitations). 'American Pie' did just this. Four horny teenage boys vow to lose their virginity before they graduate from high school and, as the old saying goes 'with hilarious consequences.' But, unlike all those times where that worn and weary phrase never really quite lives up to its boast, this time it does.There are times when a film probably shouldn't work, yet it does. This is one of those times. The story relies heavily on 'gross-out' humour. You will need to have an appreciation for rather crude and toilet-based gags to fully enjoy this. Plus, as 'sex' is a major component to the plot, you'll need to be okay with quite a few dirty scenes.Nearly fifteen years later, you will probably recognise many of the cast, but, back in 1999, they were largely unknowns, the only real recognisable face was Allison Hannigan who played 'Willow' in the Buffy the Vampire TV series. However, despite being a load of non-stars, they all played their parts really well. You'll actually care about everyone here, no matter how dumb they are.If you're really looking for faults, you could say that it's riddled with clichés. The four main lead characters aren't exactly 'fleshed-out.' They're all walking/talking caricatures and pretty dumb (but then they're teenage boys, so I guess the lack of I.Q. can be forgiven). The females on the cast fair a little better. They're slightly more smart and sensitive, but at the same time are largely only there as potential candidates for the four boys' adolescent lusts.American Pie will never be 'high brow entertainment' yet it is enormous fun for anyone with an appreciation for silly (definitely low brow) humour. Many other films were made after it trying to fit the same mould and recapture the magic. Some were okay. Others were good, but all fell short of this one. Even the official sequels themselves slowly degraded and I didn't even bother to finish all of the fourth instalment 'American Wedding.' I'll stick to this one thanks. And possibly part II.",American Pie

I was laughing so much, I thought that I would puke or I would suffer a heart attack from all my laughing. The acting was great. In my opinion, I thought that Jason Biggs and Thomas Ian Nicholas were the best. Jennifer Coolidge had great cameos as Stifler's Mom. The girls were very hot and they got my attention. The script is excellent, the music was just right, and this is a valuable piece for a large movie collection such as mine. I highly recommend this for people between the age of 15-40.

27,ironhorse_iv,This 1990s teen sex comedy hasn't aged well. The pie is starting to stink.,6,4 June 2016,"Directed by then-first time directors, brothers, Paul & Chris Weitz, this raunchy comedy was somewhat memorable at the time for its hilarious jokes about a group of high school seniors, named Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) & Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), all trying to losing one's virginity before their high school graduation. While, this movie was a box-office hit and spawned three direct sequels: 2001's 'American Pie 2', 2003's 'American Wedding', and 2012's 'American Reunion', & a lot of really bad, direct to DVDs spinoffs movies such as, 2005's 'American Pie Presents: Band Camp', '2006's 'American Pie: The Naked Mile', 2007's 'American Pie: Beta House', and 2009's 'American Pie The Book of Love'; it's clear, after rewatching this film, a few days ago, I can say that 'American Pie' is not as good as I remember. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found the movie's message to be a bit broken. After all, the film concentrates on bunch of friends trying to force sex to happen, rather than allowing it to happen on its own. It wasn't until, near the end of the movie, they decide that was a dumb thing to do, since sex shouldn't be a goal in itself, but something you do with a person who's important to you and when you both want it. That's a nice little moral that teenager can honestly get behind. However, the filmmakers kinda ruin it, later, by allowing all of them to have sex, all on the same night. As much as I like Mena Suvari as Heather Gardner and Chris Klein as Oz's relationship. I found it to be, a bit shallowed. After all, Oz does kinda bragged about sleeping with Heather, afterwards, despite their characters supposedly, taking their relationship slow. To make matters worse, some of the characters find themselves, being used, borderline getting rape, or committing adultery that night. That's not funny. Despite that, some of the humor in the film, somewhat works. I still laugh at some of the gross toilet humor, this film has to offer. The Pie scene with Jim's Dad, Noel (Eugene Levy), along, makes this film, worth checking out. Still, there were some sequences in the film, I found, to be, too low brow. One of them is the famous 'web-cam' nudity moment. I was never, really into actress, Shannon Elizabeth's work, here as Nadia. I found her foreign exchange student character to be one-dimensional and unrealistic. Not only, does her European accent sounds a bit rubbish, but the whole idea, that she would find Jim, kinda attractive, without his character, speaking once to her is just silly. Her character was pretty much, just written in the film, for fan service. If that, wasn't enough, I really didn't like, how the characters were alright with taping her, while, she's changes her clothes. The voyeurism in this movie is borderline creepy and somewhat disturbing. Anyways, she wasn't the only female character, I didn't like, about this film. Tara Reid as Victoria ""Vicky"" Lathum was very annoying as well. I really wouldn't stand her b*tchy attitude with Kevin in this film. Their scenes, together was such a turn off. The same with the walking-macho-stereotype 'Steve' Stifler (Seann William Scott). Yes, I know, that film help spark Seann William Scott's film career, but gees, his character was really irritating to watch and listen to. Nothing about his character seem real. At least, his character kinda stood out in the film unlike others people's characters. I can hardly remember, the characters, who actress, Natasha Lyonne and actor, John Cho plays as. One character that was very memorable was Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan), despite being introduced late into the first movie and had less than four minutes of screen time. I really hope, for more from her character than the running joke that she was, in this film. After all, Alyson really does make this character, very likable. It's sad, it's that her talent was somewhat wasted here. It is only the second film on, that her character being more than a one-hit wonder, but into a well-developed, prominent character. It's by then, I kinda fell in love, with this character, but for this movie, her performance was fine with me. Another person that really put it, his all was Jason Biggs. I know, a lot of people, crap on him for his mediocre acting, but he really did, make this film, fun to watch with his ability for slapstick. He nearly died from heatstroke and zinc poisoning, during production. So give this man, some props. While, Jason Biggs did fine as the main role in this film. In my opinion, the true-breakout star of this film, has to be, Eugene Levy. He really makes this film, somewhat watchable. Any scenes with him, were funny as hell. I have to give him, mad praise for making this film, work. Overall: While, American Pie upholds the tradition of horny teenage sex comedies made famous by 1980s films like 1981's 'Porky's', 1983's 'Spring Break' and 1985's 'Weird Science', for the late 1990s. It's doesn't hold up, with more of the recent ones, such as 2001's 'Wet Hot American Summer' & 2007's 'Superbad'. It's still, worth watching. Just not, too much, rewatch value.",American Pie

32,Floated2,Enjoyable teen comedy,8,18 October 2009,"American Pie follows four teens in their senior year of high school. After experiencing some daunting sexual experiences, they decide to create a pact that will increase their chances of scoring before the year ends. The four set a goal to lose their virginity on prom night, for the sake of their own good.This film has a near-perfect formula – a variety of characters that are evident in high schools (making the film easy to relate to), original and funny jokes that run throughout the entire duration, and an interesting conflict (if somewhat farcical). Could have been funnier though. Standout characters in the film are Jason Biggs as the protagonist Jim, Alyson Hannigan as the geeky Michelle (who has a hilarious obsession with telling anecdotes about band camp), Seann William Scott as the high school jock Stifler, and Eugene Levy as Jim's erudite yet slightly dim father.Although the beginning was great, the end was kind of a disappointment with satisfied. It was very much predictable that they would accomplish their goal yet you were interested in seeing how the story folds. American Pie's characters were high school seniors but they looked passable for college students. Overall after rewatching this film, I can surely agree that it is indeed the best of the series.",American Pie
33,johnnyboyz,"Routine situational-comedy, which seems to want to say something although isn't sure what or how to do it",6,12 March 2017,"The cultural and sexual revolution is referred to as such because it revolutionised, aside from certain other things, attitudes towards culture and sex. Where it hit in the 1960's, among other places, was the United States of America and ""American Pie"" is less-so a commentary on why we-are-what-we -are than it is a reasonably funny depiction of a group of people living their lives in such a fashion BECAUSE of what preceded them. If GK Chesterton once said that ""...there is a certain fury in sex that we cannot afford to inflame, and that a certain mystery and awe must always surround it if we are to remain sane"" then Paul & Chris Weitz's 1999 film should seem like a kind of antithesis to this. Indeed, I do wonder if the central characters in ""American Pie"" even know of the origins of the world outlooks they each possess. One of them, Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), seems to cut more of an esoteric figure than the others, or perhaps that's just because the others know less of the world than it first seems. Despite his nature, however, not even Finch seems to know why there exists a sudden rush amongst a class of youngsters to lose their virginity before the termination of an American high school year. Writing in ""Unspeakable Things"", British social commentator Laurie Penny describes sex as 'something you do' - not as something '...you wait around for someone to do TO you', before going on to describe her virginity as something she 'shook off' at the first opportunity she had – as if it was an annoying bout of influenza. ""American Pie"" captures this whole ethos somewhat well – the notion that abstinence is virtuous, or that sex is something else other than mere recreation, rears up in drips and drabs but not enough to convince us it's what the makers actually think. ""American Pie"" depicts a diverse set of boys: one speaks Latin and drinks expensive coffee. Another, Chris (Chris Klein), is a bulky lacrosse player. Kevin already has a girlfriend; is close to sex anyway and is granted, I think, the deliberate privilege in this regard of being the best looking of the five while Stifler (Seann William-Scott) treads an uneasy line between unfriendly lout and colleague you cannot afford not to have. The last, Jim (Jason Biggs), we sense is some kind of lead – his father was, we feel, present when much of the aforementioned cultural revolution unfolded and was amongst the first to break the taboos. His willingness for Jim to follow in his footsteps hits a strange spot between curiously heart rendering and absolutely deplorable. Depending on your politics, of course...Each of the boys is in their final year at your standard American high-school, but none of them have had sex yet except for Stifler, who seems to want to have it again, although is hindered by this fresh swarm of vultures now surrounding what was once his easy prey. They induce an agreement between them that they will press to lose their virginities before the year is up and a graduation prom takes place. How they go about doing this involves a diverse set of approaches and circumstances, neither really overwhelming the other and each different enough to entertain us reasonably well. One character eventually only finds what he is looking for when he gives up all hope and accidentally finds it right under his nose – a process of maturing enough not to especially fall into a trap of hedonism and rather to take things as they come. Chris only joins a soppy choir group to score one of the many women who sing in it, although is depicted as to actually coming to care for one of the girls there.Much of the gross out humour involving toilets and the consumption of bodily fluid is unwelcome, but then it always is in these films – writers never learn. Fortunately, these instances are rare and one can feel struck ultimately by how reigned in its material actually is. For instance, when the film finally bares a pair of breasts, we feel as if we should flinch because there has not been the cascade of nudity and 'raunch' we were perhaps expecting - the likes of which others in its genre have succumbed to. Does one really recommend ""American Pie""? Not especially: it is episodic and often quite disgusting, but it is not a film one can easily despise. Is it really a film which, hysterical conservative shrieking aside, really sends young men and women out to 'get laid' as soon as possible? It seems to present sex, or the pursuit of sex, as something frustrating; bumpy and ultimately superfluous to a good, hearty relationship with someone whose time you genuinely enjoy, but it seems nonplussed about people going out to get it anyway. The film is a long way from being a triumph of conservatism, but it does not seem to argue the case for the other side quite as manically as I remember it doing.",American Pie
34,filipemanuelneto,"After this, I'll never eat another apple pie!",1,24 April 2016,"This film tells the story of four teenagers seeking to lose their virginity before the end of high school. Directed by Paul and Chris Weitz, has a script by Adam Herz and has the participation of Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas and other actors.Sex has long ceased to be a taboo but it's not easy for a parent to discuss this topic with a son or daughter. It's part of life and it happens sooner in our times but there are clear boundaries between a healthy sexuality and a dissolute life. This has always been my personal opinion and I am sure that sex is good since it's lived with awareness, responsibility and maturity. And unfortunately, this message of maturity is totally absent of this film, that seeks to do comedy with immaturity and obsession with sex. For the guys in this movie, fu...ng is what matters, even if with an apple pie! It's the clash between a generation that didn't talk about sex and a generation that only talks and thinks about it, overcoming the barriers of shamelessness and making sexuality an animal obsession and an objective in itself. What saddens me most is to see that our adolescents (both boys and girls) are increasingly look like the characters in this film. Make it a comedy is not funny and doesn't help us to show the error that is to have this mentality. We are creating sexual perverts, and movies like this only contribute and profit from it.This film is the paradigm of teen film, one of the most stupid and insipid film genres created for the seventh art. Decidedly, the movie industry is able to reward us with masterpieces in the same way that we can throw up on the popcorn. Who have children, keep this film (and all it's sequels and spin-offs) prudently away from their eyes for the sake of their proper sex education.

The characters were incredibly annoying and unlikeable and the visual style was plain, dull and unimaginative.

Heck, whip out the old shopping list because there is a virgin for everyone! You buy one, and get a sexually obliterated apple pie as well. Priceless! If you haven't seen American Pie then, well what are you doing? This is a rite of passage. It turns innocent children into mature adults. Well, it turned this group of friends who make a pact to rid their virginity by prom night. We've got the jock, who thinks of himself as a Casanova figure. Then there's the mature one who refuses to use public lavatories (that's me by the way). Also the popular one who already has a girlfriend but is scared to go all the way to fourth base. Then, finally, there's the dork who is so obsessed with sex that he turns a warmly made apple pie into a fleshlight. Delicious! The beauty and simplicity of this comedy is that all the characters are loveable in their own unique way. It's crude sure, and never pushes any boundaries. Its formulaic narrative never injects any unexpected surprises into its predictable story. The amount of hormones being shown may also put some viewers off, especially with the constant talk of sex. But it's so assured at creating laughs through awkward situations, that you can't help but become attached to these bumbling fools. There are moments of genuine tenderness, particularly during prom night, that culminate into a milestone for my generation. This was the quintessential high school comedy, and it still manages to make me smile. Whether it be Jim's dad precariously talking to his son about sex or Stifler's provocative mum seducing his friends. It's light, raunchy and bursting with plenty of character.

39,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""American Pie"" stands out despite what it might stand for",7,14 July 2008,"""American Pie"" should be better known to the world as ""the comedy that launched 1,000 terrible movies."" This is the film that slapped a sticker on the genre ""Teen Comedy"" and convinced movie producers everywhere that the way to attract the overpaying audience of teenagers is to give them movies focused around sex and sex jokes. While ""American Pie"" certainly deserves that rep, lost in it all is what makes ""American Pie"" better than all those movies (including those of the same name that followed it). This is a comedy that despite glorifying teenage sex, has an sense of genuineness that anyone who has graduated high school can't deny and that's what makes it stand out.The film follows four friends who make a pact to help each other lose their virginity by prom night. Nice, simple and vulgar. What makes the comedy tick is that these friends are all different and attached to teenage stereotypes. Naturally, they find themselves in situations with women that come into conflict with these stereotypes or make for comedic opposites. This is a character-focused gag comedy. It's not slapstick, but all about gags making you empathize even more with these characters. While it's all very formulaic, it works somehow. You laugh and yet you have some vested interest in what becomes of the characters.Credit to writer Adam Herz for creating such memorable characters, though the actors themselves are half the success. Director Paul Weitz knows when the script is at its strongest and helps get these young actors to make some believable stuff despite their insensitive hijinx. Somehow, he gets a believable performance out of Chris Klein, for example, who plays Oz, the jock who decides to ""extend himself."" Normally he'd seem like a junky character, but his unlikely relationship with Mena Suvari's character works despite just an OK script.Most importantly, it must be stated that this film kind of operates with the liberal mindset of those who understand teenage sex happens so you might as well make it into something funny. To its credit, the film does address issues of safe sex and being in love and having sex, but that's not to say the film addresses moral issues, because quite frankly, it doesn't hold them with high regard.So as much as I want to hate ""American Pie"" for all the stereotypes and formula work, there is a lot of strong work being done with this film. It has terrific characters and most importantly a sense of being true to real life--though only the real life of one who accepts teenage sex as part of real life. The fact that Weitz was able to get these great performances out of a bunch of 19 and 20-year-olds is really impressive. So despite all the ridiculous gags and unnecessary jokes and bad movies the followed, ""American Pie"" really does work on a higher level and deserves to recognized for its contribution to pop culture (The term MILF has transformed the porn industry) and the comedy genre.",American Pie

I'm so sick and tired of movies like this, and if Sean William Scott had not been in this movie, there would not have been a single funny part in it. American Pie is an exploitative film that takes advantage of the vast amounts of immaturity readily found in modern audiences.I'll admit that I laughed at the movie, but it's the kind of laugh that lasts for seconds, and as soon as it's over, it's never funny again. You actually feel cheated because after you watch the movie you can look back and you realize how dumb the jokes really are. Except, of course, for the scene at the very end when Steve Stifler walks into the basement of his house after the party (`Mom? Shi*brick?!'). THAT will NEVER stop being funny.I don't want to give the impression that I feel that this movie was pounded out in five minutes with no thought and then thrown into production just to make money, because I realize that on some levels, maybe one or two, it is quality comedy.

43,Stevieboy666,Classic sex comedy,7,12 November 2017,"Many films benefit from repeated viewings but I think the opposite can be true of comedies, as second time around you know what's going to happen therefore it loses it's effect. First time I watched American Pie it had me in stitches, second time it amused me. So my 7/10 is based on that. It is a great & funny film about a much of guys desperate to lose their virginity but naturally with mixed & hilarious results. Couple of standout scenes here, Shannon E masturbating on web cam & one of the guys having sex with an American pie, worth seeing for those alone. Some strong language but the nudity is pretty low, they did ramp it up in the sequels, which are all worth checking out.",American Pie
44,dfranzen70,Raunch was never this cool!,8,9 January 2000,"You know, when I was a lad in the eighties, the big deal for us teens was Porky's (and its two sequels). In that film, set in Florida in the 1950s, a group of horny high school kids tries their very best to lose their individual virginity as soon as possible.You can consider American Pie an update of Porky's, except that it's a LOT funnier while still retaining all of that raunch. The hook for Porky's was that you got to see a little nudity, which was a big deal to a teenager in the early eighties. Pie surpasses the raunch and adds dollops of good, solid, vivid, and (especially) authentic characterizations. While the kids in Porky's were fairly stereotypical, the kids in Pie are.... well, typical, really. Of course, some things never change, and the driving force of the story in Pie is that males just wanna get laid, while females want it to be just right. The movie also tackles such issues as true love, masturbation (male and female), pornography, sex toys, orgasms (male and female), older women, and even diarrhea! Quite a lot to cram into 90 minutes, but not only does the film not skip a beat while delivering these goods, it does so with such honesty that you'll very rarely see in a so-called teen film of the late nineties. And I'm pretty sure it's the only film ever to tackle the all-important issue of sex with pastry!(Side note: Good to see Thomas Ian Nicholas, from Rookie of the Year, a little more grown up - so to speak!)",American Pie
45,dee.reid,There is a lot more purpose to this movie than some people think,10,17 February 2002,"""American Pie"" doesn't sound like much because of its simple premise: four guys(Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Eddie Kaye Thomas) enter into a pact to lose their virginity by prom night.  Now it's only natural that this movie would be immediately dismissed as another dumb sex comedy, but I believe that ""American Pie"" is much more than that.  Now I'm no expert, but I believe that there is a lot of hidden subtext here.  One of the scenes that I want to focus on, is the scene where Jim(Biggs) and Nadia(Shannon Elizabeth) are in his bedroom.  Now since Jim had walked in Nadia, she probably felt embarrassed and wanted to see the opposite effect on him.  When it's finally time to get down to ""business"", Jim by this time is so nervous that he n**s his boxers.  Nadia is then about ready to leave. Jim desperate and realizing that this may be the only chance he has with Nadia, starts to bring out the porn.  Nadia forgives him and they start to go at it again but then Jim blows his second chance.  I believe that this is probably the most important scene in this whole movie.  I say this because I think it was meant to show how nervous some people may get about first-time sex.  Now just because Jim had blown his big chance with Nadia, does not mean that she will think any lesser of him.  I mean after all, it was their first time doing anything together.  Now another part, which is the case of Sherman(Chris Owen) a.k.a. ""The Sherminator"".  Sherman is so sure of himself, that many people including our four heroes, think that he can score with any girl he meets.  This is wrong and this ultimately leads to his timely humiliation at the prom.  Strangely enough, his whole ""Sherminator"" act is only able to successfully attract the attention of one lucky lady(try to guess who).  Third is the case with Stifler(Seann William Scott).  Now I'm sure we've all known of at least one Stifler in our lives.  My definition of someone who is a ""Stifler"", is a person who only lives to party, have sex, and makes fun of those who can't; Stifler-""see you guys in the 'NO F*****G' section"".  What girls see in him or how he's even able to get girls is beyond me.  Fourth is the rapidly evolving dating relationship with Kevin(Nicholas) and his girlfriend, Vicky(Tara Reid).  We know that these two have been going out for quite some time.  Kevin is quite anxious to move to another base.  As he says, ""enough of this b-job bulls**t"". Vicky, feeling unappreciated that she probably can't please her boyfriend enough, dumps him.  Kevin then has to resort to ""Kama Sutra: The Book of Love"".  He begins reading the stuff in the book is eventually able to win back Vicky.  Fifth, how many of you have ever tried to change the way you act just to win a girl's heart?  I'm sure some of you have and Oz(Klein) is doing just that.  After the fiasco with Oz's first date, he begins to see things in a different light.  ""You can't try to win a girl over by repeating cheese-ball lines"" says his date.  Oz then takes this into account and after entering into the pact, he spots a young choir girl(Mena Suvari).  So Oz signs up for chorus just to win her heart.  At first he's just doing to get to her but then true love comes into play he finds himself vying for her affections.  He is eventually able to win her over but not by his physique or duty to the pact, but by his determination to find true love.  Sixth, is the minor situation with Jim and Michelle, the band geek(played by Alyson Hannigan).  Michelle- ""this one time at band camp..."" you know the rest. This relationship here is probably one of the higher aspects of ""American Pie"" because it goes to show you that you can't just put a label on anybody no matter how weird they appear to be.  Sure Jim ends up regretting his decision to sleep with her, but in the end, he'll really thank her for it and he will be glad he did.  Lastly, dear old Finch(Thomas).  Isn't it strange the things that we do out of desperation?   Now are you beginning to see what I've been getting at?  This movie is showing us how our sex lives have or may turn out to be like.  Not all of our encounters will turn out to be total disasters and we won't end up doing it with baked goods(hopefully).  Some of us may turn out to be a ""Sherman"" or a ""Stifler"" or maybe some us won't turn out to be anything at all.  Some of us may have to change our personalities completely to just to win a girl's affections.  Some of us may end up having to resort to extreme measures to get what we want.",American Pie
46,meeza,THIS ONE TASTES GOOD!,8,27 February 2000,"Many horny high school students throughout history have tried to solve the pie equation. No! Not the 3.14 one, but the one that makes them as shagadelic as an overmojoed Austin Powers. My friends that would be called the ""American Pie "" equation. These and many more hilarious pursuits are rekindled in a very funny film called ( Yes! You guessed it!) ""American Pie."" This hilarious gem is about four high school students who make a pact to lose their virginity by graduation ( or in other words solve the ""American Pie"" equation.) The movie contains some outrageous scenes such as a powerful laxative that will make you pee in your pants, a new meaning to the term the world wide web, and a beer that is definitely not less filling. To rephrase the great Forrest Gump or in this case I will call him Forrest Hump- "" Life is like an American Pie, you never know how horny is going to get."" ****Good",American Pie
47,GiraffeDoor,I don't want seconds.,4,4 August 2019,"I try to appreciate what this movie represents for people. The painful humour that is the agonising process of ""coming of age"". The frequent humiliations en route to attempts at bliss.The humour is therefor basically just people being cruel and getting mortified. You might say it's karmic but they're good at making you route for these characters.I don't like the humour and I've never liked these movies which shamelessly attempts laugh after laugh with bodily functions and then tries to add on a message about ""true love"" or something but it is far from the worst offender and it does throw the audience a bone by the end.But the only really good part is the nudity though that's tainted by comedic sociopathy.",American Pie
48,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Good movie with raunchy content,9,17 November 2005,"In my opinion, this is a good movie with raunchy content. One thing I hated most was the nudity, especially when Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) was pleasuring herself on Jim's (Jason Biggs) bed. The reason I found this was because she had no top on. In my opinion, this movie had very funny humor, even though it was vulgar at times. Another raunchy part was when Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) was in the toilet. The thing I liked most was the prom. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""If I ever have kids of my own, I'm not going to let them see this movie until they're grown up."" Now, in conclusion, I'd like to say, ""Parents, don't let your children see this until they're grown up!""",American Pie
49,davispittman,Actually turned out to be deeper than gross out humor,8,2 August 2017,"I will say this for American Pie, it's not full out of completely gross out humor like Van Wilder (2002). It's got a couple of scenes based on crude humor, but I was glad to see that for the most part, the movie steered clear of over the top disgusting humor. The characters are good hearted boys that think they just want sex, and for a couple of the characters that turns out to be true, but for a couple other of them, it turns out that just ""getting laid"" isn't the most important thing. I liked that the characters actually ended up to have a deeper want and that they actually end up having better connections with girls that yes may involve sex, but that's not all that it's based upon. Now this movie isn't all love and good hearted stuff, it's got plenty and I do mean plenty of raunchy/dirty humor. Humor that involves male and female masturbation in different ways, premature ejaculation, and very descriptive talk of all kinds of sexual activities. Just FYI in case any of that offends you. There is some truly funny material in the film, I laughed at several scenes in the movie. I didn't think it was laugh out loud hilarious, but some parts were funny. The parts I wasn't laughing at, I was feeling for the characters. I loved the acting from all the cast members. Tara Reid was really good as Vicky. Jason Biggs was a perfect choice for Jim. Thomas Nicholas is great as Kevin. Chris Klein is very good as Oz. And the rest of the cast is good too, but Kevin, Vicky, Oz, and Jim are the biggest characters here. I loved how Oz and Kevin were so adorable and were actually good hearted guys. I really like American Pie because not only is it funny but it's also good hearted and filled with good characters. 8/10.",American Pie
50,hu675,Good hearted raunchy sex comedy.,8,9 December 2008,"A group of high school students (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicolas and Eddie Kaye Thomas) are trying desperately to lose their virginity at their prom night. But each student have different experiences with the relationship... they have with their girlfriends or the young woman... they encounter. But none of them... realized that losing their virginity and especially growing up is tough.Directed by Paul Weitz (About a Boy, Down to Earth, In Good Company) made an hilarious coming of age teen comedy about growing up maturely and sex. This was the first film to make sex, just as hip for the young girls instead of the usual horny teen boys. The young cast are especially good but Eugene Levy as one of the boy's father has some of the funnier moments in the film.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. This DVD is the unrated version. DVD has an hilarious commentary track by the director, screenwriter Adam Herz, actors:Biggs-Kaye Thomas and Seann William Scott. DVD also has behind the scenes featurette, outtakes and more. This was one of the most successful comedies of 1999, it was so popular and well received. There was two successful sequels were produced in 2001 and 2003. ""American Pie"" is certainly one of the funnier sex comedies since ""Porky's"" but this movie has an bigger heart and it is more realistic as well. Don't miss it. (****/*****).",American Pie
51,jfgibson73,Looks like you could use a hand...,6,5 September 2021,"I remember really liking this movie when it came out. Rewatching it today, I thought it seemed much more tame than I remembered. It does have a couple of moments where it goes a little further than the average teen comedy, but much of it is about relationships. The characters talk a lot about their relationships as romantic interests and as friends. Other directors who like raunchy humor will throw in some emotional stuff to balance it out, but I think their is a difference between the guys who made this movie and, say, the Farrelly brothers. American Pie almost seems sweet natured in comparison. Eugene Levy provides a lot of that with his supportive father role, but almost all the characters are laid back with a caring nature. It would be nice if there were teen movies this well done at least once a generation.",American Pie
52,ferbs54,"""One Time, In Band Camp....""",7,20 August 2009,"It is one of the most beloved comedies of the last decade, seemingly revered by all members of Generations X and Y; the first of a series that supposedly includes no less than three inferior sequels; AND the popularizer (if not the originator) of the term ""MILF."" It also jump-started the careers of actresses Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson Hannigan, Tara Reid and Mena Suvari. So I thought it was high time that this baby boomer finally caught up with 1999's ""American Pie,"" and you know what...this film really is some funny stuff, and had me--a hard person to make laugh out loud--laughing out loud any number of times. The film's plot, about four soon-to-be-graduating high school guys (Jim, Oz, Kevin and Finch) in pursuit of the Holy Grail (i.e., losing their virginity by the night of the senior prom), may seem like a familiar one, but it is fleshed out with likable and amusing characters and benefits immensely by a brightly clever script. Among the funny scenes are any that include Eugene Levy as Jim's embarrassingly decent, well-meaning father from hell (the scene with the dirty magazines is a riot!); the plight of poor Finch in the ladies' rest room; the initial making of the boys' pact; and, of course, any bit with ""the Shermanator,"" the most hilarious would-be (nerd) Lothario until ""Superbad""'s McLovin' came down the pike eight years later.

55,aidanratesmovies,Raunchy Fun,9,15 January 2021,"An entertaining, if traditional little raunchy comedy- American Pie can seem like an average teen comedy at its start, but once it gets going, it easily becomes one of the most daring and vulgar little comedies you will ever come to see. The film largely feels like a launching pad for many of the comedic actors in the film we know today, and yet still didn't go very far. I wasn't a big fan of two of our main actors Jason Biggs and Thomas Ian Nicholas, who just seemed to fall a bit flat at times. The other half of the main crew however, Chris Klein and Eddie Kaye Thomas did tend to surprise me on screen with their acting skills though- and just fun comedic brilliance. I also enjoyed the performances of Mena Suvari, Natasha Lyonne, Jennifer Coolidge, and of course Eugene Levy. The film feels a bit generic at its start, but once it fits its story and its main plotline I found it to be very fun to watch. There are several hilarious, if awkward moments to watch and enjoy. It's certainly not a film for everyone, but I enjoyed it, and I had fun with it, about as much as I hoped to have with it. American Pie isn't necessarily brilliant or unique, but it's a simple and raunchy homage to the teen films before it, and oddly enough the film just works as its own thing.

So yes there are some funny parts to this movie. You may laugh. And YES I thought the legendary ""pie scene"" was funny, very funny actually, and laughed along with millions of other people.However, that said American Pie is run of the mill, typical and not really a terrific movie. Hundreds of comedies are funnier and after seeing this, I can't say I particularly remember much about it or would have cared at all had I not seen it.It does have some funny moments and it isn't as bad as I thought it would be at all. The humor is there at times. But there are a lot of other teen comedies that are more genunely unforgettable. The single best comedy for young people is ""fast times at richmond high.""

58,Movie-ManDan,A Serious and Legitimately Good Comedy.,10,25 July 2014,"This movie is the best teen comedy of the decade, hands down. It is like ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High: The Next Generation."" It follows a group of four different, but close high school friends: the geeky Jim Levenstein (Biggs), athletic Chris ""Oz"" Oztreicher (Klein), charming Kevin Meyers (Nicholas), and oddball Paul Finch (Thomas), who make a pact to lose their virginity before graduating high school, which prom being the last chance. Jim tries to score with sexy exchanged student (Elizabeth), Oz tries to make it with a straight-laced choir singer (Suvari), Kevin tries to win the trust of his girlfriend (Reid) whose relationship is ending, and Finch pays people to support a new reputation of his. Supporting characters include Jim's guiding father (Levy), obnoxious party animal Steve Stifler (Scott), band geek and Jim's last-minute partner (Hannigan), Stifler's sexy mom and Finch's last minute effort (Coolidge), sex expert Jessica (Lyonne), and wannabe cool Chuck Sherman ""the Shermanator"" (Owen). These other characters add to the hilarity, heart and memorability.Despite this movie being about sex and totally hilarious, the character development and chemistry are strong, and Kevin's and Oz's subplots are more dramatic than funny. So any super-conservative person would be surprised at the right mix of comedy and drama. The seriousness isn't sad or boring, it is there to strengthen the quality of the movie. Also, everything this movie has is realistic and relatable with the hard times of high school. So it may be about trying to get laid, but that is an aspect that nearly every teenager faces. As the guys get closer to doing so, they also learn lessons on love and adulthood. And since each friend is different, more lessons can be made and the movie gets strengthened even more. Without these strong dimensions, it would just be a stupid late-night comedy.4/4",American Pie
59,raulfaust,1999 was THE year in movies,7,25 March 2011,"First of all I have to say I really laughed in the scene that Jim said angrily ""I hate sex!! I've never done this I already hate it"" or something like that.In the first 20 minutes, I was ready to give it a bad review. American Pie began too silly and seemed to be a movie for pre-teenagers. But after the web camera scene, it began being funny and entertaining. You know, putting funny jokes much after the beginning makes the spectator loses the interest for the film, the writers here were really brave to do that (and fortunately, it worked). It deals with many of the youth issues, such as insecurity, inexperience, curiosity and growing up. The end of the movie is mind blowing; they really made it in a way to satisfy the spectator (and me as well, of course).Also, Jason Biggs proves to be a real actor that deserves the attention he had in here. I just watched this film and right after I went to youtube to see his interviews. He is really very different from Jim, which shows he can act and leave the comfortable zone with talent.

Its many knock-offs never seemed to get this, but the sex jokes weren't the core of this movie. Sure, it's funny when some dude gets caught getting it on with a pie, but that wasn't really the point. The way I see it, it was really about a bunch of guys trying to cope with growing up. Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy master in awkward situations, but their scenes are also incredibly heart-warming, especially the one with the nudie magazines. My absolute favourite part though (apart from the inevitable Nadia scene) comes near the ending, when Jim finally manages to put everything into perspective and tells everyone of.

Is there anyone left who hasn't already seen the movie, or at least knows what it's about? Regardless, here are my two cents. American Pie hasn't aged particularly well. It doesn't have the timelessness of some of the other movies in the raunchy teen comedy genre, and it's been greatly surpassed by movies that have come after it. It's still funny in some ways, but a lot of the gross scenes that used to be shocking, are fairly unremarkable by today's standards.

It was just comedy for the sake of having people laugh. And indulge in below the waist humor. But the difference with this one, is that it has heartfelt undertones, which is why it didn't get a bad rep, or people diminishing its otherwise qualities. The cast is the most iconic of the franchise, and none of the bad acting bothered me. And it still don't. I also love the music, obviously, and still regret so many good songs were missing from the official soundtrack. Or no volume 2 was ever released.

65,DeeNine-2,Suburban Anthropology,6,5 January 2001,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This is a cute, even sweet, coming of ager with an attractive cast. But be warned, if sex offends you, you will be offended. It is also more than a little on the juvenile side, especially the first half or so. I can't even discuss the subject matter on Amazon.com, which is just as well. And you DON'T EVEN want to know why it is called ""American Pie."" Suffice it to say that if you're past your early twenties much of this will seem lame and adolescent. If you're younger, you may just crack up over all the crude, but sometimes sharply observed humor.Thus the question: why did I watch it? Easy: Mena Suvari. The beauty of American Beauty is here a drama dweeb--or is that a drama geek? Actually she sings in a jazz class, which I suppose is close to the same thing. At any rate, she is not a cheer leader nor the queen of the hop, just a pretty girl with values. She is excellent. Also good in a supporting role is Alyson Hannigan (from TV's Buffy) as a nerd girl who surprises with what she learned at band camp. Eddie Kaye Thomas as the boy (Paul Finch) who learns that women only get better with age is just perfect. However, I think Jason Biggs was a little lamer than was absolutely necessary. Sean William Scott was true to his part as your classic neanderthal jock.Funniest line, from Biggs, after finding Michelle gone in the morning: ""I was used--Cool!""Another reason for watching this film is that one does get some, no doubt twisted, idea of what passes for adolescent sexual preoccupation these days and can compare such notions to an earlier era. Call it suburban anthropology.As I was watching Mena Suvari I got to thinking about the appeal of her very captivating face. Like fashion models and other stars with child-like faces, we adore her. Why? Call it neoteny. This led to a further thought. In the future, as we continue to look more and more like our children, some day we and our children will look the same. (Perhaps this could be a good idea for a science fiction story.) Some say the appeal of imagined aliens is that they have child-like features (think of the big round heads and the big eyes). But really they are unconscious caricatures of ourselves and the values that we most esteem, brains and photogenic eyes.Anyway, American Pie is kind of sweet if you are not offended by vivid depictions of adolescent sexuality or crude bathroom humor. And there is more sophistication to the relationships than might be supposed at first blush. It ends at the prom, as all good American coming of age flicks should. The boys grow up and begin to learn the difference between love and sex, and the girls find they no longer have to teach the boys how to kiss. This is an American Graffiti for the new millennium.",American Pie

67,baumer,Incredibly humourous and an honest look at trying to get laid in highschool.,9,6 July 1999,"American Pie is the funniest movie that I have seen in about five years. Something About Mary had me laughing, Big Daddy had me holding my sides, and South Park had me shocked but humoured.  American Pie is heads and shoulders above any of these films.  What makes this film so funny is not only its attempt to humour us, but its honesty in every scene.  And that honesty can bring us back to what it was like to be there.  So whether you lost it ten years ago, yesterday of even five minutes ago, you can relate to the feelings that this movie has.It is three weeks before the prom and four friends have made a pact to get laid before the end of prom.  The four friends consist of a guy who has been dating a girl for quite a while but hasn't gotten past third base.  Another is a shy guy that has problems doing his "" business "" at school because of cleanliness issues.  A third is portrayed at first as the quintessential jock that just wants to use his athletic prowess to meet the ladies.  And finally we have Jim.  Jim is the guy that you see in the commercials.  He is so sexually inept that when he tries to talk to a girl, he shies away before any words will leave his mouth.  And when he has a naked girl in his room, he "" blows it "" twice, before he can get the prize.The most interesting situation was how the jock "" OZ "" grew in this movie. He started off as a typical jock.  Then he meets a girl that he really likes.  And suddenly he doesn't just want to have sex, he really cares about her and at the end when we see them together, it makes you feel warm.  It is their relationship that makes you remember what it was like to really like someone for the first time.There are many other delicate and poignant scenes in the film concerning love.  Kevin and Vickey's relationship is a tricky one because they both really like each other but she is not sure if she wants to take that last step.  This causes some friction in the relationship, but when it is resolved, it is written so convincingly that you are happy for them.This film combines some true intelligence and romance with a wickedly funny look at the complexities of sex.  And nothing is sacred here.  They explore female and male oral sex.  They talk in depth about orgasms and of course masturbation is a big topic in this film.  And that makes it side splittingly funny and incredibly witty.  American Pie really is a miracle. It was written by Adam Herz and this is his first film.  And judging by his ear for dialogue and character, he will be around for quite some time.The one performance that I wanted to call attention to was Chris Klein as Oz.  I wasn't sure where I had seen him before so I looked him up in the IMDb.  And he was in Election.  And he was great in that film too.  But here he is honest and sincere in his performance and he lends credence to his character.  He is very good in American Pie and I believe he will go on to do bigger things in Hollywood.So if what you are looking for is one hilarious film and you like Something About Mary (tripled) kind of humour, then this is your movie.  If you don't like that kind of film, don't even bother to see this film.  But you are missing a true treasure.  Thsi film reminds me a bit of a combination between The Breakfast Club and Fast Times.  So check it out.  You will laugh and you will cheer when you walk out of theater.  The only bad thing about this film is that it ended.One final thought is that you should really beware of the chicks in band that play the flute.  ( Wickedly funny!! )Wonderful movie!",American Pie

It's just a compilation of situation gags, some better than others. Designed to titillate and amuse 14 year old boys. I prefer my comedy more intelligent.",American Pie

71,mattymatt4ever,"Funny, heartfelt and original",8,17 April 2001,"""American Pie"" set the standard for teen gross-out/sex comedies of contemporary society.  It definitely has some unforgetabbly funny moments. The scene with the beer--CLASSIC!  A film like this is noted for its crudeness, but what makes it special is it disciplines the crudeness and uses it intelligently.  There are few throwaway gags.  And through all the crudeness, there's a heart.  There's a fine love story that develops via each character, and that romance develops smoothly and not at the usual forced Hollywood pace.  And I think that's what made this film memorable. Because we see a lot of movies with crude sexual humor left and right.  The makers of this movie KNOW how to tell a sex joke and any joke that regards to bodily functions.  I think the scene that caught most people's eyes was the stripping scene with Jason Biggs and the foreign exchange student Nadia, played by Shannon Elizabeth.  We do get a shot of her taking her clothes off, but it's not done in a gratuitous manner.  It then cuts to the reactions of every computer user in East Falls, checking out the hot naked chick splattered across their screens.  The way they edited that scene was really unique.  The film even contains Shannon masturbating, and that's also not done in a gratuitous manner.  Then we have Jason barging in on her, and she feels humiliated.  What made that scene unique is SHE made HIM take his clothes off.  Each comic moment goes smoothly because of the timing, delivery and all-out design of the sequences.  So these are no mindless gags we usually are faced with in teen flicks of these kind.  Of course, SCTV legend Eugene Levy steals the screen in his supporting role.  I don't think they could've picked anyone better to play that role. 
""American Pie"" is a treat for teens, young adults and--maybe--some older ones.  I think they should find it quite harmless.  If you have an overprotective adult in the house who gets outraged if they hear the word ""damn"" used--make sure you view this film solo.  But if your parents are more lenient, there's nothing to worry about.  I'm sure they'll laugh with you.  I have a cousin who thinks of ""American Pie"" as the dirtiest film ever made.  She thinks it should get a triple R rating.  She said, ""What kind of dirty teen films are they making nowadays?  Back in my day, I was raised with good, wholesome films like ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""16 Candles.""  She obviously doesn't get out a hell of a lot.  If you're stuck in the same close-minded mode as my cousin, skip this one.  If not--kick back and have some fun!!!",American Pie
72,hall895,A mostly satisfying slice of pie,7,1 September 2005,"OK, so it's not The Godfather or Gone With The Wind. It is what it is, and what it is isn't that bad at all. American Pie is a silly farce and if you're willing to turn off your brain for a couple of hours and just go with it you may well find it rather enjoyable. If you're looking for a ""serious"" movie with some deeper meaning, well then you've obviously come to the wrong place.The story, such at it is, revolves around a group of male high school seniors desperate to lose their virginity before graduation. But the story's not really the point, it seems as if the story's just there as something to fill space between gags and jokes. And there are plenty of gags and jokes, many tasteless, mostly funny. But even as we race from one joke to the next there is time to get to know a widely disparate cast of characters. Jason Biggs plays the central character of Jim, a mostly hapless type who finds himself on the wrong end of most of the jokes and gags. There's Chris Klein as the athlete, Eddie Kaye Thomas as the eccentric and Thomas Ian Nicholas as the seemingly normal one of the group. Outside the main circle of friends is the outlandish Stifler, played with perverse glee by Seann William Scott. Of course there are also the girls our boys are chasing. Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Natasha Lyonne wander through but the two standouts are Shannon Elizabeth as foreign exchange student Nadia and Alyson Hannigan as geeky Michelle, two characters who will have a few surprises for the boys chasing after them. Also of note is Eugene Levy as Jim's dad. It's the only real adult role of any significance in the film and Levy brings his typical comic genius touch to the part.Anyone can do a teenage raunchfest but American Pie is something more. It's a raunchfest with heart if that's at all possible. We get to know and sympathize with these characters and watch them evolve over time. But we also get quite a few laughs at their expense along the way. Certainly American Pie will not go down in the annals of history as an all-time classic. But it's a funny, enjoyable, satisfying experience.",American Pie
73,Beta_Gallinger,"Can't say I never laughed, but this is another overrated immature romantic comedy",6,6 May 2010,"I've been aware of this movie's existence for many years now. Released in 1999, it's a romantic comedy which turned out to be an absolute success and spawned two sequels, ""American Pie 2"" in 2001, and ""American Wedding"" in 2003. I even remember listening to the ""American Wedding"" soundtrack six years ago, but never actually saw any film in the trilogy until this month, when I finally watched the first one. The original ""American Pie"" was released the year after ""There's Something About Mary"", another successful R-rated romantic comedy. I watched that 1998 release earlier this year and really didn't get the hype. I knew this film was a lot like that one, and thought it was slightly better than its predecessor, but still vastly overrated.Jim Levenstein, Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher, Kevin Myers, and Paul Finch are four high school friends who are nearing the end of their senior year. One of their fellow students is Steve Stifler, a popular sex-crazed jock who can be very rude and insensitive. After a geeky student named Chuck Sherman claims to have just had sex, and it appears he is telling the truth, the four friends are shocked. Jim, Oz, Kevin, and Finch then all vow to lose their virginity before graduation. Since they are convinced that Chuck has had sex before finishing high school, they figure they obviously can as well. In order to achieve their goal, they will have to get themselves girlfriends before the senior prom, which is coming up in three weeks. They don't have very much time, so each of them soon attempts to find a female peer and win her heart, but as the night of the prom draws nearer, they find that trying to lose their virginity in time isn't so easy.This R-rated comedy is crude and juvenile from the beginning, showing Jim getting caught watching an explicit channel by his parents, and I have to admit that this made me laugh. Many more crude gags follow, and they often made me laugh at least lightly, including the part with Steve drinking beer which he doesn't realize Kevin has ejaculated into, though I'm not proud of that, and didn't find the scene that soon follows this, with Steve throwing up in the toilet, very funny. There's even a part showing Jim practicing sex on a pie, and this part probably wouldn't have made me laugh had it not been for his father coming in and catching him in the act! The scene with Jim's Dad, played by Eugene Levy, giving his son a bunch of porno magazines, and at least one later scene with this character giving his son sexual advice, also made me laugh. Levy's talent was probably a major reason for this. However, most of the movie isn't THAT funny, and is sometimes pretty lame, even cruel, such as the part where many students get to see the sexual activity in Jim's room on their computers, and Steve giving Finch diarrhea and leading him into the girl's washroom to let it out, even if I didn't keep a completely straight face throughout these segments. Finch even has to face Steve and many other students laughing at him when he comes out of the ladies' room! I also didn't care much for the characters in general, there's nothing too special about them, and very rarely do I see a movie with such a stupid and uninteresting premise!Some super-raunchy modern comedies are really funny to me, while certain others have failed to make me laugh even one time while I watched them. For me, ""American Pie"" came somewhere in between. I did laugh at times, and I've certainly seen worse excuses for gags than any of the ones I saw here, but the laughs weren't consistent enough, and the movie certainly has some notably lame segments. Since there were parts I found funny, even if that's not necessarily a good thing, I give this juvenile R-rated romantic comedy a 6/10, but thinking about all the lameness I saw in it, I get the feeling even this rating is a little too generous. Unsurprisingly, nothing here made me feel the same way as the zipper accident in ""There's Something About Mary"" (I've said in previous reviews that nothing else in any movie ever has), but like that 1998 comedy, I really don't think this one deserved its massive success.",American Pie
74,CharltonBoy,All too Predictable,6,19 March 2000,American pie is a typical American college movie that is all too predictable and tries to be different by going for the shock factor but all it does is confirms that the americans are really lousy when it comes to making good comedies. why do they always have to involve some irritating college kid who is trying to lose his virginity on the prom night.

76,stamper,Is this really how teenage kids behave???,8,27 August 2000,"Well eh yes. This is a film that depicts the way teenagers behave in a great way. The stuff they talk about the way they treat each other and so on. The only thing that just might not be entirely true here is that kids of my age (17  19) don't actually need to get laid before going to college yet or maybe that's just because I live in a little hellhole. Here in our town it is more about kissing (french kissing most of the time). There are actually people who do that 3 or 4 times a night (both males and females). Of course coming to the conversational part of the movie, I can't speak for the girls, but the guys, well they sure like to observe pretty girls, they sure like to talk dirty and stupid and they sure as hell make some dumb bet's or pacts. Some may even do pretty dumb stuff, like Jim, but I haven't witnessed that, I only know the stories (maybe I'm lucky not to have seen some things). If you don't want to hear this or read this, you should stop and start reading the next bit after the blank line. This filthy story is actually from a German film (but I've heard a story about a few drunk guys a friend of mine knows who did the exact same thing). In the film (and in reality, according to my friend) a couple of guys lay a piece of bread on the ground and form a circle around it. Then they started masturbating and the one that came missed had to eat the slice of bread. Well that is quite nasty I must say and I feel far worse than what was depicted in American Pie, for it was intentional.
On to the film I must say I was not so disgusted as many of you Americans might have been. Most of the stuff there seemed pretty natural to me (with a few exotic outbursts, but hey it is a comedy). But what I really think is strange about this is that never have I read a review or comment about this film (or heard from one of my friends) is that there is actually a bit of romance between all that talk about sex and the gross  out comedy. That I found particularly good, for it brought some real refreshment tot the film. Due to the romance it was not the way that there needed to be one crude joke or action after another, you know. That is something that often happens in spoofs like The Naked gun. In those films they become so determined to make you laugh, rather that they totally cross the line and become ridiculous instead of being funny. They should be looking for something refreshing, like the romance here in American Pie (which is a film that can hardly be compared to the naked gun for it is not nonsense). Back to American Pie though. It was not only the story and the jokes that made this a good and fun film, the good performance of the young actors and actresses helped a lot too. They were all good, though there is one actor I must mention separately and that is Jason Biggs. He was really great. He was the best of the bunch, for he was the one featured in the funniest parts of the film, plus he came over like a real funny guy, who was kind of new to everything and who behaved most like I would have behaved I guess (I think he reminded me of myself and that's why I liked him so much).
This really is a film I can recommend to everyone, for I don't see how you could be  offended by the jokes and the situations. The only thing there may be for me to say that this is a film suited for no one under the age of 16 or so (because of the content, although I can imagine I might have liked it then only because of the dirty jokes and not because I had the feeling that the way me and my friends behave is in some form the way teenagers around the world are behaving, maybe even RIGHT NOW). I sure as hell want to see a sequel and I sure as hell know I'm not going to need force someone to make American Pie 2.

Jason Biggs' comic acting skills are highly underrated and, in my opinion, the primary reason for American Pie becoming so successful. Him and Eugene Levy make for an extremely likeable and equally hilarious father and son double act.The film loses a mark for the awful 'Kevin' character played by Thomas Nicholas who is just excruciating to watch. Thankfully, the rest of this great cast do a good job of drowning out his persistent soppiness. The love story between Chris Klein and Mena Suvari is very nicely executed for a teen comedy and manages to be sweet without becoming sickly.Now over 20 years old, American Pie is still pretty fresh and as enjoyable as ever.

Good lines, nothing too cheesy or cringe worthy. I loved how the entire cast brought a different view of character. There was the awkward teenager. The geeks and nerds. There was the jock and the sensitive guy. It really showed each persons character well with what girl they ended up with, it reflected them perfectly. I loved how it brought out every aspect of sexual situations that can happen, not just focusing on the classic moments or the ""I just want to get into your pants moments"". The movie did have parts where you cringed from the awkward scenes, but it wasn't a bad cringe, it was more of ""I really feel for you and I can relate"" moment. But above all I liked the sexual element in the movie. The entire movie had lots of R rated scenes, but it wasn't in a bad way. It didn't mock woman or tare anyone down. It was funny and more about teens first sexual experiences making it very relatable as the viewer remembers the day... The movie didn't feel like a dumb sex film, it had more to it then just the sex.

83,raymond-15,Guaranteed to revive memories for male audiences.,7,24 March 2001,"A light-hearted romp among a group of American High School students who make a pact to get laid within the next three weeks.  Despite their bravado the boys are naive and inexperienced in matters of sexual behaviour.  This makes for some hilarious situations in their first approach to the opposite sex. Taken in the spirit of fun, the risque bedroom scenes are acceptable in context though some might find them rather offensive.  The teenage boys are so infatuated with salacious sex one wonders if their brains have relocated between their legs,  It's a real situational farce with characters being caught in compromising positions.  For me there were quite a few memorable scenes. For example: the father/son discussion about women's bodies as illustrated in the centre folds; the girl who discards her clothing in a bedroom which has been set up with a computer and digital camera and the whole stripping and masturbation sequence broadcast on the internet; the wolf whistles from the students next morning; the young guy giving a girl a taste of foreplay while he considers his next move in consultation with an illustrated sex folder; an irrestible urge to masturbate in a hole in his favourite fruit pie baked by his mother.... It goes on and on through a series of sexual activities that are accomplished with such naivete and awkwardness, it can't help but raise a few chuckles.  The scriptwriter has cleverly captured some of the frustrations of growing up in the turbulent teenage years.  The film goes at a good pace as the scenes bubble along one sfter another and the film is about the right length too.  Any longer, it would tend to become repetitive.  The singing group adds variety to the film and the background music used to accent the comedy in some of the scenes is a brilliant and original idea.",American Pie
84,bopdog,"Way better than standard teen sex movies-- Funny, sexy, and has a heart!",9,16 January 2000,"Much better than the usual teen-sex-glitz-farce. I watched the unrated version of ""American Pie"" on DVD the same week I also watched ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" and the contrast between the two was clear. Both movies are a little gross for some tastes, and probably will concern or even offend a portion of the population. But beyond that kind of knee-jerk ""tut-tutting"" in the media there is a very good reason to enjoy ""American Pie"": It's a very good movie.I avoided ""American Pie"" in the theaters because the trailers and the reviewers focused on the ""hi-jinx"" aspect-- clumsy, self-absorbed boys running amuck while trying to satisfy their physical urges without regard to any higher values such as love, relationship, appreciation of their fellow human beings, etc. At the urging of my parents, however, I watched the DVD, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie indeed had a heart. As well as a bunch of crude, funny material-- solid comedy.Without revealing the outcomes of the ""plot""-- let me just say that the characters undergo a believable redemption and maturing that would be a high point in any ""chick movie."" I hesitate to give praise here at others' expense, yet I think it is important to note the vivid contrast of this fine and good hearted movie with another teen sex flick: ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" which was released about the same time. ""10 Things...,"" as with so many movies in this genre, was mean, low-spirited, and viciously hostile. It was an insult to the audience, especially in its vulgar depiction of adolescent boys as perverts and buffoons, and adolescent girls as greedy, ego driven bitches. That's bad!  It perverted what is otherwise a normal part of human life-- wholesome, randy good humor.""American Pie"" has a good heart, and a good eye. See it and laugh, but don't be surprised if you also get a tiny bit edified at the same time. Oh-- the commentary track on the DVD is also great-- The director, the writer, I think, and several of the actors all appear together with spirited good humor and genuinely informative info-- that alone is worth the DVD price!",American Pie
85,alice liddell,Sweet? Inoffensive? Sentimental?! What IS happening to the gross-out movie?,8,13 October 1999,"I'm sorry.  I go to gross-out movies to see a mounting series of disgusting, childish mishaps befall relatively pleasant characters.  I want to see scenes that should probably never have been allowed.  I want humiliation, body failure, slapstick and the obligatory liquid scene.  This AMERICAN PIE provides in mild-mannered spades.  What I don't want is maturity and Prince Hal.It could be argued that THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, last year's Hollywood masterpiece, leavened its gross-out with generous portions of ick, but a love quest was built into that film from the beginning, the success or failure of which was going to have an emotional effect.  Also, the characters were significantly older than the kids of AMERICAN PIE, so the pay-off was more believable, and because the characters were so sweet, more satisfying.AMERICAN PIE is about a quartet of hormonal boys who want to get laid before they go to college.  As 49% of the population experience this agony at some time in their lives, the film has to be pretty accurate in its details to succeed, and it largely is.  The guys are very likeable and believable, their mishaps ring very true.  Their worldview shapes the film, and is rarely betrayed.  The film, which everyone compares to PORKY'S, is miles above that infantile gag in its relatively even-handed treatment of women, who are not the inscrutable, unattainable, type, but a varied, complex lot. Even the set-piece with Nadja, which begins as sheer exploitation, ends up with the male lead deeply humiliated.  The universal implications of the title are a wild misnomer: it should have been called Upper-Middle-Class American Pie.  Every character lives in a big house, with no real dysfunction, so that they can afford to spend all their time fretting about sex (I'd forgotten how much EFFORT goes into this, though).  Every character is going to college; every main character is white.  An AMERICAN PIE from the projects would be a very different film.For a comedy to be lastingly funny, there has to be trauma.  That's why the mature angst of one couple strikes me as false.  The growing relationship of another is lovely, but unlikely: it's like gross-out films lack the bottle to go all the way - the repulsiveness has to sweetened.  The Farellys tried with KINGPIN, but were accused of misogyny, even misanthropy.  Only SOUTH PARK dared to go all the way, cynically parodying feel-good redemption, But, hey, that was only a cartoon, right?  And yet, even the maturity is a lie.  The characters learn that a selfish obsession with having sex is not the most important thing in life, and yet they do anyway.But I don't know why I'm carping.  AMERICAN PIE is a side-splitting hoot from start to finish.  LIke all the best comedy, the humiliation is linked to character, and Jim's experiences especially are among the funniest things I've seen in years - the practicing; the understanding talks given by his father; his immortal strip-tease; the pie!  Priceless.  Shame he looks like a cross between Ross Geller and Adam Sandler.A more satisfying melancholy concerns the allusions to Hal and Falstaff. Like the former, the characters have big careers in front of them, and must reject the exuberant licentiousness of their youth.  There is a real sense of loss at the end, of a time having certainly past, which is perversely moving.  Most adult figures condone, even encourage, the teenage hi-jinx: they know it's as good as it's going to get.None of the misfortunes really spring from malice, so there is rarely a bad taste left in one's mouth (except Stifler's).  Director Weitz could become a great comedy director - he knows how to cut scenes short for maximum effect: more experienced comedians drag on and on.  My only complaint would be the relatively short space allocated to Finch - he is a wonderful character, filled with a strange, devious self-confidence behind his apparent geekiness: you've got to like a guy who can wisecrack in Latin.",American Pie
86,FlickJunkie-2,"Finally, the real thing",8,2 January 2000,"Over the years there have been dozens, maybe hundreds of high school hijinks films, most of which are sophomoric caricatures which try to outdo each other in the grossness of their cliches.  American Pie has run away from its pubescent pack by capturing high school the way it really is.  Four years of frustrated preoccupation with sex; what it is, who's done it and how to get it.  This movie is hilarious, mostly because it depicts the essence of what it is like to be wrestling with the confusion of emerging sexuality while trying to convince everyone else that you are cool.Director Chris Weitz has found the right balance between sexual obsession and teenage self consciousness.  The fact is no-one is as experienced as they pretend, and they're scared to death of the embarrassment it would cause if everyone knew.The skits are mostly funny, sometimes raunchy, sometimes touching, but always right on the mark emotionally for that age group.
Jason Biggs (Jim) takes the cake (pie) when it comes to comic prowess in this film.  Alyson Hannigan is priceless as the nerd girl refugee from band camp.This film is a must see good time.  Check your maturity at the front door and just enjoy.",American Pie
87,Bogmeister,American dreams of idiotic teens,5,23 July 2005,"I viewed the 'gasp' unrated version of the high school sex comedy which renewed interest in ""Porky's""-style bathroom humor. My guess is the 'extra' scenes involve Nadia-the-foreign exchange-student's striptease while spied on by the Internet. But other than that, there's very little nudity or simulated sex on screen. In fact, just about all the risqué stuff happens off-camera: you hear various noises, someone bursts into the room, they gasp at what they see, but YOU don't see it. A famous early scene has a guy with a boner - but it's covered with a sock. All the bedroom scenes near the end when the guys finally get lucky are also demure, as the females are all strategically covered up. Then, of course, there's the infamous 'guy-making-it-with-a-pie' scene. It's just stupid. The entire movie is rather odd. It's almost like watching a TV sit-com show which contains some gross, raunchy ideas. All the kids, especially the males, look like they fell out of a cutesy '80s TV show. They all talk and act like kids from the '60s or '50s. Sure, they're obsessed with sex, but so were kids in the '50s. Then there's the requisite toilet jokes, including the 'guy-has-to-take-a-nasty-dump' scene (in the girls' bathroom, in this case). In the end, we have a typical coming-of-age tale. I suppose when you get to be a certain age (like me), you realize this type of stuff is recycled by Hollywood every 20 years or so. They hype it quite a bit, of course, and teens & young twenty-somethings flock to it thinking it's something which has never been seen or done before. In a sense, maybe they're right. Kids today, like any day, don't believe anything valid existed more than 10 years back. Everything is NOW-NOW-NOW, with no thought to history (or film history). Ironically, it probably would have been better if everyone had forgotten that ""Porky's"" and its sequels had ever existed, but somehow or other, someone manages to dredge up the excrement of low-class material which used to elicit howls of laughter from brain-dead teens (now long gone) for the current masses.",American Pie
88,moviesleuth2,An Outrageously Funny Comedy,8,21 October 2009,"Sex by itself is not funny. Nor is anything else, for that matter. The key to comedy is appropriately setting up and executing the jokes. Fortunately, ""American Pie"" has all the requisite elements.Four best friends, Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have a problem: They are seniors approaching graduation, and they still haven't gotten laid. Their egos are hurting, but when the biggest geek, Sherman (Chris Owen) gets laid before they do, they decide enough is enough. The four make a pact: each of them will have sex before the Senior Prom.The key to this kind of comedy is pushing boundaries. ""How did they get away with this?"" will enter anyone's mind at more than a few points in the movie (the prudish MPAA notwithstanding). All the characters are curious about sex, but they don't know how to respond to it without looking like geeks. This kind of awkwardness is good mining territory for comedy, and the creators of ""American Pie"" exploit it for all it's worth. The result is a riotously funny comedy that will have even the most tightly-wound doubled over in laughter for much of the time.But what really elevates ""American Pie"" from the usual raunchfests (other than its funnier than most of what Hollywood shells out), is that we actually begin to care about the characters in the film. None of them are especially well-developed (this is an ensemble comedy), but they are likable and more importantly, surprisingly real. We recognize Jim's infatuation with the Nadia, the sexpot foreign exchange student. We understand how awkward Oz feels talking to a girl completely different from him for the first time (Mena Suvari). We empathize with both Kevin's fears and uncertainties, and those of his girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid). And strange as it may seem, we can see a bit of ourselves in Finch's refined taste.The acting is actually very good. Jason Biggs has the social awkwardness down pat, and quite frankly, no one shows complete and utter embarrassment like him. Thomas Ian Nicholas is good as Kevin, although he is rather flat in his ""big moment"" speeches. That shouldn't be entirely faulted on him though, the dialogue in these scenes isn't especially well written. Chris Klein is rather flat as Oz, the jock. He's not bad, it's just that Oz could have used a little more energy. Eddie Kaye Thomas is great as the tightly wound Finch.The girls are great too. Shannon Elizabeth is wonderful as the sexpot, especially because she knows the effect she has on Jim. Tara Reid is good as the girlfriend who wants everything to be perfect when she loses her virginity. Mena Suvari is especially good as the mature good-girl who, despite everything, falls for the jock. And Natasha Lyonne is terrific as Jessica, the sexual know-it-all who is on hand to give advice.There are three other actors that deserve mention. Eugene Levy is hilarious as Jim's Dad. The teenage years would be smooth sailing if every teenage guy's dad was Mr. Levenstein. When he finds out about his son's interest in sex, he's not horrified, he presents him with porn! Seann William Scott benefited most from his performance as the obnoxious and egotistic Stifler, who's so stupid that he doesn't realize that no one actually likes him. Jennifer Coolidge is hilarious as Stifler's Mom (more than that I will not say).If you want to really laugh (and laugh hard), ""American Pie"" is a great way to go.",American Pie
89,Peach-2,Funny.,8,27 January 2000,"American Pie will no doubt shock some people and make others laugh all night long. If you are a fan of Dumb And Dumber or Kingpin, you will definitely like this film. The film is about a group of young teenage boys trying to lose their virginity. It reminded me of the hgh school films I used to watch when I was growing up and sneaking into the living room to watch movies on cable late at night. My parents would be fast asleep in their room and my brother was too young to care, it was just me and a dirty movie about high school or a private boarding school. Those were the days. This film is very funny and full of sexual overtones, I definitely enjoyed American Pie.",American Pie

94,LoneWolfAndCub,Great Gross-Out Comedy,8,25 September 2005,"American Pie is a hilarious, raunchy comedy that will have certain people in fits.The plot is focused on a group of four friends: Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and their sexual misadventures. All four of them make a pact to have sex before college. Enter the stupidity. Jim is hopeless with women, Oz has joined the choir, Finch is a loser and Kevin's girlfriend Vicki (Tara Reid) doesn't want sex. Along the way we meet Stifler (Seann William Scott), Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), Heather (Mena Suvari), Chuck (Chris Owens) and Jessica (Natasha Lyonne).This is a great comedy but unfortunately won't appeal to everyone. This is targeted at a younger, teenage audience. The acting is pretty good for a teenage comedy and the soundtrack is great. The humour is very raunchy.

98,FilmFanInTheHouse,Breakthrough Comedy for the 21st Century,7,28 September 2007,"American Pie (1999, Dir. Paul Weitz) Jim, Oz, Finch and Kevin are four friends who make a pact that before they graduate they will all lose their virginity. The hard job now is how to reach that goal by prom night. Whilst Oz begins singing to grab attention and Kevin tries to persuade his girlfriend, Finch tries any easy route of spreading rumours and Jim fails miserably. Whether it is being caught on top of a pie or on the Internet, Jim always end up with his trusty sex advice from his father. Will they achieve their goal of getting laid by prom night? or will they learn something much different.Before 'American Pie' was released, the amount of sex comedies for teens was very small. Now, American Pie isn't just a breakthrough comedy for its many young stars, but also a breakthrough for sex comedies. The characters are so lovable and really make you feel connected to them. The casting choices were spot on. No other actors could possibly be imagined playing the characters. Everyone can relate to the characters in some way. There are some great lines in the film, especially from Eugene Levy, who is the best character of the series. There are some great gags which can look repulsive too. It's a fantastic comedy to watch, but not really the type of film to watch with parents. Only if they know what goes on in a teens life.""Tell me he did not just get out the chair."" - Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) ""He got out the chair."" - Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas)",American Pie
99,jhaggardjr,Crude but sweet sex comedy,8,2 October 2001,"I wasn't all that crazy about ""American Pie"" the first time I saw it. I missed it when it played in theaters and when I caught it on home video, it was funny, but not as funny as I thought it would be. However I watched the movie a couple of more times and it started growing on me. It got better and better with each viewing. ""American Pie"" is a movie that most people (including myself) can relate too. It's about four high school boys who make a pact: lose their virginity by senior prom. This movie was the ""There's Something About Mary"" of 1999 with it's disgusting jokes and crude humor, but ""American Pie"" is a much better film than that 1998 Cameron Diaz box office smash. Plus, in spite of it's lowbrow comedy, it has a heart. Eugene Levy (of SCTV) was the only familiar face in the cast when this first came out. The entire cast of young actors were basically unknowns, but gained popularity since the film went on to be a sleeper hit. Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Eddie Kaye Thomas play the four buddies who make that pact; Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson Hannigan, Natasha Lyonne, Tara Reid, and Mena Suvari play the girls in their lives; and Seann William Scott steals the show as Stifler, the one who knows everything about sex. But all the actors are good here. Plus, there are some big laughs throughout. The part of ""American Pie"" that I liked best was the generally sweet relationship between Chris Klein and Mena Suvari. I'd follow them two anywhere. ""American Pie"" isn't the best comedy ever made, but it's a very good one. But the thing that surprised me the most, the sequel would turn out to be even funnier.*** (out of four)",American Pie
100,AKS-6,Average film,5,1 July 2000,"The first half hour or so of ""American Pie"" is a pure waste of time, very boring, very unfunny, very desperate. In fact, the script is more desperate than the teenagers in this film. However, after thirty minutes or so, the film gets better, it's even cute at times, but I really don't know what all the fuss is about. So, teenagers talking about sex, having sex -- who cares? The funniest character is without a doubt Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) and the best line (because it was so unexpected) belongs to Alyson Hannigan's geeky character. Well, not very good, not very bad. Average. (5/10)",American Pie
101,chrisbrown6453,"After the summer of 1999, you probably won't be able to look at Mom's apple pie (or third base) in quite the same way.",8,20 July 2001,"In American Pie, the frat-boy, gross-out humor gets laughs, but not because of any especially clever writing. It gets our attention by saying things we've seldom heard on screen before. They had to outdo THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, right? One movie's hair gel puts head on another movie's beer. It's PORKY'S for the new millennium. The simple story has four high school friends with hormones raging, obsessing about sex. How to lose one's virginity before prom night, only two weeks away? Get busy, guys.
Jim, who has been interrupted by his father while putting a tube sock to new use, has few romantic prospects. Kevin seems to be better positioned as he already has a girlfriend, albeit one who's keeping her thighs wide shut. Oz is a handsome lacrosse player who decides that being sensitive will help him make the score. Finch is so uptight that he must go home to go to the bathroom, but gets the help of a co-ed in spreading rumors of his generous endowment. Will they or won't they? Therein lies the obvious rub. The girls in PIE are given more dimension than the standard for juvenile sex comedies, which is some sort of progress. The fresh cast is quite agreeable, especially Shawnn William Scott as Stiffler and Natasha Lyonne from THE SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS. Eugene Levy performs a marvelously deadpan cameo as Jim's clueless father.  Remember to keep your eyes on the flute.",American Pie
102,bat-5,Very entertaining,9,10 July 1999,"American Pie transports us all back to the much easier time of high school when all we had to worry about was getting a date for the prom, your finals and what to do after high school.  What sets this film apart from the other high school films that came out this year is the amount of time invested in the characters, especially the female characters.  The four male characters seem to think they have it all figured out, much like most of his thought we did in high school.  What we learn, as these guys do, is that life is not that simple.  We watch them make their mistakes and laugh at them because we've all done the same things.  We say the wrong things, make the wrong choices, but it helps us grow.  In the course of this film, the four characters grow as people.  Jim learns of what it feels like to be used, Oz transcends the role of typical jock and becomes something better.  Kevin learns that there is more to a relationship than sex, and Finch, well Finch appreciates the finer things in life.  The only one who really doesn't grow is Stiffler, only because he provides the role of jerk, and he does it well. The female characters are all smart, and they are more than pretty faces. Like their male counterparts, they think they have things figured out, and for the most part, they do.  The one who really stands out is band geek Michelle, played with scene stealing gusto by Alyson Hannigan.  All of her conversations start out with ""At band camp..."" and continue on from there. But, she's a lot smarter than she lets on and in a great scene we see just how clever this girl really is.

104,Flagrant-Baronessa,Men need sex to feel loved. Women need love to have sex. Where do you even begin?,8,29 October 2006,"American Pie was a gruesome experience for me because the first time I watched it was with my best friend's older brother and father. Yeah, just us three. I was thirteen years old and a little part of me died as the brazen jokes kept piling up and culminating in grossness, upon which the father shifted awkwardly in his seat. With hindsight it was absolutely worth every minute of agony, because the film is such a powerful staple on the raunchy teen comedy wall of fame today and surely one of the most laugh-out-loud worthy films in my DVD collection (which isn't saying much since I have a total of like 20 films but still).Its premise and execution both bluntly rehash Porky's but it also updates and modernizes its humour, settings and characters. Both Porky's and American Pie will be extremely dated (the former already is) but undoubtedly that will only contribute to the glossy contemporary feel of the films. They both zoom in on a group of brazen  but ordinary  teenage boys in the last year of high school and unflinchingly follow them as they enter a quest to lose their virginity before graduation, whatever means necessary. American Pie boasts of a quintet of absolutely hilarious guys who take on the mission but botch their way through dates and sexual encounters with fumbling ineptness. What is especially refreshing about the aforementioned is that these guys have no 'assigned quirks' to get the message across but only different personalities. In other words, they are playing it totally straight and the comedy therefore stems from the situations.Sure 'American Pie' is not devoid of faults. Not by a long shot. It actively perpetuates stereotypes of the jock, the goody-goody two-shoes choir girl, the pimple-faced nerd, the Latin freak and the band camp geek. Far worse is that it presupposes that all girls are emotional predators of sorts, only after a heartfelt 'I love you' and conversely that are guys are horny beasts. Certainly there is a great deal of truth to both stereotypes but come on now  it's plain lazy comedy to ride on these clichés. Luckily American Pie has far more weapons to offer from its arsenal of comedy. How can you not enjoy a film that gave birth to the comic genius that is Eugene Levy, the fantastic Jennifer Coolidge as a Mrs. Robinsonesque older woman and coined the expression 'MILF'? The answer is, you can't. It's crude, dirty, gross, too far  and we love it.8 out of 10",American Pie

Although there are too many to count now and a million different Stiflers you still think back to the first pie movie. It really lead the plot through the sequels and spin-offs. If I ever catch this one on TV I will turn to it right away because it is truly a great teenage sex comedy. The two sequels to follow were not as great as this because it is the piece of pie that sliced it open for the others to follow through. I enjoyed this movie a lot and recommend seeing this before any of the other knock offs or sequels. Jason Biggs really pulls through as the nerdy high school guy that is just trying to get a little action. So if you haven't already seen this then see it sometime soon.,American Pie

This film is by far the most open-minded film on sex ever made in the US.Sex in movies instilled moral panic in Sweden in the 50's, and I must say that the nudity in this one is about as lame as any Swedish film from that era. The talk isn't much more revolutionary.I laughed my ass off at this movie. It was funny, heart-felt and is probably a lot more akin to the truth about what's going on inside a high-school guy's head.What bothers me most is that people tend to think this film actually wants kids to go on and do it, the quicker the better - don't you get it! It's irony: I-r-o-n-y, look it up. With that kind of understanding of movies, one could as well say that every movie about concentration camps tells us to commit large-scale murder.

108,Ddey65,What old teen movie does this REALLY remind you of?(Possible Spoilers),7,20 May 2000,"A lot of people, especially IMDb users have been comparing this movie to ""Porky's."" I say it's more like another teen movie made in the same year, specifically ""The Last American Virgin(1981),"" albeit with a much happier ending. For example, all four friends succeded at their goal of losing their virginity by/on prom night, two of which with someone they truly loved. Nobody got their girlfriends pregnant, accused them of being whores, or took them to the abortion mills. The 1950's neo-greaser attitudes towards sex is missing here, and that suits me just fine. Alyson Hanigan is not as annoying as some might believe, playing the role of Michelle(..named after ""Meyrink,"" perhaps?), the nerdy-flutist, who's only life outside of school is at band camp. What a pity, until you find out what else she does with her flute in her spare time. I was as 'antsy' as she was, after hearing that line, even though I should've seen it coming.

112,ExpendableMan,"Believe it or not, an intelligent look at teenage life",8,5 November 2006,"""Everyone remembers their first piece of pie"" says the tag-line to this movie and bar a few folks who have suffered severe amnesia, or were so drunk the only reason they knew they'd done the deed was through contracting thrush, it's a fair point to make. Everybody does remember losing their virginity and while a movie that focuses on four teenage lads dunder-headed attempts to do just that before graduation rolls around might seem crass, this isn't so much a movie about semen jokes as it is about being a teenager, a sentiment I'm sure we can all relate to in some way.The storyline is simple, Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) are sick to the back teeth of being sexually frustrated and make a pact to help each other like, make it with a girl dude by the time the end of school arrives - a standard racing the clock scenario that everyone who found themselves four months from University and still a virgin can surely relate to. Along the way they make a number of misguided attempts to achieve this which usually result in the luckless Jim suffering severe humiliation.Thus far, so very cretinous, but this is no Van Wilder: Party Liason by any stretch of the imagination. These four guys are not cardboard caricatures whose basic purpose is to serve up fodder for a string of smutty jokes, they are genuinely endearing. Jim especially is a lovable, bumbling clown that recalls the nervous, jittery idiot that all of us once were when first confronted by bare female flesh. Oz is a bit of a weak link as his story is somewhat clunky, but the rest of the lads are just as appealing and Kevin's rather sweet relationship with his girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid before she set about destroying her reputation) is handled beautifully.Backing all this up is an equally strong cast of supporting characters. The girls that form the object of the boys lust are treated with similar dignity, rather than just being another line of bimbos on their way to exposing their breasts in a shower a la Porky's. Alyson Hannigan as the ""not as geeky as she first appears"" Michelle is hilarious, Sean William-Scott is a loud mouthed but ultimately rather charismatic oaf that everyone remembers, but Eugene Levy is the one who shines brightest. As Jim's good natured dad, he shows that parents trying to give their kids a nudge in the right direction can be just as witless as their offspring and he steals every scene he's in and pretty much the whole movie along with them.Sure, this may make it sound like American Pie is too clever-clever for its own good, but don't worry, there are plenty of bodily fluid jokes to keep the laughs coming, including one brilliant moment where a series of mishaps leads to Jim dancing naked on the Internet that had me clutching my sides in pain from laughing too much. This is still a gross out comedy, but it is a gross out comedy that has genuine humanity behind it and if you're in the right frame of mind, is the sort of film that evokes a real sentimentality for the time when raging hormones and adolescent naivety were an everyday part of life.",American Pie

The story follows a Young group of high schoolers four friends who decide they will lose their virginity by end of graduation. I grew up with this Pie I bought this movie on VHS when I was freshman in high school the beginning of the school year and this movie really surprised me. One of my class mates said we should all watch ""American Pie"" in school so I bought this film and I am glad I did, I still have the VHS at home. To me this is the best in the series the original the only one ""American Pie"". This is my second favorite movie in the franchise American Reunion to me is the best one favorite to me.By the time i did not know any of the cast: Jason Biggs , Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Tara Reid, Shannon Elizabeth, Mena Suvari, Seann William Scott, Natasha Lyonne, Eugene Levy, Chris Owen and Jennifer Coolidge. I did know Alyson Hannigan as Willow from Buffy, The Vampire Slayer. None of the cast I know before.The movie talks about friendship, loyality, sexy, how to listen to girls and catch one. I laughed when Jim has full missionary sex with a freshly-baked apple pie left on the table. I laughed when Stiffler spikes Finch's mochaccino with laxatives, and promptly dupes him into using the girls' restroom, where Finch suffers explosive diarrhea in the presence of several senior girls. That was funny. I absolutelly love Czechoslovakian exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) in Jim's bedroom and Jim has a striptease going on. I love Shannon Elizabeth to death in this movie. The song Mutt plays by Blink 182 when Jim runs to Kevin and Finch when he put Nadia on webcam. The same song was played on the end of the credits Tomcats (2001) in which sexy beautiful Shannon Elizabeth was the main star one of my favorite comedy's.Jim Levenstein is my favorite character because he remind me on me. Too bad that sequels ruined this movie. The first one and the reunion in my opinion are the best one to watch. The first movie is really short only 1hr and 35 mins. awesome. Fantastic direction by Paul Weitz the acting from everyone is top noch. It is Rated - R. I disagree with haters who are saying is boring, it is not boring, it fast paced. The pacing is fast and goes fast around. This movie shows how high school was, to me high school was an awesome place which I never had problems, now in real world you have responsibility and your everything for your self. I am proud that I graduate from high school and that I make my driving licence. The movie is not bad and I like jokes. It is been 20 years since this movie come from Universal Pictures so it is 20 year anniversary and it is awesome. The cast reunited for their reunion and they talk about this movie, the clips are on YouTube.I love the finale in which Jim dancens with Nadia infront of camera I miss and I love that and I love that Jim's dad is dancing. I love, love this movie. Sccrew haters. I love the song Mutt played by Blink 182. And I love the cast: Jason Biggs , Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Tara Reid, Shannon Elizabeth, Mena Suvari, Seann William Scott, Natasha Lyonne, Eugene Levy and Chris Owen. I don't like Alyson Hannigan been geek in this movie but that's about it. I love this movie to death and Tara Reid is awesome as an actress and as a girl who is in love with Kevin who can not say two words ""I Love You"".I recommend this film to anyone who likes teen comedy's this one is for you, Don't listen to haters.",American Pie
115,galileo3,A surprisingly original and occasionally thoughtful teen 'epic',7,30 January 2008,"American Pie (1999)Rated R for crude sexual humour, nudity, language and sex referencesWhen watching such films, I tend to be critical and highly scrutinising, however, 'American Pie' is sort of a surprise. This is quite a good film and does have traces of originality and quality.While 'American Pie' includes your usually crude humour, pervasive sexual references and considerable nudity, it does stop and think at times, something that is extremely rare amongst films of this kind.There are some scenes of gross-out humour that will guarantee, what I like to call a 'laughing spree'. What makes 'American Pie' stand out from other dull, unfocused teenage movies, is that, apart from being extremely funny, cleverly written and having a well-suited cast, is the fact that it does show friendships, thoughts, differences in teenagers, without just being focused on meaningless nudity and sex all the time.This is a film for pure enjoyment and humour, a film that clearly demonstrates the thoughts of the average teenager, along with comedy, nudity and some American Pie.7/10",American Pie
116,SMLA11,Hilarious,10,20 May 2002,"American Pie is an absolute hilarious film.  chris Klein, Jason Biggs, Eddie kaye Thomas, and Thomas Ian Nicholas all make a pact to lose their virginity before graduation.  This is a very creative plot.  I have to say that the best scene is Nadia's ""changing session"" and more.  It made me very VERY happy.  All of the jokes are mainly sexually crude but very funny.   The only odd thing about this is why nobody in a sexual situation ever locks the door for a little privacy.  Tara Reid and Thomas Ian Nicholas never locked there door when they decided to cramp his tongue.  Shannon Elizabeth didn't lock her door when getting dressed.  Eddie Kaye Thomas and a mystery character didn't lock their door.Overall I loved this movie and I was surprised at the outcome of this. Rating 10 out of 10.",American Pie
117,Gubby-Allen,Pretty good,7,9 December 2001,"I scored this film 7 / 10 & am quite chuffed to see it's overall rating is 7.0. Thus, I must be fairly representative of the audience on this one.I'll start however, with the one and only real criticism I had of this film. It was about as funny as a road accident. It was entertaining, easily to follow, had likeable characters, a surprisingly good storyline, but to describe it as a comedy must contravene every trade description law in the book.To hear people rave about how hilarious this film was, you'd think it was Airplane or Naked Gun. It's not in that league, at least insofar as a comedy film. It could be another classic example of the American / Australian idea of comedy being completely different to Europe's & vice versa, as I watched this, though thoroughly enjoying it, completely straight faced throughout. Much in the same way, many Brits do with 'Cheers'. Extremely good lighthearted entertainment, but not particularly amusing.I must also have watched an edited version as I cannot believe the emphasis people place on the character Stifler. Apart from the incident in the toilet, I recall very little else of him. He wasn't part of the pact after all.Other than that though, it was good. I tend to avoid films with the first word 'American' like I avoid warts, as I do with so called sex comedies, given the amount of crap that come out of England in the 70's, in this genre, so this film was a recipe for diaster with me, but I really did enjoy it.I anticipated a shagfest of pre pubescent teens making crude jokes, (especially given the pathetic knob in apple pie scene played to death in the trailers), and a glamourising of teenage sex, to make it seem like the be all & end all of every teenagers life, when most will tell you it isn't & that they do have other interests. But it wasn't really that at all, infact, for large parts the tone was to the contrary, I'm sure it conveyed some positive messages.So for mild light hearted entertainment, I'd certainly recommend this. It's good fun, but not in the 'ha ha' sense.But one thing, please, all in the US & Hollywood. Can this be the last film or song that you export, even just for a year, where the whole story revolves around 'Prom Night'? We've had enough of them for a while. Nobody else has Prom Nights. Us in England have never been to one, and don't really have any idea what they are. We don't export films about fat northern compere's in stringed vests & strippers on stage in Working Mens Clubs.",American Pie

And I'm gonna be honest, I went to this movie not expecting much, after all, is a 95 minutes long teen comedy that's already 21 years old. But man, it's still pretty good!In the end, I think is fair to call it a ""classic"" of R rated teen comedies, since it inspired a bunch of other movies all throughout the 2000's. And it's well deserved, some few jokes didn't age that well, but it's probably one or two moments. But overall, the movie is pretty funny! At first, I didn't exactly like the characters, but after 20/30 minutes you kind get behind most of them, I think Kevin might be the only one I didn't exactly was rooting for. Oz has some kind of an arc, which is cool, and the scenes of Jim with his dad are just pure gold. Eugene Levy destroys here, and steals the show.Of course, some parts of it probably wouldn't get made today (like the whole sequence broadcasting the girl in Jim's room). I think that it doesn't have to take the movie's credit of been funny. You have to always stay open minded to judge how something used to be done, and see why it was wrong and how we can improve moving forward. I just think that when you analyze a movie you should always try to consider the it was made, and the circumstances around it. If you think about it, she was masturbating in a strange's house, so, well, she wasn't that less of a creepie.Anyways, at the end, is a movie with sex jokes, about some dudes getting laid, but is also a bit about friendship which I thought was cool. 99% of people that watch it, are probably gonna want to laugh and not think about anything else, and for that, this movie is perfect, is 21 years old, but still so funny. As we would say here in brazil, is a ""besteirol"" classic.Obs: Just wanna point out some of my favorite specific moments: Man, the pie scene! Lol, that's probably my favorite interaction of him and his dad (that and the ""I want you to be careful when you put... the croissant""); Stifler's mom saying ""I have an aged 18 whisky... just how I like it"" is just pure gold; The whole storyline which Finch and the rumors are great too.",American Pie

Okay, now that we understand the movie isn't exactly grounded in reality, it is actually pretty funny in quite a few spots. Yes, the humor tends towards the raunchy, and one won't need a discussion group after, yet the performances are rather endearing and earnest.

AMERICAN PIE is different, it's not a movie like AUSTIN or SOUTH that relies on it's gross humor to save the muddle script.  No, instead the gross humor is a medium for a decent script that winds up working well, very well! The plot is about four high-school seniors (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, & Eddie Kaye Thomas) who make a pact, that they are to lose thier virginity by the time they graduate.  The idel time to ""score"" is on prom night, so all four guys are working and preparing for prom night.  Oz (Chris Klein), a jock, joins the jazz choir to impress another choir member, Heather (Mena Suvari) and to show that he too can be a sensitive guy. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) wants to give his current girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) the perfect moment while having sex. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), is acting very smooth and charming, trying to impress the entire senior female class with his outrageous rumors. And then there's poor Jim (Jason Biggs) a young man who is at his sexual peak, and has a crush on the foreign exchage student named Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). From there on is a rollercoaster with the same equivalent as a Six Flags rollercoaster, of non-stop laughs and gross out jokes.  How would I compare this to other comedies as thrill rides?  AUSTIN POWERS 2 and SOUTH PARK are the scary ""kiddie"" rollercoasters.   BIG DADDY is the wild, but not scary of the rollercoasters, like a medium thrill.  ANALYZE THIS and AMERICAN PIE are the monster coasters of laughs.  The ones that people wait 3 hours in line, freak out while on the ride, and want more!  Well, that is what you get after seeing AMERICAN PIE, you want more! These young actors are all going to be famous, the same way AMERICAN GRAFFITI, FAST TIMES, & DAZED & CONFUSED made most of thier stars big.  I'm sure 15 years from now, their will be a collector's edition similar to GRAFFITTI and FAST TIMES.  This is the FAST TIMES for the 90's teens, but it also appeals to the 20 something crowd, like me.  I really did enjoy seeing Chris Klein play the same type of person he played in ELECTION.  Jason Biggs was very funny as the unfortunate Jim, who is unlucky most of the time.  Tara Reid and Mena Suvari are both very good as the girls who are wondering if they are making the right decision.  But the two I thought stand-out are Shannon Elizabeth and Eddie Kaye Thomas.  Elizabeth is GORGEOUS, she will get tons of iternet hits by the end of the summer.  And Thomas is both very smooth and calm, he's very similar to a calm David Schwimmer. People are calling this the PORKYS of the summer.  It isn't PORKYS was very silly, immature, and cruel.  The guys were sex-hungry idiots, and the girls were brainless sex objects.  I would rank this film with the better comedy of 1982, FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH.  Like FAST TIMES, it's full of laughs, and it has heart.  PORKYS didn't have any heart, just cruel jokes. AMERICAN PIE will tickle the young adults funny bones the same way ANALYZE THIS tickled the adults and seniors funny bones. But this film isn't for those only under 30, I'm sure that older people will enjoy this film the same way they enjoyed THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.  Will the pre-teens will try to sneek into SOUTH PARK or go watch AUSTIN POWERS 2.  The real men and women will be watching AMERICAN PIE, and lovin' it.  Just like I did. ***** (out of *****)",American Pie

Director: Paul Weitz
Starring: Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Alyson Hannigan, Tara Reid and Eugene LevyI see teenage sex comedies haven't changed. Same idea, same premise. There is however, a reason why this one was a cultural phenomenon. It is however, the film that popularized the term MILF. But, enough of that! This is an interesting exploration of hormones, out of control and the insanity that envelopes a man leading up to the first time. Enjoyable songs are used in the soundtrack. It has some gems too. Jim, our main character, along with his friends, makes a deal to be ""de-virginized"" in time for the senior prom. Jim is portrayed quite well by Jason Biggs. I thought Jim's parents were pretty reasonable people for what he put them through. And, as his father, doing an amazing job, Eugene Levy. The story is silly though and the pie thing is ridiculous too. Still a modern classic.",American Pie

124,RhapsodyReviews,Funny Teen Sex Comedy.,8,10 November 2019,"Review:
'American Pie' is a comedy film directed by Paul and Chris Weitz. It is the first film in the 'American Pie' series.
I was surprised to see the amount of negative reaction to this movie. I remember the first time I saw it and laughed almost the whole way through. The only problem that I had was that I couldn't accept the cast as being an average age of around 17.
The performances were really great for a comedy of the 1990's. Jason Biggs stands out amongst all of them, with his dorky and desperate persona. He blends funny dialog with very funny physical comedy. Also, Alyson Hannigan who has a small but funny role is also great and she says the best line in the movie. Let's talk about Eugene Levi for a second, holy cow what a funny man this guy is. He is so natural as the over sharing father who just makes everybody either uncomfortable or laughing out loud.
What can I say about this movie besides that It's a comedic classic! American Pie perfectly blends a buddy comedy, extreme gross-out humor, and dare I say a coming of age movie. It's one of those movies that is easy to predict when something bad will happen, but that's what made me laugh so hard. Some of the comedic moments are very offensive and this movie could not be made today.
Overall, this movie is a crazy, outrageous, amazingly funny comedy. I recommend it to anybody who isn't easily offended and has a great sense of humor!

125,ryan_kuhn,Warm Apple Pie...,7,13 February 2005,"The end of high school is an awkward time. Some people don't know how to handle relationships into college, some people are just trying to get into college, but the most important thing to take care of is to of course have sex before you leave high school. Sooooooo important, well, at least according to American Pie, the surprise hit of 1999 that is funny, even if it's priorities are in the wrong place. I guess we do have to give the movie credit, it does feature high schoolers who are still virgins, something that few movies still acknowledge. Jason Biggs plays Jim, a confused teenager who does not quite play the whole social scene perfectly, but is an overall nice guy. His friends are Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thoman Ian Nicholas), and Paul (Eddie Kaye Thomas), with a passing acquaintance with Stifler (Seann William Scott, in the role that made him). Stifler is that jock in high school that it was an honor to have him know your name. As prom day approaches, the stresses of the senior days of high school get to all of the friends and the comedy takes off from there. The movie does have a fresh look at how teens today deal with life, and does have crude comedy that is unthinkable, but you know what, I'm sure somewhere it happened to someone. Eugene Levy plays the father in a perfect role for him, he covers the uncomfortable parts of raising a growing boy well. American Pie is a funny movie about 4 boys trying to have sex, and if that sounds like entertainment to you, go see it already!",American Pie

His good looks don't get him anywhere.The way the Internet is used almost as another character really brings this film into the 90's.  The humour is broad, unsubtle and always over the top but funny nonetheless.",American Pie
129,Mike-DD,Hilarious,8,21 August 2000,"Even without referring to the 'pie' incident, this is one hilarious movie. Somehow, the acting and antics of the actors and actresses manage to convince me that they are 16 and not in their 20's. Though I couldn't remember doing all those things in the movie just to get sex, I can imagine what 'desperate' teenagers would do to get it. Some of the ways they thought of weren't available at my time (eg, web cam), but I was sure hoping they'd succeed. :) While you won't call this a great movie - it is after all a teen flick appealing to hormonal teenagers - it is still a great movie to watch and enjoy, especially, I guess, if you are a young couple.",American Pie
130,CMTiago,The first slice,9,12 July 2014,"Ah the first time. In 1999, American Pie joined an elite club of teen comedies that would forever be remembered as classics in the genre. Not since Porky's, had a movie been as more outrageous as American Pie, and the fact is that the late 90's generation had a movie to sort of label them, but not in a negative way.The story follows a group of four teenage boys (Jim, Kevin, Oz and Finch), who pledge to lose their virginity, but things aren't as easy as they might seem. Jim is a bumbling buffoon who gets embarrassed talking to girls and listening to his father's awkward sexual advice. Kevin is dating Vicki, but has trouble balancing his feelings for her and his desire to have sex with her. Oz, after a college girl rejects him and gives him pointers, is looking to bring his sensitive side and ends up falling for Heather. And Finch finds a way to spread rumors about himself in school, but things don't turn out the way he planned.In all of these individuals, the raunchy, hilarious and sometimes even sexy situations will make you fall on the floor with laughter. However what I also love about this movies is that the characters evolve and actually face teen, and later adult, complications. As for this movie, it is my second favorite of the 4 movies, as American Pie 2 is my favorite. Still this first slice of pie, will always have a special taste for me. Rating 9,5/10",American Pie

Oh what the hell, I'll give this American Pie a go.About 4 teens trying to get laid and the hilarious antics they get up it to, culminating into some kind of growing up by the end, it was surprisingly funny, actually really funny.  It was a nice way that an old idea was brought up-to-date using the tools of the nineties.

Mostly, the stories are pretty similar, but somehow this genre has a certain appeal to me. Maybe because I never did something crazy in my teens? Who knows.Anyway, American Pie is really a good movie, a splendid proof that the teenie movie genre is not dead but alive and kicking, and that to portray teenagers in a entertaining way, you don't have to kill them all off (Scream, I know what you did last summer) or let them talk like old men and women (Dawsons Creek) - you simply have to let them act like what they are: Young people looking for the right way to do things, searching for their identity and - off course the focus of this movie - for their sexuality.
While the story is certainly not all new, the way in which it is shown is really hilarious. There are some extremely well placed very crude, but all the more funny jokes, and the characters are simply likeable in their desperate attempts to loose their virginity. Highlights like the ""rendez-vous"" with Nadja or the blow-job scene with the not so politically correct disposal of the seminal fluid are simply too funny to resist.All in all an extremely well done teenager comedy which I recommend to every one who has stayed young at heart.

The various duplicates Hollywood managed to fart out in it's wake - some pretty good (Orange County) most excremental (Van Wilder) - might force even the most easily tickled specimen to rethink American Pie's worth. I can safely assume most of them would still think it one of the best gross-out comedies ever. It it probably always will be that sub-genre's Citizen Kane.Whereas the likes of Animal House and Fast Times At Ridgemount High were more of an amusing observation of various deadbeats and juveniles, American Pie manages to find heart in it's characters. I still love John Belushi's impression of a zit, don't get me wrong. But I think American Pie's compassion is what gives the cake it's icing - that and Eugene Levy (I wish he was my dad :D). Jim (Jason Biggs)'s attempted conquest of foreign exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) is certainly cringe-worthy but never crass. We like Jim. We want him to succeed. He's definitely somewhat of a dumbo, but not a complete fool. And for once the female characters have a healthy balance of sexual attitude, which in the past was mostly about guys trying to catch them changing.Don't get it twisted. This is a rude and crude comedy, with some great gags and a few stock characters that we didn't need. Some of the films worst moments involve Chris ""make a table out of me now"" Klein attempting to shed his jock image to reveal his sensitive side, which apparently involves joining the choir and then singing and dancing in the male showers. For all the gross gags in the film, this was certainly the most vomit-inducing. But apart from that there isn't much to complain about.Easily offended? Probably not for you.

Although I'll admit the flute comment had me rolling on the floor for a good twenty minutes, and Eugene Levy is wonderful.  And the webcam scene is so sexist, but still pretty hysterical.  But its portrayal of horny teens and the loss of virginity has none of the dark, ultra-realistic complexity of Fast Times, which proves this subject matter can be both funny and honest.

But if you can't get enough movies about hetero teenage kids agonizing over having sex for the first time, you may just love it through and through.  It's silly, and not original, but if you just want to waste some time watching some cute kids, go for it.",American Pie
149,lingmeister,Porky's for this generation,6,16 June 2002,"Seeing American Pie reminded me of Porky's, which spoke to the group of people who were sex obsessed, desperate to get some, but could never get any.  Much of the movie is getting caught in embarrassing situations in which many of us had experienced but never caught, where those what ifs were always in the back of our minds.  The movie also had its tender moments unlike the typical sex starved teen movies, with the aspect of love, the right person, waiting for the right time themes thrown in.",American Pie

I think this movie accurately portrays a teenager's struggling life and the situations that occur.  All of the characters in this movie are funny, and likeable. The pie scene wasn't too explicit, but the implications were there.  The DVD contains tons of extra so if you like this movie I'd highly recommend it. However, subject matter in this movie isn't exceptable for young kids, but I think 14 and 15 year olds can handle it.",American Pie

154,Jaime N. Christley,Astoundingly good-natured sex comedy,7,14 July 1999,"The director and the writer, Paul Weitz and Adam Herz respectively, will do anything for a laugh -- that's good, as it turns out, because this movie has a great many laughs in it.  There's not much of that restricting, suffocating ""logic"" stuff around, but ""American Pie"" is immensely enjoyable. I mean, almost none of the things that happen in this film would ever, ever come to pass in real life, but it doesn't matter.For starters, the characters aren't all one-dimensional.  Thankfully, they're two-dimensional, so right away it has an edge on 60-70% of all the movies ever made.Moreover, it's heart is in the right place.  Most high school movies these days are all about cruelty and malice, especially towards (and among) the women.  Not the case here.  This is the first conventional high school movie I've ever seen that made me smile so much (I say conventional because ""Rushmore"" still trumps every one of them).Furthermore, it's very funny.  I wouldn't dare give away any of the really great gags (we've all seen the trailer -- that's not the one I mean), but I'll say this:  Weitz and Herz are extraordinarily skilled in audience manipulation, which is to say that they know how and when to spring unexpected surprises upon us.  They also know how to use foul language for punch, rather than punctuation.The soundtrack is another positive.  It's all about joy and high energy -- even music from Third Eye Blind and Barenaked Ladies that suffers from radio overplay fits the mood appropriately.",American Pie
155,Chuck-149,The best pie ever made.,10,9 January 2000,"I know what most adults are thinking when somebody talks to them about ""American pie"".  They believe it's some stupid comedy only about young kids who want to have sex before graduating.  Well, that's not what it is about. Indeed, there is much more to the movie than just four kids wanting to have sex.  There is a story of relationships between friends as well as a big sports theme (lacrosse particularly).  This is not only crude humor, it isn't slap-stick all the time.  It has some very intelligent moments.  The movie begins with a strong beginning.  Jim (Jason Biggs) is jacking off in his room as he is watching an illegal channel when suddenly, without any warning, his mother comes in.  This scene gives you a pretty good impression of just how much you will probably laughing through the movie. We then move on to Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who already has a girlfriend, Vickie (Tara Reid), but have been at the same level of their relationship for quite some time now.  There is also Chris (Chris Klein) who is a Lacrosse player and is too insensitive to maintain any relationship with a girl.  And finally, there is Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) who is the fourth friend and doesn't try to hook up with girls that much.  But when the four guys make a pact to get laid before they graduate, they all become enthusiastic.
  First time-directors Chris and Paul Weitz do a great job with ""American pie"".  They seem to remember pretty well what their high-school graduation must have been like because the prom scene seems to be recreated in the exact same way it was for them.  They also seemed to know exactly when to cut the comic scenes perfectly so that they don't put too much and turn their jokes into stupid jokes.  Also to be mentioned as supporting actors are Sean W. Scott as Stifler, Natasha Lyonne as Jessica and Eugene Levy as Jim's dad.  It's a great movie with great humor and I highly recommend it.",American Pie
156,GuyCC,A teen comedy that's worth its weight in pie.,8,10 August 1999,"After all of the hype generated about this is a ""must see"" movie, I finally decided to see what this movie was all about once the hype died down a little.Boy, I'm glad I did.This movie isn't as ""disgusting"" as a lot of people would have you believe. Sure, there's the opening scene, and the gut-wrenchingly funny pie scene (I knew about this, but it just doesn't compare to actually seeing this), the disgusting beer scene, and a brief nude scene, but there's a lot more to the movie than that.  A lot more.The story of four guys trying to lose their virginity before the end of high school is one that anyone who is currently in high school or has been in high school this past few decades can relate to.  Sex for each of the guys means a different thing, and their individual ""quests"" to reach their goal are funny, could very possibly happen, and change each of the guys into something more than just a bunch of sex-starved hornballs.  The tables really start to turn when a few of the guys actually start caring about their would-be conquests and other things.I grew to really like these actors and actresses as they play their roles well, and as they grow in personality past their ""pact"".  They're typical high school kids, like it or not.Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad is hilarious with his dead-pan delivery and his never-ending attempts to help Jim through his current er, ""phase"".
Fortunately, the laughs go past just physical slap-stick humor.  The one-liners are more often than not hilarious.This movie more than reminded me of those classic '80's teen films, blending a great mix of goofiness and the awkwardness that age.  No, I don't think it's like ""There's Something About Mary"".  ""Mary"" was a movie that was funny just for the sake of being so.  ""Pie"", while having its hilarious gross-out moments, also had its fair share of sincere ones.  I liked the kids because they came off as actual people instead of one-joke cardboard teen stock.I recommend American Pie to anyone who has liked a good John Hughes '80's film or who just wants to see a movie that has likeable characters and is really funny.  American Pie has just become one of my new favorites.",American Pie
157,darkwizard404,Still funny after all these years...,10,23 August 2021,I was in my final year of high school when a friend recommended me this movie. I don't remember the last time I laughed so hard during a movie. The comedy was on point and the characters were very well written.Acting wise all the actors were amazing. Especially the five main characters. Stifler's comic timing was perfect and I'm sure every group of friends has a wacko like him in it. All five of them are of different nature and personality but they just click because of their similar situation.The bonding between the five friends is the highlight of this movie. That's what really hit me. I also have my own group of friends and we all relate to this film and the situation the five guys find themselves in throughout the movie.Even after all these years the movie is still funny and the jokes never get old. It's a classic 90's comedy film.,American Pie

I dont know what you adults would think though,it does have some pretty silly and disturbing scenes....But otherwise,to me,this was a hilarious crude comedy,basically about 4 dudes that really wanna score,before graduation. It starts of with a funny scene,and the acting is very acceptable,but was blatant at times by some of the cast. The love relationships were fairly unrealistic,and biased.Now,its not as easy as it sounds,this has more crude that sex scenes....now,you either find it hilarious,laughable or totally stupid thats up to you to decide.The script was pretty well developed,and had some scenes,which left you crying for more.To me,the bad point was how the film developed towards the end,it slowly begins to go downhill from there,but luckily it ends before they actually ruin anything.Well....For the sex scenes themselves,were highly un-erotic,but not stupid,and the 4 dudes really do remind you of your friends!Is it worth the rent??Certainly??But i recommend that if your,what?Over 25 NOT to watch it unless your really hip and cool cause you WILL understand it,but find it disgusting,and laugh is disgust basically...Is it a film you can watch over and over again? CERTAINLY.....This film is very addictive,and no matter how many times you've seen it,you want to invite your friends over and watch it again.!Rating of 10? Well,it might just not be a blockbuster..!

163,henrymadman,I Love This Film !!!,10,28 September 2007,"Here Are Some Facts...American Pie is a 1999 teen comedy film directed by Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz and written by Adam Herz. This was the first film directed by the Weitz brothers. The movie is centred on four boys who make a pact to lose their virginity by their high school graduation, and their subsequent adventures. The title refers to a scene in the film in which the lead character is caught having sex with a pieearlier he was told that ""third base"" feels ""like warm apple pie"". It was a box-office hit and spawned two direct sequels: American Pie 2 in 2001, American Wedding in 2003. Singer Don McLean was credited for allowing the name of his hit song to be used as the title.This film ranked number 49 on Bravo's ""100 Funniest Movies"", and ranked number 32 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the 50 Best High School Movies. In 2000, readers of Total Film magazine voted American Pie the 6th greatest comedy film of all time.Since the conclusion of the American Pie trilogy, featuring the courtship and marriage of Jim Levenstein and Michelle Flaherty, the American Pie name has gone on to be used as an entity similar to National Lampoon. The American Pie entity has spawned three spin-off films: American Pie Presents: Band Camp, which was a direct to video release in 2005, and American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile was released on DVD in December 2006. The next film, American Pie Presents: Beta House will be released in 2007.",American Pie

Of course, it is a carbon copy of Porky's, but nonetheless, it was still hilarious.  It just mainly deals with teenage boys and their ""quest"" for sex.  That is all it is, and all it was ever billed to be.  And it goes over great.  I admit, I was not too excited about renting this, but now I am glad that I did.  If you don't like raunchy stories about teenagers, and if you didn't like Porky's or Fast Times at Ridgemont High, don't rent it. Otherwise, if you had half a life in high school, and remember the things that you got in to, rent it and laugh your *ss off.",American Pie

You'll laugh yourself silly, but you'll feel a little guilty thinking that you laughed at such infantile adolescent jokes. In ""American Pie"", Paul Weitz has directed  a group of likeable young actors portraying  seniors in high school. They are in pursuit of the ""Holy Grail"", losing their virginity by the night of the Senior Prom. Yes, that's it. You can predict the rest of it after the first five minutes. The masturbation jokes are there. You'll laugh at them. Not that there's anything wrong with that. The embarrassing teenage pranks involving sex and bodily functions are as ridiculous as ever, just a little more over the line than you've seen before.

The pie scene is a classic scene in my mind. It also is in the line of movies like There's Something About Mary (though not quite as funny as that movie) that go for both shock value and comedy and work well. I give it a 7 out of 10.

This movie brought back memories of my days of high school romping. Every 5 years a movie like this needs to come out so people can remember what high, school, love, and sex was like when we were young.

I mean, talk about a cringe moment! I have already endured the ""accidental drinking of the beer with the used condom in it"" scene followed by the barfing over the girl scene, but I have hit my limit. This movie is going back into its case and back to the video store with the rest unwatched. I mean, it's not like I'm some kind of prude when it comes to my viewing habits. I loved ""Married ...

This movie has captured the soul of my youth; I loved it as a teen and I loved it even more as an adult.This movie is an absolute must see and if you haven't seen it yet, this is going to be an informative yet spoiler-free review from a fan's perspective.The atmosphere, the hilarious one-liners, the appealing conflict, its strong character development, the witty writing, the inspiring directing of it all, the ideal cast who played believable characters (except for Vicky & Heather, who are both one-dimensional, but the rest did an amazing job), these are the strengths that I hold dear to my heart.Our story revolves around the raunchy misadventures of four horny friends that are on the quest to get laid. Will they succeed? What tactics will they use to get the women of their choice in bed? What are their strengths and weaknesses? When is the deadline for getting laid? Which guy gets which girl? All of these questions will be answered once you sit down to watch this movie, after reading this.Every time I watch it, I wish my high school life was as spectacular as it's portrayed. The diverse characters enhance the experience of watching it. Of course, everybody knew a Stifler and the male audience can relate to Jim, our protagonist, and his struggles throughout his journey.I hope this review was helpful and if I could rate it higher than a 10/10 (10 out of 10), I would.

I've just caught it on DVD, expecting to detest it,but to my amazement, it left me smiling.American Pie is primarily a morality tale, with the message that goodthings (eventually) happen to good people.  This is not at all what Iexpected.  People who were scandalised by American Pie should reallytake a look at the similarly themed classic Animal House, and askthemselves which one delivers a more wholesome message.American Pie is an effective, if slightly heavy handed comedy.  Thescatological humour is unnecessary (and I mean that in a good way),but is fairly well handled.  The delivery and timing of all the leadsis exemplary, even if most of them look a little long in the tooth tobe high schoolers.As to the ""gross out"" elements, they are only a little more extremethan in the crop of 1980's ""bad kids"" films, and are par for thecourse for the late 90's ""There's Something About The Dumber KingpinWho Shagged Me"" genre pieces.

175,Primtime,Pushes The Sexual Entendre Envelope,6,10 July 1999,"American Pie could be simply described as the ""There's Something About Mary"" of 1999. It uses many of the same jokes about certain bodily fluids, flatulation, zit-faced losers and getting it on with an older woman. Needless to say, this film fully deserves its R rating as it goes full out in trying to get laughs and in its high sexual content.This film is funny, extremely funny at times, regardless of how it is done. By following the adventures of four graduating virgins, all trying to get laid, most films would not have problems getting the laughs. The final scenes of the film wrap it up nicely with some predictable and unpredictable happenings (Let's just say that I didn't expect to hear Mrs. Robinson in this film). Beyond the masturbation, pastry-loving and nude magazine scenes, one almost feels that the filmmakers are trying to end it all up with a Disney ""be good"" message, however, that is all taken away (Thankfully).The acting in this film is sub-par, but really does nothing to diminish the story. I also didn't care for the Oz - innocent choir girl relationship. How a hardcore, lacrosse playing jock could turn so soft so quickly is something only the movies could do. It also seemed that the gossipy redhead character was totally unnecessary as she added nothing to the film. The script was well written and the director created exactly what goes on for teenage boys at this time in their life. These facts combined with the abundance of comedy help to give this film such a good mark. Can't wait for the college sequel.Be prepared to be grossed out and laugh, because after all this is only a popcorn movie.6/10 stars.",American Pie
176,tgooderson,Best to remember rather than re watch.,6,28 April 2012,"It's the summer of 1999, I'm 13 and somehow myself and about eight friends get into our local two screen cinema one afternoon to see American Pie. 95 minutes and a lot of thrown popcorn later and we leave having seen the funniest film we think we'll ever see. Now it's 2012, I'm 26, I have a beard and I've gone back to watch the film that my 13 year old self fell in love with before watching the forth instalment of the franchise next month.Towards the end of the senior year at High School four friends; jock Oz (Chris Klein), awkward geek Jim (Jason Biggs), quirky Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and regular guy Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) are struggling to lose their virginity before they each embark for college. Having seen classmates like loud mouth Stifler (Seann William Scott) have success on this front and after one party believing that even the dorkiest guy in the class Chuck 'Shermanator' Sherman (Chris Owen) has lost his virginity, the four friends make a pact that they will help each other to get laid by Prom Night.When I first watched this in 1999 the idea of hearing teenagers talk about and engage in sex during a movie was still novel and outrageous to me. Some of the jokes and more graphic or gross scenes were hilarious and like nothing I'd ever seen before. Now, 13 years later after the likes of The Hangover which have pushed the crude and discussing acts even further, the film feels a bit tame. It's still pretty gross to see Stifler drink from that cup or for Jim to enjoy that pie but sensitivities and audiences have changed a lot in the last decade or so. Much of the humour I liked 13 years ago now feels immature and I suppose this is because it isn't fresh and also because I've grown up. The humour in The Hangover didn't appeal to me either and the trailer for Project X put me off completely. I wonder how funny someone born in 1999 would find this film now. I expect they would find it funnier that I. One character who still remains funny to me is Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy). His interactions with his son about sex are cringe worthy and embarrassing even today. He stole the film and the entire franchise.One thing that struck me this time round was how poor some of the acting was. Tara Reid is dreadful and Chris Klein even worse. Shannon Elizabeth's accent is ridiculous and the country she is supposed to be from didn't even exist in 1999! Another thing I noticed this time was how sweaty the whole cast looked. I'd never noticed it before but it looked like each actor had gone for a run immediately before reading their lines. I didn't particularly like the sentimentality towards the end and everything ended far too neatly but at least it wasn't a nasty or mean movie. I also really liked the film's soundtrack both in 1999 and now.Despite all its flaws I still have great affinity for this film. It reminded me of being in my teens, wearing the same overly baggy clothes and having the same overly gelled hair. The film has stayed with me all these years and in a way I wish I hadn't revisited it. It's like that video game that you loved as a kid and you see in a shop for £2. You take it home, dig out and dust down your old console and then realise five minutes in that times have changed. Sure, it was great when you were a kid but you're not anymore. It's best to put it back in the box and remember the good times you had as a kid.www.attheback.blogspot.com",American Pie
177,Rhino Rover,Fun & Funny,9,9 July 1999,"This movie did what WWW couldn't. It was entertaining from start to finish. Although this movie follows on the foot steps of Austin Powers 2 and Big Daddy, I found that it was thoroughly more entertaining. The humor is not intellectual by any stretch of the imagination (and it wasn't meant to be) but it was well written and more importantly, well delivered.The movie revolves around a group of friends that make a pact with each other that they would all lose their virginity by their prom night. What starts out as a group of guys trying every trick in the book to bed a girl turns out to be a self discovering journey that is riddled with humor that keeps you laughing right up to the closing credits. While there are those out there that may criticize this movie on its content, keep in mind that it is rated R and makes no attempt to hide that fact. Parents may be offended but the reality is that this movie does depict what many teenagers go through during the final year of high school.All the actors portrayed their roles admirably and a large part can be attributed to good writing. This movie will attract a lot of the teenage crowd (at least those that can get in) but I'm sure that adult audiences will find it just as entertaining.

179,DJ_Shilo,Have a Piece,8,10 May 2016,"July 9, 1999""American Pie"" is one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen and one of the funniest movies of the year. It may look like a retread of past comedies such as ""Porky's"" because it revolves around four boys trying to lose their virginities on prom night but it breaks new ground and gives us something different: Characters and a sense of purpose. It also aims to show you that high school is the last great memory before entering into the world and the challenges one may face before getting there.It's about a high school senior, Jim (Jason Biggs) who is awkward, nerdy and lives with his embarrassing father, Noah (Eugene Levy) and mom in West Michigan, Detroit. He attends high school with his friends: Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher (Chris Klein) and the ladies' man, Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas). They are all frustrated with the fact that they are still virgins in high school. They also have a semi-friend who is a jock, Steve Stifler (Sean William Scott) who they despise because he is obnoxious and the only one who is not a virgin. Together, they decide to form a pact to lose their virginities on prom night and discover that it might be a challenge getting there.The summer has barely started and this is the movie to kick it off. It opens in a rather funny sequence where Jim is attempting to watch scrambled porn on cable. His mother walks in the room and he desperately attempts to hide with a pillow before his father walks in and they discover Jim's fleshy indiscretion. He seems to be unlucky as he winds up in many silly and awkward situations throughout the picture, one of them involving a pie, I'm sure, will become very memorable for Jason Biggs. Real teenagers are inexperienced little hooligans who will attempt to do anything to get the girl and that's what the main focus of the picture is. That's what these characters are and they are written quite well along with actors who dive right into them. The actors themselves are inexperienced but they play them very well as breakthrough performances.I really admire the characters in this film because they come off as a real people in high school, something teenage sex comedies never get right. Let me make an example: In the 1982 comedy ""Porky's,"" and I use this film because it's awful, the characters are all moronic, loud and mean-spirited, mainly the pee wee character. They spy on girls in the change room like pigs and say all the wrong things because of a poorly written script. These kids are clever, smart and they don't walk around with an inflatable penis chasing all the girls in the school. They have feelings, are human and come off as real teenagers in high school. Stifler is a bit of pig and a smartass but he is naive and acts like he knows everything. Deep down, he knows nothing and that makes him real because he will learn like the rest of them.There has been a lot of talk about how raunchy this picture and, yes, it's very raunchy and vulgar. Some of the jokes in the film are gross but they are kind of setup to show the viewer where one's action might lead to because you know this film with be in the sights of young teenagers under eighteen and the producers, despicably, know this even though it's Rated R. This picture is not for kids or teenagers and is very much an adult film. One of the characters gets drunk at his own party and something gets splashed into his drink. Think of ""There's Something About Mary."" He ends up drinking it and pukes his guts out to which his friends tease him (Don't party like an idiot and be careful). One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Jim attempts to chase after the exchange student named, Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) and she tells him she will come over to his house to do homework. In Jims head, he is thinking ""She's ready."" His friends convince him to set up his webcam so they can watch the whole show. Instead, he ends up broadcasting to the whole school by accident and they see him dance like an idiot and ruin the whole situation; twice for that matter (Don't let your friends get you in trouble).Through all the raunchiness in the film, there is a serious heart to it and it comes in the form of a super-dorky band girl, Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) who has a lot of band camp stories and proves that even the dorky chicks have the sweetest heart and Jim just might win hers. Eugene Levy is a laugh riot as he teaches his son ""The Secrets of the Book."" Jennifer Coolidge makes a cameo as Stifler's super sexy mom and her character will be talked about for a long time. Mena Suvari plays Heather, Oz's crush he chases after her and she is a sweet soul that is part of the school's choir who doesn't know she is being played. I found the film compelling in the way it tells the story but I found it a little to advanced for high school. Some of the dialogue between Kevin's girlfriend, Vicky (Terri Reid) and her friend, Jessica (Natasha ) was a little too strong for a high school picture and they are really awkward to listen to. Terra Reid comes off as a complete dummy. The ending of the picture lost me when all the girls are played for suckers and they don't even know it. It just feels deceitful. It would have to finish with a predictable party that attempts to close out their high school days. Nonetheless, this film is a winner and it will leave you laughing with a feel-good time.",American Pie

I almost have to like this movie, since I am a 17 years old guy, and I love it. It maybe is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, featuring one of my favorite characters : Jim played hilariously by Jason Biggs. I heard that there will a second American Pie. I am really looking forward to it, and I hope it won't be less funny.
Good points : Jason Biggs, many different characters, the girls, story, hope for a sequel, comedy, beginning, ending, soundtrack, score, ideas, screenplay,Bad points : sometimes to emotional, I thinkAll in all, I rate American Pie 9.5/10 and recommend it to comedy fans.

183,robsellke,"Crude humor, but funny and some parts amazingly realistic",8,22 June 2000,"""American Pie"" is one of those movies that looks really crude and stupid in the previews, but turns out to be sweet and actually good in reality.  There is nudity and a lot of things that moral people would consider ""questionable material"", but that is also funny.  Despite a few ridiculous situations, the movie is actually surprisingly in tune with high school kids and realistic. The plot is basically this, four high school senior boys make a pact together to lose their virginity by Prom Night.  A lot of mix-ups happen, as well as humiliations and popularity shifts among the other seniors.  One thing that I don't really think is realistic, though, is the fact that the students all remain more-or-less friendly and don't really go for each other's throats all of the time, despite the fact that they have all been terribly humiliated and embarrassed.  This leaves the film a little more innocent, though, and doesn't really hurt it much.  So, in conclusion, this movie was funny and pretty much realistic, with a few sip-ups.",American Pie

Jim Levenstein seems like completely diffrent character in somet scenes, in some scenes i can't even hear that he feels anything, his behavior is too controversal if we suppouse that it is good voice acting work(no, it's not). Voice acting of the only one, but the main character ruins so much, so much, you can't even imagine(and i let myself claim that the other voice acting and cast in RU dub was overall better). Moreover his face and movement acting is supercool superlive and it creates another dissonance. And thats why Jim looks absolutely unnaturally. This movie is positive, has funny moments, good to watch, but still it has a lot of flaws, really a lot and adding note that it is overrated gonna give it 6/10. And that's why to make a fair rate you should watch movie on the original language to catch original voice acting.

If Risky Business is the high point of the genre and Porky's the lowpoint, American Pie is much closer to RB.  The characters are dealt with in a fashion that isn't highbrow, the filmmakers continually surprise you with how the situations evolve, especially regarding the Czech exchange lovely, and there is nothing mean about it, although it depends too much on social embarrassment for its laughs.  Only one sincere gross-out joke that just doesn't work and has been done before and recently, regarding a bodily fluid.  The high school characters feel real to a certain extent.

quick get rich executives and i will now list why this film is a flop1. The characters are too stupid,vein or adolescent to even understand sex
or sexual relationships and only care about their lusts which leads to humiliating conclusions2. The scenes were over the top and unrealistic as it was obviously trying to push the boundaries of outrage or trying to morally shock people.3. One scene with a boy filming himself with a girl wanting to have sex in his house is so daft that I laughed at it for that reason. Initially she wanted to go there to change her cloths and then starts to touch herself when she is going through his pornography - in reality only a very stupid girl with no brain would do that.4. All this film demonstrates to me is how juvenile and immature American pupils / students are and how conservative the authorities are with no middle ground agreement.

I for one know I have never seen the audience react as wildly or with such togetherness as with this movie... it was outrageous good fun!The interesting part is that along with 'sick humor' it acually deals suprisingly well with the slight touches of 'teen' romance and not sinking to far into just plain lust....Really a treat..

Same problems, same way of thinking, etc. 	Some people say that the gross-out humor is what makes the movie bad, but in my opinion, it's what makes the movie fun. The reason that it's so funny is because it's gross-out humor. I know that this isn't ""gross-out"" humor but, it's the only example that I give. I  remember that in one scene, they were at a party and this one guy, Jim, walked up to the girl that he liked and didn't know what to say so he just started to laugh with the girl and her friends and then walked away.

There's also a scene in which one of the characters is shown having diarrhea in the school lavatory, complete with sound effects.  The scene has no other reason than just pushing the envelope of movie grossness.).  The famous ""money scene"" of the movie in which an apple pie is used as an onanistic prop was funnier when I read about it than when I actually saw it (the scene also owes a lot to Phillip Roth's novel ""Portnoy's Complaint,"" in which the masturbation-obsessed title character has a go with a piece of liver intended for the family's dinner.)  The young characters in the movie are appealing and that alone keeps the movie mildly enjoyable.  The funniest scenes are those that are the least gross: Jim's Dad tries to explain the birds and the bees;  Finch and his friend's sexy mom (who is like Mrs. Robinson on 'ludes) go about seducing each other (Mom: The scotch is aged 18 years, just the way I like them.)",American Pie

All the performances are top notch with Jason Biggs in particular revelling in his character's increasingly outrageous situations from screwing an apple pie while his dad walks to premature ejeculation while the whole school tunes in on the Internet and his '50s styled Dad very well used is nothing short of a creation of comic genius.

The house parties, the strive to get laid, the bond amongst friends, going to college, and prom all played out in one way or another for most Americans. American Pie definitely blew some scenarios out of proportion, and the result was comedic. Film makers stripped this film down to just the set and a fun script. Most of this movie relied heavily on the script with a nice setting at the end. Dialogue between couples, conversation amongst friends, and advice from parents were all simple yet smart enough to stay funny. Physical humor did make a few cameos.

211,joshua-halstead,"Surprisingly Entertaining, and Warm Hearted.",8,14 November 2013,"I want to start this review with a shocking statement: I am a Christian. That's right, a Christian watched ""American Pie."" Okay, so to you this may not seem like much of a big deal, but trust me, to 99 percent of Christians, it is. See, I grew up being told that these films were stupid, raunchy, cheesy, sex comedies. I put in the disc for AP expected to be greatly offended and find it to be all of those things. I only watched it at first because I am a very big Alyson Hannigan fan and I wanted to see her trademark role. I'll be the first to admit that there is a lot of inappropriate content in the movie, and yes, he has sex with a pie, but I think people overestimate the way that these things are shown. The movie isn't a porn flick. It shows his butt for a few second while he is over the pie. Yes there i frontal nudity on a girl, and yes, it is in a prolonged scene, however, this is probably the most justifiable nudity of any movie in the 1990's. In the 1990's teen films had become so squeaky clean, and afraid of offending anyone that they had become incredibly unrealistic. AP was a throw back to 80's films like Fast Times At Ridgemont High, The Breakfast Club, and Sixteen Candles. Granted AP is worse than all of these. There is no way to justify the content, but that doesn't mean the movie isn't a good movie. It is a well-written, well-acted, funny, somewhat original comedy with a lot of heart. It brought back the bro- mance. The fact is that if you are easily offended, you will HATE AP, but if you're not, grab some popcorn, a large coke---and maybe some apple pie-- - and enjoy this truly one of a kind, hilarious movie that(in-case you're one those people who thinks it is) is not a sex comedy but truly a bromantic comedy.",American Pie

219,Dante Hicks,Not that funny but a good film none the less,7,17 January 2000,"Considering the immense publicity given to the film and it's more 'noticeable' bits I was somewhat surprised to find myself not the least bit shocked by the whole thing. Sure it was funny but not laugh out loud funny, not the burst my sides laughing funny that I had expected. I actually found it to be a good film on it's own, more of a nineties spin on the old John Hughes tales of growing up and wondering exactly who you are and what you want. The fact that the main focus of the film was sex changed nothing as it more than emphasised the fact that sex is only truly great when you are with someone you love. It also placed safe sex prominently, yet subtlely, in the window. It also marked something of a radical shift in teen films by not strictly placing every one in a distinct social group (The band nerds aside). The fact that the four main characters hung around with each other despite their apparent differences made the film more realistic in my opinion than the clearly divided 'The Breakfast Club' fivesome. It was more 'Ferris Bueller's' and was all the better for it. Stifler was a truly brilliant character and I hope teen film writers take a leaf from this movie in how to deal with the 'cool, rich' male leads. To label this film a 'gross out movie' is to completely misunderstand it. I found myself agreeing for the first time ever with Leonard Maltin that it's a good film with it's heart in the right place. Not overly moralistic or totally without decency it takes a good stab at what it's really like to be an 18 year old on the brink of entering a world unlike anything they've seen before. I liked it, but not because it's got masturbatory gags or endless sex remarks, but because it dealt with issues and a context never before seen in teen movies. The one major downer about it though is that it's going to usher in a whole bunch of other teen sex comedies each going further than the one before and getting worse with it. Mark my words.",American Pie
220,mig28lx,Which is Funnier?,8,15 September 2000,"What is it about this movie that makes it eligible for repeat viewing?  Why is it funny?  It's gross, sexist, lewd, crude, and many of the situations are socially unacceptable...definitely not a first-date flick.  But it's just so darn funny!  Why?  Why, why, why?Many comparisons have been made to ""Animal House"", some favorable, most UNfavorable.  In my humble, rank amateur's opinion, this picture is superior.  There is no food fight, nor is there anyone who remotely approaches Belushi in terms of comic talent.  But the story is not as preposterous in ""American Pie.""  It stays real to the characters without having to resort to something that distracts from the main goal of the picture.  People in ""Pie"" do wacky things, but you believe them.  People in ""Animal House"" do wacky things, but there is no clear motivation.  Okay, these movies are not necessarily concerned with such mundane tasks as finding motivations for every action, but there was more of it in ""Pie"" than there was in ""Animal House.""  Since it was more believable, it seemed more natural, and thus it was funnier because the characters were just being themselves without TRYING to be funny.  And since it's funnier, it's more watchable and eligible for repeat viewing.Then again, I could be wrong.  Though I doubt it.",American Pie
221,Starks,Classic!!!,8,7 September 1999,"I have to say that the most fun I had at the movies this summer was when I saw American Pie, the funniest picture I've seen since last summer's There's Something About Mary. This movie has taken the classic teenage boy film (Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds) and spruced it up for the 90's.  It is hilarious from start to finish. If you like physical comedy, gross out comedy, sexual comedy, American Pie has it all.  A great ensemble cast of likeable young actors makes this a joy to watch.     I think this year's breakout star has to be Chris Klein.  He was phenomenal in Election and he is even better here as a jock who tries to soften his image to score before prom. I have a feeling Klein is going to be Hollywood's next big thing and I hope he has a chance to flex his acting muscles in some different movies (I can definitely see this guy in an action film).Also very good is Jason Biggs who plays the sympathetic Jim character, the guy who is least likely to lose his virginity.  His antics are very funny to follow and he gets the lion share of the laughs. Finally a huge ovation for Eugene Levy, who gets major laughs as the Jim's dad.",American Pie

223,Michael1958,Why must we continue to endure the sick fantasies of loser Hollywood producers?,1,5 October 2002,"One has to wonder why grown adults make films like this one and like the film Kids, which depict young people in vulgar, crude and obscene ways. If you protest the making of trash like American Pie-you are portrayed as some sort of right-wing censorship mongering individual. This is not the case for me. I enjoy films that show a healthy attitude toward sex and do not blush at the sight of nudity on screen. What is sad is that perverse people as the so-called creativity behind this tripe were able to put on screen some of the likely sick imaginings of their youth. I will not see the sequel-I saw enough of the first to know how poor of taste it will be. In a recent interview with shock film maker John Waters-he told the interviewer that he no longer made films to shock-because there were so many of them out there from mainstream hollywood. Waters speaks truly. Don't waste your time with this, there are far too many good films that have and will be made about young people. When you pay to see stuff like this, it is the same as rewarding the folks who write obscene sayings on bathroom stalls. I would not be surprised if American Pie's producers were tops in this department while in high school.Michael",American Pie
224,vhilden,"It's all about SEX. If you don't like sex, don't watch this film.",8,12 November 1999,"[may contain SPOILERS] Why is it that so many people call this film ""shocking"" or ""crude""? I think it is really funny, well made, an excellent film. No, you will not find any messages about ""racial and/or social injustices"" here; it's not that kind of film. Its message is all about sex, teenage sex, recreational sex, period. Teenagers want sex: is that shocking? Is sex crude? If that's so, then we are all crudely made beings!I was surprised by the good quality of both the actors and the gags. I expected less, perhaps influenced by the comparisons to ""Porky's"". It is also well directed, the action runs smoothly, the gags are not overdone, and the scenes are cut at the right moments. Too often directors seem to fall in love with the jokes and keep a scene going far beyond the point where it stops being funny. Some jokes here are predictable, but funny nevertheless, e.g. the ""milky"" beer. Others came completely unexpected to me, such as the point where the geek very matter-of-factly declared her innovative use for a flute. I liked the ending too: happy, manicheist, everyone gets laid and the bully sees his mom in sh*tbreak's arms.There are many characters in the film: the four protagonists, the several girls they are running after, the bully, the dad trying to be helpful, etc. Some of these characters were not developed extensively, there was no time for that, but we get a good sketch of each, like a wiring diagram that shows the interconnections without unnecessary details.Well, I know that public references to sex were considered crude in some centuries, notably in the late 19th and early 20th.

American Pie is groundbreaking in movie history as it explores issues no other film has touched. It's a movie for teens and it is incredibly and amazingly enjoyable. I loved every single second of this movie, the script and directing is well done and all of the main and minor actors play their role well including Shannon Elizabeth, Seann William Scott, and of course Jason Biggs. But the one thing that makes the movie completely enjoyable is the gross out humor and sexual exploitations, all of which are done very well (which is rare).

232,Hinopio,Not really all that funny,1,9 July 1999,"I am one of the members of the target audiences for this movie, a horny teenaged male, but I didn't think this movie was all that great.  It is advertised as a comedy, which it is, there are some funny parts, but they threw in a lot of sentimental stuff and slow parts in here.  Like Something About Mary, I thought this movie was way overrated.  A few attempts at gross-out humor and some phallus jokes do not a good movie make.  South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut, which was released just a week before this, was a lot funnier, raunchier, and more fun to watch.  The funny parts do not make up for the slow boring parts.  The movie tries to make you laugh one second and then feel for the characters the next, but for me it didn't work. Good scenes:  The beginning scene, the pie scene, any scene with Jim and his father, the Jim and Michelle sex scene, the Fitch and the one guy's mother scene (MILF-Mother I'd Like to F**k), and the scene with Jim and Nadia.  Bad scenes: just about everything else.  The slow moving parts that try and give the characters feelings and stuff, which doesn't belong in a teen sex comedy.  So if you have a choice between this and South Park, if I was you I'd go with South Park.  Or, if you still want to see a good sex comedy, go out and rent Porky's Fast Times at Ridgemont High, or National Lampoon's Animal House.",American Pie
233,dover,Unbelievably formulaic,5,24 June 2000,"Let me start off by saying: Just where is this high school? Seemingly everyone in the film in attractive, and no one actually looks like they're in high school. The school is clean and well-kept. Also, among the hundred or so students we see, a while two of them are minorities.
This is a wierd film, when you think about it: a strange mix of There's Something about Mary, Animal House, and Stand by Me that just doesn't sit right, somehow. The whole story (if you can call it that) is pathetically obvious. If they let everything be about sex, that's one thing - but there's some abstract issues here the film wants to play in but doesn't really try to understand. Lip service is paid to ""love"", but everything makes more sense when the characters just want to get laid.The movie isn't all bad - there's some funny scenes as the main character (Jason Biggs) and his dad (former CTV star Eugene Levy) try to broach the subject of sex in a fatherly manner, but  there isn't much else.",American Pie

Admittedly some of the things done in this movie are out-there, but they are just so funny to see. I think the Adam Herz has definitely experienced some of this. Whoever casted this film did a great job. Jason Biggs and Seann-William Scott are absolutely hilarious. I think Mena Suvari stands out as doing the best job. Eugene Levy is hilarious as well. The only thing I didn't like was Eddie Kaye Thomas, not that he did a bad job I just thought he could have done better.

235,Adrian-32,A fusion of raunchiness and warmth,7,23 December 1999,"""American Pie"" is not you average teen flick. It's reputation for being raunchy and outrageous is totally justified, given the fact that it does refer to, and sometimes show, everything involved with sex, from bodily fluids to masturbation to using food as a a metaphor for third base. It's sort of like a ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" touched with ""There's Something About Mary"" grossness. Believe it or not, this film is relentlessly honest when it examines teen guys, with their consistently raging hormones, driving them to explore just about everything. Yeah, it does get a bit silly at times, but is also, strangely, illuminates alot of information about teens adults don't know about, or probaly don't wanna believe. But it's not like the lead characters are one-dimensional youths trying to get laid, there are actually some touching moments near the end where they come to realisation that relationships and love will always be more fulfilling than scoring. ""American Pie"" manages to successfully combine hilarious toilet-humour with warmth, and it owes a lot of credit towards the performances, everyone showcases potential, including Jason Biggs. Okay, so it's gags do get a but tiresome, and some character's don't develop well, but overall ""American Pie"" is a teen comedy worth watching.",American Pie

237,stephen niz,"Come back nerds, all is forgiven",3,11 July 2000,"If evidence was needed that mid-80's nostalgia is here, we get it in AMERICAN PIE. It is no more credible than a remake of Porkys or Screwball Hotel, not that it matters. The makers of those pictures were very aware that plots and characters were irrelevant, so rude set pieces instead were the order of the day. They were rarely very good (the oft-cited classic ANIMAL HOUSE belongs to a different genre altogether).Riding into cinemas on the back of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY did not hurt this films box office potential. The makers laughably suggested this was an evolution of the genre. Judging by its success, you can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time. What separates AMERICAN PIE from the rest is a series of poorly devised high school romances. Which would be okay if it was still funny. It isn't.The most explicit homage to the original inspirations is the casting of Eugene Levy (a chorus of `who?' rings out), best known for being John Candy's sidekick in a bunch of forgettable idiot comedies. So his `comeback' hardly rivals Travolta's.AMERICAN PIE belongs to a time called `mid-80's'. That time is long gone. It belongs to a genre of jocks-and-sex comedies.

238,Bats_Breath,This Movie made me Feel Old,1,10 August 2001,"American Pie was the FIRST teenage/high school flick I saw in my life where watching it actually made me feel old.  I was 23 pushing 24 when I saw AP in theaters in '99.  Before that I could still watch teen flicks and even high school flicks, even though I was no longer a teen and no longer(thank God) in high school.  No problem whatsoever.  But I guess in '99 I realized it had been 6 years since I was in high school, and these goofy teen flicks got repetive and boring to me.  The teens in the theater were laughing their heads off, probably thinking that AP was brand new and original, when in reality it is old, old, old, tired and cliche.I saw AP with two friends, one guy was exactly my age and I looked at him and knew he hated AP for the same reasons I did.  My other friend was still 20 at the time, and he was laughing his head off.  Poor guy, I guess he can be forgiven, when you are 20 a lot of people still think of themselves as ""teens"" and can still watch movies like this.  I know I could,.....until 23. Millions of REAL teens in 1999(unlike my friend who was 20) will cherish ""American Pie"" as ""their film"" a hallmark of their growing years and something that made them ""come of age"".  I guess I had ""Dazed and Confused"" and even ""Clueless"".  But AP will always be remembered by me....it was a coming of age piece for me.  It was the first teen flick I watched where I just sat and stared at the screen trying to remind myself to laugh and stop feeling so old watching this.  Since AP, I realized I could NEVER watch a teen flick again without feeling like an old geezer.  Trust me, you think it won't happen to you....wait till you turn 23, or even 22.",American Pie

Sure, similar styles had been done before but this is what set off the alarm clock for all the atrocities to come.What exactly wrong with this movie? The whole 'comedy' part is based upon sexual references, sexual references, obscenity, and more sexual references. Ha ha! Hilarious right? Well no. There isn't much comedy in a random girl masturbating in the main character's room for no reason and then him prematurely ejaculating twice. There isn't any hilarity in being caught by your parents which jacking off. The supposedly 'funny' parts are completely bland and done in a very tasteless fashion. I don't think I laughed once throughout the whole movie. Hell, I probably found even Swing Vote more funny, a movie that didn't even emphasize on the comedic aspect all that much.And now thanks to this piece of crud, thousands of movie makers are convinced that you need tons of swear words, lots of sex references, obscenity and perhaps even more sex references to make a movie funny.

241,Soujiro,"Predictable, Mediocre, but cheerfully Lighthearted Sex Comedy.",3,26 July 1999,"I really remember very little of this movie.  Not because I wasn't paying attention, but rather because the writing was so light and fluffy, I never really got a feel for  who the main characters were.  This is a movie about events and actions rather than emotion or even thought. 
There are definitely some funny moments in the film, but I never really laughed out loud.  I think that perhaps if I were a junior high student, I might enjoy the jokes a bit more.  The film feels like an 80's teen comedy with a few sexual jokes thrown in.  I liked the character of Stifler, the profanity spouting cretin that all of us have to deal with at least once in our lives.  Eddie Kaye Thomas reminds me of a young Nicholas Cage in his role as Finch with a kind of lazy charm.  The music is fairly standard for this type of film.I try not to go into a movie with any expectations, but this movie was really disappointingly average, sickeningly sweet, and unrealistic.  The main characters in The Wood, a movie with a similar premise, are much more interesting, believable, and intelligent.  Frankly, even the characters in Tarzan have more depth and personality.  I only recommend this movie to those who enjoy shutting off their brains for a couple hours (not always a bad thing to do).",American Pie

It is undeniably funny in some parts and it certainly has its special charm, but the acting and characters aren't that great besides maybe the Stiffmeister and the Sherminator. It was an enjoyable, but also forgettable comedy of the 90's and there are obviously much better comedies out there, like The Forty Year Old Virgin, Superbad, Pineapple Express, There's Something About Mary and even Forgetting Sarah Marshall. I had some good laughs, but overall not that memorable, aside from a few iconic scenes and performances. The film isn't even close to being awful, but it's not great either. Nonetheless, it's still a lot better than all of Adam Sandler's recent movies and the Seltzer & Friedburg parody films.

Finally, upon it's unrated DVD release, I saw it, and I must say, was surprised.  While it is a teen sex comedy aimed primarily at horny teenagers, it does have a rather believable story, and one helluva hilarious script.  It gets slow at times, and not taking anything away from Mena Suvari, I feel her plotline's scenes drag the most.  Overall it's a recommended watch.  I've now scene both versions, and there really isn't much of a difference.  Watching either, you'll still see the same reasons why this movie was the hit it was.",American Pie

I should know, since I AM a teenager. :) Plus, I laughed my butt off in the progress.  I never thought I could watch a movie in a theater and be allowed to fall on the floor and laugh so hard, that the guy next to you would tell you to be quiet. It was a true masterpiece of teenage intelligence. The sex, the humor and whatever was in-between just made me EXPLODE in laughter.On a side note, it was really good to see Eugene Levy do a recent role due of the fact that I haven't seen him in any movies lately. I would like to see him do some more movies in the near future. This is some great Canadian talent we are missing. Even though his role in, ""American Pie"" wasn't much on the silver screen, he still made me laugh before he said anything.Cheers to the American Pie cast and crew! Great Work!",American Pie

While there is a larger amount of content and insight than usual for these kinds of movies, the majority of the humour is lost as the timing for almost all the jokes falls completely flat.  At least the characters are strong enough to make the movie interesting, but good characters alone do not make a good film.Final score is 3/5; it is redeemed somewhat by the amount of insight, but that still doesn't quite manage to get it where it should go.",American Pie

The best thing about this movie is that it cast un-known actors and was able to make this movie a huge hit.The performances were great. Jason Bigs stands out amongst all of them. He blends funny dialog with very funny physical comedy. I hope to see him in more films in the future. Alyson Hannigan who has a small but funny role is also great. She says the best line in the movie. ( you have to see it just to see her say that line)The actors worked exceptionally well together and I really enjoyed the film. Go see it.,American Pie

Each fears leaving high school a virgin and so they make a pact to help each other score before their graduation.There are some scenes in this movie that out-gross There's Something About Mary and that's some feat but the overall tone is sweet. It's possibly the best-natured teenage movie for a while. The four leads are convincing. Jason Biggs as Jim gets possibly the most embarrasing role in recent years (he's the guy with the pie on the poster) but he gets most of the laughs. Kevin is the most experienced of the three. He has a full time girlfriend and their relationship becomes the cornerstone of the film's drama. Both are unsure of their relationship and how sex should fit in it. Finch is the shyest and strangest characters. He borders on a nerd but he formulates a plan to make him the most talked about boy in the girls locker room. The only unconvincing element of the four guy's adventures was with ""Oz"". His efforts border on sentimentality and his playing of a character who wants to find his sensitive side doesn't work.The supporting cast are used effectively. The girls are not just objects of affection. They are fully developed characters in their own right. Possibly the funniest lines come from Stifler. An experienced jock who enjoys teasing the four. American Pie is hardly family fun. For me it's success shows that there are a lot of under-age teenagers sneaking into theatres.

When four boys make a pact to lose their virginity before prom night, you know that many things can go right and some things can go SERIOUSLY wrong.

I'd like to say its very realistic, since every single problem in there and situations can happen in real life, I've even had problems like that, and watching a movie like that makes you feel like you're not the only one passing through all of that stuff.None of the actors in this movie are really great, they all did a good job, but nobody did something special.The movie was not good because of it's actors (hell no!), it was good because of it shows things the way they are in real life. I think every single teen ager (with a normal life) would love to watch this movie.As a comedy it was very good, it made me laugh a few times (and long laughs). But the good thing about this movie is that it's not just a comedy that makes you laugh but has no script, this movie has a very nice script that keeps you paying attention all the time, and you don't only get interested waiting for a funny part, you want to know what's going to happen with all the boys and the girls.I enjoyed this movie a lot, and I watched it twice in the theaters.

256,buddhadan-1,Good by itself but great as a series,8,20 September 2006,"This movie, by itself, is hilarious. It's funny for the younger set that can immediately relate to the humor that describes, at least on some level, the world that they live in and for the older set that can now sit back and laugh at the way that they were (or their friends were) when they were growing up.It's got a cast of younger actors who are truly hilarious and then they also throw in the father, Eugene Levy (sp?) to make things even funnier. His straight acting to the comedy around him is legendary, and he shows off his skill in this set of movies.As noted in my tagline, this movie is funny even if you only saw it and none of the sequels. But where this set of movie excels is in the fact that there are sequels. It shows not only that they can find fresh humor with all of the same characters (a winning point to this set of movies is that it appears that the entire cast returns each time) but that the characters can actually start to slowly show maturity throughout the films up until the American Wedding movie.See this movie if you want a good laugh, get all of them if you want to have a lot of good laughs and if you want to actually see the characters grow over time.",American Pie

Anyway, I remember this one time, at band camp...What can I say? The whole thing is almost a conglomeration of cliches but I've studied films in cultural studies that twist familiar things to make them interesting and original - like American Pie. I think all the 'bad' guys (Stifler and Sherman) get what's coming to them, as does Jim though he's actually pleased. Everything works out rather nicely and surprisingly - I mean, how many people thought things were going to be resolved about halfway when Finch seemed to have everything under control, Jim has the Czech girl over his house, Oz had 'won' the girl and Vicky had finally decided to do it with Kev? But the film ploughed on and these situations started to change and I was like, so how are Jim and Finch supposed to get laid now? But with very clever twists it all gets resolved. Love this resolving that's running rife in movies these days!Well, I must say it was an enjoyable film, utterly hilarious at parts (the apple pie is just one bit). You gotta love quotes like ""Scotch in the cupboard on the right... aged 18 years - just the way I like it."" (Stifler's mother) and little things like Jim's 'strip' which almost saved him from humiliation (the deftly aimed shirt). I'll shut up now.

I remember when it came out I said that it would be a future classic. Well we're almost up on the ten year anniversary. I'm gonna go ahead and say it's a comedy classic. It has everything you could want. Sex, outrageous comedy, toilet humor, Eugene Levy, and above all; the one thing that ties it all together... it has heart. It has believable characters that your feel for. This is also the movie that started the whole MILF thing. I mean if that alone doesn't consider it a classic, I don't know what would. It was followed by two theatrical sequels and three straight to video sequels. I know I have been praising it, but it's actually my least favorite of the first three films.

262,dustinkdye,'American Pie' set the bar for teen sex comedies,6,28 July 2013,"""So high school boys everywhere only think about sex, huh?"" my Japanese wife turned to me and said about 20 minutes into ""American Pie."" She looked at me expectantly, as if she wanted to hear me say I was somehow different, above such base pursuits. I could tell she was mildly disappointed when I replied, ""Yeah, pretty much."" Eighteen-year-old boys' raging hormones is a truly universal theme.There have been four American Pie films to date, not counting the straight-to-video releases. The film notably struck a chord with teens when it was released in 1999. I remember sitting in art class and overhearing a popular and attractive senior girl condescending to an awkward and geeky freshman boy, ""You haven't seen 'American Pie'? The great American sex comedy?"" I still cringe when I remember that.If you haven't seen it, it is basically about four senior boys who make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate high school. They shrewdly determine prom is their last chance to get laid, and devote all their energy to getting a woman in bed at the after-prom party, to be held at the lake house of the cocky lacrosse player, Steve Stifler. The boys, particularly Jim, have a series of embarrassing mishaps along the way, one famously involving a warm apple pie.""American Pie"" set a new bar for teen comedies. Every teen comedy since has tried, and failed, to top the scene where Stifler unwittingly drinks a beer with a load of semen in it.Though ""American Pie"" is famous for its numerous gross-outs, the movie is good, and not just gross, because we come to identify with the characters, and the humor rises naturally from the situations. The scene where Stifler slips laxatives into Finch's mochaccino, causing him to make a desperate dash for the nearest toilet, is funny not because fart sounds are humorous, but because the film already established Finch's aversion for public restrooms.The Stifler character was especially believable. When Heather (Mena Suvari) asks out Oz (Chris Klein) in front of the lacrosse team, Stifler proceeds to make lewd gestures. Heather misinterprets this as Stifler making fun of her, when Stifler was really just trying to embarrass Oz. When I first saw the film at the age of 16, I thought, That's pretty much how high school boys act.The acting is serviceable. Eugene Levy, who plays Jim's dad, and Seann William Scott, who plays Stifler, are totally convincing in their roles. (Toward the end of the film, watch Stifler in the background check his beer before he takes a sip.) Others, however, give flat performances, especially in dramatic scenes. However, since these scenes take back seat to the comedy, and few of the jokes fall flat from the acting, the mediocre performances don't hurt the overall effectiveness of the film.Another criticism I have of the film is one that pretty much applies to all Hollywood films, and that is that the kids are too rich. You can usually tell who the poor kid is in a Hollywood movie because he's the one who's not driving a late-model car. His family will still live in a two-storey house. Every student in ""American Pie"" (except for Oz, the only one shown to have a job), lives like the richest kid at my high school.Overall, ""American Pie"" is an enjoyable comedy that will continue to be the standard against which all teen comedies will be judged. I recommend the unrated version. While scenes in most unrated or extended editions were cut from the theatrical releases for good reasons (i.e., they were tedious), the theatrical version of ""American Pie"" was really a sanitized version of the better, unrated version.",American Pie

These are all the makings for a cult film.

The antics are relatively extreme and always appropriate for the moment. I found myself saying ""Oh Jesus"" as much as laughing, though. Look for the apple pie scene!I'm reminded of the 1987 film, The Allnighter, with yummy Susanna Hoffs and Joan Cusack. I've caught The Allnighter late night on cable once or twice in recent years, and I simultaneously find my eyes glued to the TV and my deepest innermost self completely embarrassed for myself and for the cast.

Jim has a father that won't stop giving him advice regarding sex and shows him pornographic magazines and a mother who freaks out when he is caught watching ""illegal channels"". This character is also caught in several compromising situations from masturbating while watching scrambled porn on TV to being caught by his father having sex with an apple pie. The worst of which is blowing it when he has the chance of having sex with a hot foreign exchange student, which is something that the entire high school sees on the internet. Although Jim ends up losing his virginity on prom night, it ends up being with a band camp geek, who ends up using him. The funny thing is that Jim doesn't seem to mind at all. Overall, American Pie is a hilarious movie and may very well be the best of all teenage sex comedies. It definitely sets an example for those that precede it.",American Pie

I enjoyed the opening tube sock scene and the ordeal with the beer at Stifler's party but it didn't impress me. Funny yes,...substance no! There more I watched the more I was impressed. It defined the teenage male so accurately and comically while at the same time creating some substance. Oz, a jock, explores his sensitive side in chorus and falls in love rather than just lusting. Ofcourse there is lots of shallow humor but that can be lots of fun too. I was especially impressed by ""Sh*t break's"" scene with Mrs. Stifler...the ""Mrs. Robinson"" song playing (in reference to Dusitn Hoffman's 1967 movie ""The Graduate"" about his experience with an older woman ) blew me away!

275,ViciousCXY,No depth. No story. No point.,2,23 January 2020,"Okay.. where to begin.. I've heard about this movie for a long time and everyone sings it's praises, hailing it as a hilarious teen comedy with heart. I can safely say that this film is the most unfunny, cringy, awkward, uncomfortable movie I've ever watched with the heart of an empty bucket.The plot: A group of high school boys decide to attempt to lose their virginities before they graduate.. So they're not seen as losers?
See, even this kind of plot (although it's VERY shallow and VERY thin) can be entertaining if written properly. But it isn't. The characters personality traits consist of being a virgin and being absolutely obsessed with sex, and that is all, for every single Male character. There's not a single scene, Not. A. Single. Scene. That doesn't involve a sexual context.The music: Lots of 90s Pop Punk. All the songs sound the same, might even be the same song honestly, it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest. There's also quite a bit of generic, uninspired background music, yay. We get no interesting sound design, just fart noises, shallow music and ambient sound (hallway footsteps, people talking in the background of a scene, etc).The Cinematography: Not a single shot in the film with any kind of thought behind it. There's really nothing else to say. You're not going to find a shot that looks as if it has any kind of meaning, and you're not going to find a single shot that has any kind of depth. The colours don't mean anything, the framing doesn't induce any emotion, the composition is tripe. Even High School Musical has black belt level Colour Theory, compared to this shell of a film.Conclusion: Please.. If you value your time.. AVOID this movie. You won't come out of this with anything other than a strong regret that you didn't watch something else. Ugh.",American Pie
276,davidgoesboating,"No classic, but surprisingly good.",7,27 October 2005,"OK first things first. When I watched American Pie for the first time I didn't expect much at all... from what I'd heard it was a pretty dumb ""gross-out"" comedy that was every 15 year-old boy's favourite film but was highly over-rated. I was right in some ways.... some of the humour is a bit silly and predictable, and there is no doubt it was over-rated - this film is no classic. However, I found it surprisingly enjoyable. Most of the humour was actually really funny, and I found myself laughing a fair bit while watching the film (that hasn't happened since Team America ;) ). The film does get a bit sappy towards the end when it tries to push a few predictable messages about love, but it still carries through to the end well on the strength of the characters. Jim is lovable and sad at the same time, his Dad draws laughs every time he appears on screen, Stifler, Finch, Sherman and of course Michelle are great characters as well. However I found Oz and Kevin, and their respective girlfriends, rather annoying. American Pie is by no means a great movie, but I feel that it did well for what it was trying to achieve.

It has some great comedic moments, and they are done very well, but most of them are unoriginal.  I'd like to comment on them further, but I would be revealing too much if I did.Despite what most people think, the movie does have a good message for teens at the end.

281,the rock-17,Pure Entertainment,8,1 September 1999,"Warning: This Review Contains Plot MaterialI really liked this movie a lot.  A lot of the scenes were great (including the now infamous Jason Biggs and the Pie scene), and the acting was hilarious and excellent.I thought the two strongest characters who really made this movie extremely entertaining were Eugene Levy and Alyson Hannigan, and I don't think many people disagree with me there.  Eugene Levy, playing Jason Biggs' father, was just downright hilarious as usual.  Seeing someone like Eugene giving a sex-ed role like he did was just so funny.  Like when he saw the condoms in his sons room, or the opening scene (I still laugh thinking about this) when he walks in on his son....I just can't get enough of how funny Eugene Levy was in that movie.The same goes true for Alyson Hannigan.  Seeing her play the ""geek"" (no offense) on TV's Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, a show that I love, and then seeing her change of character in this movie is hilarious.  At first, you see her pretty much resembling her dorky character in Buffy, but then she suddenly changes, and she becomes a totally different person.  It has to be one of the funniest things I have seen on the silver screen in a long time.I really liked this movie, and I recommend it for anyone who wants to be purely entertained, because this is what American Pie does, and in a very big way.  Go see this movie soon.  My grade: A-",American Pie

This might not be the most original movie ever made but it has some original ideas in it, for example I've never seen a guy humping a pie recently. I think some people misunderstands this movie, it's not so much about how teenagers act these days it's more a parody of and an exaggeration of what young people growing up go through. It's not supposed to be about what society is like, it's supposed to make fun of what society is becoming.

The answer is not many.American Pie really is one of the best teen movies out there. It has tons of laughs- e.g. the webcam- and features the definitive embarrassing dad- Eugene Levy who, in this movie, is one of the funniest people I have ever seen.Part of the reason it works is that it centres around four central characters, all of which have extremely entertaining stories. Also there's Stifler. Nowadays seann william Scott is pretty well known and the pie movies really helped launch him. Some say Stifler is one dimensional, but who cares, he's hilarious.Part cringe, part laugh, part empathy overall it really works.

There's absolutely no plot nor story or any kind of interesting characters (not mentioning there's no character developments or any information about their background or anything...) -what's the big hype behind this movie anyway?.... it's obviously just a bunch of stupid teenagers who wants to get sex -so each and every scene were dedicated for this purpose -like a collection of bad scenes along with terrible writing. But the worst part is the fact that it's not even funny -not even a single joke....the whole humor is just too vulgar (mainly sex jokes) and uninspired garbage without any meaning nor aim behind it -In conclusion: sex comedy movies sells even more then a cheap porno for everyone ,spreading the message of stupidity around the world faster -grabbing more cash from the worst kind of idiotic audience that keep funding this crap.",American Pie

The plot: American Pie is about four high school boys who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night. As predicted, not everything goes as planned. My rating: 10/10.American Pie perfectly blends buddy comedy and extreme gross-out humor. It's one of those movies that is easy to predict when something bad will happen, but that's what made me laugh so hard. For example, the contaminated beer scene, the opening scene in which a boy is caught watching porn, the internet scene, and the bathroom scene, to name a few.Also, the cast was absolutely stellar. It had names such as Jason Biggs, Eugene Levy, Seann William Scott, and Jennifer Coolidge.Lastly, I don't think I've ever laughed that hard, and that's saying something.",American Pie

288,rickert,Pandering Mess,1,29 January 2000,"The movie can be summed up in the title it had when writer Adam Herz submitted his script to studios. ""Untitled Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Most Readers Will Probably Hate But I Think You Will Love."" It was cheaply made, and it has the words ""teenage"" and ""sex"" in it.  That is why the film got made, and that's just sad.  It really wasn't much of a comedy, it was just an excuse for a string of sex jokes and fart jokes.  If done correctly, they can be clever (see South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut) but in this case, the film just seemed like an excuse to show teens having sex.  There was no ""message"" or truth to be learned from the film, and that is why it failed. Most of those teen sex films from the 80s actually had some kernel of truth buried in them, but there's nothing here at all, except, everyone's having sex and if you don't, then YOU'RE the abnormal one.  The one relationship that I thought was going to be real was the one between Heather and Oz, but instead it just got cheapened by their post-prom-sex.  The movie panders to the worst parts of teenagers, who are obviously the target audience.  The only effect I can see it having on them is to make them think they aren't drinking, screwing, or partying enough.  That is totally the wrong message, but its the only one that is apparent.",American Pie

291,Lestyr,Delicious!,8,8 January 2000,"A film worthy of repeated viewing again and again, and the nudity is not the reason.  It's a movie written expressly by guys for guys, but somehow women like it as much as men do.  The movie has so many scenes of absolutely hideous embarrassment alternated with scenes of triumph.  There were somewhere around ten times in the movie when I started shaking my fist and going, ""Yeah, baby!""  Why?  Becausen this is a movie that so many guys my age (I'm 18) can relate to.  We cringe with embarrassment beyond what we've ever known when we see Kevin get caught spouting off about trying for a sexual homerun; we cheer when we see the guy get the girl not because she coerced him into saying ""I love you"" but because he truly was interested in her.  This is immensely gratifying for us to see, partially because we never see it in real life.  For fans of the movie ""Swingers"" I would highly recommend this as a guy movie.  Storywise, this is very well written.  As noted above, there are some similarities to ""Swingers"" - obvious scenes when you can't help but feel sorry for the guy acting too effeminate or being too much of a pushover - to be contrasted with scenes (like Mike's dancing in Swingers) where you want to stand up and cheer.  It's the tension between these moments of ""I can't watch this!"" to ""You just learned how to be a man!"" that gives this movie its great appeal to me.  When I first heard of the movie, I swore that I would never see it.  I heard of scenes with a pie, of awkward porno-magazine distribution scenes, of the endlessly repeated ""Band Camp"" lines, and of a guy using a tube sock to encase something other than his foot.  Yes, these are indeed gross, but you must realize they are realistic gross.  Whether or not they cross into gratuitousness is up to you, but I feel that this film's reputation as ""The Most Dangerous Film to Our Youth of All Time"" is undeserved.  The gross scenes appeal only to the easily-titillated, or social reformers who need an excuse to impose some more limits on what we watch.  Watch it for yourself, and how you really think.

296,Scott-4,"Best ""Getting Laid"" Movie I've Seen In Years",8,17 July 1999,"Wow, things have really changed since the ""Getting Laid"" movies of my generation.  Movies like ""Porky's"" and ""Losing It"" focus on the silly stuff that occurs when boys are trying to get laid.  ""Fast Times and Ridgemont High"" showed the girl's point of view.   With this movie, you get all that, along with (omigosh) actual relationships!Obviously the taboo of showing semen in a movie has been broken forever (thanks to ""Mary"").  But in spite of that, the movie has a lot of endearing moments, like when Jim's dad keeps giving him the birds-and-the-bees talks and catching him in the absolute most embarrassing masturbation situations.I think what makes the plot brilliant is how things turn so quickly for these five guys (counting Sherman) in the scoring game (or is it the game of life?).",American Pie

But the four guys who want to lose their virginity before graduation in this film are likeable and real, unlike in the former flick. What's more, it isn't as crass as it could have been, maybe because the girls here are smarter and the boys aren't totally without feelings. Other than that, there's no true redeeming social value, which is all good and well because it's July. It's also funny much more often than not, and even sweet at the end. One more thing: Alyson Hannigan steals the show as the dork who's more than she seems to be, and the now-famous line involving the flute isn't even her best one.",American Pie
298,GradeZ,You'll never look at Apple Pie the same way again.,8,6 August 1999,"There's really nothing spectacular about American Pie other than the fact that it really is funny as hell. I found myself in a state of general disbelief in several parts of the film (namely the opening scene and the now infamous pie scene which both featured humor at Jason Biggs' expense). Yeah, this movie is Porky's with better writing and more heart - but hey, so what? Who didn't love the Teenage Sex Comedy genre when it was on top years ago? Alright, movies like Meatballs Three sunk that ship (and rightfully so) but now the genre (as they all seem to do) has returned with a bang.Looking back on those movies from the eighties, the realization occurs that they just weren't all that funny. American Pie is very funny. There were points while watching Pie when I couldn't hear most of the follow up jokes to the big gags because the audience was laughing so loud. The characters (both male and female) are certainly likable enough even though it's not clear whether there is a future star amongst the young actors (though Biggs deserves something for his self-deprecation). However, proper accolades must go to veteran comedic actor Eugene Levy who is simply brilliant as Jim's straight-laced dad. It is their hilarious and at times very touching relationship that really shone through for me. Call me crazy but if there is any justice at the Oscars this year Levy will get a supporting actor nomination. But, alas, we all know that comic actors seldom get the nods they deserve from the academy (Murray got wrongfully slighted for Rushmore last year in my opinion).Overall, American Pie is perhaps the best Teenage Sex Comedy of all time. So, if you're starved for a delightful romp or if you've ever been to band camp",American Pie

I saw ""South Park"" the same day, and ""American Pie"" totally blew it away. The first scene is can't miss, so don't get to the theater late. On the outside, this film appears to be a buncha horny teens vowing to get laid by prom night. It looks like a totally distasteful movie. But you know, this movie is very tasteful. It's better than ""warm apple pie"", as they said in the movie. Sure, it has it's gross scenes, but you know, it's all done in relatively good taste. Despite the appearance that the message is for teens to have sex as soon as possible, it's not. There is a message which lies beneath. Sex is not the most important thing in high school, but it sure seems that way. There is a nice message, which plays in near the end of the movie.

This movie introduced the world to Jason Biggs (Jim), Shannon Elizabeth (Nadia, the foreign exchange student), Sean William Scott (Stifler), and Eugene Levy (Jim's Dad). Eugene Levy is the dad that every son wished he had. Eugene steals every scene he is in and is just so lovable. Jim(Biggs) is like just about every teenage boy, he just wants to get laid, but some of the things he does are unlike every teenage boy, I won't spoil it for those of you that haven't seen it but it's extreme. Stiffler is the instigator of everything and as guys know there's one Stifler in every group of friends. Nadia is the hot foreign exchange student who Jim wants and she is willing to let Jim have her..but is Jim up to the task? At one point they are in a situation, that every teenage boy has imagined himself being in, in Jim's room.This movie is hilarious and goes to extremes for laughs.

I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. Not only was it funny but there was tremendous character development in it. The plot moved forward with a solid conclusion.  It looked to me like a pretty accurate depiction of adolescent sexuality--its not all G rated, but then adolescence wasn't either.  Mr. Biggs is certainly not afraid to do wild things and perhaps his scenes are the most memorable in this movie--I chuckle just thinking about the ""illegal channels"" scene, for who in their adolescence hasn't explored auto-eroticism in fear of being discovered by his family?  His dancing scene in front of the computer camera perhaps will go down in the annals of comedy--at last something Lucy never did before!  Eugene Levy's sympathetic and somewhat understanding, but at the same time bumbling father role, was great.  My thinking was ""at least he's trying....""Even though there were no real bad guys, it looks to me that Sherman and Stifler got their just rewards in this movie too. Probably something a lot of teens have wished for with regard to similar characters in their high school experience, but were denied; for in my experience those characters also seemed to get away with their insensitivity to woman and untrue boasts far too often.  It was nice to see those types put in their place in this movie.  If you want a good romp in the field of sex comedy, this movie is worth watching.

It would have been easy to make a total fiasco out of such a movie, but this movie is well balanced and well made. The characters are likable and the acting good. Some of the gags are original, and I like the style of humour. It deals with teenage sexuality without overstepping the line for vulgarity and without being embarrassing. Another reason I liked it - and the reason for taping it - is that I hope it can break the barrier when it's my turn as a father to explain certain facts of life to my children in a few years. The movie shows teenagers that it's normal for everybody to be shy and awkward when first encountering love and sex, and that those who are bragging all over the place do it to project a false image. The movie shows what works and what doesn't work when looking for a girlfriend, and that certain pranks that go over the line can have serious consequences. It also shows teenagers that they are not weirdos if they have sexual desires or fantasies. That said, not everybody will like it. Certain will find the humour too gross.

317,LVWolfman,One of the best of its Genre,6,1 July 2000,"Thankfully, while not quite as raunchy as it was built up to be, American Pie was so just raunchy enough that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.While the billing made it appear to be just another Saturday Night Drive-In/""We vow to lose our virginity by graduation/prom night/16th birthday"", American Pie was truly funny and touching.There's a heavy dose of morals and ethics in the message here which is sneakily slid in among the beautiful women and comedic routines.",American Pie
318,Brad-61,A Porky's for the Internet generation,5,11 July 1999,"I was quite disappointed with this film, as it does not live up to its hype. It's basically the film version of a Penthouse Forum letter, with gorgeous high school girls being wooed by patheticly inept boys. American Pie is saved from being a total disaster by a tone of sweetness, which is mainly supplied by the female characters, who are far more realistic than the males. Really, do after prom parties turn into a night at the Playboy mansion, with everyone pairing off into different rooms for idyllic sexual bliss? This film should have aimed a little higher, and instead of trying to out-gross the Farrelly Brothers should have concentrated on further developing the plot.",American Pie

320,ili_o_matt_mcgregor_o_il,THIS is a comedy!!,10,17 April 2009,"American Pie tells the story of 4 young boys who are ""unlucky"" in love and all vow to loose their virginity before their High School prom night. With some great laughs scattered in along the way along with great acting talents this movie is a real treat. I first watched this movie last year for the first time (I just turned 15) and I suddenly realised how BAD some ""comedy"" films can be now-a-days. This film is the prime example of how a comedy aspect that, at one point was so original, is now tarnished by some of the movies that are produced now a days. Some of these movies are jokes now a days with basically the same story line and characters (ALTHOUGH REMAINED!), and all has a link back to sex!!!! American Pie is the first movie ever to do this sort of broad comedy and pulls it off very well and is a great film, although some films have copied the idea of this one and has dressed it up and makes it become quite a sick and offensive theme now-a-days. 10 years after this movie was made .. it's a classic and always will be. I love all of the first 3 movies with the original cast and was quite disappointed though i must say with one element in the third movie, which is that some characters do not return. I loved the characters Ozz, Vicky, Jessica and Heather and I thought that they all deserved back in the third and, especially Vicky as she and Kevin had a relationship in the 1st one and an awkward meeting in the 2nd and I thought that it would really pay-off seeing all of the main characters back together for one last time. But this didn't happen and, apart from this, all of the first 3 films are gems in my opinion. American Pie/American Pie 2/American Pie 3: The Wedding: FANTASTIC TRILOGY!! GIVE 'EM A TRY!!

There for your eternal viewing pleasure are the funniest moments of the film.

Not like Dawson's Creek or Varsity Blues. I could relate to so much in this movie--not that i ever got down with a pie or anything.

At least, I assumed it was a comedy, despite the fact that there was nothing even remotely laughable in it.  Anything that may have had even a small amount of humor was beaten to death by the commercials, so when it came up in the movie, all I could do was groan.  For example, all the jokes throughout the movie about the one kid's slut mom, and how everyone wanted to nail her were wasted, because everyone already knew that whateverhisnamewas would get her by the end of the movie, because it was in the commercial.  Same goes for the infamous pie scene.  If you want to shock people, don't show an edited, less interesting version of your shock scene in all the trailers, or put it on all the posters.  Perhaps had I not expected a pie to be molested, it would have been funny, but as it was, the scene was dull, at best.  I've seen ""Batman and Robin,"" and ""Chairman of the Board,"" yet this holds strong to the title of worst thing I've ever seen.  I wish I could give it negative stars, it was just awful.",American Pie

336,beatlesdudeireland,Humour is lost on some people,8,17 July 2012,"People tend to look upon American Pie as crude, misogynistic and crass. They scorn it because it reveres sex, and portrays what they call toilet humor and the decentralization of the American Youth. A lot of critics note that the movie focuses too much on losing virginity before college , rather than excelling in the academics to go to said College. What critics fail to see is that it is a movie designed for the open minded individual,and that no body really cares about ""academics"" with movies in similar vain to National Lampoon. People are too uptight these days. Demanding everything to be 'PC'. American Pie, may be lewd and rude, but it sure as hell is entertaining. Who can't respect the stellar performances of the four main characters. They all have different ways of achieving their ultimate goal, which lead to hilarious antics.One involves a web-cam, one involves an obnoxious jerk's mother, one pretending to love show-choir, the other trying to deceive his girlfriend. In the end of course they all achieve their goal, as in all comedies of the American Nature. Eugene Levy, commands praise as Jim's sex-crazed father, who supports his son's endeavor.

This is an amazingly funny and amusing sex comedy that will have your eyes glued to the TV set. The other good thing is that it has no limits to it's jokes like other movies where you need to be careful of how crude the jokes are. The storyline is great with four teen-aged boys make a pact to loose their virginity by Prom night as they fail to do so and it sends a message across to the audience.Steve Stiffler is very different to the second and the third and as I was watching the First film for the first time in a long while Stifler's swearing seemed a little forced.

Guy has violent diarrhea after so-called ""friend"" slips him some laxative.  Guy drinks beer with semen in it.  Guy prematurely ejaculates when he's about to have sex with his dream girl.

The fact that the actors had a good script helped, too.My only complaints about it are that it: 1) the first half is a little slow 2) at times, it becomes too much of a teen-exploitation, i.e. SHE'S ALL THAT, CAN'T HARDLY WAIT.

We can all relate to it.  There's really not much to say about the plot without giving away too many of the surprises, so I won't say much.  The biggest surprise award goes to Alyson Hannigan, who accomplishes more than any other actor with her limited screen time.  She does the same in Dead  Man on Campus. As far as nudity, there really is not that much, but for those of you who go for that (and who am I to judge?) you probably won't be disappointed.

I mean sure this isn't the subject matter that you guys grew up with, but times have changed, you can't deny that. Whats with you? Did you lose you sense of humor back in the 70s. Are things no longer found funny to you? A guy has two premature ejaculations in a matter of 2 minutes and your upset with this scene? 1st of all, come on this is funny to anyone, as long as you know what just happened, 2nd why are you upset with this scene? It's humorous to us. Some guy wrote that this movie shows how the younger society is going down the drain. Not wanting to get off the subject of movies, I'll keep my society opinions to myself. This movie is more about going farther with sex humor than before, not about our society getting worse. As society goes on, more and more stuff that was banned in the past is allowed to be aired. Law & Order Special Victims Unit recently allowed the s-word to be said on t.v.

350,Samtheshrikker,"Pure, unbridled joy...",8,4 March 2015,"Let's not beat about it, American Pie is hilarious. Its crude, raunchy humour and frequently outrageous giggles will leave you scoffing with a mixture of bowel crunching laughter and light shock. Like most teen movies, it's extremely cheesy, but once you get past that, it's only too easy to fall into seeing the flick the way it was intended... without a shred of seriousness. The plot is simple enough. Four high school seniors pledge to lose their virginity before their fast approaching senior prom. The actors are at their best together, where the totally outrageous script truly doesn't hold back. By far the best feature of American Pie is its on-screen gags, which are both frequent and clever. They're outright brilliant, and will make you howl with laughter. However, for those who view their cinema closely, American Pie is also an exploration into coming of age. You get the impression that the boys are desperately on the cusp of bridging the gap between teenager and adult. Such an impression is all too easy to relate to, and viewers may feel all overcome with nostalgia at the eventful house parties and sexual banter. American Pie is comedy gold. It's utterly without dignity, but that's what makes it so wonderful. Sure, the acting's nothing special, but it's the boys' experiences that make it such a laugh. The plot and characters are strong enough that the film isn't totally ridiculous, but it's so cheeky and funny that it's become a popular classic.",American Pie

Obviously those leaving bad reviews are a lot younger and don't realise the contemporary movie landscape.The American Pie formula has been used a lot since its release but in its time, it was fairly original. It has humour, some of it cringeworthy toilet/sex humour granted, but it still makes me laugh out loud and turn away in disgust.Then there are the poignant moments, the coming-of-age stuff that makes watching it worthwhile. The superficial pact the friends make is superseded by the various realisations each of them has by the end of the film.When rating a film I always ask myself: does it present itself the best way it can? do the actors do their jobs well? does it tell the story? does it evoke emotion or thought? And the answer to all of these is a resounding yes. Ergo, it deserves a high rating.Plus, it coined the term ""MILF"" and many of these unknown actors went on to have fairly successful careers afterwards.

Movies that came out after this in the same vein like Superbad weren't much better either. Just juvenile humor about sex and other silly teenage crap.There is nothing thought provoking about this film.

I am also not going to lecture the film industry either on gradually shifting the limits of comedy to the point where story is no longer a critical aspect provided that you can put the characters into as many embarrassing and disgusting scenes as possible or on how despite the films rating which supposedly restricts admittance to those 17 and over (yeah, right), it is a perfect example of Hollywood's marketing to an audience for whom it maybe shouldn't be.American Pie is a textbook case of all of the above points.  It's plot, high school seniors vow to lose their virginity by graduation, sinks beyond unoriginal and enters blatant cliche territory.  But, the fact that you get to see one of the characters masturbate with baked goods makes up for it in the laugh department.That said, American Pie was NOT a bad movie and for that matter I DID like it...sort of.  It's characters were certainly likeable enough and somewhat sympathetic.  And indeed, I caught myself laughing at things that I probably wouldn't want to admit to.However, like so many teen sex comedies before it (however much more explicit this one is in relative comparison) it is stale and  predictable.
A few redeeming performances, notably Chris Klein who, although, seems to be playing the exact same character as he did in Election, comes off honest and refreshing.  Even more notably, Eugene Levy, who more or less using his comic genius managed to add hilarity to an otherwise dreary work.",American Pie

If you are interested in seeing every bodily function performed, this is your movie. Let's see... We had saliva, urine, vomit, bowel movements, and semen.  We also had zero character development, juvenile plot exposition, and every, I mean every teen movie cliche imaginable.  We had the Mrs. Robinson effect, the jock plays sensitive, the sex wagering, the ragging on nerds, the elitist scotch drinking teen, the bumbling parents, the drunken divorce, band nerds, etc.  Come on Hollywood, this movie stunk.  I am quite sure 13 and 14 years olds will love this stuff, but no one else should.  Ignore those who think this is the best movie of the year or some classic throwback comedy. It is certainly not.",American Pie

But who cared? American Pie was great - I laughed all the way through.  I'd gone in expecting to watch a toilet-humour fuelled attack of the teens and came out thinking I'd finally seen a film which managed to capture the brain function of my friends.  It wasn't packed with big-breasted low brain-cell count girls, and the guys weren't of the all-American type.  I laughed with my mates, and cried with my date.  What more can you ask?",American Pie

This was one of them...i have already seen it twice. An important part of this movie is that I don't really think anyone over 30 can really enjoy the comedy.  They don't understand how perverted and sick teenagers are these days.  Not only did I laugh out of my seat but I was also touched as well.  It had memorable characters, friendships and a strong plot.  If you even think it has anything to do with Something About Mary then you were only paying attention to the masterbation and in turn missed the humor all together.",American Pie

362,jayekrohn,"Male counterpart to the ""chick flick""",10,12 February 2003,"American Pie should be taken out of the category of 'teen comedy' and to me, should be placed under a special video store category called ""The Male Counterpart To The Chick-Flick."" Most men can probably relate to the humor in the film in a way that only the most fussy or virtuous male could not. It is funny in a towel-snapping, vulgarity-spewing, sexual one-upmanship way, a real ""guy"" film. Studies show that most men think of sex approximately once every three minutes; this film reflects a compressed thought process in a man's late teens when the hormones are a-ragin'. Sex is fantasized about, idealized and bragged about (although often with no corroborating truth). Women can say, ""guys, you just don't get it"" at a For Women Only or Vagina Monologues get-together, but this is a film that mirrors what growing up from boy to man is about. The film stars Jason Biggs as the dopey, sexually naive Jim Levinstein, under duress to meet the deadline of losing his virginity by the end of prom night. Along with Jim are his three high school buddies, Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Oz (Chris Klein), and Paul (Eddie Kaye Thomas). These characters are symbolic of high school cliques; Kevin, good looking, popular; Oz, the jock; and Paul, the eccentric intellectual. The fifth wheel is Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), a teammate of Oz's and son of a divorced mom, who has the run of the house, dad's money to burn and a mouth, well, worse than a sailor's. As true in high school, people gravitate to Steve Stifler's house (not to Steve, really, he's hunky, but an insufferable pig) to take advantage of his monied hospitality, endless weekend parties, and, for the testosterone-charged, a portrait of his svelte mother on the wall. The character of Jim's father, only known to the audience as Mr. Levinstein, is played by Eugene Levy. It is on the relationship between Jim and his dad that a supporting foundation is built for the film. What man doesn't recall in a profoundly agonizing way the ""father-son"" talk? It is remarkably performed by Levy. But he is a father who loves, and hugs, his son despite Jim's embarrassed protestations. Without going into a great deal of (unprintable) detail, the film centers around the pact between the four friends, and a typical teen male's challenges: uninterrupted masturbation, excelling at sports, the battle of peer pressure and self-esteem, partying and drinking illegally, and having a long enough relationship with a woman in order to make it on prom night (""trophy"" dates gladly received). Of course, college is a given for all, it's only a matter of a few more months to enjoy freedom. The female roles, starring Tara Reid as Kevin's steady girlfriend, Vicky; Natasha Lyonne as Tara's older and sexually wiser friend Jessica; Mena Suvari as Oz's girl, Heather; and Jim's European exchange student and fantasy-of-the-month Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), give the film added complexity. Alyson Hannigan plays the hilarious Michelle, the cultist music student; she ends up being Jim's date as a last resort. Paul Finch, Jim's scotch-swilling friend, starts a rumor about the size of his ""equipment"" in order to get a prom date, but is tripped up by Stifler. Finch attends the prom alone, but revenge is sweetly his. After the post-prom party at Stifler's cottage, the buddies gather round--revealing their stories. Sex turns out to be really just a part (although pleasurable part) of what makes the earth spin, a part of being a man, and in many cases, overrated. Welcome to the real world, men. American Pie was marketed as one of a multitude of modern ""coming of age"" teen films, yet was vastly different from the genre. Although the film remains true to form with sight-gags and gross-out sexual comedy, it veers off the formulaic path by a plot that develops relationships between individuals that are actually endearing to watch. If you are willing to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride, the nostalgia trip is well worth it. All faint-hearted need not apply.",American Pie
363,Zephyr75,"Sexy, Good American Fun...",8,17 March 2004,"If i'm in the mood for a sexy good time as far as film goes, then I know I can count on my copy of American Pie. It's the one movie that i've watched time and time again since it was first released on dvd, and have found it to be interesting each time I see it. Truthfully my all time favorite scene has to be Jim and Nadia in his bedroom, and her making him strip for the unbeknowest to her camera. This is the one film that can now be landmarked as an american treasure right along with the classic Animal House. Of course the two are totally different films, but good old natured fun in both aspects. Another thing I loved about AP was the ensemble casting. It's like looking at my own circle of friends that I went to high school with. That's another reason for my liking this film so much, just for the pure reflection of it all, and the overall genius in the humor.",American Pie
364,beckyandcutie,I'm 14 . . . and I hated this movie!!,1,27 November 2005,"I had always heard that ""American Pie"" was so hilarious!!! Now let me say that I had heard this from a bunch of teenagers, when I was 12. They were my age. Even when I was 12 I really didn't like kids or teenagers that much because I though they were completely stupid and so foolish, actually laughing at the sex and toilet humor that they think is hilarious. This movie was full of them, and I was perplexed on how anybody could really find this cute. Personally I think it's disgusting and repulsive, not to mention embarrassing and diminishing to one's reputation. How do you think people regard me? They think I actually am that intelligent. Ew. Back to the movie. I have to say besides the jokes, the movie plot was horrible, very fragile and frail, like a building with a poorly constructed frame. It really had no purpose. They wanted to lose their virginity by prom night? Whoop-dee-doo, there is barely a teenager who doesn't. Way to be unique. The acting wasn't the best I've ever seen, but then again I don't really like most of the actors. I don't really like Tara Reid that much. To me she never picked character's that I actually sympathized with. What disappoints me most about this film, and many recent films, is that they seem to take teen sex, or sex outside of marriage, as some little joke, like it doesn't matter. I'm a Catholic, but this really doesn't have to do with anything about my faith. Sex is a deep expression of love and something that should not be taken lightly, especially since the only reason they want to screw you is to for their own pleasure, or their own sick goals, like in this noble movie(ew). With all the pregnancies, abortions and sexually transmitted diseases, sex is not as carefree (if it ever was) as it used to be, and it doesn't help when Hollywood promotes it as a selling point. Oh my goodness, grow up already!",American Pie
365,howelly,I LOVED THAT MOVIE,10,7 July 1999,"When I went to see the special sneak prevue, for the movie I knew It was going to be funny.  I didn't know however, how much I was going to love that movie.  Granted a lot of the jokes, are crude, but they made everyone in the theater laugh.  That's what a movie is supposed to do, entertain people and American Pie did just that.It's more then just a bunch of guys trying to get laid.  It shows how four very different types of guys come of age, during the last couple of months of school.  It shows how important friendship is during high school and even though girls may come and go, friendship is a very important thing during your years of high school.  The movie showed that.  The movie was great, any on 15 years or older, I would suggest you go out and see this movie, because American Pie is a fantastic movie.",American Pie
366,JeffCNN,Another reason that the summer of '99 is the Season of Comedy,8,12 July 1999,"I laughed so hard I spit out half the bucket-o-pop I was drinking, and finally had to stop sipping from its fine nectar, because so many times I was hooting and bending over in joy.There are some slower moments to let you catch your breath and allow for moments of sincerity, but only for a minute. The scenes in the previews (the ones you think will ruin the movie for you) are expounded on ten-fold, so there are plenty of surprises.During the movie I kept saying, ""This is me and my friends when we were in high school!"" They were almost the same conversations about life, sex and girls; just not as frequently, but it's only a two-hour film. Any guy will appreciate American Pie full tilt, and girls will realize just what hoops guys jump through in order to get their attention, let alone in their pants.What added to American Pie is that I liked every character, because the filmmakers didn't feel the urge to give us prototypical teen characters. Their personalities are distinctive, and their situations are all different, which leads to a hilarious finale where we see just how their pact plays out on prom night.As I mentioned before, there are genuine moments on the screen where the guys and gals have revelations of sincerity. It adds a needed depth to a film like this, where it's not just raw, raunchy comedy, but important to the lives of the characters who know more than sex is at stake. Which is another reason to like Pie, there are several slices, and sexual conquest is only one of them.",American Pie
367,Mr. Fish-3,Pale ale??,9,18 November 1999,"Ho ho ho.  This is one of those films that makes you think ""Yes, it is good to be alive, and yes, being 18 was DAMN fun."" A superb film by anyone's standards, marred only perhaps in its dubious moral-soaked fables towards the end, this is definitely one to watch. The humour is toilet humour, sure, but its toilet humour dressed up in a tweed jacket and smoking a pipe, whilst listening to some good jazz. Male or female, old or young, I recomend this film.  It has some classic scenes (pie, anyone?) and some good gags. Comparable, perhaps, to Something About Mary, but tenfold funnier.",American Pie

If you want us teens to just sit around and pretend we don't know anything and all the world is just ""ducky"" fine they we would be lying to you.  American Pie is a relality comedy which is very rare. It was so hysterical because it was SO true.  I had tears rolling down my face from laughing so hard. I would highly recommend it to everyone who wants a good laugh and to anyone who is not embarrassed easily. Just a note: Don't see it with the rents!!!! :)",American Pie

I'm a 21 year old university student and I expected a fun movie and that's exactly what I got. In fact, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It's a gross-out film with a moral conscience, though it perhaps lays it on a tad too thick. I don't want to give away too much, but alot of the things that occur are just implausible and ridiculous. And that's why I found it a barrel of laughs. You'll find yourself laughing along with the characters, while some moments will make you squirm and force you to ask yourself, 'Did that ever happen to me?' It's a question many of us may not like the answer to. This is a fun film that I think should be seen by those who are out of school, rather than those still there. It's also good to see Eugene Levy again.",American Pie

I figured you had to be under 17 in order to stomach the movie.  I finally rented it because I was bored the other week and felt like watching some cheesy movies.  I was expecting it to be this generation's ""Porky's"", and I was pleasantly surprised.I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard at a movie.  All the lines and attempts the guys use to pick up girls are so cheesy, but you can see how a high school guy could actually try to use some of the lines/methods (... I said *some*).  You don't have to be in high school to enjoy this movie (although it wouldn't hurt).  You also shouldn't be expecting anything too deep.  This is just a comedy about some high school guys trying to get lucky.  If you liked ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off"", you'll like this. Although it's a better movie since it doesn't have all the situations that would never happen like F.B.D.O. does.The movies I watched in high school were all basically just made to show tits.  This actually relies on humor instead of nudity (although there is some nudity).

I had always watched the second and third films from start to finish and enjoyed them. The first one is not my favorite out of the three but it still has the whole comic relief thing going on that I enjoy. It shows how all anyone can ever think of in Highschool is sex. No one wants to go to college a virgin. The young men make a pact that by graduation they will all have sex and not go to college a virgin. Jim is interested in Nadia, a young very attractive European girl and he finds love with someone other than Nadia,he finds love with the ""band geek"" Michelle. Kevin is interested in Vicky, a very attractive blonde that he has been going out with but who has never been pleasured. In hopes to ""pleasure"" her he calls his older brother that then tells Kevin in the library there is a ""Sex Bible"". Oz is interested in Heather and she is interested in him. Although Stifler makes rude obscene comments about the pairs relationship. She believe that Oz is another Jock who all he wants is to get in her pants, but the pair find love in an unexpected place at Michigan State singing competition. Finch really doesn't have an interest in anything but Stifler's mom. The M.I.L.F of the movie. They all achieve their goals of having sex by graduation after prom.",American Pie
375,zach__anderson,A Teen Movie That Works (Spoilers Included),8,3 February 2003,"While I usually hate teen movies, the only series that I think has the ability to stand above the whole lot of them would be the American Pie series (that being American Pie & AP 2).What worked for the first release was the colorful characters, who at the time of this release were pretty much unknown.  While there was a lot of crude humor, high school itself for most people was probably the time in their lives where they were at their crudest levels.  Basically, the message of the film boils down to a teenager's view on sex (especially from the perspectives of 4 male virgins).The humor of American Pie depends almost solely on the presence of Steve Stifler, who was played brilliantly by Seann William Scott.  He plays the sexually active, egotistical jock that was worshipped by his friends, and while loathed by the band geeks and computer nerds, everybody really wants to be like him.  This character DEFINED Scott's career, and it is a character which he is truly a master of.Now, about the virgin teenager male's perception of sex.  What's great about this film is the presentation of the humor and seriousness about losing one's virginity.  On one side, we see the semi-nerd Jim have a laughable encounter with the band geek, as well as Finch pulling of a Graduate-esque romp with Stifler's mother.  On the other, more serious side, we see Kevin wind up doing something with his girlfriend which he ultimately winds up regretting in the morning; and Chris, the love-struck jock/choir boy who actually gets this sex thing right.Ultimately, this is a great coming of age film that does a great job showing us that while sex can be fun and really enjoyable, there are serious aspects that need to be addressed as well.  And honestly, who doesn't remember themselves or other people doing the stuff in this film when they were in high school?",American Pie

Though initially suspicious of this movie (how can a stupid Hollywood comedy about high school kids be any different than all others), I ended up delighted. This is something different. What makes the film great is an excellent cast (the youngsters from this film are unbelievable) and the absence of that stupid consumer-society predictability that colors all those commercial Hollywood productions.

It is a very wild comedy that is a constant barrage of utterly embarrassing sexual situations that our cast of teens are put through.  The cast does a great acting job.  The plot is kind of weak, but doesnt really matter.  Its the humor in this movie that gets high marks in my opinion.  I would highly recommend this movie if you are into very vulgar sex comedy.

I can see why younger audiences might like this film because there's really nothing to compare it to.  As for the 24+ crowd, we've seen this before during the early and mid 80's. I hate to say this, but AMERICAN PIE makes PORKY'S seem like an AFI top 100 film.  At least with the latter, there was more plot to it than just trying to get laid before a certain time period.  I've seen a more developed plot in a haiku than AMERICAN PIE.  And as for the humor, every joke you could see coming from a mile away.  It seemed that filmmakers went to great lengths to set up every one of the jokes, even if that meant compromising the story, or lack of, with contrived elements to make the joke work. Wait ten years and watch this movie again and I'm sure you will have a much different spin on it.And for those of you who are comparing this to THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY... please don't!  TSAM is such a better film because the humor seems very spontaneous, and the film is made by people who understand how to get a legitimate laugh.

I first saw this movie about a year ago, and have seen it about 10 times over again. The thing that spoke to me most was the excellent casting of all the actors and their interaction. They really looked like good friends who grew up together, and whole picture of them working their way through the end of High School was so familiar to me. I felt with those guys, and could image myself in the same spot. Added to that is a healthy dose of good humour (in its genre), making it a movie that amuses me over and over again.And please, do not say that you're grossed out by it, that's about the same as saying that you went to see Nightmare on Elm Street and got scared. This movie is MENT to gross people out, probably especially Americans, for whom sex is still a big taboo. I wasn't grossed out by a masturbation scene, of course not, the only thing one could see even were some boobs, and I've seen those before. The pie scene was, in my opinion, just funny because of its oddness, and because of the great acting of Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy.Yep, this is certainly one of my favorites, I can watch this thing over and over again, and still be amused.

Most of those films however, will leave you at the theater exit. Such is not the case for American Pie. This is a one of the rarest films I've ever seen that has the ability to gross you out one minute, have your stomach hurting from laughing the next minute, take you to emotional depths that will connect with you on a personal level the next minute, and then the next minute, do all three. This film doesn't just aim to gross you out or make you laugh. The film is so genuine and there is a connection between that cast that oozes off the screen and into the audience. I first saw this film when I was five years out of high school, and my only disappointment after finishing it was that I never caught it in high school with my buddies. I graduated in 09 so it was a few years past the American Pie craze, but I immediately felt a connection to the East Great Falls class of 99, and would have given anything to have been high school age sitting in a theater that summer.

This isn't good, self-conscious potty humor of the ""There's Something About Mary"" variety; this is more along the lines of little kids snickering at hearing ""poo-poo."" Sure, there were amusing parts, but those were so contrived (as bad scripts tend to be), the laughter wasn't of the unstoppable sides-aching type. And really, the stories behind those gags were just so cliched (not even trying to do something new and creative with old cliches!) and boringly executed, I felt like I was watching a paint-by-numbers movie.

If you are a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer on TV, you had an added shock to see they character played by the actress who plays ""Willow"" on Buffy.",American Pie
393,roarlions1,"Outrageous, lives up to its billing",9,10 July 1999,American Pie really sets the standard for teen comedy as we head into the next millenium.  Enough jokes to keep you laughing and enough of a story to keep you interested.  A must see!,American Pie
394,OPERATOR-4,"A Wonderful Movie, Not To Miss!",10,23 July 1999,"""American Pie"" is a movie that I happen to like tremendously.  Some parts of it were funny.  The overall context of this film deals with friendship and romance issues, in addition to the sex-related material.  Although most of the actors have not been in movies before, I thought that they did a fantastic job of bringing their characters to life.  I recommended this movie to all my friends and family. This movie is so wonderful that nobody should miss it!  In my opinion, it is way better than ""10 Things I Hate About You"".",American Pie

396,Lintjello,funniest movie in a while,10,13 July 1999,"Sweet Jesus this movie is hilarious. It brings back so many high school memories, and even if it's been a while since you graduated you'll still appreciate this movie. It deals with teenage coming-of-age and sexuality in a frank yet funny way. It does feature some so-called ""gross out humor"" but it's not bothersome at all and is actually damn funny, so you should dig it unless you have a giant stick up your... well, you know. The hairgel scene in There's Something About Mary and the ""coffee"" scene in Austin Powers 2 are worse...

The performances were solid all around and the screenplay was fabulous.  Herz, as well as Outside the Box scribes Jonathan Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, will likely be the big names in film comedy for the next 20 years.  This film will be a blockbuster.",American Pie
398,DaLlama,I just don't know...,6,4 January 2000,"Why is it so hard to really say why American Pie just didn't do it for me? My expectations, perhaps? Of course, like any movie you have a feel for what you hope to _get_ out of the movie right before the lights dim...I was expecting something outrageous and over-the-top, especially because I had the Unrated DVD starting to spin. I mean, this cut couldn't even land an 'R' rating. South Park did (although certain MPAA members came out later ""regretting"" their decision to shy away from the dreaded NC-17), so I was expecting something on par. Truth is, American Pie bogied, if not three-putted. It had a throw away message (sort of like South Park, but less campy and almost taken seriously, a definite negative) about the virtues of beating down peer pressure. It had forgettable characters and  a weak script. But that's hardly why I was excited to see it...I wanted pure, unadulterated, NC-17 teetering outrageousness...and I didn't get that.The mutilated pie was funny. And I never really thought about how useful a flute might be...but that was about it...all the gags seemed so...forced. I couldn't tell if I was supposed to take the movie seriously or not, and that's its inherent flaw. If you're going for the push-the-envelope gusto, by all means strap on the booster rockets and GO (which, by the way, was a far better movie chronicling the outrageousness of teen angst.). Jim and the gang were so...serious, and even if that was the intent, it wasn't very amusing as it unfolded. For example, as Jim consistently struck out with a man on first, I really didn't care...it didn't HURT, hit the brotherly sympathy nerve, like the answering machine scene in Swingers. All the characters were positively dull and terribly zero-dimensional.I don't mean to analyze this movie to death although I probably just did, which makes me something of a hypocrite. The bottom line is that it's supposed to transcend critical review and just be damn funny, no more and no less. But it wasn't and that's what made me wonder, Why?",American Pie
399,D-Gen-X,A Very Satirical Story of Teenage Sexuality,10,1 January 2000,"Like ""There's Something About Mary"", this is one comedy that would make you constantly say ""OH NO!!"" and chuckle really hard.  But this time, it's about 4 teenagers who want to lose their virginity before their high school graduation.WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD WITH SOME CRUDE SEXUAL LANGUAGE. One the teenagers is Jim, perhaps the main character of the film because we've all seen the VERY PRIVATE side of him.  The guy was a total loser on trying to score on the ""Eastern European"" chick, Nadia.  First he makes a total a** of himself when he ""tries"" to get into a conversation with her at a party, only to laugh like a dork; then he ""tries"" to ""experiment"" with an apple pie, which he successfully does ONLY TO GET CAUGHT BY HIS DAD!!!  I mean my God!!!  What's wrong with this guy??  Is that typical teenage stuff? I doubt it.  Well at least he succeeds into getting Nadia naked in his room, but then (while being broadcasted LIVE on the Internet) he ejaculates not once but twice before she could even get on him!!  
Oz, the jock, is probably someone we can all relate to.  We all want to accomplish being with the person of our dreams (him joining the jazz choir to score with a cute girl), but then we end up getting dumped (Oz insulting her with the other jocks behind her back) and decided to ""be ourselves"" (Oz REALLY practicing the jazz choir solo for a contest); then perhaps that special someone may come along (her coming back to Oz, and then some [cough] more).  Honest.  All Kevin and his on-and-off girlfriend did was talk about sex.  Only Kevin starts the conversation (and then some more) and she ""tries"" to refute that.The best one (and perhaps the funniest) was Finch.  He was a total loser, but then he eventually scores with Stifler's (another jock) mom, whom the guys call a M.I.L.F. (Mother I'd Like to F***).  Finch played this thing really smooth.There was a lot of realism in the story, considering the fact that it's teenage nature to explore sexuality, but very satirical (and raunchy).  It's funny, fresh, and actually fearless (for filming some of the things that kids below 13 shouldn't see).  A 10!!",American Pie
400,Mike-969,Sheer Brilliance,10,4 October 1999,"American Pie is sheer brilliance.  This movie truly captures the essence of the American high school male.  Contrary to what other commentators have noted, every high school male has one primary objective: to get laid. This movie definitely captures the angst associated with that quest.This movie is beyond funny. Although many have compared it to Porky's, it has taken this genre to a new level. Let's hope with see more of this high quality film making.",American Pie
401,-Auriex-,Unique view on high-school,9,18 January 2000,"I first saw this movie as it was probably intended to be viewed -- sitting in a room with a few of my male college friends.For the film itself, I feel that it speaks true to a lot of the stereotypes portrayed in many peoples minds.  Talking to a few of the people that have seen the film, they usually touch on the point of how they feel that the ""High-school"" theme was extremely exaggerated throughout the movie.  I would agree with that to an extent, though I do believe that a lot of the underlying principles portrayed in the film strike at the heart of what high-school does to the mentality of some of the kids there.  That they only touched on one of the aspects of our glorious education system...But my small rant is over -- and to sum up, I truly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to any that feel they can handle it's mature content.  I don't need to delve in to what I mean by 'mature content'; most of the people that went to see this movie already knew what the main climactic scene in it was.9 out of 10",American Pie

We were sitting at the ail, so we could make an easy escape. But soon we noticed we were laughing out loud. We even cried real tears laughing. It is true that the jokes were mostly stupid and mostly about sex (after all, it's all about a bunch of guys deciding to loose their virginity before graduating), it is also true that you could see them coming from miles away. But this was certainly not a movie about t+a-jokes. It was simply great fun.",American Pie

These were the sort of people I would go out of my way to avoid.The ""gags"", or rather the situations I had to imagine the writers thought would be gags, were unfunny in the extreme.  They seemed to try to use shock tactics rather than genuine comedy.  Unfortunately, they managed to neither shock nor amuse me.In conclusion.  What a waste of time.",American Pie
404,Ice_Queen19,"A very stereotyped, comedy concerning the extremities of High School Life",4,6 May 2003,"I saw this movie a few years ago when I was around 14. I must say, I was pretty disturbed with some parts of the movie, especially since I saw this as a freshman in high school. Thinking back on it, it was a mostly an amusing movie with a weak plot. The main character in this movie, Jim Levinstein (Jason Biggs), is a senior in high school and he is urging his girlfriend, Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), to have sex with him.  In the end she does after the senior prom. Jim tries everything from giving her an orgasm through oral sex to sweet-talking/persuasion. This story is surrounded by the issues of Jim¡¯s schoolmates, Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Chuck Sherman (Chris Owen).  Jim and his friends make a ¡°pact¡± to all get laid (have intercourse) before high school graduation. All of his friends succeed, except for Chris, who ends up finding his ¡°true love,¡± Heather (Mena Suvari). There are many entertaining scenes, especially with Jim¡¯s father (Eugene Levy), Jim getting caught many times doing¡¦ erm.. ¡°inappropriate things.¡± It is a stereotyped movie that adds funny scenes concerning high school, senior prom, and sex. I¡¯m sure some of this happens in the high schools around the US, but I¡¯m sure that not all students have sex after senior prom, as this movie alludes.",American Pie
405,Wickidforreal,It is the defining teen/college comedy of the new generation,10,29 August 2003,"I think anyone who writes a bad review of this film must think that they are 'above' this style of humour which the film uses.All I can suggest to them is that they eat a slice of 'humble pie' and realise that being immature is actually great fun!This is without a doubt the landmark teen comedy of the new generation. In the late 70's, Animal House was the one that officially started it all. Then, in the 80's, Fast Times at Ridgemont High was the landmark teen comedy. Then, in the late 90's, came American Pie. It took us into the new Millennium with two more installments which I would rate as highly as, if not better than, the original! Now, I am looking forward to seeing what the landmark teen comedy of the 2000's is!There is a pattern that seems to have emerged... Each landmark film makes at least one of its cast a star. Animal House made John Belushi a cult legend (and Tim Matheson also to an extent), Fast Times made the film careers of multiple actors who today are household names (Pheobe Cates, Judge Reinhold, Sean Penn to name but a few), and American Pie gave new found success to Sean William Scott (and also gave Jason Biggs some star status). And that is just a brief overview.Its a true comedy gem and it will definitely go down in the film history books with its name etched next to Animal House and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, among other classics.",American Pie
406,dumb_brunette,Great Movie!,9,5 May 2005,"I really enjoyed this movie. I agree it is side-splittingly funny, though there are some more tender moments - etc when Kevin and Vicky first sleep together. The song' Sway' by Bic Runga is a perfect accompanying song to this moment. The entire soundtrack to this movie is great, I haven't bought it...yet. I also enjoyed how the film ended with Vicky becoming more independent and practical when she realised it wasn't going to work with Kevin - strong woman! It was also good how Oz remains a virgin, proving that this wasn't just about guys getting laid - there were also tender emotions and heart-felt feelings in there. This has everything - comedy, teenage romance, cute guys and girls...I really recommend seeing it!",American Pie

Words can't describe the brilliance of horny teenage guys. And hey this movie can be very educational. ha ha No but seriously do watch it.

It's one of the funniest American teen comedies, and yes.. this movie defined the lives of the teenagers that grew up in the 90s. It's not a deep, heart-breaking story, it is not complicated. It's fun, it makes me laugh every time I see it on TV (which is often) And of course, one of the funniest scenes (and everyone will remember it) is the pie scene, Jason Biggs was the perfect choice for the role, and his father is so hilarious, his bushy eyebrows and his attempts to talk to his son about puberty makes this movie an original one.",American Pie

It's one of the most stupid films ever made, that belongs to the stupid-film movement of the 90's and 2000's (Big Momma's House, Scary Movie, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo). This kind of films have a lot of non sense jokes about sex or any idiot thing you like. For example, every time they say ""boobs"" or ""pinus"" the whole audience start to laugh. Why? It's all part of the human nature and sex is a serious thing. If you are a Person that likes quality films, a warning: don't watch this.

410,Andrew-6,Better than some... worse than others...,7,6 July 1999,"Well, I, like many of the other people who've commented on this flick, had high expectations going in. I was let down, but not as much as some people. This film is funny. Much more than most other films I've seen this year (but, I must say, that isn't saying much). And I'd also like to add, this is, again IMO, better than most 'teen flicks'.Now, here's my take on the flick... Masturbation plays a big part in here... This isn't bad, and the scenes, IMO, worked for comic effect without being too sick.The acting wasn't that bad, it could've been worse. A couple of the actors worked for me: Alyson Hannigan (She's funny, what can I say?), Natasha Lyonne (as always) and Chris Klein (of 'Election' Fame). Let me explain the last one... Chris Klein has played both of his characters he's had this far, well, vacant. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that he's a bad actor (or vacant for that matter)... I think it's intentional, that's why it works.And, my take on the whole 'teen flick' bit... This is a teen flick, plain and simple. However, I don't think this film is just for teen, adults can appreciate the humor too. Though it is sad that they'll probably think that the vacantness of the characters is an overstatement. Unfortunately, it isn't, it's more of an understatement.To conclude... all and all, this film is worth a look. Make that a look at matinee prices (don't blow $10 or $12 on it).",American Pie
411,Capps,"Finally, a true teen comedy!",8,6 July 1999,"In a year of- no wait, scratch that- in a decade of major league disappointments in the genre of teen cinema, Universal Pictures has finally delivered a flick that lives up to the standards of such raunchy classics as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porkys.American Pie is a genuinely funny film. While it seems as though most of the gross out humor is a blatant result of the success of There's Something About Mary, the laughs truly are quite original and not forced. The film is reminiscent of when John Hughes was writing in his prime in the mid-late '80s, back when teen comedies actually appealed to teens with true emotion and hysterics.While the script is very well written, the cast is really the driving force behind the film. American Pie would not have been half as funny had there been ""IT"" boys and girls such as Freddie Prinze and Jennifer Love in it. Actors such as Jason Biggs and Natasha Lyonne are the true stars to watch out for nowadays. The expressions, deliveries, and characterizations are priceless all around the board. Each individual actor expresses his/her character with a certain sense of pragmism and originality that it's hard not to like any one of them.I don't think I really need to discuss the plot or some of the best scenes in the film because they really have to be seen to be appreciated. Just make sure that while going to the local multiplex to catch the latest big budget filmmaking disaster of the '90s, you save a little room inside your cerebrum of entertainment to catch an outstandingly funny, smart, and emotionally satisfying flick that might not be sold out on two screens.",American Pie
412,shecky-2,Entertainment for Entertainment's Sake,9,11 July 1999,"Okay, I've never seen Porky's.  Not on video, I've seen it on TV.  Every reviewer in the country is calling American Pie ""rehashed Porky's.""  And yeah, it might be, but who cares?  It's a new generation, and, to be quite honest, American Pie was good.  Damn good.  Entertaining and everything.What distinguishes American Pie from other high school comedies?  There's no unlikeable characters.  It gives you such a great feeling because you've known the characters in the movie when you were in high school.  The characters do what you expect them to do.  When Jason Biggs' character has a naked girl in his room, you yell at the screen for him to go to her, just like his friends persuade him to do.The dorky guy that you know is lying about having sex, the butthead athlete that you like because he's so funny and stupid, the pretty cool athlete that straddles being king of the school and being himself, the guy who is just obsessed with sex, the dorky guy that hangs out with the semi-popular click, the couple that has been dating forever but aren't having sex, the chick that is so smart about life, the band geek that's got a wild streak. These are all characters we've known, and that's why it's easy to relate to them.The power of American Pie is that it is not an artistically done movie, and it doesn't try to be.  It knows it's not going to win any awards.  It is a low-budget comedy with Eugene Levy that's main purpose for existence is to entertain.  And really, isn't that what all films should do?",American Pie

His questions about sex are questions that many kids ask, but questions that no other movie has put into action. Most kids these days are exactly like that, watching porn, reading porn etc. The character of Steve Stifler, brilliantly played by Seann William Scott, is a character everyone can relate to. A smart mouthed, good looking, popular, rich guy. In almost every school around, there is at least one person, who will remind you of Stifler.

Saved by the Bell deals with the homework, principal, SCHOOL related issues of a teenagers life, while American Pie deals with the sex, beer, LIFE related issues of a teenagers life.This movie is not as funny as There's Something About Mary, but it is better.  When you watch Mary for a second time and know all the jokes, it just isn't a good movie.  In Pie, there's a human side to the story which will pull you back to watch the movie again.Some of the comments here would lead you to believe this whole movie is about masturbation, but I can only recall two scenes (maybe 5 minutes tops) which dealt with masturbation in the entire movie.

This film plays on the ""hang-ups"" that are trademarks of the time.... the pressure to get laid, masturbation, the use of the internet and other technology, etc.  The shock value in this film was amazingly high, which I thought is what made the film what it is.

While many recent teen films such as VARSITY BLUES, JAWBREAKER, and even the happily-ever-after SHE'S ALL THAT have touched on sex in their movies, it has been only the tip of the iceberg of how us teens really are when it comes to sex.I am an 18 year old male, recently graduated from a small town high school where sex is an important focus of adolescents.  For most of us, sex doesn't come that easy or smoothly, so people indeed needed somewhat of a reality check, which is adequately portrayed in this film.  I highly recommend this movie to any adults who want a sufficient glance at sex in high school, teens who want a night of laughter (and a new topic of discussion), and children who desire their first peek at what's to come in the next few years.",American Pie

It is also refreshing with a line of fresh faces both behind and in front of the camera. I recommend this movie to all mature audiences.",American Pie
428,marnader,"Funny comedy, ruined by the message it carries",6,15 August 2000,"*SPOILERS , kinda. but its obvious how its gonna end. in a typical hollywoodian fashion.*The movie deserved a 9. Its a funny comedy about senior high schoolers trying to get laid before the year ends, and I liked it. But I only voted a 6. Here's why: I could relate to Jim and the others throughout the whole movie, except at the end. Jim says ""I'm tired of everyone hyping sex, I dont wanna do it anymore. To hell with it all"" (close enough). Ok, if the movie had ended with at least ONE of the ""good guys, normal guys"" not getting laid, the message or moral would've been ""ok, some guys make it, some dont"". good. but it didnt. they had to have all the ""normal"" kids have sex, and the viewer,if a male teenager, will leave the theater thinking ""ok...so if i dont have sex while in high school, im a loser like Sherman"" (that's what many thought, and that's what the previous reviewer Longtrip thought) . How screwed up is that? I mean, only a select 30% (im only guessing) of guys got laid at my high school, does that make the 70% remaining losers? No, but that's the message you got from American Pie. That you're like Sherman. (for the record, I didnt get laid in high school). I really wish at least Jim would've stayed a virgin, at least until the next year. Also...whats up with using 24/25 year-old girls to play the role of 18yo's? huh? Shannon Elizabeth is a PLAYMATE, yet they pass her as a regular 18yo student. The average teenage girl watching the movie will obviously notice the difference in looks between her and the sexy cast of American Pie, who's supposedly ""normal average 18yo's"". No way that'll help her self-esteem, in this f***ed up world where girls think that if they dont look like the girl on the cover of Seventeen, they'll scare guys away . So, both male and female teenagers that are like me (that are part of the aforementionned 70%), when leaving the theater, will walk out with a bad taste in their mouth.I liked American Pie. Half-way through the movie, I was thinking that I'll be giving it a 9 here. but with the moral/message it has, I cant allow myself to give it more than a 6, sorry. Have a nice day, people. (oh, and sorry if I dont express myself as eloquently as some other reviewers)",American Pie
429,cowsrcool87,How can such an awful movie make so much money?,1,9 August 2001,"American Pie was undoubtedly a huge success financially. It gave hope to the struggling teen comedy genre and for the past two years we've had to endure rip-offs even worse than this.  The movie feels as fake and tasteless as a Mcdonald's pie, with almost no genuine comedic moments. Worst yet, near the end we get a moment where our hero, Jim says he's sick of talking about sex and isn't so excited to have it anymore, while the supporting characters nod their heads in agreement. The moral about taking time to have sex is particularly pretentious in a movie like this, and is even more undermined by the fact that they all have sex in the last 15 minutes.  Jason Biggs, as we have seen recent films can barely carry a film without humping a pie, and his career is already burning out.  Unfortunately, American Pie 2 will be released this week, which is sure to make a lot of money.

Most of the teen movies out there are sugar coated or they only relate to a minor aspect of teenage life.  This movie came out after my senior year, and I saw it with a bunch of my friends from high school. Everything that happens reflects the way that guys and girls think.

The most extreme being a female character visiting a lad from school she barely knows, being left for 2 minutes in his bedroom and returns to find that in his absence she's stripped off and started masturbating over female pornography that she found in his dresser draw.

Even I'm 17 and cant for the life of me understand how anyone can find this movie amusing. Except teenage boys(and confused middle aged men) who likes to look at half naked teenage girls, or women in their late 20's playing teenagers.basically its a movie about a group of teenagers who wants to lose their virginity before they graduate high school.

Don't waste your time, money, sanity on this what i fear will become an American cult movie in 10 years.I pray that one day a director will update the concept of ""teen movies"", movies that will actually portray how it is to be a teenager.

It starts with a superb original opening scene were jim (jason Biggs) is caught ""spanking the one eyed monkey""! This is hilarious and jims dad (Eugene Levy)only adds to the greatness of this scene. The story is set out by kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas)at Steve Stiflers (Sean William Scott) party. they all decide that their going to loose their virginity by their prom night. Theyre all soon paired off and prom night approaches after many more genius scenes including the ""pie"" and ""father son chat"" scenes. However things dont go according to plan but all seems to work itself out for themselves and they are soon toasting ""to the next step"" (American Pie 2)!This film is good for originality.

I don't know if I've heard anything so ridiculous, I actually feel dumber just seeing this movie. In my opinion it is a stereotypical sexually focused movie for teenagers. There is nothing I did like about this movie, the plot was awful, there was no character I genuinely liked or could connect with and the humour was crude and immature. All humour within the movie is focused on sex or sexual content. In my opinion I can't see the hilarity behind someone wanting to have sex with a food or being walked in while doing this. The characters and situations which occur are very unrealistic and I believe this movie is an example of how little creativity and intelligence people require these days to create or act in a film.",American Pie

They discovered a way to earn millions from feeding pigeons.Hell, if you want to hear a sex joke, I have friends that will tell them for free.I don't only want a refund on the ticket I paid to watch this movie, but I also want the two hours of my life back that I wasted watching it.",American Pie

Movies are for fun, the spectator is expected to be in the mood for the fun the film can offer. American Pie trilogy is a great comedy, with all we can expect: some good acting among an average cast, some intelligent jokes among the obvious, and very good role playing: One could quickly learn to like (or hate) the characters.

As one watches the film, they can just sense what these characters are going through, preparing to leave high school, and venture out into the real world, and going away from each other.

444,OwainBevan,A slice of latter-day Americana,7,9 September 2007,"Ordinarily, I avoid American teen movies like the plague. But a good movie is a good movie, and this is one of the best examples of this normally obnoxious genre. Its basic premise  a group of high-school leavers endeavour to lose their virginity before setting off for college  is a fairly simple one. It is in the quality of the comedy and (some) of the central characters that sets American Pie apart. The story centres on Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) and his attempts to get beautiful exchange-student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) into bed. The best supporting roles (and side stories) come from the high-brow (and slightly pretentious) Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Steve Stifler (Seann W. Scott) who both provide additional colour and depth to proceedings. To be frank, I found Oz (Chris Klein) and Kevin's (Thomas Ian Nicholas) stories to be fairly bland affairs, straight out of a teen magazine (they were virtually redundant in American Pie 2). With its American college rock soundtrack and its almost National Lampoon mindset, American Pie does feel a little dated today. Nevertheless, it contains enough quality to make it worth a viewing.Owain Bevan",American Pie

Consequently, this film culminates in a thoroughly satisfactory movie going experience. It is a remarkably masterful work by a talented group of people. The script was honest, natural, and very funny. I would not be at all surprised if Adam Herz' writing is nominated for an academy award. 1000 years from now, when an inquisitive anthropologist wants to know what it was like to be seventeen in the late 1900s this could be part of the definitive reference trilogy along with ""Breakfast Club"" and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"".

The cast members are believable as high school students, and even brought back some memories of my days in high school.Be warned that this film has a high gross-out factor and uses little restraint with sexual humor.  However, unlike last year's overrated gross-out hit ""There's Something About Mary,"" the laughs are virtually nonstop, and you do not see all of the funniest gags in the trailer.The script is very clever, and actually is a tad sentimental amid all of the offensive goings-on.  The film is peppered with pop-culture references, and even pays homage to films like ""The Graduate"" and even ""WarGames.""  The film even delivers a good message.  The four guys learn during their quest for the dirty deed that having strong feelings for someone you truly care about is equally as gratifying.I really couldn't find anything wrong with this film.

One other point that I would like to make about this movie, is that you see growth in all of the 4 main characters....the most in the jock, Oz...then Jim, the dork...then Shit-Break, Finch...then the only one w/a girlfriend. This movie wasn't all humor, and eventually showed you that sex isn't everything.

The movie begins with a masturbation sequence that becomes the motif - and, yes, it's funny at first, but how many times can a father realistically walk in on his son, and how many different ways can the same gag be repeated before it gets stale? the majority of the kids in the theater with me hooted and screamed just as loudly each time, so i guess i'm in the minority, but i got very tired of humor in the form of simple gross-outs. Don't get me wrong - I thought Something About Mary was hilarious; but Mary had a good script, good acting, ingenuity, and an engaging plot. this movie has none or very little of the four (with the exception of Natasha Lyonne, who is above this movie the same way Jeneane Garofolo was above 200 Cigarettes).

467,manzoor,Funny in a sad sort of way,7,21 March 2000,"I really liked the movie as a movie.

I really hope not.",American Pie
468,main.smith,Vulgar and entertaining!,8,23 March 2000,"Over here in the UK, we seems to have been bombarded by American teen comedies, either on TV or in Film. We wouldn't mind, but none of them seem to be that good. Of course we haven't actually made any ourselves, so we're hardly in a position to criticise, but the really sad thing is that the teen-com concept is full of potential. Finally, someone was daring enough to explore the outrageousness of lusty adolescence. American Pie was born!Make no mistake; the main strength of this film is it's sheer vulgarity. The usual patronising moral preaching that accompanies, and spoils, so many films of this type is absent. Replacing it is a no holds barred look at teenage angst, sexual curiosity, and the art of bodily function jokes. In addition, the subject of masturbation has never been approached with such an unflinching eye!!The young cast, all relatively unknown, offer some impressive performances. The individual honours belong to Sean W Scott, who is repulsively likeable as Stifler, even if it is nothing more than a role as the typically moronic American Jock. However, the most skillful moments of the film are provided by Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy, who offer an excellent double act as the son with strange methods of experimentation and the father, whose methods of sex education are at times equally bizarre. The sense of awkwardness as they endure their 'man to man' talks is remarkably convincing.The film isn't consistently funny, but the half dozen side splitting moments are more than enough to keep you amused, even if you have been told of them in vivid detail prior to watching. (Like I was)At times though, American Pie can certainly be accused of feeling a bit familiar. After all, the guys trying to get laid routine has been done a thousand times before, and some of the jokes (such as the old classic of post laxative attack panic) are hardly original, but the film does include some touches that save it from being totally predictable. For example there is the character of Finch, the mysterious member of the sex-obsessed quartet with sophisticated mannerisms, and the way the Jock element is played through Lacrosse, rather than a more obvious or traditional American sport.The purists will no doubt, make criticisms about it's over explicitness, and other such garbage about the corruption of the young, but as usual they are looking deeper than is necessary. While you could argue that American Pie brings attention to the awkwardness, anxiousness and confusion of adolescent sexuality, it is really just an entertaining comedy, with grossness that lifts it head and shoulders above the rest.",American Pie
469,mbauer-2,Characters and situations that we can all relate to in some way,8,17 April 2000,"There is probably a good bit of each of us somewhere in the characters and situations presented in American Pie.  I found watching it to be a bittersweet experience as it dredged up a lot of memories from my own high school days.  I think the way the story is presented and the skill of the cast helped portray this in a fun and entertaining way.  Overall, I think it is a good movie and well worth the rental (or purchase).",American Pie
470,republikaner,Embarrassing and vulgar,1,28 July 2000,"This so-called comedy is more embarrassing than it is fun. The constant flow of vulgar and sexual oriented ""fun"" is not enough to keep some one entertained for the duration of the movie.The one or two times that you laugh is more to hide your shame than, because it is funny.The film seems to be a collection of random scenes only loosely connected by the plot. As far as I'm concerned this film must qualify on the top 10 over worst movie of the decade.",American Pie

Unlike the increasingly tired sequels, the original American Pie, balanced a large cast of believable characters through some of the finest set pieces in cinema.The list of great characters goes on and on; ""Jim"" the main character, Stiffler, Finch, The MILF, Jim's Dad, Nadia etc etc. Every character has a purpose and they all given screen time so that we appreciate the situations that they face.American Pie reignited the Teen-genre and a whole new generation of gross out films like Road Trip, Old School etc owe AP a debt.If by some miracle you have yet to see this film go and treat yourself to the DVD - and laugh your nuts off whilst Jim and Co screw around, f*ck things up, and generally have a fantastic time.",American Pie

The main character who did that he's seen like some kind of hero and the girl is sent back to her country like she was the problem in all that ? The worst part is that she's not even mad, she is still friendly with the boy who did that (male gaze alert!!). I understand that you have to place a movie in its temporal context but this is a felony, it's not funny. I understand now how consent is still not respected if young boys grow up seeing things like that.

It lost all meaning without American Pie. It wasn't easy to continue a normal life after 6 days of American Pie-ing. And then one day, I came to know about American Pie 7. Colors rushed into my life, everything seemed so beautiful.I might've exaggerated a bit, but yes, that's the sort of effect you can expect the series to have on you. American Pie isn't just a movie, it's a brand, an icon with a huge number of fans worldwide. If there was ever a movie that deserved Oscars and BAFTAs, this is it. It's the most well executed movie/series in this genre (teen sex comedy) ever made. The actors don't seem to be acting, they're rather living their part.You don't need to think twice before seeing it, run like mad to the nearest parlor, rent it, and wait till folks at home are asleep. Just a tip, if your parents' room is close to yours, you might wanna lower the volume a bit in the beginning. :P",American Pie

So the Weisz Bros. decided to revisit that genre and add some of the most outrageous stunts shown in a movie of it's kind. I mean, this IS the only movie where you get to see a guy arouse himself with a warm apple pie. Or another guy drink sperm-tainted beer. I fell out of my seat laughing in ""the bedroom scene"". It's a well done movie and one I have seen several times already. This is the teen sex comedy that actually is good. My advice. See it, don't regret it, and laugh at the stupid parts.

479,kelandwood,"Lowbrow entertainment, at it's finest",8,22 March 2013,"Let me make things clear. This movie is not an intelligent, moving piece of art that reflects life in in a beautiful way. But it's not supposed to be. It's intended as light fun. And in that aspect it clearly delivers. The characters are all wonderful. Jim despite being a bit of loser does try to do the right thing and does seem like a nice guy. There's nothing particularly wrong with him, he just wants to know what sex feels like and you do become invested in him as time goes on. Oz is a jock who hangs out with the geeks, not exactly the most original character but a guy with so much charisma you can't help but like him. Finch is an oddball who takes himself a tad too seriously but still means well and Kevin is more mature than his counterparts but still having as much fun as his friends. Each of them are very likable and the way they interact with each other is very funny. When they fall into these ridiculous situations, it's all the more hilarious than it would be to less interesting characters. The two scene stealer's though are supporting characters. Steve Stifler is the obnoxious womanizing asshole who you love to hate. Again kind of generic of a characters but Sean William Scott kills it in the role. He's just so funny and has so much fun on screen. And the other scene stealer is Jim's Dad(Eugene Levvy). This guy is so supportive of his son that it's kind of embarrassing for Jim. I think we can all admit we've had embarrassing conversation with our parents about the birds and the bees but this is just taking it to another level. For the viewer though, it's hilarious. The movie does have some teen drama as well and it does work because you care about the characters so much. Still it still remembers what it is and is an is 80% comedy. I can't say it's as funny as it probably was when it came out but it's still pretty damn funny and if you're still quoting ""Warm Apple Pie"" to this day, you'll know what I'm talking about",American Pie

481,bigmik21,A well rounded AND complete teen movie,9,5 March 2005,"As a huge fan of teen-comedy type flicks it's no surprise that i highly rate this movie.The plot is that of one which a 16 year old can highly identify with.Why? Simply because this film quite accurately depicts the life and behaviors of (perhaps ALL) teenagers.I recently read a comment made about this film (a negative one) and i found myself developing the image of an insecure 35 year old who had no fun at high school, irregardless of this, how can someone be watching ""American Pie"" for the first time in 2002...American Pie 2 was already released then...Behind the times, yes, perhaps.Overall to come onto IMDb and write a review of what IS a ""CLASSIC"" and the ""STANDARD"" for any teen movie to this date is just quite funny actually, i have met many types of people with all kinds of personalities and not heard one thing wrong or negative about this film.I do not believe in comparing one teen movie to another because each are their own films, with their own plots/sub-plots, one liners etc etc.But in order to accurately draw up some sort of conclusion and/or list of titles in order of the better, then this must be done AND as much as i love the ""PIE"" Series of films i have many other favorites that in my opinion don't add up to feel as fresh and funny as the ""PIE's"" but FUNNY they very much are.If you watch this movie and feel totally disgusted/disappointed/bored/sick/revolted/annoyed even, well think of this, MAYBE it's something to do with YOU and your personality, remember this IS entertainment, NOT REAL LIFE! If it were it would be totally boring.A lot of people (Peeete from UK for one) say the creators were being dishonest etc about the story and it's world far from reality!? What did you do with your friends at school? i agree there is a lack of real behaviors i.e bullying etc but if you take time to hear what the film-makers have to say you will realize you are out of your own depth, Adam Herz clearly states in the ""making of..."" that his school-life and friends had an ""OMAGE"" feel to it....The point i am making is MY SCHOOL felt like this....Yes some people hate each other BUT it's cast away in the shadows when you bring to light the ""togetherness"" feel everyone has.American Pie : Stifler is the (somewhat more verbal less physical) bully.It's all there for your ""real world"" eyes to see but when you directly compare this Flick to your actual life then YOU ARE OF COURSE GOING TO BE Disappointed! Comdeies are made for laughs, i laughed, a lot, therefore this is a pretty damn good comedy, i just wish that in the real-world where we all live more people could just let themselves go when watching a film of this genre, instead of getting all worked up over a movie about a dude who screws a pie :) ********* out of **********9 out of 10 because life just isn't perfect!",American Pie

Revealing details about the other side of band camp included.",American Pie
483,Hammer-11,Disappointing Toilet Humor,5,12 January 2000,"I rented this movie because everyone was talking about how funny it was. I was very disappointed. The movie is full of shocking toilet humor and it has nothing in it for anyone over the age of 13. Unfortunately, you wouldn't want anyone that age to watch this kind of filth. I don't mind this kind of teenage sex comedy done well, but this movie is just dumb. It's basically a 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' effort ruined by a South Park mentality. Shame on us for encouraging this as filmmaking.",American Pie

485,Sosafan-2,I'll never look at an Apple Pie the same way again,10,11 July 1999,"This was without a doubt the funniest movie I have seen since ""There's Something About Mary"".  In every seen there was something to make me laugh, and not just a chuckle, but a full let it out blast.  I wasn't embarrassed because the whole theater burst into laughter at the same time.  And it had great music too, sometimes I found myself singing along, quietly of course. The bottom line is I think that teens should go and see this movie because it is great, but probably no one under 13 should be let in.  I have seen 4 high school movies this year (She's All That, 10 Things I Hate About You, Never Been Kissed, and this one) and this was by far the best one.  I know I will probably see this movie again soon because it was so good.",American Pie
486,djskillz,Nothing bad to say,10,7 July 1999,"Sitting here and trying to write a review for this movie is hard to do.I'm sure there are bad things to say about this movie. You could say it's vile, disgusting, and offensive. I can't say that, though, because I didn't find it any of those things.  Actually, I'm having trouble defining it period, as I am still a little overwhelmed by it. At the moment, I can say it is by far the funniest movie I have ever seen.The comparisons to 'There's Something about Mary' are relevant only because it brings you a new style of filmmaking, bringing you humorous after humorous moment. There are several kinds of brilliant films; ones that make you cry, ones that make you yelp and scream; ones that leave you feeling like you just had sex and the ones that make you laugh uncontrollably.'Pie' fits into the last two categories, no pun intended for the sex feeling. Maybe it's me, but when I left the theatre, I ran home. It was playing with Notting Hill, which I discarded for the opportunity to play preacher and call on everyone I knew, telling them to go to 'Pie'. The movie made has put a feeling of light-chested-ness in my body that hasn't gone away. The movie is just that good.The movie is this good because of the script. Like every single movie, a script is the end all of the sucsess of it. The 'Pie' script is like nothing you could expect, there has been nothing like it before. There have been comparisons to the John Hughes' and Porkey's films, but beyond the intial premise it is inaccurate. Because of the flexibility of the censors, and how much society is now accustom to, 'Pie' sets new standards and again stretches the lines of censorship. ""Porkey's' and Hughes' films were made to be somewhat innocent. It apologizes for being racey. 'Pie' makes doesn't offer you one, and instead asks for one because you doubted it before you got in there.The next most important element of a good film is the actors. In all of the great films, we rememeber the actors just as much as the plot and the setting. Jason Biggs, the lead character, and our protagonist because he's always a loser, is dead-on. He plays Jake to the last detail; the shy guy in everybody's class. Chris Klien, who shone in Election, again shines here as a wanna-be sensitive jock.  He commands such an aura, and easily gains sympathy and respect from viewers. The female actors are lead by a band geek Alyson Hannigan and Sex Therapist Natasha Lyonne. A somewhat rookie actress, Mena Suvari, plays a jazz ensemble goodie-two-shoes and interest of Klien.  She is absolutely intoxicating, and her looks, even though she is not as attractive as Tara Reid or Shannon Elizabeth(both in the film, as Vicky and Nadia respectfully), draws people, at least me, to develop a crush on here. Lastly, Eugene Levy, the SCTV vetreran, brings a character to life that we can all say 'Hey, that's my dad!', in one scene or another.You could talk about the style of shooting, and other production notes, but unlike 'Saving Private Ryan', it is not important. The movie is meant to make you laugh. You are supposed to be impressed because it is so funny, not  because you have learned something. The movie accomplishes this like Michael Jordan wins. It deserves kudos until there is no more kudos.Like Phantom Menace, go in with an open mind. Adam Herz, Paul and Chris Weitz, Jason Biggs, Chris Klien and Mena Suvari. Remember those names, as you will try so hard to forget this movie, but fail, because it so good.I guess I found something after all to say. I'll rephrase: Sitting here and trying to write a bad review for this movie is hard to do.",American Pie
487,quise,A must see 4 1999,7,12 July 1999,"I have read the other reviews left by other users and professional critics. Most agree that this movie is funny however some disapprove of this movie because its vulgarity and because of its targeted audience.  I believe that this movie is pretty vulgar but not to the point that it becomes non-tasteful and obscene.  As far as the targeted audience of teenagers, I believe that this movie is suitable for any teenager 15 and older. The truth is teenagers today are pretty vulgar and so most teens can relate to many of the situation in this movie (at least most guys can).  The issues dealt with in this movie have been discussed and acted out among teens for the longest.If you're against this movie because it's vulgar you need a reality check! If you have teens, then listen to their telephone calls, snoop though their stuff, check their computer, and I bet you will be shocked!The fact is that this movie just reflects teens today and what teens are doing today are the same things teens have done in the past!  The only difference is today is a little more high tech!   Besides, if you take away the vulgarity then alls you have left is a boring movie that promotes ""good values"",  (a movie that no one would watch).

However, not only are the characters actually believable as typical teenagers, but the movie presents itself an a hilarious fashion.  This movie contains some of the crudest jokes I've seen, but they all work, and it's actually plausible that teenagers might do these things.

For once a (teen) movie that is 1) realistic 2) filled with jokes that actually make you laugh out loud and 3) enjoyable for both teens and adults...just don't watch this with your parents.

I was not disappointed at all.  This movie has laughs all 'round, most of them coming from the supporting cast, including Allison Hannigan's ""Band Camp Geek"", and Eugene Levy.  The lines they say were as funny, if not more funny, than the visual jokes in the film.  I've seen three high school films in a row this year, including ""She's All That"" and ""Never Been Kissed"", and this movie showed high school the way it is, rather than the way it should be.

What people seem to be missing is this is one of the most realistic films dealing with the subject of teenage sexuality.  Yes, some scenes are juvenile.  However, the film also portrays safe sex and realistic sex--not the usual ""acceptable"" Hollywood sex (Jack and Rose have sex after knowing each other for only two days in Titanic, where were the Puritan critics then?).  It seems sex is only OK in films if it is glamorous and has no mention of condoms.  As a 23 year old female, I appreciated the realistic portrayal of high school boys as I remember--horny and clueless.  However, these boys do learn some respect for women, at least more than they had at the beginning of the film; and, the girls do not allow them to get away with their disrespect and juvenile actions.

It is your typical group of boys in high school (even though I never knew any seniors who were virgins!) who have made a pact to lose their virginity before graduation.One has a reluctant girlfriend who is saving herself for the one who loves her,another has the worse pick up lines you have ever heard,bachelor number three is a ball of nerves when it comes to women,and number four is a very shy almost nerdy kind of guy. Unlike some movies that have been out there,you tend to like these guys even though they just want to get deflowered.It is a hysterical movie that I think everyone should see,young and old,as long as you are of mature age because obviously it has many many references to sex and such.

This film is extremly funny but if you can't take crude humour then it's not the film for you...sorry.

It was a boring, poorly acted, unfunny film.  I have nothing against ""gross"" comedy, in fact I love it when it's done well.  However, it was used so stupidly in this movie.  It was as if the writers said, ""okay, how far can we go?  That'll be cool.  People will be shocked!""  What's the point of shocking somebody if you have nothing interesting to say?  Sad movie.  The one saving grace was the dad's performance.  Everything else was a total mess.  The pie scene wasn't even funny!",American Pie
505,jeff-311,There's something about Porky,8,21 December 1999,"This is a great movie.  I saw the unrated version on video and it was great with no scene compromise to get a specific rating.  Keep in mind those are young people and this may me shocking for some parents to imagine what's going on in their kids head at that age!  Many actors were unknown but since they were kids playing kids the ensemble was very natural.The pie scene is unforgettable.  There was a toilet scene ""a la"" dumb and dumber wich is always hillarious because most of us can relate on some way or another!The movie is very easy to watch and you're guaranteed to get a laugh every 3-5 minutes.",American Pie

507,sterwin2000,Disappointed!!!!!,6,29 February 2000,"What a terrible disappointment this movie turned out to be!
Movies like Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, Flying High, Spaceballs etc. etc. belong to my favorite movies of all time, so I was looking forward to this so much. But this movie never even came close to those classics.
What made the other movies so good was that even though the jokes were stupid, there was a sort of cleverness in them. This movie lacked that cleverness all together. Almost all jokes were predictable and therefore not very funny.Also a lot of the story lines and jokes seemed to be derived from old jokes of other movies, which made them less funny because they weren't new.Highlight of the movie for me was the 'Shermanator'. This kid reminded me of Anthony Michael Hall is his young years, and almost singlehandedly saved the movie for me.So all in all not a terribly bad movie, but certainly not a great one.",American Pie

However, friends who saw it said it was ""hilarious"" and so I was quite eager to see it.This film, in the main, is not ""hilarious."" It has several very funny moments, but with a premise such as this (teenage boys seeking to lose their virginity) you'd think there would have been many more funny moments. That's not to say that the writers were stingy with the jokes, but rather that only a small proportion of the gags were actually laugh-aloud moments.In the end, it's an average teen comedy that could have been so much more.

I am, however, offended by complete and unrelenting stupidity.  You can't image how glad I am that I got to see this for free. If I had payed, I would have never forgiven myself.  I didn't totally hate it, as I am a fan of Alyson Hannigan, but I would sooner swallow glass than recommend it to anyone other than despised enemies.

(and probably the best of teenage comedy).I watch it 100 times and I still laughing about their jokes and Jim (played by Jason Biggs) is a truly funny character with all his sex experiences and the advices that his father (Eugene Levy) gives to him, are awesome! Stifler (played by Sean William Scott) is also a very funny character! Shameless and he plays a real 'macho-men' very well. In spite of being a movie that doesn't have any brilliant performance and doesn't have any complexity that puts the actors in difficult situations, it's a pretty good film with lots of funny moments, lots of nudity, sex jokes and scenes, all the ingredients to make a very good teenage comedy!So, if you're a teenager with a tough 'sex life', watch this movie and you should learn something (or, at least, have a good laugh)!",American Pie

The characters are perfectly cast, each with separate, distinct personalities reminiscent of some stereotype we all knew in High School. This film was written with a sensitive understanding what it is like to be in your later adolescent years and still exploring sex for the first moments. Clever, original, laugh out loud funny to a point you hate to see this great comedy end. Comedies are the most difficult of genre to do really well, but this one hits the mark. I sat there and enjoyed reliving a few moments of my own as I watched this great film. Worth enjoying for more than a single viewing.",American Pie

I may have cracked a smile here or there, but I hardly consider a movie to be funny if all I'm doing is smiling.  Hell, I enjoyed the second movie much more so than this garbage (so much that I bought it... only to realize that I made a mistake, and therefore gave it away).  This movie reminds me of Road Trip, in that everyone gushes about how funny it is, and what a ""classic"" (a term thrown around all too often) it is... yet I don't find it funny in the least. The cast, with the exceptions of Sean William Scott and Eugene Levy are 100% worthless... especially Chris Kline.  Please, someone buy him some acting lessons.  The sight gags in the movie suck... flat out.  Looky, it's spooge... HAR HAR HAR.  Give me a break.  American Pie?  More like American Crap.1 star out of 10.",American Pie

All the boys in the world have passed for this phase, that's why this movie is so funny, is not something weird, it's just natural, and the scenes are amazing unexpected but they are a possibility. I laugh since the beginning till the end... Since that time i saw this movie a lot of times and i still laugh of the jokes, even more...

Aside from a few cringe chuckles from Jim's totally awkward dad and the cameo from Blink 182, I really didn't enjoy watching this. Nothing too funny, just a whole lot of middle school humor.

526,CBF,It sucks,1,18 July 1999,"At first, when I heard a movie entitled 'American Pie' would hit the big screen, I Believed it would be about Buddy Holly's death(as was the song under the same title by Don McLean was about).   When I heard it was a sex comedy, I was offended, to say the least, and thought ""Oh great, another ""There's something about Mary"""".   But, as i saw the film, I was even more offended.   It has to be one of the worst movies spewed out by Hollywood nowadays.   Whatever happened to the Noble movie?   Star Wars is one of the last refuges to the ideas that noble beliefs can still be shown on the Big Screen and still be entertaining, gripping, and interesting.And, what was even more offensive was in a commerical for 'American Pie', it had people singing 'How Sweet it is' to pies(something you'd have to watch the movie to understand).   I took it as a personal insult(the movie, and the commercial) against two songs in which I love(I hope Don and James hears about this outrage).   Take my advice, don't watch  'American Pie', go see Star Wars again, or rent 'Shawshank Redemption'.",American Pie

This movie offers some great laughs and good acting. The cast is basically made up of unknown teen actors (except for Natasha Lyonne and the girl who plays Willow on Buffy).  There are many great one-liners and it's packed full of hysterical situations.  From reviews that I have seen of this movie, a lot of people are comparing it to Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  I would say it's more like a Something about Mary about the teen dating scene rather than about thirtysomethings.  Anyone who appreciates good comedy and gutter humor should definitely see this movie.",American Pie

But something surprising happened.  After the first few scenes, ""American Pie"" became a smart and downright funny picture and I became caught up in the characters (how often does that happen in a comedy?).  The plot is surprisingly solid and, even more incredibly, relatively unpredictable, there are plenty of laughs, and, even though the ending is a little weak, I highly recommend this movie. It's much, much better than ""There's Something About Mary"" could ever dream of being.",American Pie

All the performances were solid, given the material they covered.  And even though the film revolves around teen-agers, I think you have to be in your twenties to truly appreciate the characters' take on their dilemma.  What also impressed me was how the pop music in the background fit each scene accordingly in tempo and mood.  Some people may be put off by some of the sight gags, but that's why it's rated R.",American Pie
530,Jets19,Fast Times for the 90's?,10,6 July 1999,"I just saw a sneak preview of this film, and it's difficult to try to place it.  It is definitely unlike the recent slew of teen movies that Hollywood seems to be churning out.  Why?  Well, for starters it has characters who each and every person can honestly relate to, not simply the caricatures which are so frequently featured on screen nowadays.  It has a couple of incredibly risque sight gags, one of which puts the infamous hair gel scene in ""There's Something About Mary"" to shame.  But the biggest reason it stands out is that it reminds me more of the classic 80's teen films (updated in content for the 90's, of course) than any of the cookie cutter 90's teen films have...by far.  This is ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" fixed up for a new generation.  It unabashedly deals with teenage hormones and masturbation, and is unafraid to show it.  Unlike the awful ""Cruel Intentions"", which tried to make teens appear over-experienced and sexy (failing miserably), ""American Pie"" beautifully illustrates the awkwardness and anticipation surrounding the loss of the big V and the trials of teen hormones and sexual frustration.  I highly recommend.  It'll have you rolling on the floor laughing, both from what's on screen and recognition of the humor of your own first time.",American Pie

I am not too sure if there is anymore room left on that proverbial envelope to push after this flick.  Although many teenage sexual urges and problems were exaggerated, the writers kept close to the adolescent experience.

Better yet, walk right on by the ""A""s, and head straight for the ""P""s, pick up Porky's, and go home. It will be the same premise, only executed far, far better. And since I'm turning this into a rant... Please, please, _please_ stop comparing this movie to ""Something About Mary"". (I'm a little leery of comparing it to ""Porky's"".) ""Something..."" was a well written, intelligent comedy that, while generously laden with ""toilet jokes"", did not use such humor as the foundation, purpose, and selling point for the movie. Take away the hair scene and you still have a love story. Take away the pie, and what do you have? Not much. Not much at all. Now that I'm done writing this, I've decided that, much like ""Wing Commander"", I just can't recommend that anyone see this movie. I can't have that on my conscience. ...Nah, I'm being too nice.

The story follows these men as they make a pact to loose their virginity before graduating high school and quickly learn that it is easier said than done.American Pie is a very raw and graphic film and can be disturbing at times. For most young adults the movie will come off as hilarious and good while most adults will find it repulsive and degrading. I sat in a theater between two other critics from another local media firm and a group of recent high school graduates. While one group cringed at the raw nature of the story the other cheered and yelled profusely. The movie completely butchers the idea of ""love"" and pushes on the idea of sex rules all. This movie will be a huge success among the young and a huge point of argument among the adults. If you have a week stomach i would not recommend this movie under any circumstances.

American Pie tells a somewhat realistic, though very exaggerated, story of four high school seniors who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night.  The appeal of this movie, much like with 'Mary,' is not the story, but the gross-out comedy.  And there is much of that in this film.  Still, the story is not lacking, and this film does present a sweet tale of friendship and the troubles of adolescence.  But the main reason to see this is for the great laughs and shock value, as it has plenty of both.",American Pie

542,clyde682,a hilarious documentary of teenage sexual angst,9,7 July 1999,"Well, I too saw the sneak preview of this delightful movie positioned around the quest of four high school seniors to get laid before graduation.  If you think the premise is vulgar, then you may not want to read on, b/c this movie is not for you.  Not only does it put There's Something About Mary to shame with it's liberal use of bodily fluids, but it surpasses it through its hilarious performances and unforgettable scenes.  To put this movie in a nutshell would be to label it a documentary about teenage sexual angst. Needless to say, there are many things in this movie that resemble soft porn, minus the cheesy music and bad acting.  The movie does do a very good job of displaying the different attitudes towards sex and quite possibly (this may be a long shot) love through its use of great characterization. Chris Klein, last seen in Election, brings another genuine performance to the screen, along with Jason Biggs, who's new to me but obviously a pro already, and Thomas Ian Nicholas, a wide-eyed poster boy for Clearasil. But the standout performance, although small, has got to be Alyson Hannigan as a naughty nerd who provides the movie with its most memorable shock...believe me, you'll know once you see it.  Yes, the toilet humor is abundant, but the script is equipped with nonstop laughs and clever interludes.  If you enjoy comedies and aren't embarrassed by the sight of naked women and masturbation, then you have got to see this movie.",American Pie

I rate movies on what I expect them to deliver and how they match up to those expectations.  I expected this to be a teen-flick about sex that would be humorous at times, but nothing extraordinary.  I was so wrong.This movie was so much better than any teen comedy I have ever seen - and easily in my top ten comedies of all time behind Clerks, Caddyshack, etc. The entire theater was laughing hysterically through at least 50% of the movie.  The characters were believable - you know at least one person exactly like each of these characters.  They have the high school male sex drive pegged (along with the guy talk).  Eugene Levy could have been any of our dads - trying so hard to talk to his son candidly about sex, but failing miserably.Take my word for it.  This movie is ten times better than ""There's Something About Mary"".  My only regret is that I saw the Sneak Preview and have to wait a whole week before I can see it again.

This movie is hysterical in so many different levels and somehow still manages to show a little heart.  You like these characters because they ARE you in high school.

I know, it's a matter of taste, but this movie IS funny, when you don't look too sharp... and it has certainly a deeper meaning, there are some beautiful real-love scenes in it. Really good movie! btw. The first movie I rated 10/10",American Pie
553,cdy103,Provocative insight into the final weeks for four high school senior boys who form a pact to lose their virginity by prom.,10,7 July 1999,"This movie is by far the most entertaining film I have seen in quite some time.  Not since Fast Times at Ridgemont High has thier been such an extrordinary look into the complexities of high school life.  This movie truly reminds me of how my days in high school ended.  If you can laugh at a tad bit raunchy joke then this movie will bring you to your knees.  A young talented cast deserves credit for such a fine display of acting.  The only sad bit is the portrayal of the sport of lacrosse.  But since the setting is Michigan, we'll let it slide.  By the way Michigan State recently dropped its lacrosse program so there is a bit of a blunder there.",American Pie

I had high hopes of this movie being hilarious and usually I get let down, but not this time.  The humor is a little on the twisted side but that is what is great about it.  Movies before hinted about the subjects but this one takes it head on.  There is also a few life lessons hidden behind the humor.  It is a must see if you like to laugh.",American Pie

Though we both were nursing terrible hangovers, we laughed ourselves to tears throughout the film.  I can't remember laughing so much at a movie while sober, and I don't think I've ever seen her laugh so hard outside of a pool hall.  Though the film took the discovery and yearning for fornication to absurdity, it's best not to search for any profundity here.  This is a fun film, so sit back and enjoy it.  And don't worry when the film begins to recede into kitsch morality and sensitivity, for you are saved at the moment of finally dismissing the movie by the band-camp girl.  This is an audience participation film, though, so watch it with a good one.",American Pie

It's more than just a shock-show of toilet humor. It's actually full of lessons on life and love. I was pleasantly surprised at Oz(Chris Klein)'s transformation. I laughed and nodded my head at the heroes' mistakes. I could empathize with them. Although it's naturally a little exaggerated, being a comedy and all, it's pretty honest about what goes on in high school. And more than making me laugh, it made me think. It doesn't hurt that just about all the actors were stunningly good-looking either. :) I definitely recommend this movie for parents as well as teens over 16. You'll love it and learn from it.",American Pie

Lots of unexpected and surprising laughs arise out of situations which could happen to any of us.

560,arattle,This movie is one of the best comedies of the year!!,10,22 July 1999,"Going to see American Pie, I was thinking of all the funny trailers on TV, and was looking forward to a good time.  But the movie exceeded all my expectations, as not only was this a comedy, it was one to which almost anyone could relate, and see themselves in one of the film's characters. There are several unforgettable scenes, which will no doubt become classics, but the main objective of the movie, along with providing gut-busting laughs, is to present a message that one is free to make his own decisions and to disregard peer pressure.  I'm not going to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it yet, because some of the jokes are funny only when seen for the first time, but the jist of it is: YOU HAVE TO SEE AMERICAN PIE if you like to laugh and are any kind of movie buff.  It's also a great film to bring a date to.",American Pie

I went to see it without having seen any movie trailers, and that made a HUGE difference.  Everything was a surprise.  After seeing the movie, I did watch a trailer, and was glad I missed it before.  It gave everything away!Even if you have seen the trailer, go see the movie.  It is fun",American Pie
562,Fox1013,Gross but Hilarious!,8,8 August 1999,"Probably the funniest slapstick movie of the year! I laughed out loud non-stop! The story follows the attempts of 4 high school guys trying to lose their virginity before they graduate. Their antics are ridiculous but funny! Sure some scenes, like the pie scene or the ""stuff"" in the beer scene, were nasty and extremely distasteful.  But the movie had strong performances and a hilariously entertaining script. Shannon Elizabeth is the highlight of the film!  It comes across as a ""guy flick"" but I think both genders would enjoy the film. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who isn't offended by some extremely distasteful content.",American Pie
563,Nepoc,BEST MOVIE EVER,10,29 July 1999,American Pie is the best movie ever! It has everything you need to have a perfect movie. And Shannon Elizabeth's breasts are amazing!!!

I am buying this movie the moment it goes on sale!!,American Pie

565,Mantis-6,"Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny......",10,13 September 1999,"This is a very funny, funny, funny, funny, funny movie, oh hang on, I think I may have already said that..... Ummm now where was I?  Oh yes, this is a funny movie. As Jason Biggs said in a recent Australian interview, ""People like to be shocked,"" and I think if you want to be shocked, you should definetely see this movie.  It is truly a shocker, but only in the good sense.I've been waiting to see this movie since I don't know how long, and like so many other movies that dissapoint you when you finally see them after a long, long, long wait, this one didn't. I'll admit, I was mainly wanting to see Alyson Hannigan (Tell me, am I the only one here that watches Buffy the vampire slayer, for Willow?  She's just such a cute character.) But she certainly doesn't turn out to be the cute little Willow character that we all know and love, which was quite interesting, and shocking to see.  I was going to use the quote: ""And this one time, at band camp..."" but seeming someone else has already gone and done that, I won't... (Well, it would appear that I already have.  Oh well, you get that don't ya?)Well, I can't help myself, I have to say it again..... funny, funny, funny, funny, funny.....And as the saying goes.... ""If you only see one movie this year....""  well who cares how the saying goes, see what ever movies you want to see, just make sure you don't miss out on this one......Truly a 12 out of 10 effort.Thank you for your time.Nick.",American Pie

Jason Biggs was also hilarious. I was afraid the movie would be cheesy, but instead it was funny, raunchy,honest, and intelligent.  It was one of the best movies this summer.",American Pie
567,msj,A good film reflecting teens sexuality issues,9,1 September 1999,"American Pie is a great movie. Why? I'll try to explain... When I first saw the film i laughed at the scenes where Jim was discovering his own sexuality, or lack thereof. But if you think about it for a second, isn't that the problem of many, many American teens nowadays? Adults are constantly proclaiming that sex is bad, something you should stay away from until you are at least 67! I so very often see adult Americans tell their mid-puberty-hormones-going-wild teen kids to stay away from all things fun, and not to forget - natural. ""We accept the world presented to us"" Ed Harris said in The Truman Show, and I agree to that. If I were told all my life that blue actually is red - I would believe it, but that doesn't make it right. American Pie shows us all that sex is a problem teens struggle with, and it is the parents obligation and privelidge to assist and guide their children. A very important point here is ""guide"", it's better to tell your children ""how to"" rater ""not to"", I believe. ""Man shaped in Gods vision"" ring a bell? Just kidding. We need more reality in films, especially American films. Even a comedy like American Pie can have an important story to tell, and I believe this film gived it a very good try, perfect I'd say. Today's society needs some ""Grrrr"" and ""Swinging, baby"" as a great british spy would say! So my final comment is that American Pie is a great film, very funny, the actors do a good job portraying young frustrated, scared and real teenagers longing for ""love"". It makes a good point which can be helpful in life, for both parents and children. Is it dangerous to tell kids that sex is allright? No! Love and sexuality is a great thing! And it's important.",American Pie
568,surfgal,Its the best film ever,10,22 September 1999,"American Pie has got to be the funniest movie ever made. I thought Happy Gilmore was but this movie just kicks arse!!!! It has the spunkiest bunch of blokes ever- Oz, Jim and Kevin. I walked out of the cinema totally in love with the guys and still in tears from some of those scenes like the first sock scene, the pie scene and the music scene where Oz says ""it came from the heart"". The story line is very clever and everyone involved with the film should be proud. Ever since i saw it 3 days ago all the punch lines have been going through my head and all my friends keep talking about it and we laugh ourself silly. I loved it so much that i am going to see it again and again and as soon as it comes out on video i am buying it.

For any man who's not ashamed of his teenage years this has got to be one of the funniest movies ever.  Because it fits my generation a little better, I think its an even better high school comedy than ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High""!",American Pie
572,Rob Gregory,Safe at home with the dvd,9,3 January 2000,"When I first caught the trailers for American Pie I thought that it was going to be too crude.  There was no doubt that this film would make Something About Mary seem like a Disney flick.  But now, in the comfort of my own home, having just witnessed the DVD version of American Pie, I have to say that it is an excellent movie.  Having been raised on films by the Zucker brothers and Mel Brooks, that's a difficult statement to make.  But those movies were the early stages of making sex a comedic subject, and American Pie is the next step in the evolutionary chain.  I'm sure I was as shocked at some scenes as the previous generation were at segments of Airplane! or Blazing Saddles.It's difficult to believe that this is the Weitz brothers first film.  The story flowed extremely well, particularly over the raciest subject matter. And the cast is superb.  Had the screenplay been handled with less finesse, or the lines read with less youthful innocence, I'm certain this would have been a movie to avoid.  But instead I found it a great escape.Eugene Levy was the only cast member I recognized from previous roles, and he did a very credible job as the loving father awkwardly attempting to help his boy pass into manhood.I would strongly recommend American Pie to any of my friends interested in comedy films.>",American Pie
573,DanPlant-2,This movie goes much deeper than it appears.,10,28 January 2000,"Before watching this movie, I thought it would be a lot like ""There's Something About Mary;"" overly crude, real in your face, with a lot of stupid acting characters in it.  Somewhat enjoyable, but not as funny as others made it out to be.  However, I was greatly surprised to find this an excellent teen movie.  On the surface, there are the cruder aspects of teenage years: sex and bathrooms.  But when you actually watch this movie, instead of dismissing at as a gross-out film, you will notice the excellent direction of the Weitz brothers, the small details that they put into each character that make them more than the caricatures so common in movies today.  Every actor contributes to that effort by really getting into the mindset of a graduating HS senior.  The maturing of each character is evident and encouraging.  See this movie with an open mind, and you will be thoroughly entertained.",American Pie

That is: A bunch of teenage boys want to get laid and end up getting caught in a few embarassing situations as a result.No, there isn't a lot to this movie--indeed, it is an updated ""Porky's""-type movie, with the exception that the characters in Porky's were better developed and this movie takes place at a high school only and with no real central conflicting ""Porky""-type villain.To the movie's credit, there are several great laughs in it--the jokes are in general quite original. It's just that they do not add together into anything of substance.",American Pie

Anyone who pans this movie is probably doing so because they either forgot what it was like to be a teenager or grew up in a convent.Of course certain scenes are exaggerated, but that is what movie making is all about. Real-life events are stretched out to the extremes of believability.I don't know about you, but I've made similar pacts with friends, spied on good looking women, and still turned out fine. Loosen up people, this is a very funny movie.",American Pie
577,Wink3,Masterfully written high school comedy,10,13 June 2000,"When I first saw this movie in theaters, I thought it was the greatest movie ever made. As some of you can tell by this, I am a teenager. I watched it a few times when it came out on video, and for the most part, it was equally as good. A lot of older people might not like this movie, but it is an excellent portrayal of high school students today and a laugh-a-second movie. Jason Biggs is great as Jim, but Eugene Levy and Seann William Scott have to be the funniest characters as Jim's father and Stiffler respectively. Nadia and Vicky are hot, and it's hard to believe that Thomas Ian Nicholas could go from pitching for the Cubs as Henry Rowengardener in 'Rookie of the Year' to orchestrating Sex Bible secrets as Kevin in 'American Pie' in what seemed like such a short time. If you liked 'Can't Hardly Wait', 'She's All That', or 'Porky's', you will like this ten times better. Probably my favorite movie; 9.5/10.",American Pie

581,Anvari,Perfect choose of characters! Everybody in the right place!,9,15 September 2000,"I just figured it out that everybody was chosen very carefully after watching the movie for the 2nd time. Every character was appearing right in time and in the correct place. In addition, the movie is telling the truth of life in a fantastic voice. It's really a masterpiece in my idea. It takes you back to the world we all lived in for some years. ""Guys! The big dance AND graduation are coming up and we still HAVE TO get laid."" Jim (Jason Biggs) is a bright but socially inept guy whose despair at being a virgin only increases his foolishness. He gets little help from his dad (Eugene Levy); his ideas of sex lectures are to thumb through a copy of Hustler magazine with his son. When Jim's using his webcam, the movies reaches its climax. He's playing professionally like a real virgin. The part he's trying to make his hair the way girls like is realistic. However, along the way, a few lessons are learned, and at least a few of the boys' questions are answered, balancing most of the film's vulgarity. The best characters used in real romantic scenes, were Mena Suvari and Chris Klein. Their appearance was one of my personal favorites which was played professionally in this movie. It's the most amuzing sex comedy I have ever reviewed, with the perfect use of a vast variety of different characters.-Ahmad Anvari, Movie Reviewer - Tehran, Iran",American Pie
582,chanse_c-1,What a laugh.,10,14 May 2006,"American Pie is one of those films that you can watch from start to finish, without feeling bored or wanting to fast forward it. From the start of the film where you see the main character bumbling dork Jim, try hopelessly to get the girl he likes to notice him, to the finish in which Finch gets the girl nobody in there right mind would expect, the whole film is one gigantic chuckle-fest.Laugh it up as you follow the four guys, Jim, Kevin, Finch and Oz, and feel pity and amusement as they make a pack to loose there virginity before prom.One of the highlights of this film is the hysterical Stifler. Most of his sentences include swearing, and he thinks hes god gift. But not everything turns out the way he plans. And thats all I'm saying about him ;) Anyway if you like rude jokes, stupid situations and teenage comedies as a whole, then check this film out! The king of all teen comedies, with a marvellous second and third film as well! ****/*****",American Pie

Men are supposed to be the head of the household, not cowardly weaklings who are terrified of the woman. That's just some sick feminist movement. A woman is the child bearer, she's not supposed to have the say over the man. That's how messed up society is today.

In the same way that South Park uses crude humor to make fun of current events, this movie makes fun of many current events. There are many examples of satire in this movie and that is why its my favorite movie ever.Unfortunately this film is often misunderstood by un smart people and that is sad.

OK in some bits it is crude but this is aimed at a teen audience so teens do not really care if something is crude because it is normal in their lives. The characters and actors are alike in ways and the directors really worked hard with them to get the audience a real experience of teen life.Basically you have gotta group of teens who all want to get laid on prom night.

601,rovingt,good film -- more than meets the eye,9,15 February 2003,"Crude, rude, crass, sophomoric and predictable at times, American Pie is carefully crafted to appeal to a range of audiences.  But whatever you can say about it, for me the whole thing works!I do not think you can view this movie as simply the exposition of late 20th century mores viewed through the lens of the average hormonally driven American male.  Rather it is at once and the same time an exposition about expectation.  The expectation of the time after high school, of relationships, of new found physicality, of intimate expression, of going forward into the future.Herz and Weitz craftily use the testosterone enriched environment of high school as the vehicle on which to carry this theme.  While many characters in literature and cinema have embarked on their own search for truth, American Pie is more about the embarkation upon the journey than the journey itself.The theme is repeated over and over again, and subtly (as distinct from the crassness of much of the movie) reinforced through out the film.  The journey is presented in the choices of colleges, the coach's speech at the lacrosse game, the `bus' to the prom night party and the duet sung by Heather and Chris.  It is expressed most poignantly by the characters of Vicky and Kevin when they recognize that while they have each consummated there love their futures will lead them to something different than they had envisioned just hours before.The late teen years are perhaps the only moment in time when the future potential of each of us is present in such abundance and so readily convertible into present achievement.If you are young (a late teen) and you watch this movie consider how this movie presents a modern parable to you about all the future potential you have before you and how this moment is a but a temporary gift, to be used and enjoyed before it becomes the prevailing present.If you are older, allow the magic of celluloid and the fine craft of the writer, director and actors to transport you back to a time when the future beckoned and each experience was as new as that spring day on which this movie begins.",American Pie
602,Foxy_Vixen,A Seann William Scott Classic,10,24 February 2003,"Properly the funniest teen movie of 1999!Seann William Scott, Jason Biggs and Eddie Kaye Thomas are amazing in this teen movie about one boy and his pie.If you've ever been in teen love then this is the film for you.Funny yet somehow serious one of the best teen movies since The Breakfast Club.For any teen movie lover this is the film for you!",American Pie
603,ceslovas5555,Real talk about this movie,9,30 January 2012,"If you hadn't seen this movie yet you should see it right now. Of course im not insisting you guys to watch it if you don't like teen movies but its classic of this kind of comedy.I mean it! This might look little bit stupid because its like a ""stupid comedy"" Thats how i like to call movies like this.Actually they aren't stupid at all it's very hard to create jokes like this and make a movie like this.But I could hardly recommend this movie if you are looking for different kind of comedy something opposite from teens movie like good rated movie with good well known actor and a good storyline or a family comedy because it would be pretty weird watching movies with your children or with your parent (depends who you are).This movie is way different is about teenagers life, and their jokes. I could say this was one of the best of this kind of comedy i have ever seen! if someone asks for a comedy about teens first movie i say is ""American pie"". This movie would be best if you're looking for something really easy and very hilarious to watch as I said already. Thanks for reading",American Pie
604,smeeze,No good,2,21 January 2014,"Let me start out saying that (at the time of writing) I am an 18 year old American Male which from what I gather would normally be in the target audience. Watching this movie was not by my choice but rather my parents put it on when it was on TV.There are just so many things wrong with this movie I don't even know where to start. Basically the premise is that these four ""boys"" make a pact to have sex before graduating high school which is already extremely absurd. And the comment about penises unused is just plain nonsense unless they never urinate?Most of the scenarios are incredibly unlikely and just plain ridiculous. For example the scene where Jim convinced Nadia to change her clothes at his house and she just starts MASTURBATING in his bed. Really?? WHO goes into someones bedroom believing they are just down stairs and does that? Nobody. And what the hell was with the ""Are you ready for a partner?"" portion between Jim and his Dad?? The characters also had no depth or much defining characteristics and in general were just plain unlikeable. It was to the point that I often forgot who was who which is not a good sign for a movie.Another thing is I did not agree with the message that this movie was displaying. Basically just saying everything is always about sex and that it is all that matters in a relationship. Reinforcing the pressure for people to engage in that type of activity more or less as young as possible. I found the movie disgusting on many accounts because it was just too crude and found it hard to watch within the first 20 minutes. The part early on where Jessica says to Vicky ""It's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex."" is a perfect example of the wrong attitude.I had very few actual laughs (perhaps three in total) other than laughs of embarrassment rather than actually being funny. It would have been a pure bore if it were not so disturbing.And the ending was by far the worst. Although in some ways ""Oz"" was admirable for becoming more sensitive and caring but still unlikeable nonetheless. The sex scenes were nothing other than highly unpleasant to watch. And to top it off the part where Kevin(?) and Vicky decided they could not make it ended up making me sad. So at the end of the movie I ended up sad and disgusted from the previous scenes.Personally I don't want to end up feeling like crap at the end of movies.So to summarize: If you are looking for something funny or good or even decent. STAY CLEAR of this movie. It is not good.If you really want to see a ""teen"" oriented movie, at least watch something good like Back to the future.If you are looking for something funny, there are plenty of other choices that will give real laughs.",American Pie
605,philipharveynz,"Not many teen movies can be watched more than once, this can",9,7 October 2005,"I watched and loved this when it came out, I remember it being side splitting funny. Now re-watching watching it 6 years later while in my 30s I was pleasantly surprised that it hadn't lost it's charm, and the jokes were still funny. I didn't split my sides like I did the first time but that's often the case when you have high expectations. Yes much of the jokes are gross out, but not to the extent of the films that followed that really have taken it too far. The dialogue is well written and in many cases rings true from my experiences at high school. Tthere are very few jokes that miss the mark, and the sound track is great as well. Highly recommended.",American Pie
606,silje4ever,"stupid tasteless boys' movie, with an extremely one-sided view on girls and women",2,5 February 2005,"Stupid boys' movie, with an extremely one-sided and discriminating way of seeing girls, as either ""hot babes"" or ""geeks"". It's about teenage-boys trying to loose their virginity. You can imagine how plot goes on, while the boys try to get laid. Lots of goofy jokes and primitive comedy below the belt. No sophistication once so ever. The title is referring to how doing it with a pie apparently is supposed to feel like being with a girl. Which of course end up in a scene where the leading role ""borrows"" one of his moms warm pies and of course gets caught. In general I will not recommend the movie. I find it extremely discriminating and just plain stupid and a waste of time. Very tasteless.",American Pie
607,Sinclair_Mikael,Steve Stifler is the franchise!,10,21 January 2005,"American Pie is a classic coming of age story about four boys who can't stand the idea of graduating high school as virgins. This movie contains a lot of crude sexual humour that is obviously not suitable for young children but it may come across the wrong way to certain non-open-minded adults. As most movies have sex scenes these days, this movie actually contains two oral sex scenes (although obviously no sensitive body parts are shown: no worries for the littluns, but why would they be watching anyway)?The film is low-budget, but the story flows well and the characters are down to earth (and so damn funny!) Seann William Scott is absolutely head-over-heals hilarious as the obnoxious Steve Stifler. If you own the DVD or VHS, you may want to rewind and view some of these priceless Stifler scenes over and over again:1.) Stifler asks if the boys are coming to his party.2.) Stifler greets Vicky, Jessica and Sherman at the party.3.) Stifler comments on Oz' failed attempt to hook up with a college girl (party).4.) Stifler has some pale ale (party).5.) Nadiavision (the monkey adds to this one).6.) Oz practising his duet in the showers after lacrosse and Stifler's response.7.) Stifler's revenge on Finch (Finch in the can).There are more, but those are all I can remember.Eugene Levy plays Jim's ""open about sex"" father. I felt that his embarrassing discussions with Jim were not funny to say the least (though they were intended to be), but some people liked them.Tara Reid is her usual ""hot"" self in this movie, and Natasha Lyonne looks good as well.The acting is not as horrible as people say. Chris Klein's (Oz) lines seemed a little forced in some places, but he made up for them with some of his other scenes.This movie can be watched over and over again and enjoyed as much as the very first time. If you enjoy sexual humour (which most of us do: some won't admit it though), this is the movie for you.This movie was followed up by two sequels that I'm sorry to say were not very good, but they are worth watching just to see what Stifler will do or say next.The unrated DVD of American Pie has a crapload of bonus features, so as Ferris Bueller would say:""If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up!""",American Pie
608,keithkern1977,Amazing Film,10,20 March 2005,"Aside from being an extremely funny movie, the friendship dynamic shown by the four main characters made this movie. Although #2 may have been funnier, the story line was much better. Sean William Scott as ""Stifler"" was by far the most humorous in the film, and should have had more face time. His facial expressions, tone and lines were all hilarious. He played the dumb jock/player perfectly. This was one of the best characters I have ever seen in any film. All four main characters were very good in their roles. Eddie Kaye Thomas as ""Finch"" was another great character. The dynamic between him and Stifler throughout the film were extremely entertaining. ""Oz"" was the most suave of the four, but lacked in the comedy department. Eugene Levy played the awkward dad very well. Although ""Kevin"" was somewhat annoying at times, his final scene with Tara Reid added just about the only drama element, and anyone who has had their heart broken can empathize with him. This film will become the next ""Animal House"" and be a required college flick.",American Pie

610,SoulOfSnowman,American Pie more then movie.,7,3 November 2013,"Many times I have heard positive feedback from my friends about this movie , but somehow it did not have time to see and even begrudgingly . But , having spent a half hour on the first part of the ""American Pie"" , I do not regret !Every moment of the film resembles the modern teenage society that young people care about these days. Each of the main characters I easily recognized himself and his friends. For this movie is a huge plus .The humor of the film at the highest level, the mass is very funny and amusing moments.Also worth noting is the incredible acting. Actors chosen perfectly. Hard to imagine that the role of Jim decides someone better Jason Biggs - relaxed and calm in dealing with friends, it is closed in conversations with girls. An excellent job with their roles , Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas and Eddie Kaye Thomas . But a separate credit goes to Seann William Scott , who gave the film a whole new mood.Many may think that the AP has attracted only by his vulgar jokes , but this is not the case. The plot of the film is excellent , it is not just the story of how the guys wanted to have sex, but about the fact that the world beyond that there is a real genuine love .I think my estimate is obvious : 7\10",American Pie

But the opposite happened . This movie I really liked . Such pictures as this shot very much, but it is the "" American Pie "" is considered the founder of the genre ""youth porn comedy ."" It already gives this film more flavor.""American Pie"" - it's really very nice , cheerful and funny comedy . Level vulgarity here , of course, rolls over, but the ""American Pie "" is forgivable , because toilet humor here is practically his chip if you want.""American Pie"" was the directorial debut for Chris and Paul Weitz . They are definitely a very successful debut in the movie, albeit with a rather peculiar film. Chris and Paul rented a very good youth comedy that really could become a classic.The main roles are played by Jason Biggs , Seann William Scott, Chris Klein , Thomas Ian Nicholas , Eddie Kaye Thomas, Mena Suvari , Tara Reid , Shannon Elizabeth , Alyson Hannigan . All fun played their characters, but the most memorable Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott.Subtotal: funny teen comedy and fun , and definitely a classic.",American Pie
612,mam_167,did i miss something??,10,29 March 2005,"A 6.8 rating for this movie is ridiculously low...I don't think I've seen this much hostility towards a movie in quite a while. I don't remember the IMDb being the hotbed for PC, prudish people to spout their moral qualms. What is clear, however, is this: this post will do nothing to change people's minds about the movie, so rather than try to convince people that this movie was freaking awesome, I will attempt to sum up where the appeal is.The claims of some of its detractors are true. The movie relies heavily on crude humor (very much in the mold of Something about Mary, which also started off with a 1-star rating by some prude), but very accurately reflects the type of conversations that teens have. Example: Jim, walking into school, says to Kevin ""I saw the Little Mermaid last night. That Ariel, she's so hot."" C'mon, what 17 year old kid hasn't thought that? What sets the movie apart from others in recent memory, though, is the heart with which it is done. The accuracy in the conversations and the way the people deal with the issues that always arise during that time in a person's life is fantastic and, as a result, gives the movie-viewer a powerful sense of nostalgia for those days when the struggles of life seemed impossible, but were so fun at the same time.Who will like this movie? People who are young at heart, people who are wasted, and people who want to be transported back to a great period in their lives. Prudish people- pretension need not apply.As one prude worries, ""in 10 years, I fear this may be a cult classic."" Too late. Awesome movie.",American Pie
613,ateamplayer32,A funny accurate look at High School life for guys.,8,10 April 2005,"American Pie is one of the many great films of the 90's. It goes into the minds of high school teens and shows whats really goes on. With its awkward funny moments and lovable characters this is a must see. You can relate all the characters to you and your buddies back in High School. Although it has a very loose plot it makes up for it with its hilarious scenes of what guys think sex should be and how much they want it. I kept wanting more and it kept delivering more great humor. It also includes a good romance scene or two. I recommend this for anyone who likes their humor with some nudity and perverted actions. On the other hand it has some cheezy jokes and some bad displays of acting. Its almost hard to notice the mistakes in this film because you are trying to maintain control of yourself as your cracking up. Jason Biggs delivers a great performance as Jim Levetstein, the nervous guy who isn't so lucky with girls. I could relate to so many of the characters on so many levels, and i think you will too. 3 stars",American Pie
614,brad10-2,simply the greatest film i have ever seen,6,26 April 2006,"THIS FILM changed my life!!!!! I come home everyday and throw on American pie and it never fails to make me feel great. In terms of film-making there is nothing to fault, fantastic acting, a hilarious script and inspired direction all add up to the greatest film ever brought down to earth from heaven. It truly is god's gift to serious movie-goers, such as myself, finally a film that does not talk down to individuals. I seriously think this film should be shown on a large screen in any country with social or political unrest and the light hearted comedy would really sort everyone out. I'm watching American pie on my telly as I write this thanking god that I have the absolute pleasure to be alive at the same time as such a masterpiece of film-making. It truly deserved its thirteen Oscar nominations as well as its prestigious ""film of the millennium"" awarded by the UN. Go watch it now and feel yourself grow as a person!!!!!",American Pie
615,philing,Not A Bad Movie At All,7,19 November 2015,"The first American Pie is a teenage comedy on the top movie list in 1999, but it's not the best of the seven American Pie series. For me, I preferred the second one, as everyone was more relaxed and knew each other, making the movie better. Don't get me wrong, this one certainly had it's funny moments, but in my estimation it wasn't as good as the second one. American Pie is a classic teen comedy about sex and it inspired a new era in comedy that's still relevant today. It has the crazy and good looking youth we see in today's comedy, but unfortunately also has some really lame jokes and bad acting, that thankful went out with the nineties.If you hadn't seen this movie yet you should see it right now. I'm not convincing you guys to watch it if you don't like teen movies but its classic of this kind of comedy. This might look little bit weird because its like a ""Weird comedy"".Actually, they aren't weird at all it's very hard to create comedy like this and make a movie like this.
